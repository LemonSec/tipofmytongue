1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:08,639
I'm Barry Lebowitz if you were at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:11,340
plenary last night you heard he<font color="#CCCCCC"> Joe tell</font>

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,809
you how pleased we were to to be hosting

4
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">this meeting and sponsoring the</font>

5
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:16,710
hackathon throughout the year we're also

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:20,460
pleased to present a technical topic for

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,740
the lunch speaker series today so we

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,900
have an Andy malice who many of you know

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,000
most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you perhaps know I served with</font>

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">him on the IAB back in two thousand</font>

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,040
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that Andy's a</font>

12
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,940
distinguished engineer at huawei and

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:35,000
specializes in product and network

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,260
architecture and future evolution

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,360
standards leadership customer

16
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:43,890
consultation and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of protocols</font>

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,649
mostly in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing area he used to be</font>

18
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,539
at verizon<font color="#CCCCCC"> tellabs cascade</font>

19
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,280
communications and BBM he's been around

20
00:00:50,539 --> 00:00:56,280
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to skip a lot of the rest</font>

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,050
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bio here and just say that and</font>

22
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,550
he's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about building into n</font>

23
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,709
service experience assured network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

24
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,740
hello everybody I'm Andy can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

25
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:11,399
hear me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay in the back</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay cool very</font>

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,380
good so anyway this right here is an

27
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,810
outline of the talk basically what I

28
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,990
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> you about is an outline of</font>

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:20,670
the problem space requirements and

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,158
challenges that we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> from new</font>

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,189
applications on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet current</font>

32
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,890
work to address these requirements both

33
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:32,309
here at the IETF and elsewhere and other

34
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,790
SEOs as well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> other work may be</font>

35
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:38,700
needed proposals for the future<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I do</font>

36
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:42,180
have a spoiler alert here I don't plan

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:45,960
to come with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> P package solutions to</font>

38
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,960
basically cram down your throats what

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,070
I'm here for is really<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide you</font>

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,949
all with some food for thought and

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:58,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully further discussion down the</font>

42
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:02,040
line and perhaps the formation of some

43
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,360
new work here in the IETF and elsewhere

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,950
so with that let's get going you know

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:13,620
the internet of course has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been a huge</font>

46
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:16,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">success and it's ipv4 v6</font>

47
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,110
are the narrow waist of the internet and

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,980
they support countless applications as

49
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:25,049
we know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know there's some people</font>

50
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">who try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make the argument that HTTP</font>

51
00:02:25,049 --> 00:02:28,440
is the new narrow waist but there's

52
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:30,390
still a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of applications in fact</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

53
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,769
majority of applications that<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't run</font>

54
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:37,409
over HTTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> or in a browser they really do</font>

55
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:41,900
run straight over IP and then the UDP

56
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:45,179
air a sheep<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP and so on however</font>

57
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:47,310
today's<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet especially</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the the putt</font>

58
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,190
what we think of as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public</font>

59
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:52,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">best-effort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet does have a number</font>

60
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">of challenges that still need to be</font>

61
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:58,980
addressed in fact most notably<font color="#CCCCCC"> alack</font>

62
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:02,340
widely available and to end service

63
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:05,399
guarantees for things like latency

64
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:08,640
jitter and packet loss and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this really</font>

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,609
limits the some applications that people

66
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,470
would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to bring onto the</font>

67
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:16,140
internet and i'll be<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about the</font>

68
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:19,859
requirements for those going forward and

69
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:22,970
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus of this talk is really to talk</font>

70
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:26,040
about what we can do with a wide area

71
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">with wide area</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multidomain open internet</font>

72
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,108
you know I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want to talk</font>

73
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,168
about private campus and data<font color="#E5E5E5"> central</font>

74
00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:36,060
networks or very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well managed single</font>

75
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,970
domain traffic engineered networks

76
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,760
because those all basically run pretty

77
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,459
well but therefore limited applications

78
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,608
and you know it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

79
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:53,129
what we really deal with here which is

80
00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:56,579
the public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so here are a few of</font>

81
00:03:53,129 --> 00:03:59,040
the architectural just before<font color="#E5E5E5"> I move off</font>

82
00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:03,150
the slide there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was one example that I</font>

83
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,400
just wanted to to talk to which is you

84
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,799
know just talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> from personal</font>

85
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience I've got pretty good internet</font>

86
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,530
service at home you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got fios</font>

87
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:18,029
from verizon which is a jeep on based

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,659
service I've got 75 megabits symmetric

89
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:23,969
coming into my house but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even still you</font>

90
00:04:21,659 --> 00:04:26,620
know if I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> streaming video off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the net</font>

91
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:31,810
there can be times when

92
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,639
when the video playback exceeds the

93
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:35,770
local buffering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I received off the</font>

94
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,600
net and I start seeing the twirling you

95
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,849
know and I'm sure this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something that</font>

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,060
that you're all very familiar with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and</font>

97
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,790
so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> great</font>

98
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:49,120
service<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've got coming into my house</font>

99
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,460
still somewhere along the line<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

100
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,260
were barriers to it being as good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it</font>

101
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:57,669
could be so so just with that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

102
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,039
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the architectural</font>

103
00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:02,260
issues that really prevent end to end

104
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,169
internet service guarantees well you

105
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:07,270
know some of them are coordination

106
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:09,010
across multiple layers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

107
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,080
be talking more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this this is kind</font>

108
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:13,270
of like a preview of a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things</font>

109
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be talking about today you</font>

110
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:17,289
know there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of point solutions</font>

111
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,780
that people are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and at the</font>

112
00:05:17,289 --> 00:05:21,610
various<font color="#CCCCCC"> layer is the link layer and the</font>

113
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,679
network layer and the upper layers and

114
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,330
then the control<font color="#E5E5E5"> planes but very often</font>

115
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,600
there isn't a whole lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of coordination</font>

116
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,510
going on between all the different point

117
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,460
solutions and so what you might see is

118
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,370
you know things aren't quite as optimal

119
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:38,109
as they could be in terms of what people

120
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:40,990
are working on and what they could be

121
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:44,650
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on in the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially with</font>

122
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,400
regards to various stos and by stos<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

123
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:49,510
mean you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the IETF and a lot of our</font>

124
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,340
sister standards development

125
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:57,340
organizations such as the broadband

126
00:05:51,340 --> 00:06:02,229
forum I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and no 3G 3G that's at</font>

127
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:07,210
and you know 3gpp and and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

128
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:09,699
forth and so each each is basically

129
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,710
looking at their own slices of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

130
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:14,320
puzzle and it's saying okay what can we

131
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:17,010
do to improve things for example from

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,900
the broad bands form and access networks

133
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,330
for 3gpp what can we do to improve

134
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,520
things and mobile networks and I Triple

135
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,760
E what can we do to improve things that

136
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,500
the you know at the Easter net layer but

137
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,590
in some cases there isn't a whole lot of

138
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,719
coordination going on and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

139
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:38,190
to have and interoperable solutions as a

140
00:06:34,719 --> 00:06:40,300
result and you know there certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

141
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:42,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">mechanism for cross st</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o</font>

142
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,729
cooperation which is liaisons however

143
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:47,440
you know liaisons don't work often don't

144
00:06:45,729 --> 00:06:49,960
work very effectively when you have a

145
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">very complicated problem set you know</font>

146
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,310
you need some more concentrated thinking

147
00:06:53,259 --> 00:06:58,599
and no and cooperation than just its

148
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,759
passing liaisons back and forth to each

149
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:02,469
other and then there are things going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

150
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:04,090
in the service of writers as well and i

151
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,750
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a stress of art of background</font>

152
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:10,270
that was with with verizon for a number

153
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,710
years before joining<font color="#CCCCCC"> Huawei for example</font>

154
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,650
so I've certainly got a lot of

155
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:17,049
experience here there's very

156
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,229
inconsistent implementation of a lot of

157
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work we've already done you know dis</font>

158
00:07:20,229 --> 00:07:26,680
serve is is what 15<font color="#CCCCCC"> years old now if not</font>

159
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:29,349
longer than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years old and then</font>

160
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,229
we have dis serve te which which goes

161
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:34,360
back to like two thousand five or so but

162
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:36,128
you don't see a whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a</font>

163
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,759
lot of implementation of it in private

164
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:41,469
networks and in well-managed bit

165
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,569
Enterprise Service networks but you

166
00:07:41,469 --> 00:07:48,759
really don't see a lot of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end</font>

167
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:49,930
in the public internet and in the public

168
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,120
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you also see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there is an</font>

169
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:54,969
inability for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source fighters to</font>

170
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,279
aggregate like flows together so light

171
00:07:54,969 --> 00:08:00,159
flows<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have similar treatment to the</font>

172
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,810
backbone now in in you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

173
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:04,900
public<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really impossible</font>

174
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:06,550
to do flow by flow treatment you know

175
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,068
each individual flow the network because

176
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:10,330
you just can't scale and if you know

177
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,419
there's one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to do in the</font>

178
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:16,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet's scale but aggregation works</font>

179
00:08:13,419 --> 00:08:18,310
very well when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to scaling so if</font>

180
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,990
you can effectively aggregate for

181
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:22,479
example all low latency traffic together

182
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,669
and put that through a particular path

183
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,199
through the network then that may do

184
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:29,229
better than what we're doing now which

185
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,300
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically nothing at all and you know</font>

186
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:33,338
<font color="#CCCCCC">even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things do get implemented</font>

187
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:36,399
by one particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> service provider in</font>

188
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:38,800
there a s very often you don't see it in

189
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
the next is along the path because very

190
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:44,920
few of us are in the same AAS as all the

191
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,250
servers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we go to throughout the</font>

192
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:50,740
internet right certainly when we're here

193
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Korea we're in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very different a s</font>

194
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,110
locally then you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the servers</font>

195
00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:56,510
are

196
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,810
that we normally talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> back home and</font>

197
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:02,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">so on and there's a whole lot of lack of</font>

198
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,000
coordination across a s boundaries you

199
00:09:02,269 --> 00:09:07,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">know very often the cross is boundaries</font>

200
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,700
what you have is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually have a</font>

201
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:13,700
layer to link you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you have like 100</font>

202
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,950
gig in link between service providers

203
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,959
which is you know fine in terms of

204
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:20,990
bandwidth but other than that you know

205
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:25,819
you lose a whole lot in at the IP layer

206
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:27,740
for the treatment of the packets so do a

207
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:29,630
whole lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new things coming down the</font>

208
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,100
line to that we want to pay attention to

209
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,250
in terms of the requirements on the

210
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:37,820
internet and one of the big ones<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 5g</font>

211
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:43,610
and network slicing and we had a two

212
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:46,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">hour meeting here in at the IETF about</font>

213
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,860
this on Tuesday night and so I can't

214
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:51,319
encapsulate in you know in two minutes

215
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,420
what we covered in two hours and tuesday

216
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,490
night but I just have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> slides to</font>

217
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,870
give you a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> big overview for for</font>

218
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,230
those you who weren't here Tuesday night

219
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:02,660
but i really encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take a</font>

220
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,660
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the slides that were presented</font>

221
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,949
in that side meeting with regards to 5g

222
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,459
slicing if really interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

223
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:13,310
topic so anyway so some of the

224
00:10:10,459 --> 00:10:15,979
challenges is<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:18,439
chart that's from the ng MN 5g white

226
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:20,600
paper<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was that's a source for this</font>

227
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,899
chart it's talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a whole lot of</font>

228
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,000
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> applications that you that</font>

229
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:27,500
five the folks who are designing phij

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,350
want to be able to run over mobile

231
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:34,810
networks the 5g mobile networks and it

232
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:37,970
talks about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirements in terms of</font>

233
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:40,459
user experience data rates which are

234
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,130
easy enough to meet perhaps but what's

235
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:46,130
very hard is what you see in red which

236
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:47,060
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end latency that they need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

237
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:49,160
in order for these particular

238
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:52,518
applications to work you know in some

239
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:54,980
cases you have Layton sees under one

240
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:58,310
millisecond in order for for a

241
00:10:54,980 --> 00:11:01,190
particular application to work over 5 g

242
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:04,550
and this is what the mobile folks are

243
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:06,199
aiming towards so then the other thing

244
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,849
they're working towards is called

245
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:09,050
network slicing and it

246
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll be a bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more on the next slide</font>

247
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:13,069
what the whole point of network slicing

248
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,529
is that you can have different

249
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:17,839
applications and different users that

250
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:20,389
actually get their own what you can

251
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,480
think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a private part of the 5g</font>

252
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:27,350
network and to end<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything from the</font>

253
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,480
radio all the way into the data center

254
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:32,300
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

255
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,769
your own private part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 5g network</font>

256
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,829
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to be completely</font>

257
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:39,079
unaffected by anything else that anyone

258
00:11:36,829 --> 00:11:41,029
else does and the 5g network and have

259
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:42,739
completely private data on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and so</font>

260
00:11:41,029 --> 00:11:43,880
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's a very hard problem as</font>

261
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">well because you have to have complete</font>

262
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,350
isolation of one users traffic from

263
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:51,139
another user's traffic while still

264
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:53,449
sharing common resources in the network

265
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:56,360
so it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult problem and</font>

266
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:57,620
that's why<font color="#CCCCCC"> we spent two hours on Tuesday</font>

267
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,699
night talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that was really</font>

268
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:05,000
just scratching the surface the folks

269
00:12:01,699 --> 00:12:06,649
over in in the mobile SEOs request

270
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,310
spending a whole lot more time talking

271
00:12:06,649 --> 00:12:12,290
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so as I said end-to-end</font>

272
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,599
latency in particular is a very strong

273
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:17,810
requirement for what's coming up in 5g

274
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,360
so this right here so the work and 5g

275
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:22,250
slicing is going to really require a

276
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,889
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of innovation in the world of</font>

277
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:28,459
quality service just because you have to

278
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:29,990
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guaranteed services for the</font>

279
00:12:28,459 --> 00:12:33,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">application is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be that are</font>

280
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:35,630
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be running over 5 g and those</font>

281
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:40,970
require complete isolation from each

282
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,189
other and so what we what I think the

283
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,350
mobile folks are finding is that current

284
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,630
QoS mechanisms that we have in routers

285
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:50,089
today for example and the switches don't

286
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:51,529
always meet the requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

287
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:54,079
they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with so it's going to</font>

288
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,300
require a lot of innovation throughout

289
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,979
the networking industry I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think no not</font>

290
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:01,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">just from the mobile space in the radio</font>

291
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:03,290
space but in the router space you know

292
00:13:01,069 --> 00:13:05,269
because routers make up the backbone of

293
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,670
mobile networks as we all know you know

294
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:09,500
if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing mobile front hall mobile</font>

295
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,160
backhaul that's all implemented on

296
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:14,300
routers right so so that's going to be

297
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,980
that's going to require a lot of

298
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,680
innovation in the router space in order

299
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,850
to be able to implement the requirements

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:24,180
coming out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5 cheat</font>

301
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:26,550
now some other applications that we're

302
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,060
seeing that people would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font>

303
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:36,329
to use is you know a lot of people are

304
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:39,239
into multiplayer gaming /<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 over the net</font>

305
00:13:36,329 --> 00:13:42,170
and the next extension of that is going

306
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be you know virtual reality based</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">very definite latency requirements to</font>

313
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,230
the internet now in some cases you have

314
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,259
to worry about the actual speed of light

315
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:11,639
delay between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and the server</font>

316
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:14,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">because if you exceed about 20</font>

318
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,300
reality or augmented reality you start

319
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,709
getting a disconnect between a person's

320
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,680
movements and what they're seeing with

321
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:24,719
their eyes which leads to it to some

322
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,310
extreme vertigo which you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to avoid</font>

323
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,579
certainly or else it becomes a very

00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:34,258
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of cases this is going to require</font>

326
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:36,779
not only thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what we can do</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about latency but also some intelligent</font>

328
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:41,610
work towards what's the right place

329
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:44,000
what's the right placement for the

routing the users packets to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the proper</font>

334
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:58,949
this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> imagine a whole set</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of distributed servers and then a part</font>

336
00:14:58,949 --> 00:15:02,790
of the puzzle is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only what we can do</font>

337
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,819
in the network to reduce the latency

00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:07,829
between the users and the service but

339
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">also making sure that we're out the</font>

341
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:17,220
and of course another part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the puzzle</font>

342
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:21,899
is bandwidth as well because you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

343
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:25,019
make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have enough bandwidth</font>

344
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:26,430
that's that's basically guaranteed to

345
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:29,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service so that the user gets</font>

headsets you know basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4k video</font>

348
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,970
then we have other applications that are

349
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,900
coming online that people would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

350
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:45,290
be able to basically bring into the wide

area whether it's remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care you</font>

352
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,000
know that's becoming very important and

353
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:52,729
in some cases you know people are

354
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,470
already attempting this but they're

355
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">really not doing it over the public</font>

00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:59,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet they're doing it over leased</font>

357
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,229

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:05,420
you really at this point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time can't</font>

00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:08,870
trust doing things like remote surgery

00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:12,770
over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> public internet right so but in</font>

361
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:15,650
the future if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could harden the public</font>

362
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:19,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet to the point where you could</font>

guarantee the service to the end<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:26,750
you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the medical provider such</font>

365
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:28,250
that they could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:36,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">know for for just the record keeping and</font>

369
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,310
so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and regular internet access that</font>

370
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,860
would be a big boon to that it would

371
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,410
certainly cut down on their costs and

372
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:44,630
that would be you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a big win factory</font>

373
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:48,170
automation that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's being</font>

374
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,939
done an awful lot very<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now it's</font>

375
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:52,459
being done with specialized networks

376
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,529
again because you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to guarantee the</font>

377
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:56,300
latency to make sure that you know the

378
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:59,810
machines get the feedback that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

379
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,490
at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they need it and if you</font>

380
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:03,609
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to bring this to the</font>

381
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:06,290
wide area so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could for example</font>

382
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:09,319
coordinate what's going on between a

383
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,790
number of factories then the other

384
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:13,250
question may have to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

385
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:15,730
guarantee your latency requirements that

386
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:18,380
are required there and finally of course

387
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,339
smart grid is another thing that people

388
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:23,660
are talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and and in there of</font>

389
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,559
course there were latency requirements

390
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,960
editor that have to do with the phasing

391
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,928
of the electrical power you know to make

392
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,730
sure that being generated correctly and

393
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to make sure if you have</font>

394
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,179
feedback loops such that you want to

395
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that the power goes to the</font>

396
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,590
right place and the smart grid depending

397
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:46,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">on demand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that the feedback gets there</font>

398
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:46,399
at the time that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> needed so you know</font>

399
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,930
there

400
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,970
there are all kinds<font color="#CCCCCC"> of emerging</font>

401
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:53,180
applications and this is just you know

402
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:57,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">touching on a whole set of applications</font>

403
00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:00,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that could really benefit from you know</font>

404
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:03,290
coming on the internet if it could

405
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:06,139
provide the you know the lost management

406
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:11,030
and the latency management that is

407
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">required now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is not the first time</font>

408
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:15,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">of course that people have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font>

00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:17,900
into this<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem in 2013 i sock the</font>

410
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:21,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet society held a workshop on</font>

411
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,600
latency and at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

412
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">three years ago so at that time they</font>

413
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,879
basically held a reducing internet

414
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,270
latency workshop and what they found are

415
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,220
a taxonomy for the major sources of

416
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:37,010
latency in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet basically</font>

417
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's processing delay you know</font>

418
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:42,740
computational translation forwarding

encryption compression error<font color="#CCCCCC"> coding and</font>

421
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,820
so on then you have multiplexing delays

422
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:55,639
needed to support sharing shared channel

423
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,939
acquisition output queuing and so on and

424
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,790
then you have grouping which is you know

425
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,460
reduced frequency of control information

426
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:08,240
processing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> packet is a shin message</font>

427
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,970
aggregation and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> there the workshop</font>

428
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,460
to report is online and you're certainly

free to to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> check it out anytime you</font>

430
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,580
like oh and by the way so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have</font>

431
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,630
to write down<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff like this we're</font>

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be making these slides</font>

433
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,720
available they're not yet online but but

434
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:29,930
we we will be putting them online as

435
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,870
part of the IETF proceedings so just be

436
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:35,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to proceedings page and be</font>

437
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,320
able to to get access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the talks you</font>

438
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,620
can get all the links<font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything</font>

439
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:41,929
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anyway so the workshops we put</font>

440
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,780
concluded basically that there are

441
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,370
fundamental limits this was in 2013 to

442
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,889
the extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> to which latency can be</font>

443
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,260
reduced in the internet there's also

444
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,390
considerable capacity for improvement

445
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,310
and it's a capacity for improvement that

446
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about throughout</font>

447
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,850
the system making internet latency a

448
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,629
multi-faceted challenge and it certainly

449
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:02,389
is

450
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:03,590
but as it says this capacity for

451
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:07,040
improvement and that's what we're going

452
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:09,110
to be looking at then they also said how

453
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:11,480
to standardize the definition of access

454
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,580
network latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> such a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> latency can be</font>

455
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,800
used like big bandwidth as a unit of

456
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">convert Commerce turns out to be a hard</font>

457
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:19,310
problem and that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

458
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,190
that the broadband forum is looking at

459
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:24,470
now and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about that in a</font>

460
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:27,920
moment so what's changed since the

461
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:30,290
report in 2013 well there's a whole lot

462
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of point solutions going on and i'll be</font>

463
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:37,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking a lot about those point</font>

464
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:39,530
solutions low latency is is so crucial

465
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:42,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we're finding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the content as a</font>

466
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:44,840
whole is much more distributed than even

467
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,590
was three years ago you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know now we have</font>

468
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,990
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cdns we have service of artists</font>

469
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,149
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> verizon who are taking all their</font>

470
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:55,670
video content and putting it into their

471
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:57,910
access network very close<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their</font>

472
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:01,790
customer and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth</font>

473
00:20:57,910 --> 00:21:04,520
basically the these service providers

474
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:06,500
who provide the content are moving the

475
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,300
content as close to the customer as

476
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,910
possible and that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> especially true in</font>

477
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:12,710
things like multi-user gaming where you

478
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:14,720
need low latency and in other

479
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:17,570
applications where you basically want to

480
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,420
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to provide some amount of</font>

481
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:22,070
bandwidth for the content or or quality

482
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">of service for the content that's coming</font>

483
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the user so that the user has a good</font>

484
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:31,400
experience as they consume the content

485
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:34,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so there's there are management</font>

486
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">systems which need access and visibility</font>

487
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:39,440
to network latency characteristics<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

488
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:41,240
they can really intelligently place the

489
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:45,050
flows going through the network so that

490
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:49,850
the best server you know is utilized for

491
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:51,350
each individual user and then of course

492
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:54,860
this is much easier with stored content

493
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,230
than it is with with a dynamically

494
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:00,979
rendered content such as ritual or

495
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,600
augmented reality or or gaming<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on</font>

496
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,610
although there's been some amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

497
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,639
work as I said that's starting with that

498
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:09,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well there's advancements in</font>

499
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,830
innovations have been made at various

500
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,309
layers and exploring technologies to

501
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,100
meet

502
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,899
latency technologies and the upper layer

503
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">does quick you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the quick</font>

504
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:21,408
working group here which which i think

505
00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,480
is some really<font color="#E5E5E5"> innovative work from</font>

506
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:26,210
google if you're not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> familiar</font>

507
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,249
with it check it out what they basically

508
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:32,330
said is you know they're looking they're

509
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:33,830
taking a more systematic view of what

510
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:36,980
are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> layton</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> season bringing up a web</font>

511
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,269
page in your browser and what they did

512
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">was they said well gee there were a</font>

513
00:22:38,269 --> 00:22:42,950
couple components of of latency and

514
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:44,960
bringing up a web page one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them is</font>

515
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:48,259
actually getting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP connection open</font>

516
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,320
and none of them is getting security

517
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:53,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">going for HTTPS right so they said well</font>

518
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than first getting the TCP</font>

519
00:22:53,629 --> 00:22:59,990
connection open with the handshake<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

520
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:02,719
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the security handshake let's</font>

521
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:04,369
combine them and that's quick so

522
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,470
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do is they have a</font>

523
00:23:04,369 --> 00:23:08,330
new transport protocol which combines

524
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:12,049
the security and transport aspects and

525
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:13,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">renzo over UDP and you know it's an</font>

526
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:15,649
innovative solution to the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

527
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,539
it's a point solution but it's a nice

528
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:21,289
point solution to one of the problems

529
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:25,070
that people see another one is l4s which

530
00:23:21,289 --> 00:23:28,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking a look at at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and seeing</font>

531

what changes we can make in<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp but but</font>

532
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,949
it's really aimed at a particular point

533
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:35,809
solution and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more aimed at data</font>

534
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:38,690
centers than anything else<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's not</font>

535
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:42,470
really meant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> white area use at the</font>

536
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:45,649
network layer we also have an RFC I p.m.

537
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:49,039
pls hard pipes that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really more</font>

538
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:52,219
intended for business service networks

539
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:55,789
but that's there as well as well latency

540
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,629
optimized<font color="#E5E5E5"> router design which is which</font>

541
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:58,549
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you don't really</font>

542
00:23:56,629 --> 00:24:01,490
standardized but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that</font>

543
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:04,399
certainly a lot of the router vendors

544
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,049
are working on the broadband forms

545
00:24:04,399 --> 00:24:07,939
broadband assured services which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font>

546
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:11,059
have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slides on coming up</font>

547
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:14,869
then at the at the link layer there's

548
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:18,019
work going on here called debt net debt

549
00:24:14,869 --> 00:24:20,779
net really is aimed at deterministic

550
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:24,200
delay rather than particularly low delay

551
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:26,650
it's making it a deterministic that cuts

552
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:29,650
down on the jitter or chain

553
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:31,600
in delay and it's also meant for

554
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:33,220
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> constrained environments</font>

555
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,370
it's not meant for use on the wide area

556
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:38,890
internet there's I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E 802 that one</font>

557
00:24:36,370 --> 00:24:41,260
time sensitive networking which is again

558
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:44,380
just taking a link layer view of what

559
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be done for it for time-sensitive</font>

560
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,410
applications over<font color="#CCCCCC"> ethernet flex ethernet</font>

561
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:53,530
which is joint work by the I Triple E

562
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:57,460
and the oh I<font color="#CCCCCC"> F which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically taking</font>

563
00:24:53,530 --> 00:25:00,700
a TDM like approach to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet way you</font>

564
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,800
still use ethernet framing but in the

565
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:06,160
transport of the ethernet frames you

566
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:09,879
actually allocate TDM like circuits and

567
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,860
so you're able to to provide bandwidth

568
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:13,980
guarantees for the ethernet but again

569
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:18,100
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just an Ethernet layer solution</font>

570
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:22,180
and then 3gpp with regards to mobile has

571
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:24,820
started multiple projects we basically

572
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,910
related to reducing latency in the radio

573
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:31,659
area networks in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the mobile</font>

574
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:34,240
access core and in mobile backhaul and

575
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:37,300
and and again<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's really aimed at</font>

576
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,070
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mobile solution with latest</font>

577
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,290
technologies advancements in packet

578
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,600
networks it's really becoming feasible

579
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:46,300
for us to petition access network

580
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,159
resources and to dedicate resources to

going to be what they do with their

make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some conformance with</font>

work that we're doing here especially

665
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:42,040
with yang because as we know of this

<font color="#CCCCCC">ready a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yang coordination going</font>

667
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,490
on throughout the industry we want to

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,740
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this gets included with</font>

the yang coordination that's going on

670
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:54,940
both here at the IETF and throughout the

objectives and the service definitions

676
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,790
have to feed back into the work that we

677
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,590
do here out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scope is changes to</font>

678
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,050
underlying technology owned by another

679
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,730
sto and that includes us so if there's

680
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:18,250
something that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be done in</font>

681
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:21,670
the IP layer well they'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coming to</font>

682
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,770
us to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us on it so if change is</font>

683
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:26,410
necessary little partner with other<font color="#E5E5E5"> stl</font>

684
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:29,410
such as the IETF and they expect I

00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:34,090
Triple E as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> required to jointly</font>

686
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:37,050
improve the technology so the there's

687
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,209
also flex ethernet flex season that I

688
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:42,250
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit before basically this</font>

689
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a joint project between oh I F and I</font>

690
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:51,850
Triple E to give TDM arm reliability and

691
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,890
and and performance guarantees to

692
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:58,929
Ethernet traffic but again as I said

693
00:30:53,890 --> 00:31:01,960
it's a point solution the IETF is also

694
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:06,029
has work I already talked about the work

695
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,489
that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done in l4s which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking</font>

696
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:10,289
queuing delay and latency but it's

697
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:12,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">really as i said before a point solution</font>

698
00:31:10,289 --> 00:31:14,249
quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> i talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it ready and</font>

699
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:16,889
detonate<font color="#E5E5E5"> i already talked about as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

700
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:18,389
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this but you know it's important</font>

701
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:22,738
just to recognize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we already have</font>

702
00:31:18,389 --> 00:31:24,330
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in the IETF and and so we</font>

703
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:28,019
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that that continues</font>

704
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:29,968
now what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are really seeing as a</font>

705
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:33,389
result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is we're seeing a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

706
00:31:29,969 --> 00:31:36,259
point solutions in multiple stos from

00:31:33,389 --> 00:31:39,059
the link layer with<font color="#E5E5E5"> flex ethernet into</font>

708
00:31:36,259 --> 00:31:45,919
into connections with a flexi and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to end</font>

709
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:48,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">channel MPLS based then slicing and</font>

711
00:31:48,989 --> 00:31:53,609
working up through the network layer to

712
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:55,709
5g network slicing l4s and then in the

713
00:31:53,609 --> 00:32:00,210
application layer with things like quick

714
00:31:55,710 --> 00:32:02,899
and so on and but what we really want to

715
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:05,460
see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something more of a system level</font>

716
00:32:02,899 --> 00:32:07,619
thinking about the problem you know we

717
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,359
have point solutions but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what's</font>

718
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:11,699
more important than just<font color="#E5E5E5"> point solutions</font>

719
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,009
is starting to look at an overall system

720
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,169
approach to latency<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what we can</font>

721
00:32:14,009 --> 00:32:18,539
do to think about this as an<font color="#CCCCCC"> end-to-end</font>

722
00:32:16,169 --> 00:32:20,999
problem not just as a series of point

723
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:26,158
solutions that are being done in various

724
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:29,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">places so we've been doing some thinking</font>

725
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,159
about this inside<font color="#E5E5E5"> huawei and what we're</font>

726
00:32:29,669 --> 00:32:34,769
doing is a bit of experimentation that

727
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,139
we're calling shun for now a service

728
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:39,809

bandwidth assurance and on-demand zero

733
00:32:46,739 --> 00:32:53,509
weight deployment and we're basically

734
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:56,339
doing that by taking you know a more

735
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:57,690
cross-layer approach to the problem and

736
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:59,999
looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the problems in</font>

738
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:04,349
each of the layers so for example for

00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:06,690
service deployment looking at for

740
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:09,359
example Sen based solutions is a

741
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:11,369
possibility to manage end-to-end service

742
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:12,989
and and and signaling across various

743
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:15,299
Network domains we have protocol

744
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:17,669
extensions and then what can we do

745
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,960
within a particular network such as

750
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:34,020
then within a single router what can do

751
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,710
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do ultra-low latency</font>

00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:41,789
optimizing packet processing for example

754
00:33:39,529 --> 00:33:43,679

00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,559
demo that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on on putting</font>

764
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,230
together based on virtual reality and we

00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:19,679
is going to be focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> sfc but we</font>

768
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:23,069
hope to bring this in for the next bits

769
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,619
and bytes<font color="#CCCCCC"> so in Chicago we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hoping</font>

770
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we'll be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to to bring the sin</font>

771
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:31,230
and show this to you it's basically

00:34:26,849 --> 00:34:33,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a VR service and you know</font>

773
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,399
we'll we'll traffic generators so to

create congestion the<font color="#CCCCCC"> networking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font>

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:41,668
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the VR and I are still continue to</font>

776
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:44,310
work so where do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from here this is</font>

777
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:48,000
my last slide basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we'd like</font>

778
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:50,969
to do is for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the development of new</font>

779
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,679
technologies and achieve low latency

780
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,319
end-to-end and loss over wide area

781
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,800
packet networks to enable more latency

782
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain sensitive applications too badly</font>

783
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,109
utilize the technologies we already have

784
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:07,169
and to do more system level<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking for</font>

787
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:15,209
and other stos as well so you know one

788
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:17,730
of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the possible things</font>

00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:39,669
that we've been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to so far</font>

798
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:42,490
we really want to focus on cross-layer

799
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:44,620
interactions and system-level issues

800
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:46,950
perhaps leading to new standardization

801
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:49,480
here or elsewhere based on the results

802
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:51,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to answer basically the questions that</font>

803
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,500
you see here other advantages to be

804
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:55,569
gained from taking a broader<font color="#E5E5E5"> view the</font>

805
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,160
different technologies at the different

806
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,860
layers and what their interactions are

807
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,330
one of the effective interactions the

808
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,870
coordination is between upper and lower

809
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:07,440
layers such we can make effective

810
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:10,870
optimization of you know latency and

811
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,480
lettin law sensitive services and given

812
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,000
the larger issues with that prevent

813
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,220
end-to-end service guarantees what's the

814
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,130
what where can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we most intelligent you</font>

about so this so that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> kept use</font>

it either deliberately or mine just

because I'm greedy you know which now

843
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:44,019
means that if I have that service as a

844

852
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:11,859
how you can prevent exactly that because

853
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,809
I mean that will probably stifle one

854
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:15,788
story like that will probably kind of

855
00:38:13,809 --> 00:38:19,240
take people's enjoyment out of a

work that they're doing there you know

861
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,399
I'd have a chance to include everything

generality and it takes a limited

thanks finally have a question for you

903
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:13,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">um you talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font>

904
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:15,910
think sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places end-to-end</font>

905
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:19,030
reservation as I'm sure you're aware

906
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:21,980
traffic aggregation<font color="#CCCCCC"> qsr is is a headache</font>

907
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:24,200
reservation irrigation<font color="#E5E5E5"> by comparison is</font>

908
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,700
a nightmare yes what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learned in</font>

909
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,990
the past it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it with it's</font>

910
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:33,200
going to make it different and actually

911
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:35,149
work this time well sure how much RSVP

912
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:47,230
would you like to buy that's what the

913
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:53,960
answer absolutely but but um really<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

914
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:56,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">right Oh someone shouted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money and my</font>

915
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:57,740
money and my response would like to the

916
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:01,490
money was ok how much RSVP would you

917
00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:04,850
like to buy yes exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> um to be more</font>

918
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:08,350
serious um reservation<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a problem</font>

919
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:11,390
absolutely I agree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you but there</font>

920
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,100
there may be other ways to solve it as

921
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:15,710
well one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the BBF is</font>

922
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,400
looking at actually into in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

923
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:21,560
reservation is looking at applications

924
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:27,050
where you might actually do something

925
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">like have a web form where you can you</font>

926
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,550
can reserve bandwidth in advance for

<font color="#E5E5E5">eight for a particular purpose the quest</font>

928
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,000
then we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what the</font>

929
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,259
protocols behind that are but you know

930
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,150
that that's one of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

931
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,220
BBF is talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example I would</font>

932
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:44,270
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> encourage people thinking about</font>

935
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:52,850
figuring out where the actual problems

936
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:54,680
are and how to solve them you mentioned

937
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:56,810
on particular that that biologically

938
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:58,819
access networks the cause of headaches

939
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:00,290
not the backbones the background

940
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,330
operators have the backbones and the

941
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:05,480
back linear attacks under control maybe

942
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:07,460
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe an attack on reservation on</font>

943
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:12,590
the access networks limited domain might

944
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:14,210
get somewhere mm-hmm cool thanks hello

945
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:16,160
Marco cloning I work for one of the

946
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:19,100
internet registries that's probably less

947
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,020
relevant and I'm certainly not expecting

948
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,180
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> ative answer from you but would</font>

949
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,460
love to your opinion but yeah what one

950
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:27,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your first slides contain the</font>

951
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,210
hourglass model yes and then sort of

952
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:32,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">from an architectural point in the way I</font>

953
00:42:29,210 --> 00:42:34,880
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is like okay so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

954
00:42:32,030 --> 00:42:37,430
creating sort of these different slices

955
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,320
that 55g calls slices people of

956
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,509
different terminology where would you

957
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:44,200
would you expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we still be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

958
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to sustain that hourglass or do we get a</font>

959
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,680
multistem our gloss or would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

960
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:51,410
multiple our glosses sort of glue to the

961
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,680
same base where would we end up

962
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:56,810
architectural<font color="#CCCCCC"> II do you think well I</font>

963
00:42:54,680 --> 00:43:00,430
don't seem a whole lot of change coming

964
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:06,740
to the hourglass model just because

965
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:10,600
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way it is and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in the</font>

966
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">in in the future you know as I said</font>

967
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:17,720
people have talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hourglass</font>

968
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:19,490
moving up to http right and so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

969
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,439
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it maybe as rather than an</font>

970
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:23,180
hourglass you have the top and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you</font>

971
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,540
have HTTP than you have a widening then

972
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,310
another narrowing at IP then it expands

973
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:29,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">again and you know and it may end up</font>

974
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,990
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> a model that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks something like</font>

975
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:35,000
that in the future so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about</font>

976
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:37,129
out of time Linda last question please

977
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:40,940
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> short</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to make it</font>

978
00:43:37,130 --> 00:43:43,370
very short just two new artists Linda

979
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:45,290
Dunbar from Warwick so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> addressed</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">David blacks question the Bible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

981
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:49,790
changed is VP has been a headache for

982
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:51,710
the past and there's answer on the money

983
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,500
and think that's I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give a</font>

984
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:56,270
few more<font color="#E5E5E5"> examples and nowadays and you</font>

985
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:59,090
will see if you just search our internet

986
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:01,250
like latency monitoring services there's

987
00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,590
so many new companies popping up to

988
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:04,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide their services because why</font>

989
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:07,270
because the

990
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:09,220
content managers content system Citians

991
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,470
need that kind of exposure and

992
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:13,089
visibility to the network so that they

993
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:16,270
can distribute the content more

994
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:18,160
intelligently and and as Devi said end

995
00:44:16,270 --> 00:44:20,980
to end the end to end doesn't mean from

996
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,440
here to us across the globe the

997
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:25,300
end-to-end more likely will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like in</font>
