working group has been advancing quite a

96
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:49,140
bit and now probably know we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

102
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:15,070

103
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,890
amount let me still need to do here and

109
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:31,100
working group is about what we're doing

110
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:33,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">this working group is trying to define</font>

111
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,460
media confidentiality with Seth this<font color="#E5E5E5"> may</font>

112
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:36,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">sound like something that would have</font>

113
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">been kind of a strange omission for us</font>

114
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,920
to have made in the decades that we've

115
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,990
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sep in fact that what</font>

we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify are given the</font>

117
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,340
kind of the Swiss Army knife of security

118
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:48,140
services that are available in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sep how</font>

119
00:08:46,340 --> 00:08:50,150
do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> combine those in order to</font>

120
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,680
actually be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get privacy and</font>

121
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:53,840
confidentiality which is largely

122
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,120
motivated by purpose by concerns about

123
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:57,920
pervasive surveillance and so we're

124
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,840
looking at what techniques will cause

125
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,360
basically the most VoIP traffic to be

126
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,800
encrypted that we can we also want to

127
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,750
create a document that might help to

128
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,969
influence public policy that people who

129
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:09,290
look at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> iTap and see a bcp bcp is</font>

130
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:11,360
something we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> represent to the world</font>

131
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:13,610
as the consensus of the ITF that is a

132
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,540
relatively unusual property and the

133
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:19,010
products of the group and yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

134
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,870
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting these things together you</font>

135
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,130
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could identify gaps things that</font>

136
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:24,590
actually need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fixed that we hadn't</font>

137
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought of before until</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you really try</font>

138
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:27,950
to combine everything in this way<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

139
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,900
don't know so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought we'd do the</font>

140
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:32,210
exercise and create something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

141
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,100
hopefully future work here could rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

142
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:37,370
in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to define the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best way to do we</font>

143
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:39,410
get security beset next level this is

144
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,020
has guns all intimated divided into a

145
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,939
two-prong strategy this first prong is a

146
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:46,220
comprehensive security draft that is

147
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:48,380
focused on how we use techniques built

148
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:49,880
around kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a strong identity to be</font>

149
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,100
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that confidentiality</font>

150
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,480
service there is a parallel effort

151
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">however that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not represented here</font>

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,230
today which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opportunistic</font>

153
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,730
security draft that console oh and Ben

154
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:00,920
were just describing we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

155
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:04,370
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that much here at all next</font>

156
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:06,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide so we we didn't do absolutely</font>

157
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,780
nothing since last time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did at least</font>

158
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,070
likely iterate this draft I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

159
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:11,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> twice since last time was makes</font>

160
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:12,560
we meeting there by them and then I

161
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,910
actually made a couple of

162
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,250
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> like right before the deadline</font>

163
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,930
not that that's fair yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell</font>

164
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggested this is largely because like</font>

165
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,199
what stir has been and stir is the

166
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:23,600
fundamental underpinning of this work

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,250
has been really rapidly changing over

168
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,050
the last like four<font color="#CCCCCC"> months and as a</font>

169
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,730
consequence I mean now that we've got

170
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,829
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> kneel down I think into a slightly</font>

171
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:32,960
more stable place I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

172
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:34,550
position to then apply what those

173
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,790
changes have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been to the SIP Randy work</font>

174
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,920
I think I've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that in this</font>

175
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:42,290
revision actually and my hope is that

176
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,329
there won't be a lot to do after this

177
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,680
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually you know most of what we</font>

178
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to do is probably done at this</font>

179
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,760
point more significantly beyond that

180
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,439
realignment we did have a discussion

181
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,300
last time in Berlin there were a couple

182
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">points in that discussion that came out</font>

183
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:58,430
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are noteworthy one you know</font>

184
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,160
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original draft we had a pointer</font>

185
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:02,989
to perk to kind of that the double work

186
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,430
that's going on there we removed that

187
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:06,410
since last time people said this is

188
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:08,479
really not mature enough to be something

189
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we would point to it this time so</font>

190
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,440
right now we kind of defer to any of

191
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,910
these kinds of video conferencing

192
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,500
solutions or trying to figure out ways

193
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,360
that multiple parties can maintain

194
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,370
confidentiality while still using a

195
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,570
central bridge that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is now punted to</font>

196
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,690
them that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not going to be in the</font>

197
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,850
scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this BCP we also removed much</font>

198
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:27,530
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> OS RTP we used to have kind of</font>

199
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:29,030
statements in there like you must do

200
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,920
what we're talking about here but you

201
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,510
may do a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other stuff that's</font>

202
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,969
actually discussed in like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen's draft</font>

203
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,920
and based on our conversation last time

204
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,540
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say anything about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

205
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,219
anymore we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of took all that</font>

206
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,790
out and like you can like rebalance

207
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:45,230
draft to figure out how to do that we

208
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,180
tried to put in some better text about

209
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,800
anonymity and<font color="#CCCCCC"> its der interaction as</font>

210
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,359
well and a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about like</font>

211
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,740
self-signed certain things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that too</font>

212
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,390
but though these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are I think the</font>

213
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:55,490
substantial changes just aligning it

214
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:56,959
with the ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> work and stir removing</font>

215
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,610
the things we agreed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Berlin and</font>

216
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,469
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> dispose string a little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

217
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">certificate management stuff I do have a</font>

218
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,020
couple questions though for the room so

219
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,370
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope you're paying attention there are</font>

220
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:06,199
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can profitably discuss</font>

221
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:10,310
them a little time we have today so so

222
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:12,350
please do follow along what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one</font>

223
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,329
thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that is emerged largely</font>

224
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:16,760
come shaken actually is this concept

225
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,529
that we're profiling stir in certain

226
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,930
ways for particular applications and

227
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:22,730
I've tried to retool this document to

228
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,739
talk about the work of sit brandy as a

229
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:25,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">stirrer profile we're taking stir as its</font>

230
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,349
baseline and

231
00:12:25,939 --> 00:12:31,159
applying it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem of doing</font>

232
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:33,319
media security the best way to extend

233
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:34,369
stir for a profile like this when you

234
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,409
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want the other side like</font>

235
00:12:34,369 --> 00:12:38,959
understand the extension is to use this

236
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:40,549
passport type parameter that we created

237
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,559
for passport passport is the object

238
00:12:40,549 --> 00:12:44,269
format that stir uses to provide its

239
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,669
integrity protection over elements of

240
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,470
sick requests and as a consequence we've

241
00:12:46,669 --> 00:12:49,489
now defined one of those for this the

242
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,869
extensibility model is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

243
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:53,239
something that Chris person I'd like

244
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:55,069
mess with incessantly over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last six</font>

245
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:57,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">months or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so now that that's stable</font>

246
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:59,059
enough i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can articulate what the</font>

247
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,589
right way is to do it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so</font>

248
00:12:59,059 --> 00:13:02,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">that this is my idea but what we have</font>

249
00:13:00,589 --> 00:13:04,099
now there's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> M sac passport type and</font>

250
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,569
this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we signaled in</font>

251
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:07,549
the passport<font color="#CCCCCC"> as well as in the</font>

252
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:10,039
corresponding sip header that carries

253
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:11,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the signature of that passport and this</font>

254
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:14,389
basically allows the endpoints to

255
00:13:11,209 --> 00:13:16,939
negotiate support for this profile it

256
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,470
requires the verifier well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay the the</font>

257
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:19,969
way we define the profile requires the

258
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,889
verifier must feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> the request if</font>

259
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,419
there's a signature violation this is

260
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:26,059
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a property that is intrinsic to</font>

261
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:28,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">passport in fact you know all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sip</font>

262
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:31,279
identity and passport is pretty

263
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:33,079
forgiving right about what local policy

264
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,970
can be like if you get an identity

265
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:36,378
header and the signatures broken if it's

266
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:37,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">not your policy that you should reject</font>

267
00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,649
the request in that instance you don't

268
00:13:37,579 --> 00:13:41,719
have to well this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different because</font>

269
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:43,429
force if Brandi you actually are trying

270
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,289
to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know an environment you</font>

271
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:46,699
don't necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to feel back this</font>

272
00:13:45,289 --> 00:13:48,109
is when someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is originating a sip</font>

273
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:51,079
request they want media confidentiality

274
00:13:48,109 --> 00:13:52,849
they want the request to fail if it's

275
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,829
that confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not available</font>

276
00:13:52,849 --> 00:13:57,319
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much how we define the</font>

277

profile on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'll have a few weasel</font>

281
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:06,649
something that is different about this<font color="#CCCCCC"> M</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">sac profile of star now we want this to</font>

283

284
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:11,988
in waster works stir has this concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:13,999
an authentication service and

286
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:15,949
verification service those could be

287
00:14:13,999 --> 00:14:17,720
instantiated in a user agent or an

288
00:14:15,949 --> 00:14:19,368
intermediary or actually in all kinds of

289
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,809
external entities and weirder store

290
00:14:19,369 --> 00:14:24,199

291
00:14:20,809 --> 00:14:25,999
dreamed about here you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

292
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:28,728
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be end-to-end I think we can make</font>

293
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:30,589

294
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:32,809
verifier and the verifier can know that

295
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:35,239
m/sec was used it's a much tougher

296
00:14:32,809 --> 00:14:36,439
question to really prove like was it

297
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:38,380
done by the originating you a or not

299
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,070
but it's it's a little sketchy and so

300
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,959
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some questions for group</font>

00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about this as well next um this is just</font>

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:51,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of a recap of what it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

304
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,390
and so on for things like zrt PE or like

305
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,090
alternative key mechanisms we're

306
00:14:55,390 --> 00:15:00,010
exploring for us RTP here what we really

these questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what it really</font>

327
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,570
that you know most practically means is

328
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,740
they need to have a way to get

329
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">credentials that are appropriate for</font>

this anything that is an authentication

service needs to have a credential for

332
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:54,849
its identity if we imagine this is going

some work<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have we could do something</font>

kind of self signed certificate on first

differentiated from an intermediary

basically doing the same thing and

345
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:26,230
that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it man in the</font>

to assume that as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we do have now</font>

348
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:33,370
this draft Peterson Acme telephone which

00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,819
is looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Acme as a potential</font>

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,360
mechanism for acquiring certificates or

devices that<font color="#CCCCCC"> newster there is a profile</font>

for that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> should work specifically</font>

353
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,210
for this kind of end user device where

354
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:48,400
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would use well known techniques like</font>

355
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,050
say SMS validation there are

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:52,030
sophisticated adversaries obviously who

357
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:54,490
can get in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way of that as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

358
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:56,500
but this would at least be a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

359
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,420
have a plausible story potentially

especially in a smartphone environment

361
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:01,449
one that is coupled with some kind of

362
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,040
operating system integration I

363
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:04,900
understand there are hooks for example

364
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,310
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android that allow you to interrogate</font>

365
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,480
the operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> system so you might you</font>

366
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,760
might be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get multiple factors</font>

367
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,710
that really tie this to some particular

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,270
endpoint of<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim cards another</font>

possibility of places<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you could</font>

try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some something that is tied</font>

to the device that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> controlled by the</font>

00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,040
credentials are issued for this because

374
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,510
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only reasonable assurance</font>

375
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,310
we're going to have that this is truly

376
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:28,540
end-to-end that the entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

377
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,490
talking to actually is an endpoint

378
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,899
rather than some intermediary is going

379
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,090
to derive<font color="#CCCCCC"> from something like that from</font>

380
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,580
some kind of multi-factor process that

381
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:37,270
identifies the device itself and then

382
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,310
you're going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have some</font>

00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">assurance of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the users control of that</font>

plots that much said you know we're much

385
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:47,200
like stir itself is kind of punting on

386
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,870
this like we're we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some</font>

387
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,830
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could do it if we have</font>

388
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,760
some very clever notions of how we could

389
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:57,639
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this if you think will provide</font>

390
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,520
stronger attestation that this is in

391
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,650
fact an end user device we can we might

392
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:05,879
want to prescribe those right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now though</font>

393
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:07,990
it's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I'd say that guidance is</font>

394
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,030
inspirational rather than than very

395
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:11,920
specific about what credential

396
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,000
acquisition looks like with us however I

397
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,760
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> again credential</font>

398
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,670
acquisition is probably the only thing

399
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,470
that plausibly is going to mark a

400
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:25,180
particular passport as being signed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

401
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,480
device controlled by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end user versus</font>

402
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:30,480
not rust did you have thoughts on that

403
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:38,170
Russ<font color="#CCCCCC"> Housley so the question I have is</font>

404
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,720
who we're going to mandate have the

405
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,520
certificate then we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about how</font>

406
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,170
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get it because stir</font>

407
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,990
accommodate signatures at different

408
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,930
points in the call pal it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scambler</font>

409
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:57,610
profile so this is this going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

410
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:01,630
what which place must support and then

411
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:03,399
which places could also support or and

412
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:04,870
that's what I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand</font>

413
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,710
because you can't answer that last

414
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:08,139
question

415
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:09,700
to you know who the signer is so I that

416
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,070
the intent here is provide end-to-end

417
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,230
media security and as a consequence you

418
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:16,720
know that the assumption is that there

419
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,580
is some sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> endpoint right and that</font>

420
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,960
the credentials<font color="#E5E5E5"> require design this must</font>

421
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,990
reside on such an endpoint now this is

422
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,370
unfortunately because of sips nature an

423
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,840
endpoint is an abstraction and they're

424
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,428
all kinds of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know decomposed</font>

425
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,470
endpoints and things like that that make

426
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:31,450
this extremely problematic or you know

427
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:33,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">end-user gateways you plug a black phone</font>

428
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:34,510
into you know is that not<font color="#CCCCCC"> in to end if</font>

429
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,970
there's like a Blackfoot so I mean

430
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:39,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">unfortunately you you you you quickly</font>

431
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:41,169
hit those philosophical limits when you

432
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,850
try to define this I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just trying to</font>

433
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:45,190
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what the best kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

434
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,719
assurances we could get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

435
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">device is associated with this and so</font>

436
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,330
that's why I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like this</font>

437
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi factor off that might be</font>

438
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:53,350
associated with with the device itself

439
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:56,709
to really strongly couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to the</font>

440
00:19:53,350 --> 00:20:00,840
device so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is worth notice noting</font>

441
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,370
about what is worth noting about the arm

442
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,279
about this last point about<font color="#E5E5E5"> survivor</font>

443
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,320
sorts um is that um transparency

444
00:20:06,279 --> 00:20:11,260
mechanisms like CT potentially v8 some

445
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,230
of those concerns right<font color="#CCCCCC"> kinda um leave</font>

446
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,990
it so um to what extent depends on

447
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:18,100
exactly how it applied mm-hmm no I could

448
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:20,730
make a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sense for this actually to</font>

449
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:24,610
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> letter for this yeah yeah um</font>

450
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:26,380
Ellen did you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask me punches I just a</font>

451
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,750
sort of meta level I don't think we

452
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,220
necessarily have to prescribe that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

453
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,289
you couldn't do that other ways but I

454
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,640
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do need some way that we</font>

455
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,890
say you'll have they'll work because

456
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,360
this is this solution is sort of

457
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:38,740
laughable without this is the hard part

458
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,270
of it so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> together a</font>

459
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,100
solution that really all hangs together

460
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:43,899
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a solution unless we have</font>

461
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,149
some answers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this problem as well I</font>

462
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:49,029
think it should be within our scope to

463
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:50,408
solve this and I get all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font>

464
00:20:49,029 --> 00:20:51,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how r though it's a different part</font>

465
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:54,190
like TLS doesn't have to meet that bar

466
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:55,809
right like we don't ask pls to solve how

467
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:57,789
you get the search for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in the</font>

468
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:59,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">standard so i mean it's it's an unusual</font>

469
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,149
barf the item i know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

470
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,789
give some reasonable guidance for this

471
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:05,139
right and in may be there I'm really

472
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,789
poking out here is there better guidance

473
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:13,630
we can give them you ordinarily do about

474
00:21:06,789 --> 00:21:16,240
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay Chris Chris one I guess we</font>

475
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:17,770
don't mention explicitly but

476
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,270
service providers obviously have to

477
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:25,210
follow legal types of requests where we

478
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:27,280
do have to do men in the middle yep so

479
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,500
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually one case where if a</font>

480
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,360
service provider was ever going to adopt

481
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,630
something like this and then media

482
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,479
security which can be a good thing we

483
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,260
sort of have to be able to at least for

484
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,520
certain calls do some legal things so

485
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,080
just to point that out and I'm sure

486
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,340
already thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought of that but</font>

487
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,740
there is there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is some language in there</font>

488
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:49,510
about shipwreck right which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

489
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,860
example anyway of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism that was</font>

490
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:52,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">designed for that purpose that we</font>

491
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,790
standardize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF there were you kind</font>

492
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:56,260
of work basically the media coming out

493
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,000
at the end point to two devices one of

494
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,470
which has and then confidentiality<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

495
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,330
the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other of which goes to</font>

496
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,250
recording entity that's required by Clea

497
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:05,379
or whatever so I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

498
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,970
solutions to that this this particular

499
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:07,900
mechanism and this is gonna be true to

500
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,150
anything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of follows the</font>

501
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,040
purpose mandate is looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

502
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,260
enabling that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the security</font>

503
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,550
between two endpoints and so yeah it's

504
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,440
it is necessarily going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

505
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:18,550
antagonistic I figured this would not be

506
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that people be looking at</font>

507
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,720
service writers like help this happen in

508
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,610
this instance because of that it very

509
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,070
very well I understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I mean it</font>

510
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:31,149
could be just in domain of I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> n dem</font>

511
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:33,730
sip media security and that's that's it

512
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:36,400
but if you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about service</font>

513
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:38,320
providers there and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming that it</font>

514
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,040
would be beneficial if there was some

515
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,350
way in the future that this could happen

516
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,928
but you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is we do have</font>

517
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,760
men<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle apartments there some</font>

518
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:52,120
do but I really on the side of his

519
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:53,650
noting that concern they get another

520
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,000
purpose threat model and understands

521
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:56,530
that certainly and that's that's what

522
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:01,390
we're coding to<font color="#CCCCCC"> here basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

523
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:03,250
standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> exelon um leaving that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one the</font>

524
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,050
size of the moment unconnected identity

525
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,700
so one of the interesting properties of

526
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:09,460
stir is that it only works on requests

527
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:11,440
you cannot sign responses and stir<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

528
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:14,050
a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of historical and technical</font>

529
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,090
reasons for that back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> day john</font>

530
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:19,360
LOL hack together the connected identity

531
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:21,550
draft to try to remedy this I've kind of

532
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,809
looked it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit because basically</font>

533
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,399
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same thing for this</font>

534
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:27,490
ultimately because we need the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

535
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">points to both originate you know signed</font>

536
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:31,300
identity header is basically using stir

537
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:33,639
we need them to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

538
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,830
connected identity connect identity

539
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,630
among other things relaxes the

540
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,699
requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you maintain certain</font>

541
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:41,830
dialogue tags like the same from<font color="#E5E5E5"> header</font>

542
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,880
field that it was named to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hetero filled</font>

543
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:45,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">this in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the original request things like</font>

544
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,290
that in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to show</font>

545
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:49,200
especially for the dialogue requests

546
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:52,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">early responses and things like that</font>

547
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,610
that what the actual target was that a

548
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:56,080
call reached and this is really

549
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:57,790
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> for any of this to work</font>

550
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sign for that</font>

551
00:23:57,790 --> 00:24:01,300
identity if that identity was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in fact</font>

552
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:02,650
not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe industry of domain because</font>

553
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,700
this call was<font color="#CCCCCC"> forged you you literally</font>

554
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:07,090
wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sign it unless</font>

555
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:09,850
you're changing those identifiers I've

556
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:11,500
looked at 49 16 I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I see much</font>

557
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:13,530
that's a problem and since I mean

558
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:16,180
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of examples there that use</font>

559
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,040
4474 there's a lot of 4474 specific

560
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,670
language I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's enough</font>

561
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:23,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it warrants like an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update but I'm</font>

562
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,510
interesting opinion of some so I'd like

563
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">someone other than me like who's here to</font>

564
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:31,690
like Rita at some point and see if

565
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:33,159
that's also their assessment<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

566
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:34,930
didn't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot that looked like it</font>

567
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,140
needed to be repaired apart from

568
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:44,260
examples and given that I was like oh I

569
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:46,090
mean do we would Jonathan a John phonics

570
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:49,360
good examples go in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

571
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:51,220
drafts then their<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference that no the</font>

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,389
other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around if this shows how you'd</font>

00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:54,130
use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 916</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

574
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:55,510
defining now we could definitely do some

575
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,830
examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the many</font>

576
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we probably add when we think</font>

577
00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:02,439
we've got the story baked properly um

578
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:10,570
and we get about volunteer to look into

579
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:12,700
these hello everybody's doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> email so</font>

580
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">Johnny's asking for help on on having a</font>

581
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:17,710
look at that from that point of view you

582
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,360
can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> this second</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sue bullet yeah I'm</font>

583
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:21,730
well yeah where we need is<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody who</font>

584
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,560
can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4916 who has some familiarity</font>

585
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,590
with what's in 4474<font color="#CCCCCC"> bits and how it</font>

586
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:29,440
differs from 4474 and say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay given the</font>

587
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:30,909
deltas between 4470 400m four bits is

588
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,740
there anything we actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

589
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,710
change about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the campy identity</font>

590
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:38,050
mechanism let's not focus on whether it

591
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:39,850
you know uses the term identity info

592
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:42,580
right and places so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are things</font>

593
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,740
that were deprecated in 4474 best let's

594
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,120
focus on whether any

595
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:46,890
of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you normatively are</font>

596
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,678
required to do to implement it would

597
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,510
would change because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this Adam</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Roach</font>

598
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,280
and with the caveat that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time</font>

599
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,140
ago microphone to volunteer for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

600
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of thing it took me an entire ITF</font>

601

602
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:02,070
down and then bother the crap out of me

603
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:04,139
Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Adam can we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that captured</font>

604
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:05,159
in the notes but yeah that's really

605
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:09,950
notice we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bother the hell</font>

606
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:12,270
out of Adam yes exactly we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that part</font>

607
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:13,440
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> where be aware there are some hard</font>

608
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,150
edges around retargeting right I mean

609
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,010
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I wrote</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a draft about this</font>

610
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,080
way back in the day that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was called the</font>

611
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:21,480
unanticipated response draft that I

612
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:24,960
refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the time since then that we</font>

613
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,160
never made Narcy but that basically asks

614
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,630
this question you see post and bought

615
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,950
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait I didn't mean to call this</font>

616
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,870
person why<font color="#CCCCCC"> am I connected</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why are they</font>

617
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:33,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">my connected identity like you kind of</font>

618
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,678
throw sip invites over the wall<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

619
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,270
get routed and you don't know why things

620
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,770
are forwarded or what happened in the

621
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,150
network now there have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of</font>

622
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,250
drafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that have addressed this over the</font>

623
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">years history info to version things</font>

624
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:46,020
like this and they have various levels

625
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,120
of uptake in the marketplace because of

626
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,860
the cryptography associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in</font>

627
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:51,239
particular<font color="#CCCCCC"> though</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think a</font>

628
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,428
cryptographic solution is probably

629
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,480
warranted for this and I took a stab at

630
00:26:53,429 --> 00:26:55,830
this because people keep complaining

631
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,210
about this as well on the store list

632
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:59,699
there's a draft now<font color="#CCCCCC"> a draft Peterson</font>

633
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">stir divert that looks at a special</font>

634
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,660
passport header that basically does a

635
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:05,610
cryptographically signed diversion that

636
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">just lets you say this call has been</font>

637
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,590
forwarded from its original destination

638
00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:12,780
to somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> else so take a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look at that</font>

639
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:14,129
too again I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need that in order</font>

640
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,309
for the connected identity story to

641
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,420
really work<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's another piece of</font>

642
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:22,500
the puzzle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're folding into this</font>

643
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:25,559
next line this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is something also came up</font>

644
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,120
in astor list you know should you do

645
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,850
people want some kind of middle ground

646
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,469
maybe an opportunistic stir<font color="#E5E5E5"> as sex I</font>

647
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,399
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a previous</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide on opportunistic</font>

648
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,400
stir in Berlin they talked<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

649
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,760
something different than this do we need

650
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,950
a way that when you're trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

651
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:43,770
this m/sec mechanism you still want the

652
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:46,650
call to set up if the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side does</font>

653
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:47,970
not support media security you'll know

654
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,850
that it's not encrypted don't be any

655
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,500
ambiguity about that but you're still

656
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:54,389
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to let the call be set up if it</font>

657
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,840
turns out that encryption cannot be

658
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,820
negotiated and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

659
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,199
no I mean you could always try with them

660
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,059
sack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know try it again</font>

661
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:05,480
without<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit right i mean it invites</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

662
00:28:02,059 --> 00:28:07,820
cheap but if we wanted to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that i</font>

663
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,840
think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reading on stir and</font>

664
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,610
especially if it's extensibility

665
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:12,350
mechanisms that kind of wood already

666
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,240
allow this if we wanted it in that the

667
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:15,860
authentication service right the only

668
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,380
indication it really gets that the

669
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:19,699
alternate side supports em sack is when

670
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:21,440
it sees this request in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the backwards</font>

671
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,210
direction that contains the answer that

672
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to contain the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> em sack you know</font>

673
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:26,750
passport type in it and if the

674
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:28,190
authentication service is feeling

675
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:30,200
forgiving right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the originating</font>

676
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:31,730
side so it's in this instance it's

677
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,529
supposed to be coupled with the end

678
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:34,640
user's device the end user would control

679
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:36,740
the authentication service in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

680
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,659
instance it gets feeling for giving it

681
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,039
could just be like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay like you know</font>

682
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:41,510
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't support him sack you obviously</font>

683
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,158
didn't understand the identity header in

684
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,419
here there's no identity at or

685
00:28:43,159 --> 00:28:46,340
whatsoever on the response or whatever

686
00:28:44,419 --> 00:28:49,610
fine let's just like set up<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call I</font>

687
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,529
could like document that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I don't</font>

688
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:54,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it breaks anything in stir to do</font>

689
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:55,730
that um but I was curious if people

690
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,889
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was even worth documenting</font>

691
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:59,720
or if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a strong stand and</font>

692
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,460
say actually when you're using em sack

693
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:03,049
don't do that like that that's the

694
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,580
alternative right we could say if you

695
00:29:03,049 --> 00:29:06,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">send em sack is an authentication</font>

696
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:08,389
service and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the other</font>

697
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">side something with no idea you had to</font>

698
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:12,620
wear them sec in it you must feel like

699
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,779
right wait I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we quite say</font>

700
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,219
that yeah we could right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just a</font>

701
00:29:14,779 --> 00:29:18,440
bit ambiguous I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is Cullen</font>

702
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,450
then crisper than Jonathan hey John

703
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,210
actual question them so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gonzalo</font>

704
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:24,529
from the floor but um document in this

705
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:27,460
draft so what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about yes</font>

706
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:30,320
it's not documented in the draft today

707
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">killing James uh I mean I think we</font>

708
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">should describe something like this when</font>

709
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,340
you look at practical deployments they

710
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,750
have to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to solve this</font>

711
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:36,830
problem and they'll all do it

712
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,210
differently we like won't like the

713
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:39,889
answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll paint us into corners</font>

714
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:41,270
that we can't get out later if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't</font>

715
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,640
end up describing this so I would prefer

716
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,610
to describe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and then decide whether</font>

717
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,440
we say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we truly hate this but</font>

718
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,908
<font color="#CCCCCC">no you'll do it anyway all in caps I</font>

719
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,710
mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> may be the category for it but</font>

720
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:54,380
I can decide that later but we should

721
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,710
have some text that's says it<font color="#CCCCCC"> christer</font>

722
00:29:54,380 --> 00:30:00,140
thoughts yes cursed<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh what you just</font>

723
00:29:57,710 --> 00:30:02,870
said isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> that something which is more</font>

724
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,760
generic to extending stir and should

725
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:07,100
actually be<font color="#E5E5E5"> documented in this document</font>

726
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,799
so it stirred us people<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir does behave</font>

727
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,000
this way now right so again i'm talking

728
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,340
about what the baseline stir

729
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,680
behavior there is in the second hole

730
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:17,659
subpolar we could however override that

731
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,850
right we could we could say you must

732
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,290
fail this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this specific profile</font>

733
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:22,850
again the same way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shaken is a</font>

734
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,830
profile of stir this is a profile of

735
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:26,570
stir<font color="#CCCCCC"> we could say that in these cases we</font>

736
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:27,679
wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ban it right now it's just a</font>

737
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:29,240
loophole that I don't say anything but

738
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:31,010
either way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I observe this loophole</font>

739
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,750
existed because people like dave Franco

740
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:35,330
are asking a master list is their way to

741
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:38,750
do this opportunistic<font color="#E5E5E5"> lid right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now say</font>

742
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:40,820
well you could so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the</font>

743
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:43,070
question is do we even if we say<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing</font>

744
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,080
we're still allowing it we could instead

745
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,970
of saying nothing explain how to do it

746
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,470
right and say this is by the way the

747
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,960
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists feel free to exploit it</font>

748
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:52,370
alternately we could say right you can't

749
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,410
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and make it a must not for this</font>

750
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,449
profile would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you prefer any of this</font>

751
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,400
three options<font color="#CCCCCC"> this guy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean the only</font>

752
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,980
thing what what I want to do is assuming

753
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:05,060
I mean I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> the verifier and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

754
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:08,510
support stir I mean a stun easter and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

755
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,270
get this invite with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> m/sec or</font>

756
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:13,670
whatever you call it and I have no<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

757
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:15,610
of it I don't know what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it's just</font>

758
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:18,710
something to me which is then clip on

759
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,310
but it's still ok for me to indicate

760
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:23,840
this goal as being verified I don't want

761
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,909
to reject this because you know I do

762
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,560
stir and I get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff that this or</font>

763
00:31:25,910 --> 00:31:29,150
so that'sthat's my Lou we're not

764
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:30,800
changing that paper I'll really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

765
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:32,840
behavior the beaver would be back on the

766
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:34,460
authentication server side right the the

767
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,860
changer that if we were to make a change

768
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,810
would be that when the purifier side

769
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,969
sends back the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> the invite if</font>

770
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:42,980
not doesn't use em sack we could say

771
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:44,810
because the original the call does like

772
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,490
that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fail yeah sure didn't</font>

773
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:48,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">originator can do whatever it wants but</font>

774
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:49,850
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a verifier you very</font>

775
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,430
much nurse it's a rich inside beaver

776
00:31:49,850 --> 00:31:54,800
Jonathan the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neckar okay gentleman x</font>

777
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:57,290
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comment that I think</font>

778
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,159
that they're probably should be some

779
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,020
warnings that even if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing</font>

780
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:02,030
opportunistic you know you call this guy

781
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:04,040
yesterday needed em second you called

782
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:05,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">him today and he doesn't you know that's</font>

783
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the same thing as I'm calling</font>

784
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,649
somebody out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> blue and they don't do</font>

785
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:11,990
em sexo yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean more complex policy</font>

786
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:14,120
analytics things like that aren't

787
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,560
exactly i think the immediate scope but

788
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,879
certainly we could have some guidance

789
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,169
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tofu stuff should obviously</font>

790
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,850
have cognis like that yeah so I mean

791
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:25,240
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like inverse tofu or something</font>

792
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:26,990
yeah so on the other related thing

793
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,580
but you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're saying here is</font>

794
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,730
if I wondering if you want anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

795
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">um baseline stir for basic comprehension</font>

796
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:35,780
mandatory you know if you don't

797
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:38,390
understand this field either<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

798
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:40,100
ignore<font color="#E5E5E5"> identity entirely or even reject</font>

799
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,540
the call so that that texas air it's

800
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,129
pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at the difference is the</font>

801
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,320
differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to Christers point we</font>

802
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:46,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't we don't prescribe that you have</font>

803
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,780
to reject<font color="#E5E5E5"> the call right when you</font>

804
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:49,640
prescribe if you don't understand the

805
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:51,800
ppt type in that entity header you can't

806
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,970
use it now it's then<font color="#E5E5E5"> local policy up to</font>

807
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,680
you what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

808
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,600
another at any header<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do understand</font>

809
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:58,309
in addition to this one obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

810
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,870
use that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hear you understand if you</font>

811
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,550
don't require identity all you can still

812
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:03,169
process the call so I mean there's that

813
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:04,760
that range of policy outcomes isn't

814
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:06,080
affected in baseline store but we're

815
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,390
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> something stricter and narrower</font>

816
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:09,710
than baseline stir here which is why we

817
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,050
have the opportunity to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

818
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,809
trigger if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> Becker yeah Eric</font>

819
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:16,520
school um yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's gonna</font>

820
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:18,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">be pretty common demonstration where you</font>

821
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:20,450
admit this stuff for their guys like

822
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:22,790
I've never heard of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this crap so I I</font>

823
00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:24,080
don't see how we don't I I don't know

824
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:25,520
how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> is talking with this loophole</font>

825
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,139
forces less if we allow it to continue

826
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,000
to exist well that's one of the

827
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,410
questions I'm asking yes I guess I think

828
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,870
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ought you offer three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

829
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:35,030
possibilities one pass on silence to

830
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,129
document and three forbid i think for

831
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,050
bid is clearly like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i could plan so</font>

832
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">i think that leaves us with you know</font>

833
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,899
document versa in a document for space

834
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:46,669
on uh you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I think perhaps a</font>

835
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,020
paragraph of useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um I think</font>

836
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:51,770
every wouldn't be a disaster<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

837
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:53,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> weird but um yeah I got this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font>

838
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:54,260
i'm generally getting as people are<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

839
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:59,630
with documenting this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font>

840
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:01,160
in look<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will mention that I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I this</font>

841
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:03,559
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> earlier eyes just for ought to</font>

842
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,510
mention it I'm not very enthusiastic at

843
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:07,760
the tofu mechanisms I think existing

844
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:10,010
evidence with systems are much better

845
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,500
manners than this um that have tofu

846
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:14,240
style mechanism specifically HP KP is

847
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:16,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually it's not worked out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

848
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,959
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people are extremely reluctant</font>

849
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,590
to actually commit to any set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> key</font>

850
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:24,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">material um and and it causes Buster's</font>

851
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,270
gonna try so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess this is a situation</font>

852
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:29,540
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chance that I'm gonna like you</font>

853
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:31,129
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah huh how many times is like</font>

854
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,360
the people have to restore<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

855
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:34,129
their phones and reinstall our phones

856
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,899
and lose their<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys if the consequence</font>

857
00:34:34,129 --> 00:34:38,469
of like<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing your key is like</font>

858
00:34:35,899 --> 00:34:40,118
everybody that is it like

859
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,959
you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to all time can't talk</font>

860
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:45,580
to you that seems like a not very

861
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,379
attractive outcome um so I got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

862
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,879
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to me like we'll</font>

863
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,290
probably go with explicitly documenting

864
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,270
that at least noting this loophole

865
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:54,480
exists and what it would look like in

866
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:57,910
practice to use this opportunistically

867
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,970
next slide so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

868
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:02,440
issue list for this you know we can

869
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:04,390
tighten that m/sec tax that's a good

870
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,280
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of something we tighten that's</font>

871
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:08,140
an example of a failure case definitely

872
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,910
having some concrete examples in the

873
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:11,799
draft would<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably help as well I</font>

874
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">think this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a mature enough state</font>

875
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:16,180
that we could start looking at those we

876
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:17,980
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably borrow them pretty pretty</font>

877
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,000
much from the existing examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> we build</font>

878
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:23,260
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> passport and for RC 4474 bits at</font>

879
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,070
some point we want to make sure we've

880
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,570
handled WebRTC alignment on this Cullen

881
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:30,040
in a sense of like you know one of the

882
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,210
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really hope for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

883
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:32,830
this mechanism is that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

884
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:34,780
possible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have ended</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> media security</font>

885
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:36,970
from a sip endpoint using stir to a

886
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,560
WebRTC endpoint or we we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to add</font>

887
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:41,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">that as a stretch goal in this</font>

888
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,940
particular Kickstarter that is sip

889
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,250
brandy so I mean I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

890
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:47,500
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anything other than not</font>

891
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:50,290
closed doors that will prevent us for

892
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:51,880
doing that later at this point and your

893
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:53,380
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> appreciated and give</font>

894
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,390
some context around that of what the

895
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:56,859
doors are we shouldn't close but the

896
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:59,529
sense of getting is were probably cool

897
00:35:56,859 --> 00:36:01,359
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean just a status update I think</font>

898
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,040
right now it's it we're even<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than</font>

899
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,630
doors open I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would actually work</font>

900
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,369
from what we have right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font>

901
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,410
there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin and I have a PR</font>

902
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:10,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in on web RTC stop this you know</font>

903
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,830
change is happening but I like I think

904
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:18,520
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is looking like we might get the</font>

905
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:20,560
stretch goal Martin you you bullish that

906
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:23,140
was a shrug<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay i'm putting by I my</font>

907
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">mama right so weak by right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now oh yeah</font>

908
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:25,660
Martin tells me I'm always a little

909
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:27,250
cautious about doing these things until

910
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:29,200
I've actually implemented them at least

911
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:32,220
and I haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> had time to with them at</font>

912
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one it's relatively trivial but I</font>

913
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:36,399
haven't made the changes yet so all

914
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:39,670
right I'd be interested to hear about

915
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,500
that when the time comes um that much

916
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:44,109
said I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's like a</font>

917
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,730
ton more to do here right miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> bcp is</font>

918
00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:47,529
merely you know stitching together

919
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,060
existing work that's been done elsewhere

920
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,950
it creates<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new profile and</font>

921
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,420
extension um I still think we're

922
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,330
probably pretty good shape to get

923
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:57,160
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> March especially given it provided</font>

924
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,890
stir does not change 15 more times and

925
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,540
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> do four months which at this</font>

926
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,980
point I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think seemed seems unlikely I</font>

927
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:08,470
think we should be in pretty good shape

928
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:10,600
um that's it unless you will have any

929
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,089
further discussion comments any more

930
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:17,710
question for for John anyone wants to

931
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:20,740
volunteer to do this and spit me um

932
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:22,720
thanks thank you John<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'm pleased</font>

933
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:24,640
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> when your advice is the draft um</font>

934
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,129
you know preview it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some comments</font>

935
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:32,700
because yeah we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish ideally</font>

936
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:32,700
by x marks um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay any other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

937
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:40,930
well the meeting is adjourned<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font>

938
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:43,660
uh we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> missing one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ablution</font>

939
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:48,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">solutions how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Henning does the blue</font>

940
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:52,170
right I think so yeah if you can bring

941
