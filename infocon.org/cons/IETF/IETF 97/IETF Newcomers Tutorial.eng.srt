meeting the died ever IETF working group

24
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,788
meeting I've ever attended we started

25
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:04,080
about eight o'clock in the morning when

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,309
development organizations or talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

32
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,110
a little bit about culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people</font>

33
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,570
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about culture in different ways</font>

34
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,090
the IETF has a culture we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,960

people useful documents and tools talk

about what the internet research<font color="#E5E5E5"> task</font>

force is just again because they meet

with us they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the IETF but you</font>

49
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:02,700
might find it useful to sit in one of

50
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,290
their sessions and understand what's

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,120
going on

52
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:06,470
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk a little bit about other</font>

is an organized activity and Internet

Society that wasn't always the case the

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:23,150
IETF was originally an engineering

63
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,860
NSFNET over the years the IETF turned

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,720
from that engineering organization to

65
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,060
what we primarily are today a standard

69
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:00,340
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see in the IETF gets done</font>

70
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:03,500
actually in subgroups the working groups

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:04,610
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> encounter lots of them here</font>

72
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,459
there's about a hundred thirty of them

73
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:08,870
you also might encounter the turning in

74
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:10,190
architecture board in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

75
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:11,540
probably one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have questions find</font>

84
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:41,320
understand what's going on so I ETF is

85
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:43,959
roughly divided into these areas general

86
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,100
applications real-time transport

87
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:48,440
Internet routing operations and

88
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,870
management and security this is useful

89
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,420
for you because if you are interested in

90
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,730
working group it is associated with an

91
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:58,700
area and other working groups in that

92
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,280
area may also have interests for you so

93
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:03,820
if you are a security geek and you're

94
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on</font>

authentication constrained<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment</font>

96
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,799
you might find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something useful and say</font>

97
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:15,570
TLS which is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a working group in</font>

98
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:18,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that security area and this is what</font>

99
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:18,890
happens when I push the wrong buttons

100
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,469
there we go sorry

101
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:31,140
okay we meet three times a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

102
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,510
met all over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world this is the 97th</font>

103

104
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,240

107
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,060
meeting okay at the session these are

108
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:50,790
the events these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the things that are</font>

109
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,650
organized working group sessions that's

110
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:54,360
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's mostly what you're going</font>

111
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:58,169
to see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> but you get birds of feather</font>

112
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,630
sessions I RTF sessions you get the area

113
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:03,990
wide sessions the security area advisory

114
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:07,010
group the applications area steering

115
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,360
group things along those lines plenaries

116
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,860
we've only got one this time around if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

117
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember correctly and that's on</font>

118
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wednesday and that's the combination</font>

119
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:17,369
technical and administrative sometimes

120
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,290
if we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got enough going on those will</font>

121
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,940
get split into two nights one for

122
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:23,280
administration one for technical stuff

123
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,550
but like right now that's we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

124
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,080
tutorials and lunch events um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

125
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,390
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a social I know we don't</font>

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:35,070
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a social event this time around but</font>

127
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:37,740
we do have the bits and bytes which is

128
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,400
sort of a social<font color="#E5E5E5"> event and you know we</font>

129
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:45,180
want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at our product stuff um</font>

the IETF hackathons are pretty common<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different organizations and I</font>

development here it's about building

136

something with people who want to build

who work in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> code sprints and then</font>

style of presentation that we've been

160
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,210
years gives you a lot of the nur scia so

161
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:19,000
we are a long established organization

162
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:21,698
we have a culture you will not be able

163
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,550
to change it immediately you change it

164
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,800
by participating and by<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting a little</font>

165

<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of stuff into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the water and helping</font>

168
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:36,878
piece is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really important</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know if you</font>

169
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,800
bring an idea forward and you try and

170
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">get 30 or 40 people to bring the same</font>

171
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,319
idea forward it better be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good one if</font>

172
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:47,289
it is a bad one and it's a company thing

173
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,139
or a organizational thing or you're

174
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:53,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do something it's still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a dumb</font>

175
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:53,699
idea and we know the difference

176
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:01,290
this is it we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the internet</font>

177
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,880
and Internet related technologies we

178
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:05,130
deal with things that are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

179
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,990
internet level sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> a tiny</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

180
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit underneath that with respect to</font>

181
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,740
things like mpls and some time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

182
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:12,900
things just a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> over that</font>

183
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,870
dealing with transport layers and things

184
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,400
like that we mostly don't deal with we

185
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,400
occasionally deal with applications

186
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:27,280
leaked to the other people in the room

187
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,780
and by respectfully I mean be aware that

188
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:34,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">they may not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be in the same place</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:37,510
are with respect to with respect<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

190
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,400
understanding of what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

191
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:42,588
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sinus or it may be ignorant</font>

192
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,420
rather than stupidity<font color="#CCCCCC"> and in fact it</font>

193
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:46,250
probably isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is a nurse around</font>

194
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:52,010
stupidity but willful ignorance is

195
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:53,600
problematic so just be aware and be a

196
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,740
little bit tolerant of people when

197
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,010
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and we're going to be do</font>

00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:22,380
of how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people we need for the rooms</font>

you're in a session and you can't

260
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:40,350
understand if the person is talking

261
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,860
isn't speaking loud enough or speaking

262

too fast please let them know we can't

263

non-native<font color="#E5E5E5"> English speaker or you have</font>

265

somebody to explain what's going on text

271
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:11,870
wise without actually having to interact

272
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:15,180

00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:50,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to try out or we've got some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

288
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:54,120
who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in something</font>

289
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:55,980
something fun so we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had birds of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

290
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,040
feather sessions on internet of things

291
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:02,010
birds of a feather sessions on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I've</font>

292
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,400
lost track over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the years the idea is</font>

293
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,530
the birds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the feather session is to</font>

294
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,939
get people involved get an idea whether

295
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,689
or not we should form a working group

296
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,340
and have that conversation they tend<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

297
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:17,010
be a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tutorial than</font>

298
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:19,350
working group sessions so you will get

299
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:21,840
some information beforehand but the key

300
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:25,200
piece is they generally only meet once

301
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,590
and they either end up going away or

302
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,690
ending up as a working group so there

303
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:37,140
you've got most of all the stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

304
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:40,200
here um the working groups are ideally

305
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:41,550
have a fixed life they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> designed when</font>

306
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,570
you start the working group you've got a

307
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,910
work plan and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the work plan is done</font>

308
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:49,500
the working group is done some working

309
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,760
groups have lasted quite a long period

310
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time because every time we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

311
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,410
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> done something else gets new</font>

312
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,020
gets added to the dead to the thing but

313
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,750
with the things that are more focused

314
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,670
this is a goal to get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> started go</font>

315
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:07,080
through the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get it done so</font>

316
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:09,890
give me a half second to grab some water

317
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,890
if you would please

318
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:20,000
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually really need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to look</font>

319
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:21,740
to to know this but the guys who with

320
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,500
solid dots are generally people are

321
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:28,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in the running of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF or</font>

322
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,710
something along those lines so these

323
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:34,580
guys the green dot guys you should be

324
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:36,800
aware of because they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ones who</font>

325
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">can help you with local stuff here they</font>

326
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:42,709
are involved in dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font>

327
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:45,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and things along those lines but</font>

328
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,300
almost any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these people can answer</font>

329
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:49,579
the question of where do i go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find an</font>

330
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,930
answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they may not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

331
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:54,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">answer the question but they can answer</font>

332
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:56,510
the question define the question so keep

333
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,250
these guys in mind these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first</font>

334
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">people you want to talk to they</font>

335
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,600
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> know something about how the</font>

336
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF is set up go talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them first if</font>

337
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:09,650
you can't in many cases eldri they may

338
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:12,950
drag you over to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Secretariat or</font>

339
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,350
something along those lines so speaking

340
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:18,290
the Secretariat there are a number of

341
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,520
organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> support and help the</font>

342
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:24,800
IETF most important one are these guys

343
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:26,600
the Secretariat you're going to see the

344
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,599
wandering around they've got secretary

345
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:36,590
on the back black shirts sorry I didn't

346
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:40,010
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are key to our</font>

347
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:41,960
success they have been intent in some

348
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:45,380
cases I believe Marsh has been with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

349
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:47,480
for 15 or 20 years they provide

350
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,990
continuity they provide support for the

351
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,580
organization and they also and they're

352
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:57,889
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones who figure out how to get the</font>

353
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:00,889
meetings actually working hey I Anna

354
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,790
if you are you don't need to know you

355
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,489
don't necessarily need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know about</font>

356
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,319
this right now but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my guess is later on</font>

357
00:16:04,489 --> 00:16:08,299
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing an internet draft or</font>

358
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:10,399
you're working in the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font>

359
00:16:08,299 --> 00:16:13,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably end up having to talk to them</font>

360
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,759
again they have office hours here

361
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,869
there's a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> out by registration</font>

362
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,029
they're nice people go by they have

363
00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:23,329
candy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful thing actually so does</font>

364
00:16:20,029 --> 00:16:26,149
the RFC editor our<font color="#CCCCCC"> C editor is response</font>

365
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:28,638
we're actually taking your miss formed

366
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:32,029
ideas and paper and turning it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

367
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,369
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be appreciated any</font>

368
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:36,230
publication in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world we have good</font>

369
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:37,939
quality good professional quality

370
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:41,779
editors<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are involved in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

371
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:44,329
process so again<font color="#E5E5E5"> worthwhile to say hi</font>

372
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,589
chat about what's going on if you are

373
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:53,229
getting to the point of wanting to

374
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:56,359
publish something all good people um

375
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:59,989
Heather is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC editor this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is her</font>

376
00:16:56,359 --> 00:17:03,110
staff here<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh Neville is about to leave</font>

377
00:16:59,989 --> 00:17:07,669
he is the independent stream submission

378
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,439
of editor on the RFC series is<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font>

379
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:11,720
for comments the reason is called that

380
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,549
as something<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do with some something</font>

381
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:17,059
going back to nineteen sixty-nine if you

382
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:21,500
can believe that it was never really

383
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:24,309
designed as a publication<font color="#E5E5E5"> see series on</font>

384
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,470
this scale but it has ended up there

385
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:30,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">Neville is the guy who deals with things</font>

386
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:33,649
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily IETF related</font>

387
00:17:30,409 --> 00:17:38,659
but should go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RSC series so you</font>

388
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:41,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">get things that are on the edge of what</font>

389
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:43,730
the Iowa IETF wants to work on but we

390
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,908
don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> art</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it isn't going to</font>

391

392
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:51,470
is the guy who is the gatekeeper for

393
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:58,120
that along with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent</font>

00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:58,120
submission<font color="#E5E5E5"> editorial board so so um</font>

395
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,720
actually I'm doing much<font color="#E5E5E5"> faster than I</font>

396
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:08,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">was planning on um there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a bunch of</font>

397
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:12,500
useful documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got the print</font>

398
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:16,010
outs here the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tao the IETF has been</font>

399
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:18,679
around for oh I don't know 15 20 years

400
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,260
it and it's been edited a couple of

401
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:22,970
different times it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of the</font>

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,450
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the IETF the culture of the</font>

403
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:30,260
IETF how to get cutting around in it on

404
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:32,390
it's a good document to read some way

405
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,750
some way midway through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the middle of</font>

406
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:39,790
this this meeting meaning wiki<font color="#CCCCCC"> um this</font>

407
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:43,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the place to go for things about um</font>

408
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,840
that are locally significant on one of

409
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:47,449
the more important things off<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

410
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,510
meeting wiki is the departures page if

411
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,280
you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> off to fly on a particular</font>

412
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:54,320
day and you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody to share a cab</font>

413
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:57,620
with you can post<font color="#E5E5E5"> your departure and</font>

414
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,439
make arrangements<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go there and then</font>

415
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,570
the edge you tutorials there are more

416
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:06,920
tutorials and I then I can shake a stick

417
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:10,309
at with respect to what the IETF does

418
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:12,890
including the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> newcomers</font>

419
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:16,520
tutorial which was all which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> more of</font>

420
00:19:12,890 --> 00:19:19,100
a history<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the IETF as opposed to this</font>

421
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:25,100
which is sort of your quick guide to

422
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:26,689
survival<font color="#CCCCCC"> lissa bliss there are lots of</font>

00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:29,629
mailing lists in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF if you haven't</font>

424
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:32,000
noticed that already well I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

425
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:35,630

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,610
for the meeting one dealing with

429
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:46,639
newcomers one dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with any attending</font>

it our<font color="#E5E5E5"> Secretariat so it's just way of</font>

436
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,330
getting information I believe this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

437
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">the correct location for in the network</font>

438
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:07,970
information um it changes occasionally

439
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:10,850
and for some reason they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this</font>

440
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:15,470
page up until almost until about

441
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:19,399
now so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I kind of guess at this but we'll</font>

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">research task force the I RTF deals with</font>

446
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,880
things that may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be real quite yet it</font>

447
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,410
is for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> the late hour and</font>

448
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,610
networking was about how do you deal

449
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:42,590
with interplanetary networks for example

450
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:44,209

00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:52,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">research forum which deals with</font>

454
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,750
cryptography and getting things approved

455
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:59,750

pretty good here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the only ones i</font>

517
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:50,250
actually found when i went looking on we

518
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:53,158
do have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> protests going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on just be</font>

519
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:55,710
aware if you get<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of this area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

520
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,019
think most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far like two</font>

521
00:23:55,710 --> 00:24:00,870
miles away<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we should you should be</font>

522
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:03,210
fine on this one the second<font color="#CCCCCC"> one was</font>

523
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:05,039
weird but it was something<font color="#CCCCCC"> i got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

524
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,380
three different websites<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be aware</font>

525
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">that there are some controls on public</font>

526
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,049
speech in the country especially with

527
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:15,269
respect to North Korea and finally

528
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:17,580
watch your step watch your stuff we

529
00:24:15,269 --> 00:24:19,799
don't want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose your bags we</font>

530
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:25,789
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind using computers we are mostly</font>

531
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:25,789
an honest group but sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal where</font>

532
00:24:28,419 --> 00:24:32,649
okay so this would normally be the end

533
00:24:31,149 --> 00:24:34,689
of the presentation in fact it was the

534
00:24:32,649 --> 00:24:37,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of the presentation last time and I</font>

535
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:43,090
really went through this very fast sorry

536
00:24:37,299 --> 00:24:44,710
um networking okay I'm glad you all

537
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:47,730
mostly stayed off your computer's some

538
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:51,309
of you didn't I see you out there okay

539
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:53,649
the IETF runs the network in this hotel

540
00:24:51,309 --> 00:24:55,480
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire time is here unlike any</font>

541
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:57,039
other conference I've seen we basically

542
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,350
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the entire thing everything</font>

543
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,389
top to bottom belongs to us the only

544
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,549
thing we can't swap out or the ape are

545
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:06,639
the access points on the on the guest

546
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:08,889
floors but the back end of it is we have

547
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:12,219
a network that is pretty much second to

548
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:17,379
none with respect to backhaul so you're

549
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:20,889
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see a wireless SIDS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf IETF</font>

550
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:24,549
hotel IETF vb6 only things on those

551
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:26,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">lines the non-secure ones you just</font>

552
00:25:24,549 --> 00:25:28,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect and you're good to go the secure</font>

553
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:29,799
one like IETF hotel doesn't actually

554
00:25:28,269 --> 00:25:35,259
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> password or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have any</font>

555
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:38,710
security IETF is actually you<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in and</font>

556
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:43,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'll pop up at wpa2 the and it'll be</font>

557
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:45,220
user ID I<font color="#E5E5E5"> ETF password IETF pretty</font>

558
00:25:43,029 --> 00:25:46,840
straightforward so you shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

559
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:49,629
any problem getting on if you do have

560
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:54,840
problems the terminal room has people

561
00:25:49,629 --> 00:26:00,540
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help you and they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are on the huh</font>

562

563
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:04,379
so if you have problems getting

564
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,550
connected go there there will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be there's</font>

568
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:16,170

mentioned a couple of sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of times</font>

644
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:42,790
don't present stupid ideas you know

645
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:46,010
don't so I was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> curious</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

646
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:47,770
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of incidence rate is of companies</font>

647
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,750
trying to push a stupid idea with the

648
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:52,250
attack and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

649
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,900
countermeasures and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> often does</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

650
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,360
come up with the sensitivity level I

651
00:29:53,900 --> 00:30:00,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean um over the 30 years I've been</font>

652
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing this it's it about every two years</font>

653
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:05,960
you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you get a kind of an impulse</font>

654
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:07,750
of those types of things mostly it<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

655
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,070
happens and then it goes away

656
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:14,240
occasionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> we get strange things like</font>

657
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:17,389
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITU versus the IETF with mpls for</font>

658
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:22,640
example but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I IV let me let me let</font>

659
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:26,470
me say this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean to say you</font>

660
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,470
shouldn't bring up an<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea because</font>

661
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:35,419
sometimes sometimes just having that

662
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:38,570
conversation about you know is this and

663
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:41,930
is this a stupid idea is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful thing</font>

664
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:44,090
for people to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have presenting the same</font>

665
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:45,980
thing over<font color="#E5E5E5"> and over as I think Einstein</font>

666
00:30:44,090 --> 00:30:47,179
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you know doing the same thing</font>

667
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,300
over again and expecting a different

668
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,220
result is insanity sometimes applies to

669
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,200
the IETF and sometimes we just need to

670
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,310
remember the history and sometimes you

671
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,600
just need to find the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

672
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,760
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> who know what's going on about</font>

673
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:02,750
that so again don't be afraid to bring

674
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:05,410
an idea forward just be just be prepared

675
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:09,770
to figure to defend it well technically

676
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:11,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay anyone else</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up please and to the</font>

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,219
need to need worry about for this

686
