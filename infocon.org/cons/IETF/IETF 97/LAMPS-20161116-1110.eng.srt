17
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:51,800
come back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them hoping that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their you</font>

18
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">know one of the long elevator</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cues</font>

19
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:15,979
I told my last meeting I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was presenting</font>

20
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:22,909
first I guess was right um<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay next</font>

21
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:26,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">sector so I think we've managed to get</font>

22
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:28,849
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> almost everything that needs to</font>

23
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:31,599
be done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> these documents there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

24
00:05:28,849 --> 00:05:35,498
a couple of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I wanted to</font>

25
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:39,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">double-check consensus on as it were um</font>

26
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:42,650
the first is there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple people</font>

27
00:05:39,139 --> 00:05:45,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">who wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to list AES 192 in the</font>

28
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:51,169
mandatory well in in the in explicit

29
00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:53,509
must should may list um i think that i

30
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:55,878
saw enough people who were against that

31
00:05:53,509 --> 00:06:00,139
position to say that the consensus of

32
00:05:55,879 --> 00:06:02,060
the mailing list was not to do so um if

33
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:08,680
anyone believes that is wrong they need

34
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:14,330
to let me know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I inserted text on</font>

35
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:17,120
deterministic ecdsa um which I think

36
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:21,649
said use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have it because it's</font>

37
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:26,810
much much better um if anyone objects to

38
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:30,319
that text<font color="#E5E5E5"> um please do so otherwise it</font>

39
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:34,039
will stay so Jim what I think the text

40
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,649
says is that signers should use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but</font>

41
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:42,199
validators can't tell whether the sign

42
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:45,110
are used it or not right um I'm not too

43
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,229
sure it says the second okay that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

44
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:55,009
true statement because it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

45
00:06:48,229 --> 00:06:56,180
should use it to signers yes okay right

46
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,210
if you can figure out how to how to

47
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:10,560
check on the receiving end<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll give you</font>

48
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:17,190
a math prize um somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> asked for</font>

49
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:21,650
um inclusion of p38 for as they should

50
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:26,340
in the document on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the basis that</font>

51
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:29,940
there's a large amount of government and

52
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:32,429
commercial people who end up needing

53
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:37,230
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a sweet be protocol</font>

54
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:39,450
um I have pushed back on this using much

55
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:44,310
the same logic that I put it was used to

56
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:46,500
push back on aes 192 which is yes it's

57
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:51,450
there but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really something that</font>

58
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:56,520
we're saying is if it's as you notice

59
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:59,789
let me rephrase this doing so we tend to

60
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,389
bless a government position and that's

61
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:08,280
not an ietf thing and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear to</font>

62
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:11,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">me that there is a reason to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put this in</font>

63
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,460
the document as the industries that need

64
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:17,870
it will push on provide on providers of

65
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:25,530
email clients to provide it anyway I

66
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:27,530
think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I want to say um this</font>

67
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:30,900
does anyone want to say anything

68
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:33,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting at this point in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time so on</font>

69
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,909
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will start with the chair so</font>

70
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:39,959
on the list I've been the one advocating

71
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:42,000
it does is there anyone else in the room

72
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:51,060
who supports the inclusion of it as a

73
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:56,250
should level requirement Eddie<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cooley so</font>

74
00:08:51,060 --> 00:09:01,650
as the yeah and I say cuz I'm all over

75
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:03,690
Mike can't doesn't move um it's okay so

76
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:12,959
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not calling it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> CN SI by the way</font>

77
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:14,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sweeping um true so we would like it</font>

78
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,949
did you can we can we now call it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

79
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,839
keep them from part of my business of

80
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,839
them so what no

81
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:35,488
no um so we would like it but if you

82
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:40,119
don't see fit to put it in then huh

83
00:09:35,489 --> 00:09:42,489
you're right well go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sean do it so</font>

84
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:44,589
um I guess Shawn Turner I guess it just

85
00:09:42,489 --> 00:09:47,199
seems odd that we do have this group of

86
00:09:44,589 --> 00:09:49,539
people who might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the largest users of</font>

87
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:51,419
this and you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> male like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

88
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:53,559
put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in there it just seems weird I</font>

89
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,209
mean they've got a profile so

90
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:57,399
technically you could leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out and</font>

91
00:09:55,209 --> 00:09:59,079
say yeah I know we don't it's not part

92
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:00,579
of the base standard and then you know

93
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the people that need to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

94
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:04,839
go whack them but it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> really weird</font>

95
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:07,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I mean really it's I mean it's</font>

96
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:09,100
usg<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's other people in Europe I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> manage</font>

97
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,369
people in other continents it's not just

98
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:17,259
us G so it seems weird that you would

99
00:10:11,369 --> 00:10:18,579
not at least mention this somehow and so

100
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:23,589
we've said not to use the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

101
00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:26,559
right the smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> one nah what we waitin</font>

102
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:28,600
it which how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> smaller</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> soapy 256 is</font>

103
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:33,189
sort of off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right I'm not 252</font>

104
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,929
page 256 is a must<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok yeah that's the</font>

105
00:10:33,189 --> 00:10:40,179
most so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it if it</font>

106
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:43,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> released I should this one so anyone</font>

107
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:43,980
else that wants to speak for or against

108
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:57,369
Tim lunch after being sign on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok ok</font>

109
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:04,259
um I will confer with we will take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

110
00:10:57,369 --> 00:11:08,949
to the lenses um last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sha 3 i'm</font>

111
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:11,649
at this point in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm seeing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zero</font>

112
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:15,599
real support in the IETF for doing sha-3

113
00:11:11,649 --> 00:11:19,449
on anything and I'm perfectly willing to

114
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,389
stay with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> position on for this</font>

115
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:26,819
document is there anyone who thinks

116
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:26,819
that's a bad position

117
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:46,400
nah not seeing anyone run to the mic to

118
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:49,010
say otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so front from that</font>

119
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:51,260
list there that basically says we've got

120
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:55,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">one thing to slaughter to decide and</font>

121
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:58,400
everything else stays put ok so we're

122
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:02,329
cleft um I need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a really short</font>

123
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:05,569
paragraph on padding which says you know

124
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:08,090
you may want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it um but</font>

125
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:13,270
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably a huge issue for us</font>

126
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:16,130
mime<font color="#CCCCCC"> it per se</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um and I need to</font>

127
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:20,300
regenerate examples and try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some</font>

128
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:24,290
verra verification of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm debating</font>

129
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">just stealing some Paul Hoffman examples</font>

130
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:27,730
for everything's that the authenticated

131
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:31,790
date is so that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only 1i have to</font>

132
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:34,940
generate<font color="#E5E5E5"> from scratch um if anyone</font>

133
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:37,849
thinks that's a bad idea let me know if

134
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:41,270
anyone is willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do validation of</font>

135
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,360
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things let me know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awfulest so i</font>

136
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:46,340
can send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to you and say they're</font>

137
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,990
right i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can probably get Peter</font>

138
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">gottman to do validations but not</font>

139
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:51,350
positive yet so are these examples that

140
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:53,870
you're putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this draft are</font>

141
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,780
examples you're putting in the 158 page

142
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,730
s why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm examples draft these are</font>

143
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:01,089
examples i'm putting in this draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

144
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">great</font>

145

okay said okay I'm done<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Alexei</font>

146
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:47,339
Europe right I'm doing a very quick

147
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:55,019
update on the internationalized email

148
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:58,139
addresses in a pickax certificates my

149
00:13:55,019 --> 00:14:02,069
co-editor did a very good job he did two

150
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:04,470
updates basically we received I think

151
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:07,829
three reviews one from Ross one from

152
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:12,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shawn and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one from gym or something like</font>

153
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:17,909
that I believe all of the comments were

154
00:14:12,359 --> 00:14:24,299
addressed basically clarification on

155
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:28,129
where the new other name form is allowed

156
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,598
in issuer out name so it is allowed

157
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:36,179
without there was no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason to disallow</font>

158
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:37,949
it disallow wildcard characters some

159
00:14:36,179 --> 00:14:39,899
clarification on encoding byte order

160
00:14:37,949 --> 00:14:46,049
mark character unicode characters

161
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:47,849
disallowed a send one module some oils

162
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:50,848
for temporarily allocated and then

163
00:14:47,849 --> 00:14:57,599
deallocate it and that TBD so this will

164
00:14:50,849 --> 00:15:01,639
be resolved by<font color="#CCCCCC"> anna so i want to say one</font>

165
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:05,009
thing on that point the other name<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID</font>

166
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:08,489
way just put it the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> available one</font>

167
00:15:05,009 --> 00:15:10,470
into the internet draft so since<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

168
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:13,379
happen to be the iono expert on that

169
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:15,509
registry i<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually made that allocation</font>

170
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:18,449
so that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone implements from the</font>

171
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:19,500
internet draft or the RFC they'll be

172
00:15:18,449 --> 00:15:21,390
implementing the same

173
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,150
point I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'd be really bad if</font>

174
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:27,390
that changed yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that it should</font>

175
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:30,780
have been a DVD but he didn't do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

176
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:33,870
and so I right I saved us from from

177
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:36,990
potential early implementers doing the

178
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,930
wrong thing yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for</font>

179
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:42,210
that I did it<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain offline to a way</font>

180
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:49,680
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> n allocations typically happens</font>

181
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:52,080
later but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know yeah I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can</font>

182
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,160
show the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> slide which basically says</font>

183
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:58,290
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're done I don't know of any</font>

184
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,980
open issues there is no TBD in the

185
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:08,790
document as far as I remember does

186
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:12,510
anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to raise aleinu issues does</font>

187
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:18,000
anyone think this document is not ready

188
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:19,860
for working group last call<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then by</font>

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,170
the end of the week<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will begin a</font>

190
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">two-week working group last call thank</font>

191
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,439
you

192
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:37,679
Sean so I guess just for completeness I

193
00:16:35,819 --> 00:16:40,889
guess PhD in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> chatroom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> did say that</font>

194
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:44,720
he thought not including sha-3 and the S

195
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:47,309
Mon specs is a bad idea so just want to

196
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,600
key thought we should include

197
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:51,209
include I think of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's saying</font>

198
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,269
which should include sha-3 so right<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I</font>

199
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:59,279
just want to wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out with which</font>

200
00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:00,660
signature algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right hi my</font>

201
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,189
name is Shawn Turner and I'm in the pink

202
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:07,529
box so why am I<font color="#CCCCCC"> here um I asked even</font>

203
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:09,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Farrell 280 sponsor this draft and he</font>

204
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:12,388
said that's awesome please go get some

205
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,939
comments go to lamps so here I am next

206
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:16,469
all the links actually go to things so

207
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,600
what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> est right so he is T is an</font>

208
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:23,059
enrollment over secure transport it's

209
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:23,059
the last RFC that came out of pickax um

210
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,580
leave the joke up there basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

211
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:32,580
is to allow<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to do enrollment and</font>

212
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:33,809
get certs and you know server generated

213
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,320
certificates over in HTTPS connection

214
00:17:33,809 --> 00:17:38,908
and it's getting posts and it's just a

215
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,408
collection of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one for CA certs</font>

216
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:42,929
there's one for doing simple enrollment

217
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:44,580
which is tens and sevens simple rien

218
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:46,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">rolls the same thing server key gen</font>

219
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:49,279
allows you to generate ask the server to

220
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:52,049
generate you the<font color="#CCCCCC"> public/private key</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pair</font>

221
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:54,240
full CMC which is another interface to

222
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:56,370
do you know the full CMC dance that you

223
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:00,510
could do and then their csr attributes

224
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:03,899
which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> added to allow the DST server</font>

225
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:05,760
to provide something to the client they

226
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,889
can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> use to include in one of the</font>

227
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,899
enrollment requests so an example of

228
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:12,389
essentially is<font color="#E5E5E5"> https you know</font>

229
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:15,330
example.com well known / EST and then

230
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:19,408
like this the service name so what do I

231
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do stand all the protocols you</font>

232
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:22,320
give me a framework and I do some stuff

233
00:18:21,029 --> 00:18:24,240
so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to extend it the key point</font>

234
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,399
here is this an extension it's not it

235
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,809
updates I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that every EST</font>

236
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:29,760
server that's out on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the planet there</font>

237
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:32,070
are a few need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of these things</font>

238
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,500
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some additional services and</font>

239
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,700
some people could adopt them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

240
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually talked with some people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

241
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,539
Harkins is not here he he thought some

242
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,250
of it was a little interesting some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

243
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:42,990
it actually implemented in Yokohama like

244
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:43,590
on the fly fairly quickly so that was

245
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,809
nice

246
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:48,059
and panels at Cisco I guess I also talks

247
00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:49,950
to unfortunately butcher his last name

248
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:52,529
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't try it he said some of it was</font>

249
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:54,870
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some of that he meant me so I'm</font>

250
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:56,250
completely understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not all the</font>

251
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:58,168
services are universally loved by

252
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,000
everybody but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you put</font>

253
00:18:58,169 --> 00:19:01,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">them enough of them together I got</font>

254
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,880
enough use cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be used</font>

255
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,799
so next so first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is</font>

256
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,960
extend the existing server key gen in

257
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,730
three ways the first thing I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

258
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,669
is that there are some additional CMS

259
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,950
content types that allow you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> return</font>

260
00:19:13,669 --> 00:19:18,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to allow you rap rap key packages in</font>

261
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:20,490
additional thing so one of them

262
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:22,080
essentially is right now you could do

263
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:25,049
naked which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is essentially just returned</font>

264
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,610
in a Kiki over TLS which is good for

265
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:28,918
most scenarios but not for those that

266
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,449
are slightly more paranoid um the next

267
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,360
thing is you can use cryptid dated or

268
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,970
envelope data well there's this RC 760

269
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,168
32 which is encrypted key package so

270
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:38,760
that's useful if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do this</font>

271
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:40,559
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> called</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CMS content constraints</font>

272
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">which you can put in a certificate to</font>

273
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,010
limit the person that's allowed to

274
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,990
authorize or originate these packages

275
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:48,379
what they can do so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that you</font>

276
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,500
would like essentially link the two um

277
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:55,320
the next thing is that actually um

278
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,760
because we also have a way to return

279
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,200
receipts and errors we'd like to have

280
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:59,730
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ability to return</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these back to the</font>

281
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,159
server so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that when you give</font>

282
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">them a package you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can say you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

283
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,520
please return this receipt with an

284
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,820
attribute if there's an error hey guess

285
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,158
what you post back the receipt or air

286
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:13,049
and you do that with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a post and well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

287
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:14,760
had to figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out a way to someplace to</font>

288
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:17,158
put this so essentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> what i did was i</font>

289
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:20,039
extended the syntax from server key gen

290
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,140
to someplace called return so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

291
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,850
generic because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's post receipts and</font>

292
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,559
errors<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could have had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one for each but</font>

293
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:28,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">i figured</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since it's one thing it's a</font>

294
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:30,990
post you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go there um and the</font>

295
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:32,610
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think dan and</font>

296
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,190
panels like was actually returning it to

297
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:36,539
kcs 12 we love that everyone would use

298
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:39,330
the standard formats that we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

299
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:41,789
with but keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> pkc s12 is still used and</font>

300
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,110
so we're just going with the flow it's

301
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:46,590
just add another<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that actually be</font>

302
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:47,908
used so you know we tried our best and

303
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:50,129
everybody was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like hey that's really</font>

304
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:53,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">great but p12 is kind of what gets used</font>

305
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:56,799
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> given up so next</font>

306
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,570
and then all of the new services so the

307
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea essentially is this pal thing and</font>

308
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:03,070
this is where I'm going to duck it's an

309
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:05,200
XML formatted file that essentially is a

310
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:07,178
flat file with a bunch of entries that

311
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,490
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> included there's a iono registered</font>

312
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,309
type there's a name for the thing

313
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,590
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pointer in it and a date and a</font>

314
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,629
size and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically you have this file</font>

315
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:18,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can just you would you get</font>

316
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,139
pointed at it through some a priori

317
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:21,700
syntax and you would essentially just

318
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:23,289
walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through this file to know all the</font>

319
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,419
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get so the first thing you</font>

320
00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,429
would get is like your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ca certs then you</font>

321
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:29,380
can maybe get firmware tam stuff if that

322
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,450
wasn't interested um then you could get

323
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">some CR</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l's and then he get some skip do</font>

324
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,880
your enrollment and you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these</font>

325
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,899
things in at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the day after</font>

326
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,730
you've walked through this whole file

327
00:21:34,899 --> 00:21:38,918
you're ready to go you're pretty much

328
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:40,600
ginned up and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start</font>

329
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:42,370
communicating<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

330
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,658
the next step is so there might be some

331
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:45,158
other way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this but this is the</font>

332
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,190
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> the dan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> implemented kind of on the</font>

333
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:49,809
flop fairly quickly so distribute I have

334
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,419
some slides later if we have time which

335
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:54,120
we might or if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> bored we can just</font>

336
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:57,549
get them and you can read them later um

337
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,379
distribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> EE certs so this this service</font>

338
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:01,149
would allow you to essentially say hey I

339
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,100
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these devices are really along</font>

340
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:05,199
going to talk to a couple of people so

341
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,580
just distribute certs that you know that

342
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,200
the device is<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually going to talk to</font>

343
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,760
so say you're setting up a thing in a

344
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,159
house or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and it's only going</font>

345
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,570
to talk to for the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could give</font>

346
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">it those for cert so it doesn't have to</font>

347
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,600
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go find them later it's just</font>

348
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:18,130
already got<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so when it goes to</font>

349
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,250
communicate it can use that it can use

350
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:23,740
them to just verify or decrypt stuff um

351
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">crl zan day or else I know there's a way</font>

352
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that that you can just</font>

353
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">straight</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up pull</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cl's and ariel's</font>

354
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">from cas but you could also just use</font>

355
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:36,158
this mechanist ribbit um symmetric keys

356
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:38,380
again it's another key format that we

357
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,090
defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the IHF and the idea is that</font>

358
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:42,519
hey it might be good to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd</font>

359
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:44,230
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this est thing to</font>

360
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,260
distribute them so the idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

361
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:48,460
essentially the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the client would connect</font>

362
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the server and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the server would say</font>

363
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,970
hey look here all these symmetric keys

364
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:54,459
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in battle with</font>

365
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:56,139
download them and again it's CMS wrapped

366
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,940
and you can encrypt sign there's a whole

367
00:22:56,139 --> 00:22:59,590
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know various ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

368
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:02,169
can wrap these things to provide various

369
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,820
levels of security none if you want or a

370
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,059
whole bunch and then we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a more fun</font>

371
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:08,529
ones like firm or it is an RFC standard

372
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:09,850
actually people that use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it so the idea</font>

373
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:11,830
is that we'd like to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to support</font>

374
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,899
those people that could use it damps

375
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:15,759
another one and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of course all of</font>

376
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:18,639
these things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know require</font>

377
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,019
that my TF protocols do like return

378
00:23:18,639 --> 00:23:21,459
receipts and errors we included those

379
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:22,960
and for completeness were like<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

380
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,879
so we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to support</font>

381
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,169
returning those so that's where this you

382
00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:30,248
know service name / return<font color="#CCCCCC"> with posts so</font>

383
00:23:29,169 --> 00:23:31,899
the difference is all the ones on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

384
00:23:30,249 --> 00:23:35,259
left or gets the ones on the writer

385
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:38,248
posts<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sean yesterday we had an</font>

386
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:41,980
interesting discussion and TLS about

387
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:46,419
Sutton groups in data centers that might

388
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:48,039
use preacher keys so is this a symmetric

389
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:51,429
keys thing appropriate to solve that

390
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:53,679
problem or is it orthogonal it could be

391
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:55,059
used so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is if they were to set</font>

392
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,220
up their servers to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to go pull</font>

393
00:23:55,059 --> 00:24:01,559
this thing you could you could see that

394
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,909
that could be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution interesting and</font>

395
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:05,019
back up and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is just kind of more if</font>

396
00:24:03,909 --> 00:24:06,460
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to go to the next slide it just</font>

397
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:08,980
shows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the format of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the pal and</font>

398
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:10,960
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> I duck because it's XML but it's</font>

399
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you know it's a pal with a</font>

400
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,889
bunch of messages it's got a type and

401
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:15,999
it's from an eye on a registered thing

402
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:17,168
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have on the right and</font>

403
00:24:15,999 --> 00:24:18,309
there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of them so we kind</font>

404
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:21,700
of broke it down the ones that i've been

405
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">using um you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PAL could</font>

406
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,119
be like a million long maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

407
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:26,379
want it a million long you can clip it

408
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,990
and make it short so you can have one

409
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:30,668
pal point to another pal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then all</font>

410
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,070
the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

411
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:34,419
date format the size of the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

412
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:36,668
then some info about the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

413
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:38,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're pulling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> down it's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

414
00:24:36,669 --> 00:24:40,149
format for amazing but it's like a

415
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,669
manifest basically yeah that's probably

416
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:44,379
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> better name for apathy is it's</font>

417
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,690
commonly used somewhere or was it

418
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:50,619
commonly used there are people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

419
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:54,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">using it yes and the same you didn't</font>

420
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:59,830
invent it I mean no<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok I mean yes I</font>

421
00:24:54,460 --> 00:25:01,570
invented it but no it's yeah it's a

422
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:03,279
manifest basically it's not there's not

423
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:05,980
a standardized manifest format but it is

424
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,240
a what you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use Jason yeah</font>

425
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,289
so I need you guys say so I need

426
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody who's gonna ask me that yeah</font>

427
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:12,879
that's where all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cool kids are doing</font>

428
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:16,450
now um yeah I'm not apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

429
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:19,418
she bore I'm not cool and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting</font>

430
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:20,410
older um did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in XML this is obviously</font>

431
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the newest</font>

432
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:24,100
hang on the planet my kind of theory is

433
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,870
that I need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and so if other</font>

434
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,230
people want to do JSON that's great if

435
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:32,800
somebody can tell me how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow both</font>

436
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:34,900
but not require one and allow the client

437
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,760
to request what they get returned would

438
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:39,670
be great<font color="#CCCCCC"> but if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this MTI</font>

439
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,590
thing I'm gonna lose my<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

440
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">just need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to return this format and if</font>

441
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,480
it's JSON or XML I really just don't

442
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:48,280
care or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing I just need I</font>

443
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,960
need XML there other<font color="#E5E5E5"> people might like</font>

444
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,210
JSON is<font color="#E5E5E5"> there safe you know if you know</font>

445
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,510
as an art guy you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me what the</font>

446
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:58,800
right way to do this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is I was just</font>

447
00:25:55,510 --> 00:26:01,240
such as you're poking fun<font color="#CCCCCC"> t-that yeah I</font>

448
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:07,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought I asked just because I can I</font>

449
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:11,650
just because as I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> read your</font>

450
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">drafts can ask some ignorance so is</font>

451
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:17,320
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to discover which one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

452
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:19,210
new ones you support or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> or like do</font>

453
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,889
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support all of them or so</font>

454
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:22,660
the way I wrote it in sense there's none

455
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:24,640
of them are required<font color="#E5E5E5"> so they're all</font>

456
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:26,170
optional so the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that if you if</font>

457
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,490
you didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do the pal you could</font>

458
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,350
just skip the path you just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

459
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,180
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> e search you just add it so you as a</font>

460
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,760
client which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> no if you were to go um</font>

461
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,840
go to connect to it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't if you</font>

462
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,640
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to that thing you get an</font>

463
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,830
error basically so there's no<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

464
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,720
client will use one of these hands get

465
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,550
America ok get an area it's not awesome

466
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,570
i mean so there there is some grander

467
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,070
schemes where we could do some like

468
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:49,840
service discovery kind of thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

469
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:51,280
lot stuff that's just a bridge too far i

470
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,990
think for basically what i need to do

471
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,760
which is like here's some more stuff you

472
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:01,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">could get here's a list of things point</font>

473
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:01,710
to it go get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it um you go back two sides</font>

474
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:10,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sean gets skewered by the CMC author huh</font>

475
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:16,690
two slides wait for it<font color="#E5E5E5"> started started</font>

476
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:20,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure not one so distribute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source is</font>

477
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,510
basically this is get all sorts or get

478
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,610
whatever is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just hot air to know what</font>

479
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,650
everything so it's not any<font color="#CCCCCC"> root is not a</font>

480
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,750
new directory query mechanism it's a

481
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:30,550
mechanism which the ca who knows a

482
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,960
priori you're going to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these</font>

483
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:33,610
people here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some certs that you</font>

484
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,300
might like there they go so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

485
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,729
query mech

486
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:39,070
to be like hey I need search for

487
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">so-and-so it's the it's the EST server</font>

488
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:43,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving it is to give me a set of sorts</font>

489
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:45,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw in my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life thinking of is no</font>

490
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,469
publishing their issues yes give<font color="#CCCCCC"> me some</font>

491
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:50,080
bag it's again it's basically exactly

492
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,550
that it's a cert bag message because

493
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's CMS right so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these are</font>

494
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:57,480
basically except for the xml stuff or

495
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,250
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially CMS</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wrap stuff right um</font>

496
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:04,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">after this meeting i'm going to go to a</font>

497
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:10,090
core meeting core me and EST<font color="#CCCCCC"> is showing</font>

498
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:11,500
up in core really though yeah it's not a

499
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">crazy idea i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean when they first came</font>

500
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:15,340
out was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like whoopee doo it's just like</font>

501
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:16,659
CMC but you know it's that does there

502
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:17,860
are some other things that it does that

503
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,050
seem to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it fits some other</font>

504
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:22,929
people's deployment models for cert so

505
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:25,980
so so obviously they're gonna want to

506
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:28,960
you know change things at some point to

507
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,750
return some other things but obviously

508
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,090
they're gonna like get out roll over and

509
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:35,920
die if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed them xml well that's</font>

510
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:37,449
fine so my theory is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't so the</font>

511
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:41,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">PAL is the only one that's XML right the</font>

512
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,660
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that lcms blobs and if again you</font>

513
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,880
can tell me how I can query and get xml

514
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,710
and they can query and get json now to

515
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:50,650
be great and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know if you do that</font>

516
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:54,220
based on some oh you can ask for cut you

517
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:57,370
can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> one do pal one do pal Jay son</font>

518
00:28:54,220 --> 00:29:00,270
doing do pal sure you could do action

519
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:02,409
format equally yes I guess you do that

520
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,540
yeah so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> could do that that'd be</font>

521
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:06,100
great and then just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like you can</font>

522
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:07,659
actually agree on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote-unquote</font>

523
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,610
schema but it can't be a schema cuz<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

524
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">JSON cuz Jason doesn't have schema but</font>

525
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,550
right but they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically a great day</font>

526
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:15,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">they actually wanted to refresh your</font>

527
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:17,080
pebble<font color="#CCCCCC"> baby yeah seaboard JSON whatever</font>

528
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:22,660
will make up a new format<font color="#E5E5E5"> called Sean I</font>

529
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:25,120
Sean hey is anyone I shot Sean Leonard

530
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,520
um so yeah just too although it sounds

531
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,199
like some of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML versus JSON vs</font>

532
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:34,030
zebra or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a little facetious</font>

533
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:37,570
this exact same issue of a type

534
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:39,420
negotiation has come up in net comp and

535
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:42,189
yang and they have an approach of

536
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,810
negotiating internet media type so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

537
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,820
would say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so but you know what you</font>

538
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just use a very similar approach</font>

539
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:54,129
over HTTP over HTTP over HTTP rest conf

540
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:56,500
just use HTTP content negotiation I

541
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,800
think it's accept header<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we just</font>

542
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:01,180
say except and I the format the format

543
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,919
say cuz<font color="#E5E5E5"> that works I mean that's</font>

544
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:04,540
basically what i wrote this and was like

545
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,920
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hell i knew i was gonna get zinc</font>

546
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,990
this so it's like how do I get out of

547
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,610
this box<font color="#CCCCCC"> Liz oh if you guys</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

548
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:12,700
solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could go look at him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

549
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:15,399
don't need annoying thing from reskin

550
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">face they sort of said clients needs to</font>

551
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:21,160
support both JSON and XML and so it was

552
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:23,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">suppose just one so I i would rather if</font>

553
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to recommend one you know</font>

554
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:28,690
recommend one don't recommend to all

555
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:30,010
right oh you know make 11 mandatory to

556
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:31,870
implement and everyone is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

557
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:33,070
must if it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm okay because</font>

558
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:35,469
there are times we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can just be like</font>

559
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:37,570
candy that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> box doesn't do that so</font>

560
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,190
that's life<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright cool that is</font>

561
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,149
actually really valuable input because I

562
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:49,360
didn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to do that at all so</font>

563
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:52,510
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not in the charter of lamps but</font>

564
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:56,409
Stephen kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of said go here so John</font>

565
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:58,440
came here so what I'm going to do is if

566
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:07,300
you think this work should go forward

567
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:09,040
please send an email to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephen the next</font>

slide is kind of more of a this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

569
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft right so it's an eye chart</font>

570
00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:13,450
so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is you know what you</font>

571
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:14,919
could do if you have the pile so

572
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,810
essentially you do a get to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> PAL</font>

573
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,220
and then you were<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like I said walk</font>

574
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:20,050
through the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing so I just</font>

575
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,190
provides you more information about you

576
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:23,649
know what's in the get and all the

577
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:26,980
fields and it's it's basically like an

578
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:28,570
eye chart and it's in the draft so all

579
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,430
this stuff is already registered<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

580
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:35,710
no new iono registries at all and I

581
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:38,730
stuff it's using know so the only thing

582
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:42,850
you're doing then is extending the

583
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:44,620

whether I had to do that via Standish

585
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,580

622
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:07,500
go forward so one of the points I guess

623
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,299
is that like if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think that I'm with</font>

624
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,380
the biggest idiot on the planet like now

625
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:12,240
would be a good time to hear that

626
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:13,650
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the problem with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

stupidest thing on the planet I know

00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:24,690
it's not the smartest thing on the

634
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:27,179
planet but it's also probably not the

635
