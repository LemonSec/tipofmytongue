Michael I went to present the status of

57
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:38,520
this draft thank you hi so as was

58
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,500
mentioned it's been in working group

59
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:47,130
last call<font color="#E5E5E5"> um prior to the or app just</font>

60
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,719
prior to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last ITF arm six men made</font>

61
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:52,440
some interesting changes which were very

62
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:53,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">helpful to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us arm in particular allows</font>

63
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,870
us to leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI</font>

64
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:01,010
in arm on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> assumption that they will</font>

65
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,750
not be processed whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means arm</font>

66
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,110
and you can go to six men and<font color="#E5E5E5"> enjoy that</font>

67
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">debate arm that the so that's really all</font>

68
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the most of that's changed in the</font>

69
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:17,010
past three<font color="#CCCCCC"> or four months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has been</font>

70
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,870
editorial clarifying of some terms we

71
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:20,039
had a lovely review from Peter thank you

72
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:24,360
very much about some of the things

73
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,300
they're still missing and um that's

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it again it is a long document</font>

75
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,270
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it takes a bit of effort to</font>

76
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:37,140
understand and there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some really</font>

77
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,719
good slides that we we had in the last

78
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:43,020
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last ITF if you need help because</font>

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,850
they're animated um and i really suggest

80
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,229
you take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it because it really</font>

81
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:48,960
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> define something has been missing</font>

82
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,220
in this working group is exactly what

83
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,250
the data plane looks like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

84
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:57,150
clarifies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deal that's</font>

85
00:06:53,250 --> 00:07:03,260
really it not a lot else to say we'd

86
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:05,370
like to publish it get it done<font color="#E5E5E5"> cummings</font>

87
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:10,020
anyone read it in this room yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

88
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:12,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow okay cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

89
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,020
got some questions they're good avocado

90
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,690
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> hobby my question is this this</font>

91
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:21,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision of leaving the rpi yes intact</font>

92
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,670
while moving it out of the network the

93
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,640
6lowpan network of whatever yeah so this

94
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,870
decision reduces the complexity as<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,030
understand you know after reading the

96
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:32,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">graph so far from there is there any</font>

97
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:37,679
like why was this decision i it's it's

98
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:41,820
it is possible for the the edge router

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,950
to remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpi header so why was this</font>

100
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,440
decision taken to just simply allow it

101
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,210
it's not possible for the edge router to

102
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,730
remove the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rpi header because headers</font>

103
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:54,390
may not be inserted or removed in

104
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:57,980
transit okay so so that's an important

105
00:07:54,390 --> 00:08:01,500
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not that rule is</font>

106
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:04,010
changed or not by by six men it has

107
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:07,330
until very recently been believed to be

108
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:11,050
it firm<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

109
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,240
that the the difficulty was that given

110
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,220
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't remove it at the edge and</font>

111
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:19,150
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the header has been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> marked as</font>

112
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,919
critical or it's a header<font color="#E5E5E5"> extension at</font>

113
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,020
hop-by-hop extension marked critical

114
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,990
given that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been marked critical</font>

115
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:29,639
then the next router that does not speak

116
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:32,320
understand it according to historical

117
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:34,529
understanding was intended was would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

118
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,950
be expected to drop the traffic

119
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:42,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore any traffic that unintended ly</font>

120
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:44,260
would be contained<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the downside is</font>

121
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:48,160
that of course we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send</font>

122
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:50,410
traffic the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole point of a mesh that's</font>

123
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,089
you know connected by IP is that you

124
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:58,029
might like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send traffic outside of</font>

125
00:08:52,089 --> 00:09:01,360
that mesh so arm in order to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

126
00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:03,310
remove it what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> discovered was that we</font>

127
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,740
have to put I PA p headers in which has

128
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:08,050
a significant cost and which we then

129
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:10,600
have figured out how to compress such

130
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,689
that we can remove them so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

131
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:17,019
we we realize that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not obligated</font>

132
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:19,300
to remove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> header then a number of</font>

133
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:24,310
scenarios where we require to put an IP

134
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:27,640
IP header in arm become uh not so

135
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:29,170
critical<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok and and that was that</font>

136
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,069
that's that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

137
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,709
it turns out there's some other

138
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:35,350
scenarios independent of sending traffic

139
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:38,170
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> quote internet if you have uh</font>

140
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,519
what are properly called hosts or

141
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:43,779
sometimes in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we can group we call</font>

142
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,260
nan RPL aware leaf nodes right those may

143
00:09:43,779 --> 00:09:49,750
not necessarily understand that header

144
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:52,839
and if we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send traffic to</font>

145
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:55,420
them then<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to know when to remove</font>

146
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:58,329
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> header and weird if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were faced</font>

147
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:01,529
with the difficulty<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in many modes</font>

148
00:09:58,329 --> 00:10:05,769
in particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> story mode we don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

149
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:09,430
what the node before the end header node

150
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:12,190
is and since<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that node we</font>

151
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:13,930
wind up having to put hop by hop IP IP

152
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,430
headers which means we have to remove

153
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:19,060
them at every hop and add them at every

154
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:21,279
hop<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so that's a bit of a pain in the</font>

155
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,589
ass it's complicated

156
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:29,649
code<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it seems dumb</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's redundant</font>

157
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:31,269
no one implements that and so in the end

158
00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:33,129
with this so what I document in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end</font>

159
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,069
does is it makes it clear you don't need

160
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:41,529
to remove them and at the end node will

161
00:10:36,069 --> 00:10:43,959
deal with them<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay right let's get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

162
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:47,439
mail that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a few things we just</font>

163
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:50,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">in flux and there is now the influence</font>

of the new<font color="#CCCCCC"> six flourish on coding which</font>

165
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,979
might actually change the deal a little

166
00:10:52,720 --> 00:11:00,420
bit first thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 46 man nothing is</font>

167
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:03,459
recast in stone i think the the

168
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,309
consensus right now is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> update</font>

169
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:08,920
of 2560 will not change anything

170
00:11:06,309 --> 00:11:10,689
dramatically because you just you have

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:13,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to interest energy you don't</font>

172
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:15,149

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the consensus about going</font>

176
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:28,839
arguments against inserting others don't

177
00:11:24,579 --> 00:11:32,079
necessarily apply to removing others so

178
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:34,990
um what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm getting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at is if you've got</font>

ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it still if the root can the</font>

182
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:48,839

00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:57,100

185

but if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way we design the</font>

that you can play this sort of trick for

192
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,439
cling remove addresses as you consume

193
00:12:18,069 --> 00:12:21,910
them right and the next thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you find</font>

194
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:22,959
and if you don't have in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the packet</font>

195
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:25,240
going out you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a rotting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">either the first thing you find if you</font>

have a packet which does not have a pin

we don't have IP in IP but we've gotten

200
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,910
our PR well if you look at the

201
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,840
compressed form

202
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:42,020
the FBI comes first which we tells you

203
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:44,720
that at the moment where you expand the

204
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:47,000

you could cut it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yeah and just just</font>

ignore it when going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet and</font>

209
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,850
the best practice should be don't do I

210
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:03,860
pinay p for a packet going out if you

211
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:10,490
know that's going out don't do IP<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

212
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:17,660
just to API but with at the root<font color="#E5E5E5"> snip it</font>

213
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:19,820
up so so that could happen I'm not

214
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,280
screwing with you and that the

215
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,610
documented says right now essentially

216
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:29,329
says don't do for upwards traffic don't

217
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,330
do IP and IP just do<font color="#E5E5E5"> RPI that's true for</font>

218
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:34,670
storing and non storing mode and that's

219
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,240
nice it's a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> transmit path for</font>

220
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,449
upwards traffic and the decision as<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

221
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,750
remove it or not is a decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

222
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:48,350
root which is probably more capable more

223
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:50,840
configurable and more upgradable so

224
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,240
that's that's uh on some sense a

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:55,250
decision by the operator to do that as

226
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,410
for the arguments for removing the

227
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,710
headers are probably not as strong as

228
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:03,350
inserting certainly one of the arguments

229
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,630
is that it breaks pathum to you is not

230
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:09,890
true that it breaks authentication

231
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,080
header is true on that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where this may</font>

232
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:16,340
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be relevant because it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not clear</font>

we're using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> H headers ever but there</font>

234
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,360
may be other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that matter so I'm</font>

235
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,310
comfortable with it is and I'm

236
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:26,060
uncomfortable the fact that we can send

237
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:29,780
them out to the internet and not break

238
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,089
the architecture as it is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

239
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a good scenario one of the</font>

00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions I know we did get from one of</font>

241
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:41,569
the reviewers somewhere was how we know

242
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,270
whether we're using this this

243
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,550
formulation or the other one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I know</font>

244
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,010
that the six<font color="#CCCCCC"> low rh got the same</font>

question

246
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,510
and essentially my answer as well we

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the six lower age is a is is</font>

you're doing it it's on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it</font>

00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:04,900
essentially if if if a node needs to

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,089
know whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not it can follow the</font>

254
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:13,360
some historical process then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

255
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,400
well if it's doing 60<font color="#E5E5E5"> rh header</font>

00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:20,380
should it should follow these rules and

258
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:24,000
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality whatever is doing</font>

as well and what past is<font color="#CCCCCC"> G now because</font>

it's in the RFC editor queue with the

those addresses so as to save energy etc

270
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:58,690
etc and there's a discussion in the

271
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:01,780
future RFC about the fact that it breaks

272

00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,980
is that it's the role by 2460 that if

you want to reverse the routing either

yeah but but so far we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes that's</font>

285
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,210
true but as<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon as you get that I agree</font>

286
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">with effectively the rules for removing</font>

287
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:41,830
headers are as weak as for inserting

288
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:43,329
headers for our point of view and and I

289
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we could I think we could do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

290
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,150
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we should write that down</font>

291
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,990
as a separate document and have a

292
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:52,329
separate debate over what the what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6</font>

293
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,130
lb are should do on outgoing packets if

294
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:57,640
if you feel strongly that it should

295
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:59,530
remove the<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPI on then I think we should</font>

296
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,689
write that down separately as a separate

297
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:05,680
document because essentially decidable

298
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:07,870
by the six la 6lb are independently of

299
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:09,730
any of the other other decisions okay

300
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:11,290
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was getting at and my</font>

301
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,270
point<font color="#E5E5E5"> was we should have a</font>

302
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommendation in this document about</font>

303
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,329
that but you think we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

304
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,770
something there well somebody has to say

305
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,770
something somewhere all right i mean i

306
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:23,020
agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way document is welded so</font>

307
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:26,079
far<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't do I pinay p I think</font>

308
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:28,780
it's safe but now<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do we do with the</font>

309
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">rpi I think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> always safer not to</font>

310
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,770
keep it in the IP packet mean what's the

311
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:34,270
point in putting it I mean at least you

312
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,490
know if you'd get the cisco reg

313
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:37,990
formulation it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to snip it up</font>

314
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:39,550
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> more complex to keep it</font>

315
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:42,520
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to reincarnate into the</font>

316
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:45,730
compressible uncompressed form if you

317
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,440
have a non six large packet i would say

318
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,600
okay pressing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets always a risk</font>

319
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,400
so why don't you pass it down so<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

320
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">keeping the capability to either pass it</font>

321
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,490
on or not pass it down but i would say

322
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:58,180
basically the recommendation would be

323
00:17:54,490 --> 00:18:00,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">600 hu sniff it out plenty i catch you</font>

324
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:03,250
keep it something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can we</font>

325
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:06,220
continue this offline oh oh please pass

326
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:12,760
calculus<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sally</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sampai refer to add to</font>

327
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:16,570
the document<font color="#CCCCCC"> well this yes I mean I I</font>

328
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:20,440
feel I I feel that that will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

329
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:25,990
will that will drag this document into

330
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,700
the six men morass and and so so what I

331
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,880
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why I would propose that we</font>

332
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:34,480
we do this is a separate document and we

333
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,320
wait three to five<font color="#E5E5E5"> months for 2460 bits</font>

334
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:40,780
to settle and and then we will either

335
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,230
point to the resulting thing and say it

336
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">says we can do it so we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it or</font>

337
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:48,550
we won't and that gets us out of

338
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:50,470
otherwise I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're going to</font>

339
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:52,899
get I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

340
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:55,030
blocked on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> review somewhere or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

341
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,240
know but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would not like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ship these</font>

342
00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:00,220
documents saying do but you know at

343
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,340
least if we do like<font color="#E5E5E5"> logical 60 we don't</font>

344
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,530
say anything but saying do keep the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rpi</font>

345
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:07,929
in the back of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Safari time you said</font>

346
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:10,660
you can keep the rpi in the packet as it

347
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:13,330
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> out it's not it's you don't have to</font>

348
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,650
remove it by putting IP IP header we

349
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:19,030
didn't tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to remove it</font>

350
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:22,180
we said you can leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in right so</font>

351
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:24,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">there so L aveiro like do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agree with</font>

352
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,770
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that I think we're stepping into</font>

353
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:31,060
a disaster if we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else or do</font>

354
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:35,290
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think God's I'm wrong it's over I've</font>

355
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:39,580
ever gonna I don't know exactly where

356
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:43,690
six man is so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe having</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we may</font>

357
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,830
not so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> anima I'm sure that most of</font>

358
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,530
you probably follows these men a lot

359
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">closer than I do so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll let the working</font>

360
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:56,440
group decide what everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah but</font>

361
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm hearing is we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask Suresh okay</font>

362
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thinking we could create a ticket</font>

363
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:03,880
about that so we can keep working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

364
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:07,660
that that's one all right just to track

365
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:09,160
these I'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> pop I could be done</font>

366
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,350
with that's what I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> prefer that's</font>

367
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,840
why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to open a new issue but</font>

368
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:16,719
I mean tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> how strong you feel about</font>

369
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I I think that we could easily write</font>

370
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,870
this as a later document because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

371
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's operate a balut and it's</font>

372
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:27,790
easily the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route is relatively easy</font>

373
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,649
upgradeable versus the firmware this

374
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:32,710
decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> has no effect on the small</font>

375
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:36,730
devices out in the out on the edge of

376
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,280
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thank you thank you</font>

377
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:42,070
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much icon thank you and please read</font>

378
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,230
the document I mean that's important

379
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:46,510
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> read it and the sense of</font>

380
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:53,130
comments that please thank you very much

381
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:57,150
Michael mm-hmm our next<font color="#E5E5E5"> topic LDV ripple</font>

382
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:57,150
with Charlie Perkins

383
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:20,230
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you what the chase</font>

384
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:23,969
lines oh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not what I need any</font>

385
00:21:20,230 --> 00:21:31,030
you need to sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> into it I don't see it</font>

386
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:32,890
no no I need them<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I gun okay well</font>

387
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:34,899
I'm Charlie Perkins and I'm here to tell

388
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:41,820
you a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit about the updates to</font>

389
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:47,830
our document a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 0 DB ripple and um it's a</font>

390
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:50,710
sort of a new take on the p2p our peer

391
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:55,179
to peer use of ripple and there's an

392
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:57,640
experimental document RFC 69 97 but able

393
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:02,080
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> V extends the functionality from that</font>

394
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:06,280
document so we support the story mode

395
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,399
and we have both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old wait a minute</font>

396
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,899
I'm tally yeah now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is working thank you</font>

397
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:16,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay boy things change fast around here</font>

398
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:18,760
so we have a sub support for symmetrical

399
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,840
and asymmetrical but still

400
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:25,030
bi-directional<font color="#CCCCCC"> are links and this</font>

401
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:27,520
approach avoids the requirement for

402
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:32,020
having an address vector as in the

403
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:35,560
product from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the previous document p2p</font>

404
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:38,400
RPL so the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we have route</font>

405
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:42,580
request message and replied this<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub is</font>

406
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,490
more or less adapted for use with ripple

407
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,250
from the work that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> done unnao TV and</font>

408
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">a 0 DB version 2 and another working</font>

409
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:55,620
group and oops now what I do holy smokes

410
00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:05,860
sorry I must have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> big thumb so the</font>

411
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:10,600
changes that were made as we actually

412
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:12,550
wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reduce the amount of space</font>

413
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,070
that is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rare reply and we</font>

414
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:18,370
could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> by actually having us</font>

415
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:20,710
repaired dode eggs and so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

416
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:24,120
have an easy association between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

417
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:28,870
route reply and the request and the way

418
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,459
we did that not fairly straightforward

419
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:34,418
way which I'll mention in just a minute

420
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:37,299
the route request actually is sent from

421
00:23:34,419 --> 00:23:39,820
the requesting node or the originating

422
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:42,549
node to finally received by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the target</font>

423
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,980
and but the when when the target

424
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:47,830
received at what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is that</font>

425
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:49,929
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> target now has a way to transmit</font>

426
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:52,000
package from from itself to the

427
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">originating node and the route reply</font>

428
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,740
then is transmitted back towards the

429
00:23:54,909 --> 00:24:00,009
originating node according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to some path</font>

430
00:23:56,740 --> 00:24:02,440
possibly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a symmetric path and when it</font>

431
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:05,470
arrives then the originating node has a

432
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:11,950
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to transmit packets are transmitted</font>

433
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:15,190
data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the target node so don't breeder</font>

434
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,950
is that there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> adesh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a3 document</font>

435
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,870
that's available and actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> this squat</font>

436
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">this slide describes the changes between</font>

437
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:28,299
our previous one document and the end of

438
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:31,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">three so the draft update specifies this</font>

439
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:34,690
way of pairing the request and reply

440
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,919
instances and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allows us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to eliminate</font>

441
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:43,419
a large field in the route reply message

442
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:46,870
and we have implementations in process

443
00:24:43,419 --> 00:24:49,330
there's a work that you can read<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

444
00:24:46,870 --> 00:24:52,389
there works on<font color="#CCCCCC"> kontiki with the kuja</font>

445
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:54,879
simulator which by the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not do</font>

446
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:57,840
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> work but one that co-authors and SV</font>

447
00:24:54,879 --> 00:25:00,039
Anand has done this so it does and

448
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,009
implementation supports about symmetric

449
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:05,889
and asymmetric modes and if making

450
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:10,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">comparisons against a ripple storage</font>

451
00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:13,149
mode so we will make a more full report

452
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,120
on this at the next ITF this has worked

453
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:18,158
it's in process and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> intention is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

454
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,928
actually make a demo at the next time

455
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,980
ITF

456
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:26,889
so the pairing works so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

457
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:29,889
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the upstream is considered to be</font>

458
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:31,928
transmission from the destination or

459
00:25:29,889 --> 00:25:35,519
target node back to the originating node

460
00:25:31,929 --> 00:25:38,470
and downstream the other direction so

461
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:41,080
the upstream sense instanceid for the

462
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:43,360
route request instance is selected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

463
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:46,210
an odd number and then the intermediate

464
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,360
routers stored that instance ID and then

465
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,240
when the rat reply comes back<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the</font>

466
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:54,850
route request instance plus 1<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

467
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,850
that makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> straightforward for the</font>

468
00:25:54,850 --> 00:25:59,860
intermediate routers to know what is the

469
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:05,889
originating node towards which they are

470
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:07,990
establishing the reverse path so that's

471
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:13,869
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> main technical difference</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of nuh is</font>

472
00:26:07,990 --> 00:26:16,119
now present in the updated draft the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

473
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:18,580
not going to go into the gratuitous

474
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,168
robbery right<font color="#E5E5E5"> we play it's it's the same</font>

475
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:26,320
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was before but basically on now we</font>

476
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:28,539
allow it to work with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> some way of</font>

477
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,668
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> paired pairing between the route</font>

478
00:26:28,539 --> 00:26:32,669
request and route reply instances

479
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,249
implementation is mentioned before is

480
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:41,049
done on the kontiki and I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

481
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:46,090
supposed to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> available in github soon</font>

482
00:26:41,049 --> 00:26:48,519
and soon I guess means this year so we

483
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:50,649
are planning to run a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of experiments</font>

484
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:53,080
on various Network scenarios to see what

485
00:26:50,649 --> 00:26:56,918
the performance gains are and then so<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

486
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:03,639
and to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together a demonstration for</font>

487
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:07,149
the March idea I guess that's it any

488
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:09,850
comments or questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ravi Giada from</font>

489
00:27:07,149 --> 00:27:12,070
wally so uh one of the claim of the

490
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">previous draft I mean have not gone</font>

491
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,539
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the latest dr. povitch's for</font>

492
00:27:13,389 --> 00:27:18,610
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> previous draft said that this</font>

493
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:22,509
enables asymmetric operations a

494
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:24,248
symmetric link so basically but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way</font>

495
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,559
previous draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> of operated was by</font>

496
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:27,879
sending message from A to B and

497
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,619
establishing route in the reverse

498
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:33,320
direction oh yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> we distinguish between</font>

499
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:37,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">asymmetric and unity</font>

500
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:40,730
fictional so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a path to go</font>

501
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:43,580
back but the asymmetry comes about by

502
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:45,440
enabling the reverse link to have a much

503
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:49,970
different metric or a much different

504
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:53,389
time that's a feasibility then so you

505
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:56,360
might want to have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> union you might</font>

506
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:58,129
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the best path going from</font>

507
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,689
source to destination by a much

508
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,990
different mechanism than from

509
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:05,389
destination to source but we do expect

510
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:08,509
at least that the control messages will

511
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:11,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">be transmitted in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics evaluated</font>

512
00:28:08,509 --> 00:28:15,649
in that way so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to enable</font>

513
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,139
fully the more general case for there

514
00:28:15,649 --> 00:28:21,709
are unidirectional links then I think

515
00:28:18,139 --> 00:28:24,258
additional work is needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok one more</font>

516
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:28,669
question regarding the simulation that

517
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:30,470
was done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kontiki so which model</font>

518
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:33,019
was selected was was it was it you GD

519
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,429
amor de<font color="#CCCCCC"> grm so I mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically I want</font>

520
00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:36,889
to understand if the default mode was

521
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:38,330
selected which I mean if you use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

522
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:40,729
default mode definitely the previous

523
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,070
doctor at least would work yeah well for

524
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:45,320
that I I have to tell you I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

525
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:49,370
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> information since i'm not doing the</font>

526
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:53,269
simulation network when<font color="#CCCCCC"> contiki but its</font>

527
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:57,469
own brush it do you know anything about

528
00:28:53,269 --> 00:29:00,259
the kontiki platform you probably should

529
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:03,860
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mic I'm putting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him on the spot</font>

530
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:15,169
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh not at this moment all right now</font>

531
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:19,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay more questions well ok thank</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

532
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:25,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charlie thank you very much all right uh</font>

533
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:25,779
whom read a document raise our hands ok

534
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:36,230
ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> life who wants to review this</font>

535
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:38,990
document and collaborate on it one once

536
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:47,149
I just review review our industry you

537
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:48,889
yeah 11<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok to actually test killed</font>

538
00:29:47,149 --> 00:29:50,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">encouraged me to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first</font>

539
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:53,439
place<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you should use yeah how about</font>

540
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:55,609
you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> straining</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> willing to review I</font>

541
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,830
know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> feeling thank you very much</font>

542
00:29:55,609 --> 00:30:12,129
thank you very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much Pascal please it's</font>

543
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:23,019
kyle next speaker tell projection ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah</font>

544
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:26,978
you can so I'm past caring with Cisco

545
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:31,369
presenting on the dial projection so

546
00:30:26,979 --> 00:30:34,639
basically we've kept this yeah we've got

547
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:37,189
this well the repo protocol which

548
00:30:34,639 --> 00:30:40,070
actually enables a number of different

549
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:42,799
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing things which is so that we</font>

550
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,168
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually turn repo and we knew it</font>

551
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,580
from from the experimental RFC before

552
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:53,929
into a reactive protocol we can also

553
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:56,539
easily turn repo<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a centralized</font>

554
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:58,159
routing approach and we've not done that

555
00:30:56,539 --> 00:31:00,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">before but there are a number of</font>

556
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,489
applications for which this could be

557
00:31:00,469 --> 00:31:06,139
useful an example application is

558
00:31:03,489 --> 00:31:08,679
industrial control loops so what you

559
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:11,629
build this ripple based cluster of

560
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,849
sensors and actuators and programmable

561
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:16,488
logic controllers and with this<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font>

562
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:20,089
enable control loops inside your factory

563
00:31:16,489 --> 00:31:23,659
network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then at some point you want</font>

564
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:25,519
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> establish special path between this</font>

565
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:30,320
particular sensor and this particular

actuator with guarnteed capabilities for

567
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,450
instance you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had a six digit ACH Mac</font>

568
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:39,379
layer and with this Mac layer you can

569
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:41,330
program time slots so as to to grantee

570
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:43,789
deterministically a path<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the</font>

controller and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then back to an actuator</font>

573
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:52,429
if you want to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you need a a way</font>

574
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:55,039
to go and program the path the rods into

575
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,690
the devices so at some point you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

576
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,158
program the time slot themselves and

577
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:01,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the objective at all for this</font>

578
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,570
work but<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand you also need</font>

579
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:07,428
to program the rats into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices and</font>

580
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,019
if you're well it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which one</font>

581
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:10,399
are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> peek but if you want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

584
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:21,049
using repo as the protocol to install

00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:35,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network so what we do add two 6550 is</font>

588
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:38,750
really this capability to to add<font color="#CCCCCC"> routes</font>

589
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,360
on demand and other control of the root

590
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:43,879
but the root itself and we don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

591
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,879
specify how that happens can be in touch

592
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:53,509
with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC satirized rotting controller</font>

593
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:57,740
which can tell the route which routes to

594
00:32:53,509 --> 00:33:00,950
install so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> application for</font>

595
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:04,190
this is kind of obviously because that's

596
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:06,740
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started a way to comprise</font>

597
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:09,710
source right path if you get a deep

598
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,779
network and you're using non story mode

599
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:13,429
at some point you'd say oh if I've got

600
00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:15,889
this particular long line here on the

601
00:33:13,429 --> 00:33:17,450
right and they know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> capabilities the</font>

602
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:20,840
memory space that you get in those

603
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:23,269
devices I could actually save all these

604
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:25,850
sort information in all those packets by

605
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:27,649
installing pinpointing some rods in

606
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:30,769
those particular nodes and since it's

607
00:33:27,649 --> 00:33:33,620
done centrally it can be done with some

608
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:35,230
awareness of how much memory there is in

609
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,309
those devices so you know you're not

610
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:41,659
overloading those devices by this

611
00:33:37,309 --> 00:33:43,970
additional<font color="#E5E5E5"> rod so this the first usage</font>

612
00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:48,379
and there's some new text in in version

613
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:52,850
3 is about compressing the strict sauce

614
00:33:48,379 --> 00:33:55,610
rod header and making it loose around

615
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:58,969
other from our way so<font color="#CCCCCC"> the routing matrix</font>

616
00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:02,479
also will play a role when you populate

617
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:07,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">a part downstream so how would you take</font>

618
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that ok so the path is actually</font>

619
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:12,409
in non story mode is actually already

620
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:14,690
decided by the dowel process which

621
00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:17,179
creates the non<font color="#E5E5E5"> store across so</font>

622
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:19,550
so the cost it's done its work is done

623
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:22,119
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> topology is built what you're doing</font>

624
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:24,440
for the non story mode is you are just

625
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,109
compressing the expression<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that path</font>

626
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,560
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are not changing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way you</font>

627
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:33,918
compute it so the cost is past its it's

628
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,989
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so as I understand it</font>

629
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,658
correctly so you're saying that since

630
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the node has already sent a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dau is</font>

631
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:43,399
it has already taken into consideration

632
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:46,279
the metrics and decided the bio yeah the

633
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,638
eieio and then it has already decided we

634
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:53,569
share<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> world knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it</font>

635
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:56,450
would build this long sauce wat header

636
00:34:53,569 --> 00:34:58,730
to go down this path and I have picture

637
00:34:56,449 --> 00:35:01,549
of that so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

638
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:04,700
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is shrink the expression of that</font>

639
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:09,770
path in the non story mode packet by

640
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:12,439
installing pinpoint state in specific

641
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,810
individual ok<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok right but you're not</font>

642
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,829
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a routing protocol it's just a</font>

643
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:22,609
way of enabling a little bit of storing

644
00:35:18,829 --> 00:35:25,700
mode in a non-story network so that you

645
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:28,848
can transform streets<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rotting in</font>

646
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:31,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">toulouse so Swati right right and this</font>

647
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:34,640
is doable because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route is expected</font>

648
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:36,770
to know the capability of the mode so it

649
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,020
goes on this node i can install<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 rods</font>

650
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:44,240
let me optimize which not get which

651
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:47,930
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the version 2</font>

652
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,770
of this draft introduced a story mode

653
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:56,060
variation of that which cannot be fully

654
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:57,800
achieved until we send more information

655
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,560
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route about the topology</font>

656
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,890
because the non story mode only work

657
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,960
works on the information that the route

658
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:10,009
already has which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is enough information</font>

659
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:12,050
you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> follow the same time if you</font>

660
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:14,420
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use the second technology which</font>

661
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:16,670
is enabled by this draft which works in

662
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:21,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">storing mode as well towards in both</font>

663
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:22,910
modes you need some additional protocol

664
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:25,069
element which this<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

665
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,410
providing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have to decide if one</font>

666
00:36:25,069 --> 00:36:28,500
to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this path and provide those</font>

667
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,930
elements within the

668
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:33,060
draft or with another draft and with

669
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:35,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">these additional topological elements</font>

670
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,730
you can be able to transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> soul path</font>

671
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:40,890
divus<font color="#E5E5E5"> tration so let's go through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

672
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:42,930
slots<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there are those two modes</font>

673
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:45,839
will have to decide if we pursue this

674
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:47,970
draft whether we do or need a non-story

675
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,550
in which case we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need new protocol</font>

676
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:52,049
elements or if we also want to do the

677
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:54,180
transversal path which is really

678
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:57,750
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> piece in in some scenarios</font>

679
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,850
like industrial and in that case we'll

680
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:01,560
need to talk about topological elements

681
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,200
how we express that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root or to</font>

682
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:10,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the PC like tease you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know this type of</font>

683
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:15,240
information that net so it's no nothing

684
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:17,430
much I I mostly did editorial work fixed

685
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,450
the abstract which was deal from<font color="#E5E5E5"> version</font>

686
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:23,040
1 so we talked about so throughout and

687
00:37:20,450 --> 00:37:25,200
so clarified what you can do with this

688
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:31,290
transversal rods which were<font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced</font>

689
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:33,509
in version 2 so I am is we could work on

690
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,180
the draft a lot but at some point we

691
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,950
really need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see where the working</font>

692
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,210
group wants to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those two</font>

693
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:44,100
technologies if you want to pursue them

694
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:46,950
and then we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can work together</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also type</font>

695
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,540
1 a-ron shadow from<font color="#CCCCCC"> worry one of the</font>

696
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,939
discussions<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had on mailing list was</font>

697
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:55,230
you know not related directly on this

698
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,060
draft the discussion was whether a

699
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:59,070
mixed-mode kind of operation be

700
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,890
supported would this draft enable by any

701
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,080
chance it is a mixed mode which of the

702
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:05,910
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very controlled mixed mode because</font>

703
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:10,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with mixed mode is same</font>

704
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:13,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">promise as storing mode is controlling</font>

705
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of rods that you push into</font>

706
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:17,190
the devices and that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really why</font>

707
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,870
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two modes in rebirth I</font>

708
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:21,450
mean this discussion was like years ago

709
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:23,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">but the discussion was like this storing</font>

710
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:26,759
mode looks of like a very good idea

711
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:29,670
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> you reach the limits of a note and</font>

712
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,290
so we said okay so we could have and I

713
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:35,460
seen your work which is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that again</font>

714
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:40,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">we we could have some intelligence so as</font>

715
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:42,090
to refuse a down from a child if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

716
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:44,549
table is already saturated

717
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,230
um and you could do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but then you're</font>

718
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:47,820
pushing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime on the neighbor and</font>

719
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,470
maybe the neighbor at the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime and</font>

720
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:52,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be pushed and some point there</font>

721
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:55,230
is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> way right so so that that kind of</font>

722
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:58,470
pushes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Prime a little bit and</font>

723
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:00,780
enables a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> well a number of new</font>

724
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:02,490
situations but it doesn't solve the

725
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:08,310
problem it just pushes the prime for

726
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:10,319
further away the<font color="#E5E5E5"> approach can it's very</font>

727
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:14,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make the distributed approach</font>

728
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,950
work and so we can try but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

729
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:20,490
hard the centralized approach is doable

730
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:23,490
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> route knows which routes</font>

731
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:26,370
it's injecting into the network right so

732
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:28,229
it does that because it has information

733
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:30,000
about the capabilities of the node

734
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:31,890
that's part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> expectation you know</font>

735
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,630
which notes you're talking about you

736
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:35,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how much stage you can install</font>

737
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:38,280
those nodes you know the lifetime of

738
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,500
this state so it's very controlled so

739
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,820
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution of the real problem</font>

740
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,030
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is how do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know you're not</font>

741
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:47,670
overloading the whole thing so that's

742
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,220
that's the low-hanging fruit in this

743
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:56,090
direction outside but the real prime is

744
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:59,339
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> much harder thank you my questions</font>

745
00:39:56,090 --> 00:40:01,800
so angry provided slice which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I won't</font>

746
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,990
play but it's if you want to go through

747
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,610
how these things work in the

748
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:07,589
illustration in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the coming slides which</font>

749
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:14,100
will be published I guess on the side

750
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:17,340
yeah yeah we can so I just thank you who

751
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:22,950
has read this draft one two three<font color="#CCCCCC"> four</font>

who wants to review this draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> one three</font>

756
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:47,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">this should be part of our work mmm</font>

757
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:48,990
lentils four five six<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay okay so we</font>

758
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:51,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to confirm the sphere the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> beylin</font>

759
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:54,930
list yeah yeah thank you very much

760
00:40:51,000 --> 00:41:19,140
Muskaan yeah

761
00:40:54,930 --> 00:41:22,348
slice okay okay um<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh good morning lots</font>

762
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:24,240
of jet lag well I try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see if there's</font>

763
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:26,790
any interest in the work we did it is

764
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,529
about nipple and especially about the

765
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:31,680
number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> four virus you have any metal</font>

766
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,930
in an internetwork if you have lots of

767
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,149
network which is very dense and there

768
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:38,040
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of four virus in it maple for</font>

769
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:40,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">routers then when you want to multicast</font>

770
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:42,869
the message you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an enormous storm of</font>

771
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:45,480
broadcast messages and that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

772
00:41:42,869 --> 00:41:48,450
helping the performance of the network

773
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,579
so for those networks it is important

774
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:54,839
that you can reduce the number of maples

775
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:57,510
so that the Equality the density of

776
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,578
maple for<font color="#CCCCCC"> virus in the network is not</font>

777
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:02,790
too not too high and you can have a

778
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:07,339
reasonable number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages so that's</font>

779
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:09,960
what we try to do here i have an example

780
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:13,049
robot you might like yo you have this

781
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,760
network if they're all forwarders and

782
00:42:13,049 --> 00:42:16,680
one will start the forwarding you will

783
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:20,880
get all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other blue ones will forward</font>

784
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,649
it only only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one hop is dated to go to</font>

785
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,109
the ones on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left and from the ones</font>

786
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:27,390
to left on to the others if you only

787
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,790
select for example 24 hours in the

788
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,859
middle then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of maple for</font>

789
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:33,900
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages company is reduced and</font>

790
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:39,240
the performance of the network is much

791
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:40,950
better yeah how many forward a suit you

792
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,689
select well if you have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> network</font>

793
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:47,578
where you have only one<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope network and</font>

794
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,890
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think more forward a sufficient</font>

795
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:51,809
and you would need<font color="#CCCCCC"> one for order because</font>

796
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,740
suppose that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broadcast coming</font>

797
00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:58,440
from the right hand green note it was

798
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">sent it to everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they receive the</font>

799
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,530
message but then<font color="#CCCCCC"> bounced the link is</font>

800
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:06,180
between the dead link has done then

801
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:08,610
you're very happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're still and</font>

802
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">passed which goes for you the forwarder</font>

803
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:12,990
to the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes which has this</font>

804
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:14,520
mission link so having at least one when

805
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:16,439
you have maple and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted more</font>

806
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,540
reliability having at least one for

807
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:22,560
Weiser also in the single hope network

808
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,330
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync encouraged the other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case is</font>

809
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you have them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> too hot network and</font>

810
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:30,240
then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> at least 24 hours i think</font>

811
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:32,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">because if the link to some of the</font>

812
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,259
forerunners and the destinations breaks

813
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:36,540
down then you have the second forward to

814
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:38,610
continue so the reliable ability is

815
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:42,210
riddled increased we did some

816
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:45,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">measurements in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an offices and we sold</font>

817
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:47,880
that actually the even stable links a

818
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,720
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> as is very good etc that if you</font>

819
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,240
will say 20 minutes per week you have

820
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:56,819
links which actually crash and then you

821
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,830
have these two routers you just continue

822
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:05,460
working during during the year yeah

823
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">doctor so what does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the note maintain we</font>

824
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:11,160
might try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep to it another simple</font>

825
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,350
and what you do is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have count</font>

826
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,629
the number of neighbors which have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

827
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:18,779
state<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there for barter state is FF</font>

828
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:21,390
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a for barter so every note</font>

829
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:24,120
maintains the number of neighbors that

830
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:26,370
he has that he has a forward of is and

831
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,710
the other one is that he looks at the

832
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:32,009
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there the number of</font>

833
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:34,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">for virus is slow lagos by smaller than</font>

834
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:36,030
the wanted number of forwarders and

835
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,600
duplicate which you should well in this

836
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:41,340
stuff work<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't course to be too and we</font>

837
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,080
have also an hour both<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the</font>

838
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,360
number of neighbors which is larger than

839
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:47,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">n duplicate because value constructing</font>

840
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:49,650
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> num is selecting the number of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

841
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,750
virus you will see that well it's not

842
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:53,940
fantastic every time so that when you

843
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,010
have too many men neighbors which has

844
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,680
for viruses selected within a certain

845
00:44:56,010 --> 00:45:01,050
area you can reduce it and also then the

846
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,660
network configuration changes so you can

847
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:07,140
select other ones and they move on so to

848
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:13,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep this reasonable now i have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

849
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:15,359
complex picture oh yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next</font>

850
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,490
one so what do the notes they do they

851
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:19,230
sent a link<font color="#CCCCCC"> locomotive cast and they</font>

852
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:21,209
send their adverse there says I the

853
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,859
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> four</font>

854
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,779
for bar the neighbors to have the end or

855
00:45:23,859 --> 00:45:28,500
under and n are both deaf and their own

856
00:45:25,779 --> 00:45:32,940
state of course she were format is used

857
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:37,990
who doesn't and only messages from her

858
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,750
yeah even draft so I the only messages

859
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,519
from fell out neighbors taken into

860
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:44,980
account and only message message

861
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:49,569
reception you updated note and you

862
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:54,940
execute the selection algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

863
00:45:49,569 --> 00:45:59,410
complex oh here's the commissary here's

864
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:01,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the complex picture I wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to show</font>

865
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:04,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this NR under actually gives you</font>

866
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:08,259
information about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

867
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:10,750
to help to hop neighbors yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have</font>

868
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:13,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit bones were selected to be a</font>

869
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:15,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">forwarder you will see that the Wonder</font>

870
00:46:13,089 --> 00:46:17,799
in the middle he sees that this number

871
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:19,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of for viruses to you see only others</font>

872
00:46:17,799 --> 00:46:21,730
that they have the number for viruses<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

873
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:23,259
and then you have all these months which

874
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,079
are the neighbors which have to enter

875
00:46:23,259 --> 00:46:27,759
under they can tell and by selecting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

876
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,829
one which has the highest and are under

877
00:46:27,759 --> 00:46:33,549
for all your neighbors you may consider

878
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:36,670
that this is the highest number of notes

879
00:46:33,549 --> 00:46:38,529
you are helping with this for Ryder so

880
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:41,079
what we do is we look at the number try

881
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:43,089
to select death note of all the

882
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:45,430
neighbors which has the higher numbers

883
00:46:43,089 --> 00:46:47,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anna rounder and that number may be</font>

884
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:51,129
the same for several notes into town

885
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:53,109
break ties we use the network address so

886
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:55,779
choose the highest<font color="#E5E5E5"> one for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> example to</font>

887
00:46:53,109 --> 00:46:57,308
have only<font color="#E5E5E5"> one note of all the neighbors</font>

888
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:59,799
which are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be for</font>

889
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:04,029
murder yeah you don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> all them of</font>

890
00:46:59,799 --> 00:47:07,230
them decide simultaneously so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

891
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:10,269
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on selection algorithm so every</font>

892
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:12,880
note orders the neighbors including

893
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:14,979
itself on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> N or unknown number value</font>

894
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,230
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address so that you have this</font>

895
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:20,259
and what do you do is select at the

896
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:23,470
first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you and become</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

897
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:26,799
forwarder simple as that you also look

898
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:29,410
at NR above this first star ignore and

899
00:47:26,799 --> 00:47:30,910
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's equal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the number of valid</font>

900
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:32,710
neighbors you know that all neighbors

901
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:34,470
see too many months<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know that if</font>

902
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:37,020
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and forward your</font>

903
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:40,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">Islam too many in this company</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

904
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,290
remove yourself yeah so that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

905
00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:46,080
there's also an you want this to happen

906
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:47,640
in a stable network so you don't want to

907
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:50,700
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> decisions about networks which are</font>

908
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,480
constantly changing aspects so what the

909
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:55,950
cotillion for that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at the</font>

910
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at all the neighbor messages and</font>

911
00:47:55,950 --> 00:48:00,810
if the NR undervalue is changing if the

912
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,910
end are under value changes you don't do

913
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,359
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> once that you see the deer in</font>

914
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,279
cycle all the message are the same it's

915
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:10,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same and a runner for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oldham you say</font>

916
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:18,359
look here I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> stable I can make my</font>

917
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:20,970
decision yep some examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if here</font>

918
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:22,830
and that did some simulations of it the

919
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,759
distance<font color="#E5E5E5"> between the notes are about 10</font>

920
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:28,619
meters it isn't too<font color="#CCCCCC"> hot network so the</font>

921
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:30,210
ones down<font color="#E5E5E5"> below don't see the ones up</font>

922
00:48:28,619 --> 00:48:33,030
above but the month in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

923
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:36,180
apparently see all of them you want to

924
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:39,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">have in the past between all the four</font>

925
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:41,098
murders so what to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I first make sure</font>

926
00:48:39,089 --> 00:48:42,960
that there is long for<font color="#E5E5E5"> water and a</font>

927
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:44,820
forwarder can only be selected<font color="#E5E5E5"> when he</font>

928
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,200
sees another forward so which issues

929
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,000
that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a path between all four</font>

930
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:51,240
murders otherwise you may get have

931
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,540
separate set of forward a switch and you

932
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:56,220
don't want it so here it looks rather

933
00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,390
nice I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you can do much</font>

934
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:02,879
better than that however if the distance

935
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:06,359
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> notes is harder is larger so</font>

936
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:09,180
the density has decreased then the

937
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:11,670
things become a bit more less optimistic

938
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:18,390
you see that where they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

939
00:49:11,670 --> 00:49:20,640
ones are each note is marked with the

940
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:22,859
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward as it sees and they</font>

941
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,480
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at least</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two where you see when</font>

942
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:26,279
the number of for where this is five or

943
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,800
six you may wonder if it should not be

944
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,450
removed while giving the algorithm where

945
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,060
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> had you see that actually some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

946
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:35,609
them remove themselves yeah so one of

947
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:37,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">those there the life blue one has been a</font>

948
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:39,960
forward but you saw that the density was

949
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:42,210
too high if the others do not go down it

950
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,250
means<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on the edge at least there is</font>

951
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:46,530
one note which only sees two 4runners

952
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:48,120
and you can do not remove himself yeah

953
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:50,520
so

954
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:52,560
probably when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the evolution</font>

955
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,960
of the Anne Arundel etcetera can do much

956
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:57,150
more with so all the data you get in the

957
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:02,220
algorithm and do some refinements I

958
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:04,830
didn't do them I've here another example

959
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:09,419
also so it is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> dense network it's</font>

960
00:50:04,830 --> 00:50:11,670
not too bad actually this egra also is

961
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:14,550
not too bad and they all<font color="#CCCCCC"> have see the</font>

962
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:20,000
two 4runners so now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pleasantly</font>

963
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:24,300
surprised and the question askers sorry

964
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:27,510
so I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to continue the work if</font>

965
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:37,230
there's enough interesting it if not to

966
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:39,950
know let me just stop it I'm I'm Charlie

967
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:44,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">perkinson I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great idea</font>

968
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:48,120
was involved a lot with the forwarding

969
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:50,880
specification in manet and there's been

970
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:53,160
a huge amount of work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area I</font>

971
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,320
mean I one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terms that's used is</font>

972
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:59,190
connected dominating set when you're

973
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:00,990
trying to construct one so I but I guess

974
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:02,730
to have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions I mean</font>

975
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:05,430
first of all do you really think that

976
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:10,860
it's typically important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have more</font>

977
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:14,779
than one forwarder yes I mean that's if

978
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,780
you want at least one hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent</font>

979
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:19,500
availability<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a year in this room</font>

980
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,540
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> not when you switch it off you say</font>

981
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:24,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right good quarter or for now and</font>

982
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:28,020
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> again yes you need at least in one</font>

983
00:51:24,450 --> 00:51:29,970
hop networks at least one and in larger

984
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">network we have multiple hops you need</font>

985
00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:36,089
as many forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> ssink yeah you mean</font>

986
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:40,049
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying you need duplicate brownie</font>

987
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:43,230
district at shell so and duplicates 14

988
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:48,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">Milty of networks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to discourage</font>

989
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,890
that's idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and I guess it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

990
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:54,480
know your pictures are all sort of

991
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:56,400
regular arrays Oh sites of overall I

992
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:59,610
think that could be end up being a

993
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:01,740
little bit misleading I quite agree if

994
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:04,050
there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> other misleading sings I mean</font>

995
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:06,118
may choose your network<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses such</font>

996
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:07,890
that the algorithm is improved I mean

997
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:10,890
there are lots of things you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do but</font>

998
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:12,960
yeah what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> also wanted to do is look if</font>

999
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,609
this how far is from the optimal so how

1000
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:16,440
many forwarders you look for the optimal

1001
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:18,360
case I didn't do all these things I mean

1002
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:22,290
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just was happy with this for the</font>

1003
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:25,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment and so it's I guess it's is it</font>

1004
00:52:22,290 --> 00:52:28,110
agree that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this working</font>

1005
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:31,200
group mainly of<font color="#E5E5E5"> interest for stabili</font>

1006
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:34,230
located devices ah that's a very good

1007
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,629
question what is stable I mean this

1008
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:39,150
table is with respect to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

1009
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:41,100
times you sent your you sent your

1010
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,580
message out so if you sense out your

1011
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:47,009
maple let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like they did every</font>

1012
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:49,740
five minutes and you have about<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty</font>

1013
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:52,380
neighbors then stable is longer than 20

1014
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:58,350
times<font color="#E5E5E5"> five minutes yeah okay thank you</font>

1015
00:52:52,380 --> 00:53:01,080
welcome um<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael Richardson so trying</font>

1016
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:04,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">to understand that the diagrams in this</font>

1017
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:05,880
diagram for instance to all do the nodes

1018
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:08,820
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> far left can hear the nodes and</font>

1019
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:11,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the far right no no this is a multi</font>

1020
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:24,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">network how far do they here okay can I</font>

1021
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:27,029
point it out sure so the one the left

1022
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:36,899
mark zero can see as far as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> month</font>

1023
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:38,820
one marked 11 okay okay that's that's

1024
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">great to understand and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you said</font>

1025
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:44,070
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to ask something about about</font>

1026
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:45,570
uh about your definition of stable as

1027
00:53:44,070 --> 00:53:47,480
well and it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you couldn't so</font>

1028
00:53:45,570 --> 00:53:50,190
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically if the if the</font>

1029
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:52,470
instability of the of the network or if

1030
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:54,300
it's not fixed orbits moving if it's

1031
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:56,480
slow enough compared to your your

1032
00:53:54,300 --> 00:54:00,270
transmission time then it effectively

1033
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,710
stable yeah so you can this can be set

1034
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:03,300
so actually I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make the</font>

1035
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:05,690
protocol search the dependent on what

1036
00:54:03,300 --> 00:54:09,660
you see you decrease or increase that

1037
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:10,920
cool um well so my other I haven't read

1038
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:13,920
your documented also i really have no

1039
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:15,830
idea so is is your does your does your

1040
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:19,440
protocol live on top of

1041
00:54:15,830 --> 00:54:22,819
um<font color="#E5E5E5"> trickle on trick on trickle so it's a</font>

1042
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:26,100
it's a it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> independent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

1043
00:54:22,820 --> 00:54:27,750
nipple forwarding itself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that</font>

1044
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:31,410
what I was curious about is that it that

1045
00:54:27,750 --> 00:54:33,900
I I know little about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but they're</font>

1046
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:37,680
the people that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to do beer to</font>

1047
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:40,500
rip to do multicast it sound I think

1048
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they would benefit from having this</font>

1049
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:45,690
minimum set of devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1050
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:47,700
address that would then do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so I</font>

1051
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:50,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would be a you're absolutely</font>

1052
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:53,520
right my disgust is disgusting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and its</font>

1053
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:55,500
first salt three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months two months ago</font>

1054
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,020
they saw that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it might help to reduce</font>

1055
00:54:55,500 --> 00:55:01,950
the number of offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> pass that they had</font>

1056
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:04,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at yeah ok cool no it can be</font>

1057
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">used for other ones as well I mean not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1058
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:10,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">living piscataway I love this so if you</font>

1059
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:12,900
you're looking for voices to say yes to

1060
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:16,259
continue please continue this work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1061
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:17,850
um it looks to me that it's an

1062
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,950
interesting variation around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1063
00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:22,049
something very similar acronym which is

NPR the multi punch realize you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1065
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:29,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">i saw and i was just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering it seems</font>

1066
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,350
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me that you're looking for an optimum</font>

1067
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,360
for certain radio condition you know the

1068
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:35,279
radio conditions change a lot there's

1069
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:37,050
also if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

1070
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:42,090
non-pom advice is battery-operated

1071
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:44,490
devices then you may be draining the

1072
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:46,890
battery of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same devices all the time</font>

1073
00:55:44,490 --> 00:55:50,009
all the time and i was wondering<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

1074
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">could inject some viability in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1075
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:55,800
algorithm<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you would periodically</font>

1076
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:58,620
maybe not get the optimized thing but

1077
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:00,690
optimized with the radio<font color="#E5E5E5"> matrix is never</font>

1078
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:02,850
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway but have some rotation</font>

1079
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,820
mechanism so that it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> not always be</font>

1080
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:07,440
3 11 24 and sometimes would be this guy

1081
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:10,040
above<font color="#E5E5E5"> three and this guy and the high</font>

1082
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,660
level on the left but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more notes but</font>

1083
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,700
excellent i think excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

1084
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:17,430
actually it's fits with my mom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1085
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:19,799
other sorts because when we when I see

1086
00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,899
the stable solutions if you move<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

1087
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:24,210
the forward a little bit to another

1088
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,400
location the whole pattern may look

1089
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:28,260
differently and you may remove of them

1090
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,160
so i was thinking of actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

1091
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,049
implementation

1092
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,990
you may improve by moving them around

1093
00:56:31,049 --> 00:56:35,788
and so moving them around would be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1094
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:42,839
good idea i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually in general</font>

1095
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:49,740
yeah okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much Peter who</font>

1096
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:51,210
have read the dot he written<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok too ok</font>

1097
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:59,160
please read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and comments on my mini</font>

1098

list everyone sign these<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok some more</font>

1099
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:09,328
questions or laps or comments no

1100
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:11,009
comments on the progress no comments on

the Charter everybody happy to go

1102
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:18,930
forward as we are intended to yep right

1103
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:23,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok ok</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very much thank you very</font>
