00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:10,420
there's a separate presentation so i

50
00:04:06,939 --> 00:04:14,680
won't go into the details and a young

51
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:21,488
draft it's progressing forward but my

52
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:23,470
kink it's slowly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security HP v6</font>

53
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:26,739
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> work continues there were several</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">versions published and we had some</font>

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,260
discussion on deep-sea mailing list and

56
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:35,020
also on sag so with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first new</font>

57
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:38,860
extensions there was no progress<font color="#E5E5E5"> outers</font>

58
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,770
are not responsive Bernie and I tried to

59
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:44,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">contact them several times so we have an</font>

60
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:50,948
agenda slot you know to discuss what to

61
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:54,699
do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and there's there are two</font>

62
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:57,300
drafts that were adopted Dixie rely part

63
00:04:54,699 --> 00:05:01,150
and the Dixie<font color="#CCCCCC"> realize server security</font>

64
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,620
and there's technically there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

65
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,099
call on the second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in progress</font>

66
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:08,500
because i haven't summarize it up there

67
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:11,199
were very few responses actually only

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:14,530
bang you responded<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think so if you</font>

69
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:20,010
have some comments please do send<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

70
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:23,469
to the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we have several</font>

71
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:27,760
individual draft one of them is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,409
software dhcp for over<font color="#E5E5E5"> six and there</font>

73
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:36,370
were there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation about it</font>

74
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:38,770
coming right after<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and the</font>

75
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">last update regarding the working group</font>

76
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,320
is about milestones so we recently

77
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:45,669
completed two milestones we still have

78
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,479
too much<font color="#CCCCCC"> since opened the first one is</font>

79
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:53,010
and that we should reach outer this

80
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:56,979
would probably make sense after we

81
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,840
finish our work on 2315 bitch and of

82
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:01,719
course we have the second milestone

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:03,760
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question to the working</font>

84
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,100
group so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys consider the</font>

85
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:13,090
milestones useful at all have you looked

86
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:21,639
at them and follow them<font color="#E5E5E5"> later them ok</font>

87
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:24,070
that's a good feedbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so Suresh are</font>

88
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:31,570
we required to continue updating those

89
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:33,219
milestones Association I think it's

90
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:35,650
useful to update the milestones because

91
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,910
it helped me plan like you know when the

92
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,888
documents come through so I don't get

93
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a sudden I have like suddenly 14</font>

94
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:43,210
documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my queue in the last two</font>

95
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:44,740
weeks and it's not it's very difficult

96
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:46,510
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plan to get them until it</font>

97
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">shuts and everything so I I I want to</font>

98
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,060
have an approximate idea when something

99
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:53,620
is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be done so I think it's good</font>

100
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:56,830
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in that case only one person is</font>

101
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,340
using it but he's an important one so

102
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:10,090
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok in that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll continue</font>

103
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:12,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">updating them ok so that's it yeah good</font>

104
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:14,799
morning in far from Georgia telecom

105
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:18,639
first<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so second slide</font>

106
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,979
technical so um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think I presented</font>

107
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,690
this a few meetings back in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HCHO</font>

108
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,570
probably probably going on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

109
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:30,340
years now but a quick refresher about

110
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:34,599
the we're just trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of that</font>

111
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok there is the what and the wise so can</font>

112
00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:38,110
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> go can you go to the first slide</font>

113
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,830
just to sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Greece what this is so</font>

114
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,510
um for soft was we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have fee for</font>

115
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:45,669
configuration and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build a</font>

116
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,200
tunnel in v6 so we've got a few

117
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:51,090
parameters that need to be provisioned

118
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:54,550
to the client last year we published a

119
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:56,530
static provisioning dhcp address which

120
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,910
deals with essentially you have pre

121
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:59,830
configured and kind of deterministic

122
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,410
ways of assigning these<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses to</font>

123
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:04,270
clients and you know that cell that's

124
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,889
implemented and working but some

125
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:09,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">obviously with any color static and</font>

126
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:11,440
pre-configured configuration model isn't

127
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,380
here and wastage in there and it's a not

128
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,870
possible to

129
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,180
you know gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good well address</font>

130
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,680
sharing an aggressive use of the

131
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:21,950
remaining before it sources that you've

132
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,330
got um another particular thing that

133
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:24,860
needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be solved with soft wires is</font>

134
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:27,469
that you need as an operator to know

135
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:29,720
what the clients tunnel endpoint these

136
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,040
six address is going to be so I mean

137
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:32,539
there's there's a way<font color="#E5E5E5"> of kind of pre</font>

138
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,700
calculating that that we've used in the

139
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:36,949
in the static provisioning model but

140
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,169
this provides a way that the client can

141
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,110
just simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the server in a</font>

142
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:43,909
parameter this is what i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

143
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:46,190
and then the server stores that

144
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,900
alongside the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lease information so that</font>

145
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,850
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of single point in the</font>

146
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:52,850
network that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can say this is all the</font>

147
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,710
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> i need for v4 v6 and i can</font>

148
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:59,390
use up to provision the other elements

149
00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:01,370
in the architecture next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> please so</font>

150
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:04,670
um yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been around in software</font>

151
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,730
for some time but hasn't really moved

152
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,020
very far in<font color="#E5E5E5"> there because essentially</font>

153
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,040
everything that's described in here is

154
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:14,960
dhcp 44 / dhcp 6 related so there's two

155
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">RFC's that have already been published</font>

156
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:22,700
both worked on in DHC so that's 73 41

157
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:26,870
and 76 1876 18 deals with address

158
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,610
sharing in v4 least addresses and so as

159
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,710
this is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the final part that</font>

160
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:32,270
makes the whole thing come together it

161
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:35,270
made more sense or hopefully it makes

162
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:38,810
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put it in DAC next slide</font>

163
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:40,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">please alright so here's a kind of a</font>

164
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:43,459
rough overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean it doesn't show</font>

165
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">the full DHCP message flow here but some</font>

166
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:48,950
if you're familiar with DHCP for over<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6</font>

167
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,819
it all starts off by receiving an option

168
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,350
from the dhcp<font color="#E5E5E5"> server that will either</font>

169
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:56,780
either enable it will contain a unicast

170
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:59,240
address for the DHCP for over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 server</font>

171
00:09:56,780 --> 00:10:01,699
you then have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new message</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> flow which</font>

172
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,010
is the DHCP for over 6 1 and in there

173
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:08,950
you're carrying DHCP for messages inside

174
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:12,170
a particular DHCP six message type so

175
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:15,080
within the flow we pass from the server

176
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:19,449
to the client a hint this is in the form

177
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:23,060
of an IP version 6 prefix and this is to

178
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,370
essentially help the client to find the

179
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,030
right address or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the right prefix out of</font>

180
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,180
all the one that's got

181
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:30,740
available so that it can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chance</font>

182
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> getting a SoftWIRE built on the right</font>

183
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,290
place that's going to be rootable and

184
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,560
whatever else the client then builds an

185
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:42,079
address on that prefix and indicates

186
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:43,609
back to the server this is my / 128 that

187
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:45,740
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to use my tunnel endpoint as</font>

188
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,260
my tunnel endpoint<font color="#CCCCCC"> aggress so at that</font>

189
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:50,720
point once all this is completed the

190
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,920
dhcp server has got the while all of the

191
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,870
information that's relevant for the

192
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,579
SoftWIRE crimes and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> this can then</font>

193
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:59,510
be pushed into the other network element

194
00:10:55,580 --> 00:11:02,360
the AFT are using what we're using that

195
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:03,800
come for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this but we talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about using</font>

196
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">things like both of these query and</font>

197
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,089
things like that for it and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

198
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:10,520
point you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a fully functioning</font>

199
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:12,380
soft wire and a dynamically confited

200
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:15,939
address that can be you know works under

201
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:20,180
normal dhcp for kind of thumb leasing

202
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide please so there's two</font>

203
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:24,469
new<font color="#CCCCCC"> options in here the first one being</font>

204
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Prince of the hint option which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

205
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:31,130
just simply a v6 prefix and the second

206
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:32,630
one is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> 128-bit address that will be</font>

207
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,150
used as the tunnel endpoint that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

208
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:39,800
client pass back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the server next</font>

209
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:41,449
slide please this is the kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a ya</font>

210
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,829
the minute a of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly happens at</font>

211
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:46,760
each step and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that it's</font>

212
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:49,070
aligned with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DHCP for message flow</font>

213
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,790
so these messages are the additional new

214
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:54,770
options that I'm talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here are</font>

215
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:57,140
carried<font color="#CCCCCC"> along</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the corresponding v4</font>

216
00:11:54,770 --> 00:12:01,840
message as it goes through the ER than

217
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:04,730
or dhcp for leasing process next<font color="#CCCCCC"> slide</font>

218
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,210
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on an implementation at</font>

219
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:09,590
the moment and it's not completed but

220
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,540
there's already some feedback that's

221
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:14,750
coming back<font color="#E5E5E5"> from there about the text</font>

222
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's in so I submitted the 06 update I</font>

223
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,580
think two days ago that took into

224
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,600
account some of those those things

225
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,550
there's also some other comments that

226
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,160
have come back from from our implementer

227
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,500
and some yeah those those will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> up on</font>

228
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list shortly there was another</font>

229
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:33,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">review that came in fringe in May</font>

230
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:34,579
overnight so some other comments that

231
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:35,930
need to be addressed there there's I

232
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:37,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">think there's still quite a few things</font>

233
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be considered in here at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> moment</font>

234
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's near to being done</font>

235
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,689
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

236
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:43,189
hopefully we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in DAC it'll get</font>

237
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:48,589
the the attention from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right people</font>

238
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:50,329
that it needs next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the</font>

239
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,160
question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really wanted to ask is</font>

240
00:12:50,329 --> 00:12:54,469
do we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is suitable to move to</font>

241
00:12:52,160 --> 00:13:01,779
DHC and if so is it something that would

242
00:12:54,470 --> 00:13:04,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">be adoptable so does anybody have any</font>

243
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,819
opinions one way or the other or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

244
00:13:04,129 --> 00:13:15,019
know supporting moving it or opposed to

245
00:13:07,819 --> 00:13:16,459
seeing building it i'm gern so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i haven't</font>

246
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:21,129
read the draft but from what Ian's

247
00:13:16,459 --> 00:13:21,128
presented it seems sensible enough to me

248
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:26,569
so description i read the draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

249
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,360
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to move here like have you</font>

250
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:31,639
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Terry about it or to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Teddy yes</font>

251
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,339
I before I suggested this as her started

252
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:38,679
okay something<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> um I'm perfectly</font>

253
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:38,679
fine if you do pose to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take it up good</font>

254
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:46,999
okay thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay prepare to let</font>

255
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,610
something to<font color="#CCCCCC"> add oh I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in favor of</font>

256
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:52,610
taking it up okay governor yeah so with

257
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:54,829
my culture cut off i'm also supporting

258
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:57,769
moment<font color="#CCCCCC"> it here so it makes sense it's</font>

259
00:13:54,829 --> 00:14:00,559
reasonable draft and it's a good fit for

260
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:06,319
DC so yeah we also have from the jabber

261
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:10,879
room lengua<font color="#CCCCCC"> son and we both</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> escaped</font>

262
00:14:06,319 --> 00:14:14,360
adopting us so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess one question</font>

263
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,800
though is do you want you know do we

264
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,689
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start working group a call</font>

265
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,410
adoption now do you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to update the</font>

266
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,579
draft and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then start the call given that</font>

267
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:26,480
you mentioned that there were some

268
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:28,248
pending updates um I mean it's just when

269
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,679
I want to put the 06 update that we've

270
00:14:28,249 --> 00:14:32,990
had it had some discussion starting on

271
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:34,730
the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> so let's see how that pans out</font>

272
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,619
I'll make an update based on that and

273
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:38,059
then we'll do the cfa<font color="#CCCCCC"> odd map okay yeah</font>

274
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:39,920
that that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have</font>

275
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:50,420
recommended ok good<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay thanks</font>

281
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:09,670
few open issues that we'd like some

282
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:11,589
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a reminder to</font>

283
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:15,040
sort of where we are today the 05

284

version was published<font color="#E5E5E5"> in june we</font>

285
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,459
initiate a working group last call in

286
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">July which lasted a while and it ended</font>

287
00:15:21,459 --> 00:15:27,819
in august and we got approximately 290

288
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,100
you know comments it wasn't 290 separate

289
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,260
emails but we kind of took everybody's

290
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,610
comments and and chop<font color="#CCCCCC"> them up into</font>

291
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:39,850
individual items that were tracking on a

292
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:43,060
Google<font color="#CCCCCC"> sheet and you know obviously</font>

293
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,190
there were duplicates in there but most

294
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,729
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them are probably unique there are</font>

295
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:52,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">were 16 serious reviewers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know that</font>

296
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:56,920
that generated on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> order of 10 to you</font>

297
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,139
know 30 comments each so there was very

298
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,060
you know I really thank everybody that

299
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:02,949
reviewed it you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys did a fantastic job</font>

300
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,410
this this is the way working through

301
00:16:02,949 --> 00:16:08,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">blessed calls should work and it got</font>

302
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:12,490
excellent coverage so you know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

303
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:15,430
good obviously the bad news is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

304
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:17,829
have 290 issues to go through and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

305
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:20,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">know well I'll talk a little bit more</font>

306
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:22,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of them but you know the</font>

307
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,859
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that it's just a lot of</font>

308
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,860
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've addressed</font>

309
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:29,139
about 200 the comments but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

310
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,670
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go there you know in that last set</font>

311
00:16:29,139 --> 00:16:34,690
there's probably some duplicates as well

312
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:36,819
next<font color="#CCCCCC"> line many of the comments were</font>

313
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,399
minor you know clean up text fix typos

314
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:41,469
formatting issues or inconsistencies

315
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:43,630
where the documents in one part said one

316
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:46,300
thing and kind of contradicted itself in

317
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:48,189
another section usually just stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

318
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,260
we had done when when we edited it we

319
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:53,310
didn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know edit all the text in</font>

320
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,750
certain sections there were a bunch of

321
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:59,050
comments about<font color="#E5E5E5"> clarifying sections</font>

322
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:03,390
adding new more definitions and even

323
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,940
reorganizing the text to improve its

324
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:08,389
presentation and

325
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:10,520
you know logical flow and we have a few

326
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,210
potential changes that we want your

327
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:20,000
input on so the first of those is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

328
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:23,450
soul mix RT and also impacts RT um you

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,660
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the RC 78 III which we never</font>

330
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:30,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">really caught during this is that it</font>

331
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:32,180
never really clarified how the options

332
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,990
should be updated if there are multiple

333
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:40,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advertised or replies</font>

334
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,140
received<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um you know if the client</font>

335
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:44,899
accepts an advertised should have used

336
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,260
just that the options from that and

337
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:50,000
ignore the others um but you know what

338
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:54,230
if it didn't contain options but others

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,970
did and what happens if no advertisers

340
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:58,160
accepted and multiple multiple

341
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:59,630
advertisers are receive so it's a

342
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,850
question of you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> either just</font>

343
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:06,590
say well nobody cared it 79-78 III so

344
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,169
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> leave it alone and just copy the</font>

345
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:14,120
text in here or we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to address</font>

346
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:16,600
this you know one proposal is to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

347
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:22,239
smallest legal value across the received

348
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:25,699
options you know legal there's some

349
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:30,230
boundary checks that are specified in

350
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:31,790
seventy eighty three you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I should</font>

351
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:33,890
point out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a minor</font>

352
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:35,510
issue because on a properly operating

353
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Network you would expect the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> last bullet</font>

354
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:39,290
to apply and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there all the</font>

355
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:42,050
servers if there are multiple servers

356
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:44,450
are gonna use the same values but you

357
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:45,560
know that may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the case mm</font>

358
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:50,080
and I have a comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that particular</font>

359
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:52,580
bullet I think that as a way of avoiding

360
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,260
attacks which you know probably wouldn't

361
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,030
happen on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really you know secure</font>

362
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,450
network but it certainly could happen on

363
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:02,389
a less secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network like a home net um</font>

364
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,190
it is almost certainly a good idea to do

365
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:06,350
the take the smallest length that you

366
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:08,810
here because otherwise somebody can just

367
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:11,810
sit there and send you the you know

368
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:14,540
super<font color="#E5E5E5"> long sull max RT and bam you're</font>

369
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,490
off the wire for however long right and

370
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:18,350
that's what we kind of figured is that

371
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:19,100
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean they can somebody can</font>

372
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:21,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">still</font>

373
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:27,049
do the opposite and give you a small

374
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:29,210
value but that's less harmful suresh

375
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,250
krisshnan so i'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit conflicted here</font>

376
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:33,289
right because like I hear what ted says

377
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,610
like an<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of like doing</font>

378
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:36,740
seventy eighty three was to increase

379
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:39,010
this thing to reduce the traffic volumes

380
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:43,160
right correct in and it did two things

381
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:47,179
783 it changed them the default up and

382
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:49,760
it provided this option to override the

383
00:19:47,179 --> 00:19:51,950
default and if you can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase the</font>

384
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,669
default<font color="#CCCCCC"> I if I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember correctly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

385
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:58,220
that base of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3600 seconds no you can go</font>

386
00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,860
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> to 60</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you go down to 60 right</font>

387
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and so I have an alternate proposal</font>

388
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,120
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> no I haven't thought this out like</font>

389
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just came up with it like if you get</font>

390
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:12,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">like multiple different ones you change</font>

391
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:14,809
to the default which is 3600 because

392
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,460
like then like somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> could like have</font>

393
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:18,020
an attack where they put in like a small

394
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:19,490
number and advertise it and just like

395
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,500
increase the traffic on the link for

396
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,330
notation right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't I just don't</font>

397
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,620
know like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't thought it through</font>

398
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:27,289
but I mean it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that sounds</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font>

399
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:29,209
plausible solution you know the one

400
00:20:27,289 --> 00:20:31,520
thing that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to remember is that a</font>

401
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,380
client isn't necessarily going to wait

402
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,080
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know lots of them to come by</font>

403
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,970
either so but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if it does receive</font>

404
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,678
conflicting values may be the best thing

405
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:43,039
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is you say is just say use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

406
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,179
default and and leave it alone right and

407
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:45,830
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really depends on the implementation</font>

408
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:48,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">too if it's actually keeping track of</font>

409
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:51,110
how it<font color="#E5E5E5"> gots the solar max RT right so</font>

410
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,908
well maybe it can check if it's already

411
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:55,580
non-default but maybe it's not non

412
00:20:52,909 --> 00:20:57,380
trivial but it's yeah and that I didn't

413
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:59,889
bring it up on this slide but there you

414
00:20:57,380 --> 00:21:03,260
know there's there's another little

415
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:07,190
complexity and that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

416
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:09,950
when do you ever set so max RT back to

417
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:13,070
the default suppose you get a large

418
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:14,929
value<font color="#E5E5E5"> or different value</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok when are you</font>

419
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">supposed to set it back because it never</font>

420
00:21:14,929 --> 00:21:21,049
really that 70 83 never really talked

421
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that issue I you know since since</font>

422
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:25,610
you kind of stepped a little bit into it

423
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:28,010
I figure maybe it's work also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

424
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:30,350
address that is to kind of say that

425
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:32,090
maybe you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way is that obviously</font>

426
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">if the client solicits again and gets a</font>

427
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:36,959
different value then it<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

428
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:40,230
is ok I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use that right but</font>

429
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,780
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a subtle issue that you know does</font>

430
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:45,780
exist right and also another thing is

431
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,010
like maybe tom i can answer this like do

432
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,110
you keep track of where you got the

433
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:51,300
solar max Hardy from from itself right

434
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,800
because if if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the server it solves</font>

435
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:55,530
changes the solar max RT like you need

436
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know if it's it's an inconsistency</font>

437
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,310
other so just change the solar max RT

438
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,030
right yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't again it doesn't</font>

439
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:04,020
really talk about that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know so</font>

440
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:07,290
implementation-specific if you really

441
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,760
want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can track of it but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I just</font>

442
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to know about kia like what it</font>

443
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,120
does right sir<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so key is a server</font>

444
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,650
only so yeah this is really we'd have to

445
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,810
ask client implementers and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

446
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,330
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many you know Tim might know whether</font>

447
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:25,679
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot that have implemented</font>

448
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:28,230
seventy eighty three or not so come

449
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,630
winners UNH i well so we've only really

450
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,720
seen it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in home gateways most of them</font>

451
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,460
when you reboot them will lose it yeah

452
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,130
well that make sense and really<font color="#E5E5E5"> learn it</font>

453
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,790
I do have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that keep it forever and</font>

454
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:44,370
that's been oh that's been interesting

455
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,990
so we might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say something about</font>

456
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">this because I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suspect more people will</font>

457
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,980
just take whatever new value they get

458
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,540
and apply it forever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's nasty it</font>

459
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,400
is nasty if you set<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to a high value</font>

460
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:55,139
it's going to sit for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a while but I mean</font>

461
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:57,270
I will say this is a unique test case or

462
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:59,490
any case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it means there's nothing</font>

463
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:01,320
answering it so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much we</font>

464
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,910
care to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in crazy text here to try</font>

465
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">right well that's the other question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

466
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:08,520
that is kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a failure case anyway or</font>

467
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">RK an odd case anyway Ted lemon so um a</font>

468
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,970
couple things one I think suresh's

469
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,850
suggestion is great if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

470
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:18,570
conflicting values use use the default

471
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:21,090
yes um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not</font>

472
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:25,110
likely to be a problem in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> typical</font>

473
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:27,510
use case for this in the sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

474
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:31,080
know if your cable modem goes and sends

475
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:33,150
out a solicit it's on a cable network

476
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,790
there is relatively tightly constrained

477
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:37,320
and controlled and so the likelihood of

478
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,629
you getting an attack from some

479
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">third-party on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that network is pretty</font>

480
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:44,340
slim and it's not a bad idea to have

481
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:46,210
this this you know this fall back but

482
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:48,520
but I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a really serious</font>

483
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,530
I issue it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a serious issue on</font>

484
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,889
a home net but on home that you know I

485
00:23:50,530 --> 00:24:01,750
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suresh is solution works fine um</font>

486
00:23:52,890 --> 00:24:05,110
and uh i'm going to say sorry or your

487
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:07,330
second point was about oh right i think

488
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:09,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the time to discard the value is</font>

489
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:11,139
whenever you see a link state transition

490
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,330
right and implicitly also that means on

491
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:14,860
a reboot because otherwise you know

492
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,000
certainly for for cable modems you're

493
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,889
not likely to ever see link state

494
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,840
transition it's not a big deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if</font>

495
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,430
you do like you know if one of the

496
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,750
things that cable providers will do is

497
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:26,050
they'll whack your link<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get you to</font>

498
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,390
restart to re initialize so yeah and

499
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:31,540
that that does<font color="#CCCCCC"> raise a funny question</font>

500
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,820
about you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know should should these</font>

501
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:40,180
options then be allowed in in the

502
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:41,580
confirm um you know refined case right

503
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's what you're going to do</font>

504
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:48,159
when the link yeah flips so you know

505
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,870
maybe it doesn't matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> because you're</font>

506
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,970
not soliciting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in that case and so we</font>

507
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:53,889
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that may just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

508
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the answer right is you could restore</font>

509
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:58,180
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you do if you do ever fall back</font>

510
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:59,950
just look phase you'll get new values or

511
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:01,360
so maybe that's the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve that is</font>

512
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,280
it doesn't eat it's not necessary

513
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,889
because of that<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we'll</font>

514
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:10,000
probably you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that somebody from the</font>

515
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:11,710
biz team will summarize and provide the

516
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,270
suggestions for confirmation on the

517
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,360
mailing list and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can discuss a lit</font>

518
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:20,950
for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> issue so another</font>

519
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,949
request that we received was to remove

520
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:30,280
the following paragraph from section 17

521
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:32,320
1 10 1 and we believe this is to allow

522
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,170
to run multiple independent state

523
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,080
machines on a single interface oh this

524
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:41,260
isn't the updated slides but anyway is

525
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,330
to discourage but allow is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

526
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,370
we wanted to say to run multiple

527
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:48,490
independent state machines on a single

528
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:50,110
interface and we got to feel that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

529
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:52,720
you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do something</font>

530
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">as complicated as that you should take</font>

531
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">that text with a grain of salt you know</font>

532
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:01,800
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> all required leases and and</font>

533
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:03,540
that means just<font color="#CCCCCC"> those for which that</font>

534
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">state machine is kind of running because</font>

535
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:06,600
we kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of say at the beginning of this</font>

536
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,430
document somewhere I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we kind of</font>

537
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,280
talked about that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is sort</font>

538
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:16,140
of a single instance of a dhcp client

539
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:18,300
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would run a different one on</font>

540
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,930
each interface and things like that so

541
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:42,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">it I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to remove this</font>

542
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:46,590
this paragraph or even reword it so um

543
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,300
Ted lemon my only reason for not loving

544
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:52,919
this text is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does have the</font>

545
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:54,629
effect that if you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> running to DHCP</font>

546
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,980
servers on a link one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is doing</font>

547
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,150
neighbor discover sorry one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> which is</font>

548
00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:01,110
doing PD and 10 which is doing na then

549
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:04,230
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to make you do a lot more</font>

550
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:06,000
work but well we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really support</font>

551
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,430
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibly not a great thing to be doing</font>

552
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:11,600
anyways right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not a problem and</font>

553
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:15,090
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the you know the this</font>

554
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:18,659
7550 staple issues kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> route them</font>

555
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,939
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you</font>

556
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,350
want to build a client that does that I

557
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:24,240
don't think you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> prohibited from doing</font>

558
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:26,820
that right and you might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use a</font>

559
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,800
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> iaid anyway because presumably</font>

560
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:33,149
you have some reason why you're doing it

561
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:35,250
right yeah ok so again we'll take this

562
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:38,570
to the list with a summary<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what we</font>

563
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:42,960
kind of concluded here and confirm next

564
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:46,230
so the last one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

565
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,070
about ipsec encryption and we got a

566
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment that you know we kind of now say</font>

567
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:56,399
that the null encryption can be used

568
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:58,110
because DCB messages uh you know that

569
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,920
the data in there is not generally

570
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:04,469
considered confidential and you know

571
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,910
that's that's very debatable today

572
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,940
because there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

573
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:12,090
iesg about this and that's why i wrote

574
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,049
the relay server security draft which

575
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,480
did

576
00:28:13,049 --> 00:28:19,289
mandate but kind of highly recommended

577
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:23,489
ipsec usage so you know I'd like to just

578
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:25,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">drop the text in from that document but</font>

579
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:28,080
that document is in working group last

580
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:30,809
call well they kind of technically

581
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,850
expired but hasn't yet really been

582
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:35,668
processed and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was only wanting</font>

583
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,279
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> comment on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and as a co-author that</font>

584
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,570
probably doesn't count much so we

585
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:42,419
encourage people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at that</font>

586
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:43,950
document and indicate whether you know

587
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,470
you support this because then we can

588
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">just drop a lot of this text from that</font>

589
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:56,549
document into the 33 15 biz so i will

590
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,759
send something<font color="#CCCCCC"> Colless on this as well</font>

591
00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:01,249
but again I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the solution is</font>

592
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:07,019
support the working group last call on

593
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:09,239
the relay server security draft and then

594
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:13,019
if everybody supports that we can

595
00:29:09,239 --> 00:29:15,389
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just copy that text and that</font>

596
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,710
will also i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think make the iesg happier</font>

597
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:21,869
that we have a bit stronger statement

598
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:27,869
about security and<font color="#CCCCCC"> things ok that's all</font>

599
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:34,439
I had for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the next steps for the</font>

600
00:29:27,869 --> 00:29:39,330
document are that uh you know a what was

601
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,999
it yeah thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all the comments but</font>

602
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:44,480
you know if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some that our</font>

603
00:29:41,999 --> 00:29:47,309
cellar it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not too late we'll take them</font>

604
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,409
you know we did publish the 06 which has

605
00:29:47,309 --> 00:29:51,980
some of the updates and it's possible

606
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:54,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we made some mistakes and stuff so</font>

607
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,299
we'll continue to work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

608
00:29:54,359 --> 00:30:00,269
hopefully publish in 07 our hope is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

609
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,970
do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> before the next ITF so that we</font>

610
00:30:00,269 --> 00:30:05,580
can do a short review of the document

611
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:09,179
with all the changes and hopefully send

612
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:14,279
it off with maybe an 08 published to

613
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:17,899
suresh shortly after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next IETF so</font>

614
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,899
that's how we'll update those milestones

615
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:31,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay thank you</font>

616
00:30:21,779 --> 00:30:38,429
ah ok so this will be a very brief

617
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:41,549
presentation so we had the force<font color="#CCCCCC"> honey</font>

618
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:45,299
next slide please so we had the first

619
00:30:41,549 --> 00:30:48,179
renewal extensions this was drafted was

620
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:55,109
presented in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Buenos Aires it was adopted</font>

621
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:57,809
in may 2016 16 the response doing the

622
00:30:55,109 --> 00:31:00,089
presentation and adoption it was not

623
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:01,799
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> popular but in general people who</font>

624
00:31:00,089 --> 00:31:04,139
expressed their opinions they were in

625
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:08,009
favor so after death there were

626
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:11,699
completely no updates no discussions we

627
00:31:08,009 --> 00:31:15,839
tried to reach the outers also primary

628
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:18,570
alto liu yuan she used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for</font>

629
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:22,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">microsoft but she's now in a different</font>

630
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:27,418
team so our site of<font color="#E5E5E5"> microsoft and the</font>

631
00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:30,869
draft has expired so when next so the

632
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:35,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">question is are we still interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

633
00:31:30,869 --> 00:31:37,738
<font color="#E5E5E5">this work we I think we try to reach the</font>

634
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:42,509
other routers three times and nobody

635
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:48,299
responded so is there anyone interested

636
00:31:42,509 --> 00:31:51,029
in in this work to continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I</font>

637
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:53,460
don't see anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay in that case we'll</font>

638
00:31:51,029 --> 00:31:55,589
go and quit option we just drop the work

639
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,539
so we will mark it as they attend but

640
00:31:55,589 --> 00:32:00,299
will confirm on the mail I'm us<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

641
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:03,839
make sure that nobody else has any okay

642
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:07,619
right yeah before before taking that

643
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:09,178
action my purse mm I my personal feeling

644
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:10,499
is I don't object anybody continuing

645
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,059
this work if somebody wants to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it but</font>

646
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:20,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have no interest in continuing it</font>

647
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:24,349
myself okay and it's v4 so it's yeah

648
00:32:20,249 --> 00:32:24,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that's it thanks</font>

649
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:44,049
okay so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd like to talk about possibly</font>

650
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:51,070
resurrecting an old draft that we

651
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:55,000
started work on next slide back in 2005

652
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,830
of October was when the original draft

653
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,710
was written it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> adopted by the</font>

654
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:03,158
working group back in January 2006 kind

655
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:06,850
of lingered there for several years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

656
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:09,220
in January 09 the 04 was was published

657
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:13,320
which is the current version it

658
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:16,059
obviously has long since expired and

659
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,279
interest was primarily lost because

660
00:33:16,059 --> 00:33:21,279
there were if I if I remember correctly

661
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,700
there was a concern about<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of order</font>

662
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:29,529
packets might cause issues and the other

663
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:32,080
issue was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> CableLabs had had</font>

664
00:33:29,529 --> 00:33:34,090
specified in<font color="#E5E5E5"> relay agents were starting</font>

665
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">to implement just doing relay snooping</font>

666
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,620
just to say done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> dhcp v4 because it</font>

667
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,590
worked great for v4 so why not use<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

668
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:45,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">for v6 so the working group was a bit</font>

669
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:49,600
too late in sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of doing this work next</font>

670
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:52,240
slide so why now well you know the

671
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,658
original motivation was we wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

672
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,610
avoid relay snooping<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know they</font>

673
00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:00,370
shouldn't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look really shouldn't</font>

674
00:33:57,610 --> 00:34:04,330
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look inside the individual</font>

675
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:06,070
client messages to determine what Lisa's

676
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:08,230
the client was assigned or what other

677
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:10,480
actions like you know when a client

678
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:14,290
release<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elise that that the least was</font>

679
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,060
removed and today the or the original

680
00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,250
argument was that if we had strong

681
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:23,109
security some at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some point security</font>

682
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:25,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">might make this impossible we also want</font>

683
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:28,810
to reduce complexity for relays because

684
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,790
some relay messages<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sorry some reply</font>

685
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:33,070
messages do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> details on what the</font>

686
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:34,899
client did for example a release doesn't

687
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:37,330
you know the release message<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

688
00:34:34,899 --> 00:34:39,759
the server<font color="#CCCCCC"> has a list of addresses and</font>

689
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:41,620
prefixes that might be released but

690
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,960
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reply coming back has nothing it</font>

691
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,719
just basically says yeah I<font color="#CCCCCC"> released your</font>

692
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,550
addresses its success or failure usually

693
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,500
just success<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so there's no</font>

694
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,270
information for the relay so it makes

695
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,880
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> relays job a bit harder because it</font>

696
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:58,450
has to monitor<font color="#E5E5E5"> the clients request not</font>

697
00:34:54,880 --> 00:35:00,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">just the replies and the idea</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

698
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:03,040
with this is that the server provides

699
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,070
the relay explicit details in the rear

700
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,230
wheel a reply message about what it's

701
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:10,780
done what Lisa's<font color="#E5E5E5"> its assigned or</font>

702
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:16,270
extended lifetimes on or<font color="#CCCCCC"> even those that</font>

703
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:19,570
it released next slide so the design<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

704
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:23,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know the relay added in Oro</font>

705
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:25,360
with this new option to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the relay</font>

706
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:28,180
forward and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of was a little</font>

707
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:30,040
bit unique in that the Oro you know

708
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:32,500
tended to be more views just<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the</font>

709
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,230
client whereas here it was making use of

710
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:38,110
it by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the real I now we could have a</font>

711
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:41,500
relay echo option if we want you know I

712
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:44,410
sorry a real a request option if we

713
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,810
wanted to an<font color="#CCCCCC"> RR 0 instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of an Oro but</font>

714
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:49,089
it probably isn't you know I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

715
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:51,400
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of doing that because it's</font>

716
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:53,650
clear where this this message this

717
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">option would be in the relay forward</font>

718
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:59,230
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the message not in the clients</font>

719
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,060
message and the server added this option

720
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,270
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real a reply with all the</font>

721
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:09,549
addresses and prefixes in use by the

722
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:11,320
client<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pretty much the you know real</font>

723
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:15,520
agent was only supposed to use the valid

724
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:17,470
lifetimes and about<font color="#E5E5E5"> lifetime is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 meant</font>

725
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,990
that the address<font color="#E5E5E5"> or prefix was released</font>

726
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:21,879
and again the advantage here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is relays</font>

727
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,100
no longer need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the clients</font>

728
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:28,450
message and it's explicitly notified of

729
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:30,520
server actions next slide so the problem

730
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:34,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">today is that we're working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on secure</font>

731
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:38,140
dhcpv6 which is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encrypt the</font>

732
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,150
messages so the client to server

733
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:45,670
communication is encrypted so relay

734
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:47,740
snooping no longer works so what do we

735
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:49,600
do well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in the short term</font>

736
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:52,720
assuming that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we can get the</font>

737
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,410
secure dhcpv6 work done will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

738
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,540
certain

739
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:59,770
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> real a snooping is required such</font>

740
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:02,050
as in cable<font color="#E5E5E5"> docsis they won't may be</font>

741
00:36:59,770 --> 00:37:04,990
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support secure dhcpv6 option</font>

742
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:08,920
maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a big deal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but you know it is</font>

743
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:10,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">it is there um another option</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

744
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,060
the one I'm proposing is we resurrect

745
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,160
this draft and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think some of the</font>

746
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:17,440
issues that were raised about it are

747
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:20,170
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty minor because relay</font>

748
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,180
snooping can suffer from the same out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

749
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:23,590
order packet delivery issues and things

750
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:26,859
like that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been done very</font>

751
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:28,570
successfully without to my knowledge any

752
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:31,840
significant problems or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems at</font>

753
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,180
all so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that was probably an</font>

754
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:36,280
overrated issue you know was a nice

755
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:39,879
conceptual issue but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it wasn't probably</font>

756
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:43,300
a realistic issue um you know another

757
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:45,940
option is if you do secure dhcpv6 maybe

758
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,980
the you have to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

759
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:49,570
server certificates but<font color="#CCCCCC"> Suresh shakes</font>

760
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,990
his head<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i agreed that i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

761
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:54,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's a very good idea either um you</font>

762
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,229
know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are other options like having</font>

763
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:59,440
the real i used actively square e to

764
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:01,810
keep up with updates which that that

765
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,210
would be a fairly workable solution

766
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:07,000
potentially um you know and we could

767
00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:12,910
develop yet another protocol but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't</font>

768
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we want to do that either so next</font>

769
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:19,660
slide so what do people think do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do</font>

770
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:21,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">we want to resurrect this do we want to</font>

771
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:24,310
wait a little bit further until<font color="#E5E5E5"> secure</font>

772
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:31,500
dhcpv6 is further along do we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

773
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:34,090
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something else telemon um so I</font>

774
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,630
actually kind of liked your active<font color="#E5E5E5"> lease</font>

775
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:40,270
query idea the reason being<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

776
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:43,360
eliminates the concern about timing

777
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,740
right because now you're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

778
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,240
actual communication between the real

779
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,709
agent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the server and it's also</font>

780
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,410
something that real agents that do

781
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:52,390
snooping are likely to want to do anyway

782
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,069
right for example they might they'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

783
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:55,810
to do both<font color="#E5E5E5"> query for lease query for</font>

784
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,240
example when they reboot because they

785
00:38:55,810 --> 00:38:59,890
can collect all the state yeah yeah or

786
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,299
you know it could be that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> even just</font>

787
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">do at least query whenever you see a</font>

788
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,960
release go by or whenever you well now

789
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,950
you have yeah you do have to do it well

790
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,900
the problem is yeah

791
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:09,939
again when we encrypt right you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

792
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,440
all you're gonna see is a packet went by

793
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,290
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna know right right what's</font>

794
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,480
in it yeah so that said I don't have any

795
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,770
objection to doing the other solution I

796
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,510
just I just think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

797
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,250
seriously<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it's probably</font>

798
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">worth actually thinking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

799
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:25,839
plausible a solution it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to use active</font>

800
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:27,160
lease query if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that it's not</font>

801
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,589
really going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work then we shouldn't</font>

802
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,420
do it but we should at least answer that

803
00:39:29,589 --> 00:39:33,670
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> before we develop a new thing</font>

804
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:36,670
because you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are now putting more</font>

805
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:38,290
junk into the dhcp packet and you know

806
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:40,420
if there's if there's a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

807
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:42,009
it maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should just do that and and</font>

808
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,570
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> active least query at least in</font>

809
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,760
principle is a better way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that</font>

810
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:48,310
yeah the only I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only objection</font>

811
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,290
that that might exist and again it's

812
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:53,740
only a theoretical thing at this point

813
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:55,900
would be that actively square e you know

814
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,348
is a separate communication channel yeah

815
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so the timing of it might be a</font>

816
00:39:59,349 --> 00:40:02,829
little bit interesting because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

817
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,920
if you let things go to the client

818
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:08,170
traffic might appear before the active

819
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,030
lease query makes it through especially

820
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,950
if there's like a hiccup where the

821
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:14,530
actively scary query connection goes

822
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:16,480
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it's TCP bays and has to be</font>

823
00:40:14,530 --> 00:40:18,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">restarted and things like that so I</font>

824
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,579
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the only concern</font>

825
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:24,310
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know might exist because if you</font>

826
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:26,050
do want to you know if like on a CMT s

827
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,630
where you're installing a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

828
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:30,609
state when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> get this stuff they would</font>

829
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,619
really like to do it sort of as the

830
00:40:30,609 --> 00:40:35,950
packet goes back to the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

831
00:40:32,619 --> 00:40:38,950
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only benefit I think for</font>

832
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the this option is that it's it's you</font>

833
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:43,180
know will happen at the same time<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

834
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:44,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">right maybe a better way to put it would</font>

835
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:48,009
be that active least query is a good

836
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,839
thing to do in addition to this just

837
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:52,089
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will clean up any mistakes</font>

838
00:40:49,839 --> 00:41:00,099
that happen that that could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an</font>

839
00:40:52,089 --> 00:41:07,900
argument yes yeah so anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have</font>

840
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:09,400
any comments pro<font color="#E5E5E5"> or con or suresh</font>

841
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,930
krisshnan I don't have any<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

842
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:14,560
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> either I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't three and five</font>

843
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:17,440
so I'm okay<font color="#CCCCCC"> with like 12 and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> four and I</font>

844
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,869
would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to wait until security</font>

845
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,849
ICP<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 like gets out and</font>

846
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:23,890
to see if like people<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issues before</font>

847
00:41:21,849 --> 00:41:26,650
we do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like because and they had</font>

848
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,328
similar things with send you know like

849
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,329
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of stuff done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it</font>

850
00:41:28,329 --> 00:41:33,640
never got the plight so like uh I don't

851
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:35,880
know like it's I'm fine with like

852
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,519
continuing working on this but I'm just

853
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,740
wanna see like uptake before um doing

854
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:44,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really yeah and I think it'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be I</font>

855
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:46,959
I agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've had</font>

856
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:50,078
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long road with the secure dhcpv6</font>

857
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,539
work and so it may be still be a little

858
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:54,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit premature to start something because</font>

859
00:41:52,539 --> 00:42:00,700
we don't know how it's gonna end yet

860
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:03,038
right um but hopefully hopefully one of

861
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:05,319
these days<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get a security</font>

862
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:08,950
mechanism that works right I mean so

863
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:11,288
yeah but so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

864
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:16,049
recommendation is that we we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

865
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:16,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">park this for now and revisit</font>

866
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:24,059
periodically depending on how secure

867
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:27,220
dhcpv6 your some<font color="#E5E5E5"> though for exact okay</font>

868
00:42:24,059 --> 00:42:31,269
and I'm perfectly happy with that I

869
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you know I think um yeah I you</font>

870
00:42:31,269 --> 00:42:34,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">know was a little bit leery about</font>

871
00:42:32,410 --> 00:42:36,910
bringing this up this early because I

872
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,430
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how secure d cv v6 is going</font>

873
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:41,470
to work out there there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

874
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:43,348
some there are some subtle benefits for

875
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:46,238
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it solves like the release</font>

876
00:42:43,349 --> 00:42:49,119
problem and things like that so there

877
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:50,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">are some advantages in using this or the</font>

878
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,640
active least square solution because the

879
00:42:50,950 --> 00:43:01,118
the relay does get more more<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date</font>

880
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:02,470
information Tim Chang might be a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

881
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,769
a naive question what about things like

882
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:08,230
69 39 where the relays doing something

883
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:10,959
based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the client does is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

884
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:13,119
issue was that irrelevant uh which is

885
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,700
that document that's the one where you

886
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:17,559
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> squeeze the mac address of the</font>

887
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,509
client to get it into the relay to

888
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:21,819
forward it for the people that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

889
00:43:19,509 --> 00:43:24,400
warm comfy slippers are wanting to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

890
00:43:21,819 --> 00:43:27,250
McEnaney know the link is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that an issue</font>

891
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,410
or that type of thing

892
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:31,750
no cuz that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the link layer is that the</font>

893
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:34,960
link layer that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really odd fence so</font>

894
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:36,730
that was a misunderstood yeah okay um

895
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,850
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be encrypted with</font>

896
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:41,980
ipsec but that's a that you know the

897
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:51,720
relays and and stuff will know how to do

898
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you thank you uh</font>

899
00:43:53,460 --> 00:44:04,180
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings us to the end of our</font>

900
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:07,570
formal agenda so if there's any<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

901
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,069
things people want to discuss briefly we

902
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:13,210
can certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a few minutes to do</font>

903
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:17,470
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> but otherwise call meeting adjourned</font>

904
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:23,680
and this was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the shortest DHC</font>

905
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:35,980
meeting ever we could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

906
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:37,450
Emmental bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> tintern so I shouldn't</font>

907
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,570
mention this if you want to get away<font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

908
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:44,290
there is a discussion in six-man about

909
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:46,510
updating RFC 6434 just the node

910
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,840
requirements document and there are some

911
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:51,730
words in there about DHC and support for

912
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:55,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">THC and there are some people in six-man</font>

913
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:57,400
that have suggested<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the heb support</font>

914
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:59,380
should be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> May and not assured that</font>

915
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,790
type of thing I don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

916
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,010
this point having a discussion here now

917
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,840
with 10 people but if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear that</font>

918
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:08,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">our interested can take a look at the</font>

919
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,600
DHT relevant bits in 6434 and suggest

920
00:45:08,770 --> 00:45:12,310
some words either that they think those

921
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:15,279
are still fine or suggests words to

922
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:17,890
replace those chunks in 6434 that would

923
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,770
be useful thank you yes that isn't a

924
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:23,560
good point and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should follow</font>

925
00:45:20,770 --> 00:45:26,200
that work and stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with it because</font>

926
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:29,430
just to see where it goes and comment on

927
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:37,529
anything that's really as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you see there</font>

934
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:31,799
that did a lot of the the etherpad thank

935
00:47:08,579 --> 00:47:17,259
you so we will make some modification

936
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:19,420
what to focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the motivation right so</font>

937
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:22,200
you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> explain you know what</font>

it is you're trying to
