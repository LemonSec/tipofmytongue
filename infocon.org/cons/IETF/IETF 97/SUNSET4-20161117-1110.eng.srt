00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:57,888

draft I want to sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of review some</font>

53
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,890
action items from the last me this sort

54
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:28,799
of the notes that I took away from our

55
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,710
last face

56
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,599
meeting first of all is we asked that

57
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:37,198
suggested the IV could make a statements

58
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:39,180
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> SD OS on ipv6 done we are still</font>

59
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,949
working the mechanics of actually

60
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:43,830
getting our liaisons to send<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to the</font>

61
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:46,770
stos not all<font color="#E5E5E5"> stos need that statement</font>

62
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,780
for instance or not all of our liaisons

63
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:51,060
need to for that statement for instance

64
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,198
i can has actually done you know they've

65
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,000
got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website they're not doing</font>

66
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:54,990
networking protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're they're in</font>

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,150
pretty good shape the statement doesn't

68
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:03,150
apply um iesg statement on ipv4 work so

69
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:05,250
the iesg said you know we probably could

70
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:09,000
say something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> continued ipv4 work</font>

71
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,430
or stopping a ipv4 work but it would be

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,110
much stronger to have an ietf consensus

73
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,050
statement on that and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why I'm</font>

74
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,580
back so that's what I'm doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one</font>

75
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:20,039
we could update the v4 historic draft

76
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,080
I've got a note on that a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute draft</font>

77
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:24,659
PHP<font color="#CCCCCC"> Phillip Holland Baker had ideas</font>

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,940
about ipv4 sunset is complicated and

79
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,289
what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> steps might be I've asked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> him a</font>

80
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,849
couple of<font color="#CCCCCC"> times hey do you want to work</font>

81
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:31,289
on a document can I help what would you

82
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:34,069
like to see in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I haven't heard</font>

83
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:36,180
back so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what status is they're</font>

84
00:05:34,069 --> 00:05:38,099
updating the I<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dean its checkered to</font>

85
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,139
check for ipv4 literals that was done

86
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:42,419
while we were in Buenos Aires that was

87
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:43,650
fantastic cleaning up documents that

88
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:45,389
have V for liberals examples of

89
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:46,529
dependencies I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's going</font>

90
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:48,180
to I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this probably gonna be</font>

91
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:51,270
a major effort to go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and revise</font>

92
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,710
existing rfcs that have those<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

93
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,090
something I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think everybody ought to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

94
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,039
paying attention to as we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:57,929
document drafts coming through and I

96
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that and then</font>

00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,869
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> knock then we can start working</font>

119
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,449
through what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the broken issues and</font>

120
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,419
either then reveal issues back to IETF

go thurs escape so Mike you can speak

126
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:22,490
the real question is is net 64 the

127
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:25,638
correct ipv4 mmv 6mm protocol to use

128
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:29,720
there are others which have less impacts

129
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:35,210
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> user than that 64 and then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> s6</font>

lots of operational issues which<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

Charlie palette I think that's that's

161
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,480
actually the problem we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to first</font>

162
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:09,140
define what is our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and our lawless</font>

163
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,090
break things or allow the people to keep

164
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,430
working without breaking things and at

165
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,470
the same time make sure that every

166
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:18,439
single keep working in the future which

167
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:20,600

mention already in the in the plenary

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,720
mailing list what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is not</font>

170
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:29,120
use just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half solution like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> nat64</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

171
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,280
need a solution that<font color="#E5E5E5"> behaves like in the</font>

172
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,600
real world and the real war is people

173
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:37,970
having private<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv4 addresses and</font>

174
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,840
probably as more<font color="#E5E5E5"> the times goals on</font>

175
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll have ipv6 only access and that's</font>

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,270
not not 64 because applications still

177
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,689
use little<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses like Spotify skype</font>

178
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:52,939
and so on so what we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is to</font>

179
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">try that solution in our own network as</font>

180
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:59,300
primary as SSID and at the same time in

181
00:09:56,450 --> 00:10:04,340
the select if for example we choose X

<font color="#E5E5E5">for a 4</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 X lat in the Select diamond</font>

183
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:09,890
in our first hop router have some kind

184
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:12,490
of logging that allows us to identify

185
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,590
what applications are using the select

186
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:18,080
which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in future meetings we</font>

187
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:21,020
can have tall those application vendors

188
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:24,560
this is not working sort it out and then

189
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we can go to a solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only not 64</font>

190
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:33,229
but first we need an intermediate<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

191
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:36,410
stage German<font color="#CCCCCC"> koi I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are a lot</font>

of networks around Eugene has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> sadya</font>

193
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:41,300
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 vis v6 only because it's from</font>

194
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,089
operational perspective it's much better

195
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,339
than heaven doorstep and there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

196
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:51,110
lotta stuff and I do not think that

197
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:53,330
introducing this as a default IETF SSID

198
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,640
will break<font color="#E5E5E5"> addition because there are</font>

199
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,980
other SSID always fall back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a</font>

200
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,650
stack if you have problem so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

201
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:04,010
we've done a tripe at some point right

202
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:05,209
so it will it was communicated to users

203
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,699
please try

204
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:09,739
v6 only if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have problems which back</font>

205
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,569
to dual stack and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you fix your you</font>

206
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:14,720
show cave and all we know it's because

207
00:11:11,569 --> 00:11:16,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">of I v6</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all right now we need to</font>

208
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">stop here it's not the main topic</font>

209
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,410
awfully sorry I would think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

210
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">great for the list though right we've</font>

211
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:25,160
started this conversation on the list

212
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:30,079
let's carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on there alright so I</font>

213
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:32,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned that I would come back and ok</font>

214
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,998
doesn't work next slide and next slide

215
00:11:32,119 --> 00:11:36,230
so I have not updated v4 historic

216
00:11:34,999 --> 00:11:37,790
because i didn't think that folks were

217
00:11:36,230 --> 00:11:39,649
actually ready to talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

218
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:41,748
just yet these are the three fairly

219
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:44,959
minor notes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had from the last</font>

220
00:11:41,749 --> 00:11:46,519
meeting on the updates to make so if you

221
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,729
want other updates net send it to the

222
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:52,639
list and i'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> them done next slide</font>

223
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:56,059
so today's draft and work on ipv4 next

224
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,279
slide the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abstract says the IETF will</font>

225
00:11:56,059 --> 00:12:00,350
stop working on ipv4 except where needed

226
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,480
to mitigate documented security issues

227
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,790
to facilitate the transition to ipv6 or

228
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,860
2<font color="#CCCCCC"> enable ipv4 decommissioning this is</font>

229
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,509
what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this is in</font>

230
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:10,160
some ways similar to the previous drafts

231
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:12,470
but this is again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the goal of this</font>

232
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">document is we had asked the iesg to</font>

233
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:17,179
make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement about not chartering</font>

234
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,589
new ipv4 work and that's so that's

235
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:21,350
that's what I'm try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it here next</font>

236
00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:23,179
slide I think it'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> be incredibly boring</font>

237
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:26,089
if I actually read all the slides to you

238
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:28,639
because they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of beads of</font>

239
00:12:26,089 --> 00:12:31,389
text like this but if you'll take 20

240
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,389
seconds to read this

241
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:49,940
okay obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> what I'm trying to do is</font>

242
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">give everybody a chance to read the</font>

243
00:12:49,940 --> 00:13:03,170
draft I have the entire draft up here

244
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:04,220
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> words the one note i want</font>

245
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,219
to emphasize here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have it</font>

246
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:09,350
emphasized on the slide is that ipv4

247
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:11,600
focused activities in some in support of

248
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,430
security transition and decommissioning

249
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,860
will continue and maybe i should say

250
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:17,810
orchid decommissioning where accompanied

251
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,190
by a problem statement if nobody commits

252
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,380
based on operational experience if

253
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:24,050
nobody can say this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an actual problem</font>

254
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:26,990
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a philosophical problem or a</font>

255
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:34,579
speculative speculated problem I let's

256
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:36,710
not work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it okay next slide so it's</font>

257
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:38,570
will update protocols and features to

258
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:41,060
facilitate decommissioning will

259
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,040
explicitly support ipv6 or if<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's IP</font>

260
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,650
version agnostic because it's a higher

261
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:50,110
in the stack for instance then that's

262
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:52,189
fine except for<font color="#E5E5E5"> we still do ipv4 up</font>

263
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:53,780
except that before specific transition

264
00:13:52,190 --> 00:14:00,140
technologies which I come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you on</font>

265
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:03,319
the next slide to say we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

266
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:06,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">initiate any new ipv4 extension</font>

267
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:08,980
technology development and the point

268
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,900
there is we can work on and this is a

269
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,290
potential point for discussion we could

270
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,280
work on additional transition mechanisms

271
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:17,719
maybe somebody has a great idea we

272
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,480
haven't come up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with yet and it's not</font>

273
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,420
too late to design and deploy it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I doubt</font>

274
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,550
it but any<font color="#CCCCCC"> training future transition</font>

275
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:27,439
mechanisms we might work on or you know

276
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:29,990
or enhancing our existing transition

277
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,220
mechanisms we won't work on ipv4

278
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,690
extension mechanisms so ipv4 address

279
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,830
sharing probably isn't a place that we

280
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:38,900
really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a whole lot more</font>

281
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:42,470
time because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> only so much</font>

282
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:44,930
further we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go next slide there is</font>

283
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:46,730
security considerations um pretty much

284
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:47,810
the same that you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen before maybe</font>

285
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:49,670
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an issue that we've</font>

286
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:51,920
discovered an ipv4 I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

287
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,149
it's been fairly robustly tested but it

288
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,810
possible that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are inherent</font>

289
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:59,269
security flaws in the ipv4 spec so if so

290
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:02,268
we can document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and mitigate them next</font>

291
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:04,760
slide there we go so I'm looking for

292
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:06,740
comments and obviously we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna want</font>

293
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make some revisions but I would love</font>

294
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:11,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see whether this should be adopted as</font>

295
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:15,320
a working of document so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Chris</font>

296
00:15:11,959 --> 00:15:20,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">powers and I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like to see some wording</font>

297
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:24,079
in there that allows for the iesg when

298
00:15:20,389 --> 00:15:27,350
evaluating charters to sort of include

299
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,209
the impact the actual impact because so

300
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:32,329
on you know focusing on perhaps

301
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:36,888
applications as opposed to in my case

302
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:40,719
routing protocols as a good example<font color="#CCCCCC"> ospf</font>

303
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:46,430
uses as a system identifier a router ID

304
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:49,910
whereas is is uses a system ID that so I

305
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:52,969
I think it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a bit a waste of</font>

306
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for ospf to try to now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font>

307
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:57,890
ospfv3 but it's not been particularly

308
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,529
widely deployed and there's good

309
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,529
applications for just straight old ospf

310
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:07,850
for carrying mpls information which can

311
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:10,910
then carry ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> i I think it would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font>

312
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:14,870
waste of time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to make that router</font>

313
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,069
ID ipv6 and so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see</font>

314
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:18,769
though so we don't have this argument

315
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,529
later on I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see wording and</font>

316
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:24,920
here that makes that exemption pretty

317
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:27,140
clear yeah I can see that technically

318
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,819
the ospf router ID is not actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

319
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,529
ipv4 address right it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 32-bit</font>

320
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,470
integer that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody uses an ipv4</font>

321
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:35,000
address right but it's a pair<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

322
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,339
think tonight yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> just making back</font>

323
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,470
we're so that someone on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the iesg who</font>

324
00:16:37,339 --> 00:16:42,699
maybe doesn't understand that goes oh ok

325
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:42,699
yeah whatever yep

326
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,530
Aaron Hughes<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6 connect sir I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

327
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,880
to unravel<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so in your list of steps</font>

328
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:54,189
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the slide debt there</font>

329
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:58,930
are six steps in there I think the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

330
00:16:54,190 --> 00:17:01,270
five of them missing a timeline<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

331
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,160
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenges and animosity</font>

332
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,619
that you're getting around or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

333
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,879
with v4 yet if we added<font color="#E5E5E5"> a timeline next</font>

334
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:08,139
two steps<font color="#E5E5E5"> one through five we probably</font>

335
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,240
come to the conclusion that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

336
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,250
going to get till step 6 until you know

337
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,500
years out because there are so many

338
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,630
things that need to be rewritten I've

339
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">been through projects that design</font>

340
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:21,220
routers that our v6 only that include

341
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,560
removing all 32-bit identifiers and

342
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,689
going through that<font color="#CCCCCC"> process we drafted</font>

343
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:29,020
updates to probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hundred different</font>

344
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:30,700
rfcs so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I fully expect that if we start</font>

345
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,710
along this path we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need to</font>

346
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">spend quite a bit of time updating rfcs</font>

347
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:37,570
to get to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> point where we actually</font>

348
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,340
have default being v6 only and I'm in

349
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,960
full support of this kind of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

350
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:44,530
forward thank you for bringing it to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

351
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,440
I think so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I well I think that we still</font>

352
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:49,750
have adopted as a working group a an

353
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,490
ipv4 gap in our transition captain

354
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,900
alisis document right and that's that

355
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,120
document is still open<font color="#CCCCCC"> is still a</font>

356
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:58,120
working group document and I think it's

357
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,729
specific goal is to list rfcs that need

358
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:02,050
to be updated so please forward that and

359
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:08,530
we'll get<font color="#CCCCCC"> right on that happy to help</font>

360
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:11,560
yeah hi<font color="#E5E5E5"> David skin Ozzy again I have</font>

361
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,120
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question on or asking for</font>

362
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:16,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">cooperation that should I think appear</font>

363
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:20,050
in the draft regarding new work that can

364
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:22,149
be dual stack what I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that two</font>

365
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,490
examples that come to mind are home net

366
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:27,970
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> multiple interface PVD work</font>

367
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:29,950
they're both v6 centric as oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a host</font>

368
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,680
and I have these two v6 prefixes where I

369
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:33,940
do with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them however all these</font>

370
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,160
properties that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're getting from the</font>

371
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:40,450
network also apply to v4 in the case of

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">home net the if my memory care tell me</font>

373
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:43,120
if I'm wrong with my recollection the

374
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,860
whole net documents is that your home

375
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,600
network may support ipv4 from reading

376
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,570
the draft it sounds<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you're saying</font>

377
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,010
oh no no it shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even say that so I</font>

378
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that should be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made clear because</font>

379
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:57,820
I agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these things should be more</font>

380
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,740
of these eccentric but things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that do</font>

381
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,990
both should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

382
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:05,610
can you go back to statement 104 because

383
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,610
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's the one where I say uh</font>

384
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:11,050
nope okay go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> slide I</font>

385
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:12,460
think so i think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a word smithing</font>

386
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:18,610
comment and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we have to find up</font>

387
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:21,640
at the words up here<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slide okay</font>

388
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:25,678
so the bullet says the work will be

389
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:29,590
capable<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operating without ipv4 um</font>

390
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so new IETF work even even home</font>

391
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:35,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">net explicitly supports ipv6 or is</font>

392
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:38,200
version agnostic so homenet specifically

393
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,559
supports ipv6 it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> happens to support</font>

394
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,210
ipv4 which is great but so I so I think

395
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that your point is actually</font>

396
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,450
covered in the text all right then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

397
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,910
on the same page it's just ordinary to

398
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:52,240
make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear if you wanted to say it's</font>

399
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,470
somehow differently send<font color="#E5E5E5"> text Tim shy</font>

400
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember from the</font>

401
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,210
home net architecture document is

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,950
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> you then say doing something the</font>

403
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,309
best way for v6 only whether that might

404
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,450
somehow break be four operations I think

405
00:20:03,309 --> 00:20:08,200
that's maybe another thing to consider

406
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:13,090
in the statement and maybe we will you

407
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:17,429
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> goes better job yes Alex</font>

408
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,428
he's ever had there's a powerful yeah

409
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,270
chef you sell cisco so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font>

410
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,350
confirm that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> home the Charter</font>

411
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:29,410
and work is covered by these statements

412
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:32,590
like yeah we support ipv4 but we are not

413
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:36,880
supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add anything to it right</font>

414
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:38,830
today<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's that's good that's</font>

415
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,530
my understanding yeah trance cutter um

416
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:47,080
can you go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next slide maybe um</font>

417
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:49,090
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I read</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft almost I think the</font>

418
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">only thing that jumped out at me is kind</font>

419
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:55,990
of weird was the not initiate new

420
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:58,210
technology development elm and when you

421
00:20:55,990 --> 00:21:00,700
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to over it actually I I would</font>

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:01,990
summarize<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're just now I would</font>

423
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,190
summarize what you said as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well we've</font>

424
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:04,929
pretty much covered that waterfront

425
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:07,870
already there's not really anything new

426
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:11,169
to be you know no more blood to be

427
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:13,689
squeezed out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stone which if</font>

428
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:16,090
that's true you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need to say</font>

429
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,039
so and if it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> true the technology</font>

430
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:19,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be developed anyway because that's</font>

431
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:20,950
just how things work so I mean I don't

432
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">really care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you put that in the</font>

433
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:27,519
document or not but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's kind of</font>

434
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,200
you know either it's true anyway or if

435
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,720
it's not true then it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

436
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,259
matter so it's a reasonable point the

437
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,000
reason I wanted to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say it is that people</font>

438
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:41,440
keep coming to us with great ideas for

439
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">new versions of IP for instance and new</font>

440
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,129
versions of extension<font color="#CCCCCC"> technion new</font>

441
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:47,230
proposed extension technologies<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

442
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:48,969
of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give the iesg the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> club just</font>

443
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">say we don't even have to talk about</font>

444
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:55,509
this we've already said we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not doing</font>

445
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:59,860
it point taken so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use the example of</font>

446
00:21:55,509 --> 00:22:02,950
router ID and so for ospf is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris</font>

447
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:06,158
<font color="#E5E5E5">powers again I'm curious the feeling in</font>

448
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,309
the room though on you know interfaces

449
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,080
between routers that use v4 addresses so

450
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:14,830
that those are clearly v4 dresses and

451
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,189
not 32-bit integers now what I'm

452
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:22,240
suggesting is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely</font>

453
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,200
low priority in getting rid of compared

454
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,110
based on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact on the overall</font>

455
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,399
transition to v6 um I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very</font>

456
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">clear about that that I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

457
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:34,239
talking about router IDs so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

458
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:36,250
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're saying that this</font>

459
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,350
statement actually tells us to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> route</font>

460
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,600
out those things it's saying we're not

461
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to initiate new work that allows</font>

462
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:51,219
us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to require ipv4 addresses show like a</font>

463
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:53,439
an LSA that is in ospf that would ride

464
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only place it can go is over an</font>

465
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:03,340
interface that has that those properties

466
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:06,009
where does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stand um so I I would I</font>

467
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:11,080
I would argue that you know in terms of

468
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:16,179
impact on you know so networks that are

469
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:20,379
running v6 only enterprise networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

470
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:22,779
they're running ospfv3 but v2 would

471
00:23:20,379 --> 00:23:25,299
still have a function in service

472
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:27,700
provider networks with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> miniscule</font>

473
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:30,970
number of v4 dresses

474
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:32,760
so I I think allowing for that decision

475
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:37,779
to be made in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> statement is a</font>

476
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,399
reasonable compromise well let me ask so

477
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:44,230
in that example which i think is a

478
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:49,330
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting example um new new</font>

479
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:51,279
communications um might well use IP use

480
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,710
links with ipv4 addresses and be

481
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,830
required to understand that but they

482
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:59,889
should also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run over ipv6</font>

483
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:01,178
only links and networks yo<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're right</font>

484
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:03,549
ospf<font color="#E5E5E5"> you tues never gonna do it you're</font>

485
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:07,210
right um and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually said</font>

486
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:08,470
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopping working ospf e2 right I</font>

487
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think we've said always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> made that</font>

488
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:14,080
statement no yeah yeah so do you want so

489
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:16,479
you've nodded do you want me to propose

490
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,139
some wording to to do this you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

491
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:23,889
come up wording so well um I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

492
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:26,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more feedback because there</font>

493
00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:28,779
comes a point where maybe we say yeah

494
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:32,260
people are using ospf and and eventually

495
00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:34,649
we're using ospf e2 and eventually we're

496
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:38,350
going to stop working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on ospf v2</font>

497
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:40,330
eventually so and when is that so what

498
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:44,830
they look like let's think of us p FV to

499
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:48,100
as you know it carries mpls information

500
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,830
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TE opaque</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ill essays right so you</font>

501
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:54,340
could have been so v6 goes over and pls

502
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:57,158
so the fact that you've got v4 addresses

503
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:59,408
you know they could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be some I so some</font>

504
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,779
strange addresses but to happen to be

505
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,419
you know v4 dresses but a<font color="#CCCCCC"> miniscule</font>

506
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:09,279
quantity of them given in the scheme of

507
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:12,909
things it seems like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of it seems</font>

508
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:18,419
like basically a way to kill ospf all of

509
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:18,419
ospf relative to I<font color="#CCCCCC"> esaias instead so</font>

510
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:25,990
Michael Abramson so do you generally do

511
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:27,850
things so if you if you propose a new ll

512
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:33,309
say you wouldn't that go it both in 20

513
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:39,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">spiffy v2 and v3 and they have different</font>

514
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:41,299
encoding so sometimes yes sometimes no

515
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,559
it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

516
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:44,809
general yes it seems get done in

517
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:47,119
parallel it's are you saying there would

518
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:52,220
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an exemption if you did both of</font>

519
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:54,080
them or what what's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> the intention</font>

520
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:56,450
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not to do it is more beef or</font>

521
00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,379
only<font color="#CCCCCC"> work yeah it's a feature parity</font>

522
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:02,779
thingy yeah but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we're missing so</font>

523
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,830
that that is so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I'm sorry</font>

524
00:26:02,779 --> 00:26:06,200
to interrupt you but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that</font>

525
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:08,149
that point might carry us but it would

526
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:10,519
need to be wordsmith 2.8 out but<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

527
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:15,109
then it wouldn't necessarily make sense

528
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:20,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">because so right now mpls is not done</font>

529
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:23,210
over ospfv3 in terms of practical

530
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:25,249
deployments so carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tea opaque</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> l</font>

531
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:28,580
essays that traffic engineering with

532
00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:31,100
mpls is not done so saying that oh we

533
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:33,678
would have to sort of do the parallel v3

534
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,379
version of that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know one could think</font>

535
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:40,249
of ospf v2 turning into basically an

536
00:26:36,379 --> 00:26:42,559
MPLS infrastructure mechanism and have

537
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:47,499
<font color="#CCCCCC">nothing to do with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> v4 per se except that</font>

538
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">it uses a small number of v4 addresses</font>

539
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:54,679
and the impact on service providers of

540
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:57,200
saying oh you need you know we can't

541
00:26:54,679 --> 00:27:00,320
actually modify this protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore</font>

542
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,600
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be significant so Michael Abramson</font>

543
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,418
again so are you saying today that I

544
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,480
cannot use oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's from a protocol</font>

545
00:27:05,419 --> 00:27:11,809
point of view is there anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do</font>

546
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,419
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> no Smith v 2 that I can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you knows</font>

547
00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:17,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> three if the vendors implemented</font>

548
00:27:14,419 --> 00:27:22,009
what's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> standard I think there are</font>

549
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:26,960
still still gaps yes so when are these

550
00:27:22,009 --> 00:27:28,669
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be fixed I don't know I don't</font>

551
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,460
know as soon as somebody's writes the

552
00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:39,470
drafts as an asset operator I would like

553
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:43,760
those gaps filled<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is the impact</font>

554
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:46,820
on just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existence of ipv4 addresses</font>

555
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:49,429
ipv4 addresses just on links in your

556
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:55,039
network that's that's that's the

557
00:27:49,429 --> 00:27:58,070
important thing so the fact that i can

558
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,650
in 2016 if i were to green feel like if

559
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:02,090
i quit working and i<font color="#CCCCCC"> started up at my</font>

560
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,130
present employer and started a new one

561
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:13,149
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to configure ipv4</font>

562
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:13,150
or to run mpls<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah I</font>

563
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:19,940
Aaron Hughes again to this point the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

564
00:28:17,179 --> 00:28:25,870
I interpret this draft is that we begin

565
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:29,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">work on ospf be four and bgp v5 and</font>

566
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,070
resolve these issues we get rid of the

567
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:32,510
32-bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers as we get rid of the</font>

568
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,389
problems where we cannot wait will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

569
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,010
required to have altered protocol

570
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:38,720
support I mean why not if we're going to

571
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:41,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">move forward we move all the way forward</font>

572
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,230
to a v6 only operating environment so I

573
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:47,150
do think a lot of rhubarb sorry that

574
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:48,740
that's a phrase for muttering in the

575
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:50,240
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that we need to</font>

576
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:53,210
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> our protocols can run v6</font>

577
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:56,059
only but I'm i might be content well an

578
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:57,350
ospf tp2 is it is it an unusual case

579
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:01,520
that we need probably need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk a lot</font>

580
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:04,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">more about um but I I'm content to say</font>

581
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,350
to just have a short draft saying you

582
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:14,900
know router IDs or not IP addresses

583
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:16,820
carry on good it's a simpler way out now

584
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way well the other we clear its</font>

585
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,280
interfaces between routers with ipv4

586
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:23,600
addresses but it's the interfaces that

587
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,580
matter when you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> link state you</font>

588
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,649
know that's that that matters yes yes

589
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,799
it's not just the router ID and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

590
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:35,870
right jump and<font color="#CCCCCC"> but those are different</font>

591
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:38,090
things um that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say that we</font>

592
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:40,370
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to start new work on routing</font>

593
00:29:38,090 --> 00:29:42,199
protocols and there's no routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 in</font>

594
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:44,899
here that I see right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so ha that's</font>

595
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,340
not oh hey there you go so there may be

596
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,200
other reasons you wanted to do routing

597
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,399
protocols but I'm not gonna I don't

598
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,740
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's in scope for us here well</font>

599
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,629
actually based on<font color="#CCCCCC"> our charter maybe it</font>

600
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:56,260
is

601
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:58,090
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco speaking as myself not</font>

602
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:59,680
throwing any<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font>

603
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,169
my concerns here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'd not opposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this</font>

604
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:06,190
sounds great is that yes need some

605
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:08,650
wordsmithing because new ITF work maybe

606
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:11,140
you mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> brand new idea for converse</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

607
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,500
continuing say Wes<font color="#E5E5E5"> canopy to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> atf work</font>

608
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:17,470
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example but there's of course new to</font>

609
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,090
the ATF voice<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you too ITF work</font>

610
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:21,490
etc some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things to be clarified</font>

611
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:27,610
I think on page one for example you talk

612
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:31,510
about it says ipv4 only<font color="#E5E5E5"> for features of</font>

613
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:34,840
vital operation to me that's the door

614
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,680
right that it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> open where if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I say well</font>

615
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,899
I need to update those<font color="#CCCCCC"> 22</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever</font>

616
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,370
for vital operational issues that's it

617
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:44,470
right that that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the door that's open</font>

618
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:48,429
of course everywhere else in the text

619
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,500
except that sentence says transition

620
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,830
security and something else not

621
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:56,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">operations so we still need to look at</font>

622
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:58,540
while and it says they're right well I

623
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,000
appear before still operational we still

624
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:03,639
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we support that</font>

625
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,980
so I I tried to close that door with the

626
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:07,570
must have a problem statement based on

627
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,520
operational experience but if the door

628
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:11,200
is too wide open no write that in there

629
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
in that other part you nourish and

630
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,820
secure a transition of the commissioning

631
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:17,560
not up operations like that right so

632
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:20,050
it's yep yeah we're little worse here

633
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,550
there I think the intent is fine and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

634
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:24,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that eventually we just need to</font>

635
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,020
clarify what is really new ITF work or

636
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,169
your continuing you have to support

637
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,879
whatever we have so then question back

638
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:35,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the folks here is should this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

639
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,450
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group charters or should this</font>

640
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,620
say should this mean that 80's sitting

641
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,570
and working group meetings and watching

642
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:43,780
lists seeing something that's v4 only

643
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:52,360
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> SWAT it down what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

644
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:58,450
see yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I heard in all of the above not</font>

645
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,709
at the mic so so yeah it but I but I'm

646
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:01,420
seeing Chris say yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we just talked</font>

647
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,630
about OS we have v2 that's a specific

648
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:06,429
example it you know it's open work it's

649
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,639
still things something we can work on

650
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:12,610
and having a routing ad say no no you

651
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:14,769
can't work on ospf v2 is a serious

652
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:19,658
consideration that matters in the real

653
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:21,759
world so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be very sure what we</font>

654
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:23,259
want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll update</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it to</font>

655
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,809
you know if the working group wants to

656
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:26,919
adopt the dress the draft I will work on

657
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:28,990
whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group tells me to</font>

658
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,480
do but<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we go to IETF consensus</font>

659
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:37,360
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to have you know it's going</font>

660
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:38,799
to be allowed long last call or maybe it

661
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,748
won't people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they'll be you know</font>

662
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:46,418
rough consensus that no forget ospf you

663
00:32:40,749 --> 00:32:50,200
too you're not running the mic with that

664
00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:53,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">I am shooting flames out here so Michael</font>

665
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,080
Abramson so um with the example of ospf

666
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,720
here if someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> came and said I want</font>

667
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,428
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know 52 I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> care to to</font>

668
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,619
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that same functionality knows baby</font>

669
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:04,119
3 i'm going to get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset there</font>

670
00:33:02,619 --> 00:33:06,249
needs to be at least be feature parity

671
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:08,918
the ice to understand that people still

672
00:33:06,249 --> 00:33:11,619
want this functionality<font color="#E5E5E5"> now 52 which is</font>

673
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:13,029
fine but not caring about those be 33

674
00:33:11,619 --> 00:33:15,970
and making sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they can do the</font>

675
00:33:13,029 --> 00:33:17,470
same is really bad so maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

676
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:24,039
word smithing thing that we can do here

677
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:26,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that says something like a no-no</font>

678
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,700
feature can be added that's ipv4 only

679
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,519
unless there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nike v6 comparable</font>

680
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,139
feature or equivalent feature in an

681
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,409
equivalent system and even maybe give

682
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:40,360
the example of ospf v2 v3 with I'm

683
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:41,409
seeing some nods and shrugs and saying

684
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:43,689
maybe that's the right way to finesse it

685
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,279
I'm hoping somebody was taking note

686
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:47,320
taking I'm hoping you got that because I

687
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:49,840
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> said it out loud um Tim I help you</font>

688
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,830
yeah some something like what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font>

689
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be close enough then we'll fight</font>

690
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:57,039
about analyst we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> just move this</font>

691
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,619
to the ospf working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> um is the only</font>

692
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,350
example anybody can come up with is ospf

693
00:33:59,619 --> 00:34:05,049
it it is convenient that both v2 and v3

694
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:07,379
live in the same working<font color="#CCCCCC"> group yeah</font>

695
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,379
that's true

696
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:14,619
so Leah questions as you must<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

697
00:34:12,579 --> 00:34:18,579
know these do<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than anybody else</font>

698
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:23,909
do you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it fits the Charter that's</font>

699
00:34:18,579 --> 00:34:28,359
a great<font color="#CCCCCC"> question um so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think as a um</font>

700
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:33,730
you the punches<font color="#E5E5E5"> said there it's covered</font>

701
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:35,139
under advice um but I wait we haven't we

702
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:37,480
have an ad here who can tell us whether

703
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:43,059
it fits the Charter and if it doesn't we

704
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:47,770
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just you know Terry Madison in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terre</font>

705
00:34:43,059 --> 00:34:50,710
a day it is provide recommendations yes

706
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,149
I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it does fit the Charter if</font>

707
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,679
someone would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to disagree with me</font>

708
00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:59,170
I'll happily take that offline and could

709
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,680
you quickly summarize what the<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font>

710
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:07,900
for ITF consensus would be but I

711
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:12,339
probably could but yeah yeah Terry

712
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:14,200
medicine again so the process for this

713
00:35:12,339 --> 00:35:17,319
consensus will have to go through

714
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group last call go through IETF</font>

715
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:23,770
last call then go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ballot</font>

716
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:28,118
procedure with the the iesg<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gia yes the</font>

717
00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:31,720
iesg and then it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> published okay</font>

718
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:33,400
then so again so weak oh oh I'm sorry

719
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,569
you didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a you know the newcomers</font>

720
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,400
bad we didn't know the cameras I know

721
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:42,069
he's a working group chair is a whip

722
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,130
okay I'm they are very confused I'm very

723
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">confused okay thank you my guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

724
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:48,700
we would take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a hum to see whether the</font>

725
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,558
working group wants to adopt it I would

726
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,020
then spin a revision based on comments

727
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:55,270
made here and notes made here named for

728
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:57,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group if we adopted there</font>

729
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:58,930
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be more wordsmithing online at some</font>

730
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:00,420
point we'll say gene no more comments

731
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,558
are being made we<font color="#E5E5E5"> seem close enough and</font>

732
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,039
the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> of chairs will do it will</font>

733
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,420
issue a working group last call either

734
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:09,339
that could be at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next meeting or a</font>

735
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,559
meeting and saying do you think it's

736
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:12,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready we'll take a hum or it could be on</font>

737
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,920
the mate just on the mailing list and

738
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,349
then we run probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> to two to four</font>

739
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,260
weeks whichever um to see if anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font>

740
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:21,880
any further comments and then if there

741
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,470
are no further comments or the strong

742
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,310
support then it goes to IETF last call

743
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:27,459
which is

744
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:30,220
same two to four week<font color="#E5E5E5"> process which will</font>

745
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,720
probably generate a lot of comments but

746
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:33,459
if there is consensus and that's judged

747
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,020
by first<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group chairs to say</font>

748
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:37,000
what so in the working groups just<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

749
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,670
the chairs at last call i think is

750
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:45,520
judged<font color="#CCCCCC"> by the the 80s and then it goes</font>

751
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:48,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the iesg to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put discusses on it any</font>

752
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,190
more questions fully so question for

753
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:53,200
myself now which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the same as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you we</font>

754
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,030
will do a ham quickly to see whether the

755
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,960
working group wants to get this document

756
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:59,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Duquette it's a working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

757
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,540
document so we'll ask the first one will

758
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,670
be yes I won this as a working group

759
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,140
document and the second I'm would be no

760
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:08,950
I do not want this as you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

761
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:10,770
document so we would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> f</font>

762
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:17,799
this document is the working group

763
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:19,690
document kiss em now thank you for those

764
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,640
of you that do not want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up this</font>

765
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:25,420
document is yoking group document please

766
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:28,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">em now okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was to be expected but a</font>

767
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:33,120
clear physically for the noting a clear

768
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:36,160
adoption there<font color="#E5E5E5"> thankfully so the next</font>

772
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:48,280
a chair and not with the full power of

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chair at dinner i was unable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

slides you need to send in the pink we

776
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:05,470
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eric Nate migrant hi and I'm Emily</font>

777
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,200
stark i'm here from the chrome team um

778
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:13,750
I'm pretending to be my quest um uh I

779
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,770
was hoping<font color="#E5E5E5"> he might appear remotely so</font>

780
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:18,130
that he can answer all the hard

781
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:21,880
questions but looks like not so no hard

782
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:23,410
questions um so I I'm presenting a

783
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:26,140
pretty simple proposal that might put

784
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,609
together I've been tangentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved</font>

785
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:29,020
in some of the issues here but this is

786
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:36,220
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike's proposal he just going to</font>

787
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:38,090
be here so um<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the the problem that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

788
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:43,919
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve arises for</font>

789
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:47,130
the fact that 6761 advises users that

790
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">they can assume that that local host</font>

791
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,940
names resolve to loop back IPS but in

792
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:55,830
fact the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> sections that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

793
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:59,700
outline<font color="#CCCCCC"> the behavior of name resolution</font>

794
00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:02,040
libraries and and DNS servers says this

795
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:06,180
frames this has a should not not a must

796
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:08,190
so um uh DNS servers and numerous

797
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">Aleutian libraries are actually free to</font>

798
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,240
resolve local host names to anything

799
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:14,160
they'd like including<font color="#E5E5E5"> something on the</font>

800
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,439
public internet and that is surprising

801
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,299
um several implementation

802
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,870
implementations do do this we've

803
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,860
encountered them in the wild um so the

804
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:27,930
implication of this is a few things um

805
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,420
it makes local host names difficult to

806
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:33,390
use or I'm impossible to use for

807
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:35,640
security decisions and I'll give some

808
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:37,259
examples of that in a moment but it

809
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:39,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">means</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's no guarantee that</font>

810
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:42,800
local host names actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> resolve to to</font>

811
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:47,759
look back they can go anywhere um and

812
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,860
and because of that we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

813
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,390
give certain functionality that we would

814
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,850
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give to local host names which</font>

815
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:58,560
may encourage developers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-code</font>

816
00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:00,750
address literals um and that is probably

817
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">not good for all of you people who are</font>

818
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:05,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kill IP before because it</font>

819
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:12,990
proliferates IP address laurels and in

820
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:15,360
applications um so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm gonna uh there we</font>

821
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,930
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so just a little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more on the</font>

822
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">motivation here and comes from w3c where</font>

823
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:24,810
there's a speck<font color="#CCCCCC"> that defines a secure</font>

824
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,300
context in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the web platform and very</font>

825
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:30,779
roughly a secure context is currently

826
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,960
defined as when a frame and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of its</font>

827
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:39,260
ancestors are HTTPS or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> WebSockets</font>

828
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:42,150
equivalent or um or a loopback IP but

829
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:44,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">localhost is is very conspicuously</font>

830
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:46,800
missing from this list of URLs that

831
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:49,170
define a secure context and that's a

832
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,850
pain for developers developers<font color="#CCCCCC"> um well I</font>

833
00:40:49,170 --> 00:40:51,700
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> another key thing here is that a</font>

834
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:55,480
secure context

835
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:58,149
used to to grant special privileges and

836
00:40:55,480 --> 00:41:00,540
functionality to web applications so

837
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:03,369
certain powerful<font color="#CCCCCC"> web platform features</font>

838
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:05,829
like the geolocation API for example are

839
00:41:03,369 --> 00:41:08,800
only available to applications that are

840
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:10,300
running in secure contexts so developers

841
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,070
want to test these features they want to

842
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:15,250
test them on localhost but we are

843
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:16,960
currently unwilling to to give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

844
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:19,000
localhost because we don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

845
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,359
what what<font color="#E5E5E5"> localhost is it could be could</font>

846
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,609
be anything um so letting developers

848
00:41:24,609 --> 00:41:31,119
localhost moreover you can you could

849
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:33,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">imagine that a an application might want</font>

to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to a local service we don't want</font>

851
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:41,560
a local service<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we if that local</font>

852
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:43,150

853
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,859
context that secure contacts is only

854
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:48,640
really allowed to talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if it is</font>

855
00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:52,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">also a secure URL and and so currently</font>

856
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,640
we the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mixed content specification</font>

857
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:56,680
which defines how secure content is

858
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:00,848
allowed to load sub resources from from

859
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,980
insecure for load insecure sub resources

860
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:04,630
currently that spec doesn't allow local

861
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:06,339
host and will trigger mixed content

862
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,020
warnings and web browsers for for

863
00:42:06,339 --> 00:42:12,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">localhost and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

864
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:16,210
definition that secure context uses um

865
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:18,910
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically the proposal is basically</font>

866
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,089
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like replace the shades</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

867
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:24,098
the musts appropriately um so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

868
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:28,509
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> three or four places in</font>

869
00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:30,430
6761 that define<font color="#CCCCCC"> the behavior of name</font>

870
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:32,710
resolution libraries and gayness servers

871
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,240
with respect to local host names and the

872
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:38,050
proposal is to change those roads to

873
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:43,598
musts so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> applications can assume</font>

874
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:50,530
or or constrain um their dns lookups for

875
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:52,450
local host names to to loop back so

876
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:56,609
that's basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it it's pretty simple</font>

877
00:42:52,450 --> 00:43:00,129
proposal um kind of removes and need a

878
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:03,160
need for proliferating um loopback

879
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,410
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> literals and and will be very</font>

880
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:09,129
useful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us over in w3c lands to</font>

881
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:15,279
to add local host to the lists of<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

882
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:22,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> um that define secure contacts any</font>

883
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:24,250
questions hi Stan York and my my head

884
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,630
was exploding sort of because I was

885
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:28,390
having this collision between my

886
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,610
previous ipv6 world in my current dns

887
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:33,279
world and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just reading this because</font>

888
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:34,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">i had actually double checked 6761 was</font>

889
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,250
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought it was I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

890
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:41,860
question is um why are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we having this</font>

891
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:43,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen did Mike bring this to DNS op or</font>

892
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:46,210
anything like that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mailing list</font>

893
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:49,720
um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't remember ever seeing in a</font>

894
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:51,580
list<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am Not sure unfortunately I know</font>

895
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,410
he has been soliciting feedback from

00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Deanna's people but i'm not sure to the</font>

897
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:58,359
exact communication mechanisms that he's

898
00:43:55,750 --> 00:44:02,080
done useful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well my feedback i</font>

899
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,030
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be for him</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to say um for him</font>

900
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:06,279
to bring this DNS op because this is

901
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:08,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">clearly an operational and we've been</font>

902
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,510
having all sorts of fun with RFC 6761

903
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,520
and special use names and in fact we're

904
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:15,550
having an interim in a couple of weeks

905
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,009
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about that or not it's or month</font>

906
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:19,870
or so or something right Terry it's

907
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,760
someone that space so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say that</font>

908
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:23,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this would be something that he should</font>

909
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,130
send in there and we're watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

910
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:29,230
pacman eat Mark Andrews ok so anyway

911
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:30,640
that would be my suggestion because this

912
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:34,320
is something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be that would be</font>

913
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:34,319
the group to updater yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok thank you</font>

914
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,020
um video called Enoch I I second that

915
00:44:39,370 --> 00:44:44,859
that question I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was wondering why we're</font>

916
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:50,590
presented here second is setting all the

917
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:52,150
problems in 6761 aside um the discussion

918
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:55,060
whether or not<font color="#E5E5E5"> localhost should resolve</font>

919
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:57,280
to defined results is like decades old

920
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that doesn't mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it doesn't</font>

921
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:01,420
deserve an answer but there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of</font>

922
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:04,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">history in baggage which might lead to</font>

923
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:06,760
certain biased responses so just be

924
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:10,960
aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is old stuff and muddy</font>

925
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:14,950
waters I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure I understand how</font>

926
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:19,180
reliable the result is really meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

927
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:21,779
be again setting 6761

928
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,879
moving this from a show to a must

929
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,950
doesn't guarantee any any any future

930
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,250
performance<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess is that it's the</font>

931
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:34,149
term that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually use it may or may</font>

932
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:35,920
not be implemented today questions for

933
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:38,890
local host may leak to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root service</font>

934
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,050
today and actually at that place the

935
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:44,170
responses<font color="#CCCCCC"> annex domain so what you</font>

936
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,300
probably really want and again a<font color="#E5E5E5"> warning</font>

937
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:49,089
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not leading anywhere what you</font>

938
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,710
really might want is that the

939
00:45:49,089 --> 00:45:53,828
authoritative service for that part

940
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:57,280
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> with whatever result you you</font>

941
00:45:53,829 --> 00:46:01,930
desire there you can't assume that that

942
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,490
is happening anytime soon yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> um to</font>

943
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:05,649
two things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think i just want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say i</font>

944
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">think how this ended up here is the</font>

945
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,109
issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> of proliferation of ipv4 literals</font>

946
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:14,348
and so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the relevance to</font>

947
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:18,730
this group is like um if we can remove a

948
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:20,140
common you know and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's thing that</font>

949
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:22,869
pushes developers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the directions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

950
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:27,549
ipv4 literals then that makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier</font>

951
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:29,619
to kill off ipv4 um uh to your second

952
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:30,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">point yeah like we just changing RFC</font>

953
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:32,829
doesn't change the simple fact that

954
00:46:30,970 --> 00:46:35,529
implementations are not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna probably</font>

955
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:38,650
ever update I think what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> would do is</font>

956
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:42,339
make this change<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then um in the</font>

957
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:43,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure context spec maybe I don't know</font>

958
00:46:42,339 --> 00:46:45,400
if it would be I probably wouldn't be

959
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:47,589
normative but like make it make a note

960
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:50,980
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state of the world and</font>

961
00:46:47,589 --> 00:46:55,089
then browsers would in fact on some

962
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:57,040
platforms chrome already um forces local

963
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:58,839
house to resolve to<font color="#CCCCCC"> loop back so we</font>

964
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,410
would sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of implement it in the</font>

965
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:05,319
browser and that would make us<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel safe</font>

966
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:09,069
about giving local host secure context

967
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:10,390
so it's sort of um the purpose is not so

968
00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:12,759
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> that implementations will change</font>

969
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:16,270
overnight but to sort of bolster the

970
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,770
case for the user agent um kind of

971
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:22,270
pretending that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the state of the</font>

972
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">world so if i may ask a follow-up</font>

973
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:29,440
question so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i now hear that you were</font>

974
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:31,059
looking for a maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm completely wrong</font>

975
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,010
but this looks like getting a

976
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:36,160
justification for doing this in a

977
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:38,830
implementation which doesn't necessarily

978
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,350
mean you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> change the the current</font>

979
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:45,910
entry in the registry I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

980
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:47,500
a justification so much as as a thing

981
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:50,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">that makes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sense to do in parallel like</font>

982
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,500
I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is continuously surprising</font>

983
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:57,400
22 people and it's I think it's just

984
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of like um how how it should be</font>

985
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:00,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">like people expect a local host to</font>

986
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:04,750
resolve to look back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it should</font>

987
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:06,250
