<font color="#E5E5E5">through the status stuff and hopefully</font>

57
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:51,620
Krista will be here by that but um I

58
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,140
assume he's okay with that agenda change

59
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:59,120
as well so we'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as yes any</font>

60
00:04:54,140 --> 00:05:01,099
other comments on the agenda Martin yeah

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,270
so I won't just want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

62
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:08,960
we closed the deal on<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4572 like put a</font>

63
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:12,080
nail in it barriers yes that's

64
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,210
everything so is everyone happy with the

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,820
plan that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font>

66
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:22,409
it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list okay the plan is to</font>

67
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:24,719
rather than try to monkey patch 4572

68
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,670
with an update we will produce a new

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">version of 4572 that contains exactly</font>

70
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,200
the changes that we agreed on in list

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,750
but it's now a document that obsoletes

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,900
4572 it's just complete as opposed to

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:45,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">apache thing I think Collins already</font>

74
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:47,880
done the work for that we have it on the

75
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:51,180
status lights as well so well we can

76
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:55,969
revisit their let me get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that any</font>

77
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,400
other comments on the agenda all right

78
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:02,100
in terms of the working group status we

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,810
don't have any published RFC yet we have

80
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:08,910
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of jabs still in the RFC</font>

86
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:25,710
published so we're actually just waiting

87
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,210
for the remaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> trees to sign off on a</font>

88
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:34,710

116
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:57,530

Pablo editorial updates are needed but

121
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:09,349
we should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to move forward with</font>

122
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,449
that one sdp neck<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is in pretty</font>

123
00:08:09,349 --> 00:08:13,039
decent shape as well so we'll expect

124
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:22,279
that one to proceed pretty shortly as

125
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:25,009
well the red draft is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam here okay we</font>

126
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,240
we tried getting a response from adam s

127
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:27,560

129
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:36,289
from him so if anybody sees Adam um try

130
00:08:32,899 --> 00:08:40,940
to prod him as well or it can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go glass</font>

145
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,310
up you know be a little bit flexible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

146
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,360
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with this</font>

147
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,829
one

148
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,660
it's just been way too long at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

149
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,849
point and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> feels the</font>

150
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:28,670
same way too so let's try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on</font>

151
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:30,680
this one then Adam faith and<font color="#CCCCCC"> am just now</font>

152
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">said uh yes I need to make sure that's</font>

153
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:36,550
done I'll get them an entry before lunch

154
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:38,540
today<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright cool thank you ah</font>

155
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,779
simulcast I think there were a couple of

156
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,449
comments on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one as well yeah we</font>

157
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,329
have a few more edits that we need to

158
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">make as as a result of a few comments</font>

159
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we received otherwise it should be</font>

160
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:59,268
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so 4572 update as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Martin</font>

161
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,300
was just talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before so they</font>

162
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:04,279
always thought we already then there

163
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,769
were some changes comments etc so there

164
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,029
is a substantially updated version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

165
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,980
the document at least in terms of the

166
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,050
text that's in there because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the overall</font>

167
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,399
approach it will now obsolete the old

168
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,990
4570 to update given that we feel from

169
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:20,209
the chairs point of view that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we should</font>

170
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:22,010
reissue a working group last call more

171
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,739
formally so that's what we're planning

172
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:26,540
on doing assuming we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get any</font>

173
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:31,399
comments then we can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> move forward</font>

174
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:33,050
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dzl ssdp again we</font>

175
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,720
thought we were ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask a</font>

176
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,569
publication did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> final review on that</font>

177
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,430
one found a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of issues talk to the</font>

178
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">authors about that one they have updated</font>

179
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:45,199
the document since then just reviewed

180
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,329
that again there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of fixes</font>

181
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:48,979
that have to be done in there but given

182
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:51,319
that there were some non editorial

183
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,000
changes done as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of the review</font>

184
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,829
we think that we probably need to do

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,360
another<font color="#CCCCCC"> workbook last call but just on</font>

186
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:58,579
the changes there again it's not the

187
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,810
entire document i think the document is

188
00:10:58,579 --> 00:11:01,160
in pretty good shape but again<font color="#CCCCCC"> i want to</font>

189
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people in the group are</font>

190
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:06,199
comfortable with what's in there and

191
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:08,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i sip sdp and trickle i sip those</font>

192
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:12,439
are both on the agenda today so we'll

193
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:15,019
get back to those in terms of new work

194
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,760
items we don't have anything there other

195
00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,630
working group tasks not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agenda</font>

196
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,390
right now or<font color="#E5E5E5"> already covered else</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ora we</font>

197
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:24,949
have already covered MSRP use its data

198
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:26,569
channel<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we are getting ready to</font>

199
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:27,660
move<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward with that one now that we</font>

200
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:33,120
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stp neck</font>

201
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:35,069
draft well on its way<font color="#E5E5E5"> 4566 bits we have</font>

202
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,870
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not put any emphasis on this one</font>

203
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:38,490
because it's not holding<font color="#CCCCCC"> up progress on</font>

204
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:40,350
anything else and you have plenty<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

205
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,240
other documents to focus on that are

206
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:44,310
dependencies especially on the RTC

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,220
website so once we get more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

208
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:51,569
stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> finalised will will pick up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

210
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:56,700
and designated expert reviews we have a

211
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,380
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those as well thank you to Dan</font>

212
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,420
wing for reviewing a couple of those and

213
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:06,870
we had a<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple of additional ones for</font>

214
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:09,079
their youngest designated Expo to last

215
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:12,060
slide here is just basically recap

216
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:13,170
Jonathan was area equals<font color="#E5E5E5"> so somewhat to</font>

217
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,439
the previous slides number<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this slide</font>

218
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Cullen earlier for</font>

219
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:21,360
the a66 this is currently actually a web

220
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:24,330
RTC dependency some wording reference is

221
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,460
it what r dr 66<font color="#E5E5E5"> biz yes I mean maybe it</font>

222
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,330
shouldn't maybe something maybe there

223
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:29,120
something should hear everything

224
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:31,980
perfectly<font color="#E5E5E5"> sticks itself but currently I</font>

225
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,530
think Cullen's tree walking algorithm

226
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,390
does find<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> success</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

227
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:38,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I thought we had covered that</font>

228
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:45,569
previously and we had agreed that that

229
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:46,890
was not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the case so I ok so just to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

230
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:50,010
sure i understand we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that probably</font>

231
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:51,960
web RTC shouldn't depend on 4566 biz

232
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:54,630
it's just beyond 4566 is that sort of

233
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,730
like that yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the chairs</font>

234
00:12:54,630 --> 00:13:00,090
assumption right now now is there

235
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">anything in 45-60 six bits that is not</font>

236
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:05,070
in 4566 that you need and hence we got

237
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,209
in this forward always<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest that you</font>

238
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:08,040
were trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to stay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> current with the</font>

239
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:09,750
reference I imagine it's an accidental

240
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,160
staying current with the references that

241
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:14,700
we can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and look at unless</font>

242
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,230
trickle ice in some way needs it that's

243
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the only one I can pick up that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

244
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so calling can we ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you to take</font>

245
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,240
an action to verify that try and figure

246
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,130
out where that is by the end of the

247
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,360
meeting yeah whether you guys in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

248
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:29,070
you have a dependency on it or not

249
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,680
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you do then we obviously need</font>

250
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to put more emphasis on it right now</font>

251
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">wish yes you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so for the</font>

252
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:41,400
note taker you gotta thank you just just

253
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:44,300
on the topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian groves</font>

254
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:46,380
there might be something in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> SDP</font>

255
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,760
negotiation for with artistic data

256
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:50,700
channels because there's that new level

257
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,110
we're introducing a new level for the

258
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">SDP attributes so there might be</font>

259
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:57,030
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the iron a registration</font>

260
00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:05,189
stuff so<font color="#CCCCCC"> and will be some dependency</font>

261
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:07,680
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Christian had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly right</font>

262
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,440
it is that document that refers to 4566

263
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,319
is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our normative this again</font>

264
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,400
is through that data channel document so

265
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think we'd have to look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

266
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,410
document and figure out if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> clips</font>

267
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:20,730
there was a problem okay what Colin you

268
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:22,439
will still get back to us with more

269
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,650
details around exactly what it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

270
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:27,930
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we can understand whether we</font>

271
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,290
need to push this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead or not okay</font>

272
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:33,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">Kristen yes there's of course a lot of</font>

273
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:36,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">documents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way that we very</font>

274
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:38,190
reference you know bundle and everything

275
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:39,660
which does something with stp but I

276
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:41,340
don't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we could reference</font>

277
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:44,400
base so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't so maybe it's not</font>

278
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:47,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">an issue but my point is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that in RTC web</font>

279
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,860
if they reference one document which

280
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:53,430

have an implicit reference anyway and

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,530
then if you have somewhere 4566 and

283
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:01,230
under place 4566 base maybe it doesn't

matter because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess there are no</font>

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,660
understood understood so but at least

298
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,100
here we haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I have</font>

300

agree mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> ya</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gotta trace through that</font>

301
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,990
of course

00:15:52,130 --> 00:16:10,010
really normatively<font color="#CCCCCC"> Knox attributes yeah</font>

max<font color="#CCCCCC"> crafter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first 4566 bliss because of</font>

304
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:15,710
the iono update that we did to see how

305
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,020
do we for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new attributes what the</font>

306
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,790
procedure we need to follow and 4566

307
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:22,150
this explains how could it with the new

308
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:29,209
attribute or operating division category

309
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:31,040
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah generally speaking</font>

310
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:32,570
with my co-chair behind me going Ted

311
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,500
comes up to suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> it down rough</font>

312
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:38,090
exception and he's exactly right given

313
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,830
that the change here is actually Justin

314
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,930
iono procedures i think a Down rough is

315
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:44,360
eminently sensible and would help us

316
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:45,979
avoid pain and suffering since i'm not

317

<font color="#E5E5E5">in favor of pain and suffering let's do</font>

318
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:55,310

<font color="#E5E5E5">me any 80 comments objections</font>

321
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:15,410
right that document has already been

322
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:22,850
approved so yes you're gonna add a Down

323
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:24,530
up now Ted hearty I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rep</font>

the down<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughs dungeon it is entirely</font>

326
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:33,440
possible to send a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the IETF</font>

327

the sole purpose of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the down rep but</font>

329
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:41,210
that that's all you you you open right

330
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,389
you say we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not taking comments on</font>

331
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:46,910
anything else but this down<font color="#CCCCCC"> rev all</font>

332
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:51,620
other matters are closed it works pretty

333
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:53,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I think the after I know the 80s</font>

334
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,149
need to look at this and confer with the

335
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,940
chairs if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I just</font>

336
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:00,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the procedural troll will</font>

337
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:04,160
work in the salt mines and bring back an

338
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,379
answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group alright so</font>

339
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,660
for the note taker

340
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:11,280
you got that captured as well that we

341
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,830
the chairs will confer further with the

342
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,660
80s on how to proceed whether we can

343
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:22,010
replace the<font color="#CCCCCC"> mocks attributes reference</font>

344
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:29,100
to 4566 bits with 45 626 all right

345
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:31,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">christer yes I think the 4572 update</font>

346
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,320
should now be based on that it did you

347
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,550
know change with it bit with the

348
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,439
discussions with Cullinan and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thomas and</font>

349
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,260
everything that's no gonna be a direct

350
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:47,430
reference I think I see you sorry and I

351
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:50,900
think gossamer<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SDP but I don't know</font>

352
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:53,460
but but at least 45 70 to update oh

353
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,140
because it's listed as a indirect you're

354
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:02,700
saying that should be a direct yes

355
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:07,730
agreed all right any other comments on

356
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:07,730
the OTC web dependencies in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the music</font>

357
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:15,270
Colin this may not matter once we get

358
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:19,170
rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of 4566 but it has a weird reference</font>

359
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:21,030
to a char set draft from long long ago

360
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,860
and it seemed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that one could be</font>

361
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">converted to the actual RFC I was going</font>

362
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,610
to send an email to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ally to see if we</font>

363
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:28,170
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this fixed but there's another</font>

364
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,300
weird dependency problem since we

365
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,520
discussing all this basically there's a

366
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:34,169
char set document the draft updated

367
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,540
hasn't been updated in like a year now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

368
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:39,630
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and when we actually looked at the</font>

369
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:41,820
draft in 4566 biz it looked like it

370
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:43,560
could easily just reference the original

371
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,050
RFC it didn't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reference the new</font>

372
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:50,520
draft but right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it has a normative</font>

373
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:52,590
reference to that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft okay good</font>

374
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,420
could you send<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mail on that just so we</font>

375
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,179
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah can we capture on actions to</font>

376
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:03,120
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever cope with it yeah an HR set</font>

377
00:19:57,180 --> 00:20:08,120
reference in 45-60 six bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay alright</font>

378
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,120
thanks come any other comments

379
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:16,269
all right I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is it for the</font>

380
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:25,928
status<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates so Colin you wanted to</font>

381
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:29,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about bundle real quick so one of</font>

382
00:20:25,929 --> 00:20:31,179
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent we just sent the J sub</font>

383
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,459
draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> to working group last call and had</font>

384
00:20:31,179 --> 00:20:36,070
one new big block of text about how you

385
00:20:33,459 --> 00:20:37,929
take RTP packets and figure out what

386
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:39,729
happens to the next like how they

387
00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:42,759
eventually end up with the right codec

388
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:45,700
and this involves the how you look at

389
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:47,589
the mids the rids the SSR<font color="#E5E5E5"> sees and that</font>

390
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,539
type of information and figure out what

391
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:54,129
happens now the the text we have their

392
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,019
has some problems with it and a few

393
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:57,599
ideas do it now what I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> propose</font>

394
00:20:56,019 --> 00:20:59,320
doing and I had a good conversation

395
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,289
conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> different people about</font>

396
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,450
particularly<font color="#CCCCCC"> Magnuson Colin and Jonathan</font>

397
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,969
this morning and I think I can put

398
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:08,859
together a proposal a to pull requests

399
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:10,389
to fix this up in a way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hope</font>

400
00:21:08,859 --> 00:21:13,658
everyone's okay with and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give</font>

401
00:21:10,389 --> 00:21:15,369
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> a heads up on that here so it</font>

402
00:21:13,659 --> 00:21:17,829
would take the bulk of that text that's

403
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:19,389
in section 6 of the J sub draft right

404
00:21:17,829 --> 00:21:23,168
now and it would move it over to the

405
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:25,238
bundle draft on the algorithms that this

406
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:26,649
the resulting algorithm that you would

407
00:21:25,239 --> 00:21:29,559
write if you were implementing a browser

408
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:31,389
would not change very much a couple

409
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,039
little fine print on that coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in</font>

410
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:35,889
a second but<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for working purposes</font>

411
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,629
it doesn't change for a second we'd

412
00:21:35,889 --> 00:21:40,389
rewrite the terminology a little bit to

413
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:42,009
term this more in terms of an RTP stream

414
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:44,258
explain how the you know you look at the

415
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:46,299
SSRC and from the SSRC number in the RTP

416
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,529
packet that is which stream<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in and</font>

417
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:49,629
then we write some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other text to</font>

418
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:50,859
be in that terminology that wood line it

419
00:21:49,629 --> 00:21:54,158
up more consistent with the RTP

420
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:56,589
documents the one change that would be

421
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,690
actually made to the algorithm would be

422
00:21:56,589 --> 00:22:03,279
to make it so right now we have a line

423
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,739
that if you have a payload if the only

425
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:11,829
algorithm in some cases it can use

426
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:14,529
payload type to determine where which<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

section that this would go to and it

only does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in cases where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't</font>

431
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that we have</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">than that is that if there was multiple</font>

433
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:28,720
that it could go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same payload</font>

first one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Magnus pointed out that</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just that that's nuts that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

438
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,809
this should never happen like you could

00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:39,850
only be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use this hint if they</font>

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:43,090
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> all unique so it would be better in</font>

441
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:44,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">the case that they were if the payload</font>

442
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,959
types are not unique the same payload

443
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:48,309
type occurs on multiple infections and

444
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,690
you have no other way to figure out

445
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:51,100
which one of these in sections it goes

446
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,790
to it discards the<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets that's the</font>

447
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,299
only technical change the algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah</font>

448
00:22:53,790 --> 00:23:01,149
so I expect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a pull request to</font>

449
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:02,679
bundle pull requests to to Jason you'll

450
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:06,010
still be a bunch of texts in<font color="#CCCCCC"> jessup that</font>

451
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:07,780
talks about how how this maps up to the

452
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,610
names of the objects that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use over</font>

453
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,809
there right like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going</font>

454
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be in the bundle draft we're not</font>

455
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:13,990
going to be talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about RTP senders</font>

456
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,399
and receivers and transceivers we're

457
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,410
going to be talking about em sections

458
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,780
and then adjacent trap will say about in

459
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:21,669
section lines up with the names we use

460
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:23,260
that but the bulk of the algorithm

461
00:23:21,669 --> 00:23:25,419
actually moves over to the bundle draft

462
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,030
is what I'm proposing so I put together

463
00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:30,250
pull requests i will put together pull

464
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:32,168
request for bundle and forge a set at

465
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,510
the same time put them on both the lists

466
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:36,730
and then people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will need to review them</font>

467
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:39,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">i would like to move relatively quickly</font>

468
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,860
on this people have thoughts or comments

469
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:43,480
with that plan on understand people have

470
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,580
to see the actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> text to agree to it</font>

471
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:52,450
but that that plan sound like a

472
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:54,730
reasonable approach to people ah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

473
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,880
the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm moving to the bundle</font>

474
00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:03,370
to start with really<font color="#CCCCCC"> Adam okay that</font>

475
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:10,870
sounds good to me okay okay that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

476
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:15,090
thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you all right Krista Europe which</font>

477
00:24:10,870 --> 00:24:15,090
one you guys talking this

478
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,460
hmm

479
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:38,980
sure

480
00:24:48,870 --> 00:25:02,309
okay okay this is for a few issues for

481
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:04,890
for the ICPC p draft I'm not the main

482
00:25:02,309 --> 00:25:06,240
editor of this draft unfortunately I

483
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,770
didn't have time to go through these

484
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,150
slides with and they know author but

485
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,270
these issues that I'm going to raise

486
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:13,290
there have been raised us on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list</font>

487
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:16,410
there's been some comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font>

488
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:18,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually the most of them came to my</font>

489
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:21,600
mind when I was talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the BF CP</font>

490
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,170
people about helping them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> fight try</font>

491
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:28,230
to finalize their<font color="#E5E5E5"> text but it's not</font>

492
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:30,510
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> BFC be specific it's it's it's</font>

493
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,650
stp<font color="#CCCCCC"> over answer specific so so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

494
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,420
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a look at those so next slide</font>

495
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:39,780
please and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to make this is</font>

496
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,790
not this is eyes hdb specific that's why

497
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,899
we talk about it here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and not in in in</font>

498
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:49,530
dice working good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so first is the</font>

499
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:52,290
default candidate in sdp answer first

500
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,940
couple of background in according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

501
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:56,129
offer answer even though as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

502
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:58,650
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not actually specified but I think</font>

503
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:00,510
it's what most people as you is the

504
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:04,260
m-line in the offer announcer must match

505
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:06,000
so I did the proto the transport in the

506
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:07,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">m-line in the offer an answer must not</font>

507
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,510
sure if you put transport<font color="#E5E5E5"> X in the</font>

508
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:11,010
offering the same line in the

509
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:14,550
corresponding game line in the answer

510
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:17,610
you need to have protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> X also what</font>

511
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:22,320
with what the draft I seep stp says is

512
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:24,000
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> c & M line I guess it in the</font>

513
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,620
boat offer an answer must contain the

514
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">same default candidate the reason why</font>

515
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,580
why it's required in in offer is because

516
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,200
we don't know whether it is going to be

517
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">used in the first place so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to</font>

518
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,309
put something in the c & M line that

519
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,130
works even if the even if the answer

520
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:43,170
doesn't support the one to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> sighs the</font>

521
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,059
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

522
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:47,429
requirement for the answer and there is

523
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:48,899
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> no justification for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the</font>

524
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:51,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem that can occur if you go to the</font>

525
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide please it's what it's offer</font>

526
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,730
an answer have different the offer has

527
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,840
one default candidate and the answer has

528
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:01,110
another one and they use different

529
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,870
transport now we say that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> must put</font>

530
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:05,360
the default in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CNM line but</font>

531
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:07,610
if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer has a different transport</font>

532
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,709
it can't put it in the CNN line because

533
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:11,600
of the tree 264 rules so the only thing

534
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">you tag can do is basically reject the</font>

535
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,550
whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> em line which is kind of stupid</font>

536
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:18,650
because I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it wants to do eyes and</font>

537
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,180
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are candidates with transport that</font>

538
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it does support so it is able</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

539
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:26,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">establish a session so this is just a 32</font>

540
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:28,640
64 restriction issue so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically my</font>

541
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:32,480
suggestion is there that we basically

542
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:34,520
remove the requirement to insert default

543
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,850
candidate in the comm line on the stp

544
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,309
answer the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok we're going</font>

545
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use eyes so so it puts whatever their</font>

546
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:43,550
that matches<font color="#CCCCCC"> their mining offer and and</font>

547
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,470
we're done and then he puts the

548
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,669
candidates because the candidates are

549
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:48,530
going to be used in which actually

550
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:50,360
establish the transporter they see an

551
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:54,080
inline doesn't really matter but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

552
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:56,510
to be there<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the 32 64 so that's</font>

553
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:08,409
my suggestion I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> ecker and I approve</font>

554
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:10,490
this message<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allen fourth I mean I</font>

555
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,170
mention it's on the list as well and yes

556
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:13,850
I definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> support making this change</font>

557
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:21,080
would be a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we just echo what</font>

558
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:22,399
in the offer and ignore it John likes I

559
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,620
mean the one issue here is the other

560
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing this does is it's also for</font>

561
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,340
detecting ice mismatch<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you've</font>

562
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,649
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> an spc that's mucking with your CLM</font>

563
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,870
lines it doesn't understand ice that's

564
00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:37,070
for detecting this I'm worried that'll

565
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:41,020
break that mechanism um I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it</font>

566
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">was I assume was put in ice for a reason</font>

567
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:48,440
ya know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I mean I think that you know</font>

568
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:50,510
and yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> spc shouldn't be passing a</font>

569
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:55,880
equals lines they don't understand but

570
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:57,620
they do so you know i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

571
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:59,990
that's why you know put the ice mismatch

572
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:04,699
stuff was in<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and i'm afraid it'll</font>

573
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,559
break that now mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you i think that the</font>

574
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,600
candidate lists here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean so the worry</font>

575
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:12,950
you have I guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> still early for the PFC</font>

576
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,270
p case is that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have</font>

577
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,730
any candidate that matches this

578
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,809
transport right because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it pretty</font>

579
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,450
if you're doing if you know you're doing

580
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:22,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys what candidate you use doesn't</font>

581
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:23,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">matter as long as there's some candidate</font>

582
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,939
that match the transport that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay but</font>

583
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:29,840
i guess the where you have is you know I

584
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:32,600
offer UDP and TCP PFC p defaulting<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

585
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:35,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">does that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only does UTPB FCP actually</font>

586
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,639
now now now<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rica that yeah the case</font>

587
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,649
where the other endpoint<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't support</font>

588
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,049
a protocol to begin with that's my next

589
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:44,179
issue so so so so it will come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

590
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:46,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one right this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically</font>

591
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:48,230
regarding the mandate to put the default

592
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,059
candidate in the m-line on the alligator

593
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,549
it's the ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> mismatches the case you</font>

594
00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:55,100
care about their if you care about that

595
00:29:52,549 --> 00:29:57,830
and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not sure we do but maybe we do</font>

596
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,178
and based actually but maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> i should</font>

597
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,610
have taken other issue first because

598
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:04,340
depending on how we move forward with

599
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:08,059
the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue maybe this issue is will</font>

600
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:19,580
big will actually go away so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

601
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:21,559
we yeah so the issue is it's actually

602
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the default candidate which is in</font>

603
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,690
the answer it's the selected candidate

604
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,959
it's the selected candidate which goes

605
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the answer so slight correction</font>

606
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,620
terminology I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the original</font>

607
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:36,140
explanation why this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing was needed is</font>

608
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:38,059
if there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything on the line which</font>

609
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,790
monitors the signal<font color="#E5E5E5"> in exchange it</font>

610
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:43,940
doesn't understand ice it needs to know

611
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,389
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport which r.i.p import</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

612
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:50,090
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for communication so it can</font>

613
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,340
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this information from and CNM line</font>

614
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:56,959
and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> remove this requirement they</font>

615
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:59,199
no longer will need this and so that's

616
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,669
why the requirement is there and

617
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,299
basically what happens is if we as I

618
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:09,980
said<font color="#CCCCCC"> if we're switching from UDP to tcp</font>

619
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:12,918
then I will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have different transport</font>

620
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:16,970
protocols in<font color="#E5E5E5"> am line which causes the</font>

621
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:19,970
mismatch which breaks the 32 64 rules so

622
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,400
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue and again I know that</font>

623
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:24,559
requirement that the CNM line is

624
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,299
supposed to match what's actually being

625
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,280
used for communications for some

626
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,990
external monitoring tools then raced

627
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,649
multiple times on the list but i'm not

628
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:36,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure if it</font>

629
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:39,350
actually affecting anyone yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I</font>

630
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,910
other existence anybody is doing

631
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:42,469
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful with this any of this</font>

632
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:45,440
information I mean the bottom line<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

633
00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:49,340
that the instructions in arson 5245 tell

634
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,720
you to put in like the like at least

635
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,669
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the least</font>

636
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,780
likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know set of parameters</font>

637
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:58,960
namely the relay parameters and so like

638
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:05,590
like these mismatches are constant and

639
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:07,790
you know so on you know that the like I

640
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,770
strongly suspect putting chicken chicken

641
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:11,420
chicken<font color="#CCCCCC"> were working</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here and if not</font>

642
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:13,520
putting chicken chicken that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm fairly</font>

643
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:15,770
confident putting like exactly that's it

644
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,379
 you offer put in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> or work um</font>

645
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,850
and like I think it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> incumbent</font>

646
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,350
anybody thinks it like this stuff is

647
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,530
doing anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to like produce</font>

648
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:26,929
some evidence that's the case and I

649
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:28,550
think just I mean in most cases i don't

650
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,780
think there's this is anything even

651
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,210
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an issue because for example</font>

652
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:34,160
RTP<font color="#CCCCCC"> i assume that people are going to</font>

653
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:36,200
put the transport in them and i think

654
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,270
it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very rare that you put</font>

655
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,400
for example tcp in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a transport the same</font>

656
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:42,710
thing goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the data channel actually</font>

657
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:44,960
in the draft a ctp<font color="#CCCCCC"> DTLS we say now that</font>

658
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:49,190
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should use UDP and tcp should just</font>

659
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,440
be the last you know the worst case but

660
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:53,570
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> again came up with BF CP because as</font>

661
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,780
far as i understand maybe FCP UDP and

662
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:58,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp has equal weight so to say there is</font>

663
00:32:56,780 --> 00:33:00,590
no one which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more you know and then</font>

664
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:02,629
the other so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think that's where where</font>

665
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,389
this issue could could come up and as

666
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:07,070
far<font color="#CCCCCC"> as i know in bisbee FCP endpoints</font>

667
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:09,350
don't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> support both tcp and UDP</font>

668
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,909
they could support just one of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

669
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:13,879
then we come to them no more<font color="#E5E5E5"> today soon</font>

670
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:15,830
in my next issue so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't support</font>

671
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,040
the protocol to begin with so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

672
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:21,710
transport Adam<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roche going back to what</font>

673
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,720
Donovan was saying I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he like</font>

674
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,390
gave an answer to the problem but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

675
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,160
kind of breezed past it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if you</font>

676
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:31,040
just say we're changing mismatch

677
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,900
detection for answers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if it</font>

678
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,159
doesn't match any of the candidates if

679
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:35,540
the mismatch as opposed to it doesn't

680
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,550
match the default candidate is a

681
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,690
mismatch and then everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> works I</font>

682
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:41,050
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that makes Jonathan's problem go</font>

683
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,050
away now

684
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:50,420
now the this CNM line is what defines

685
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:51,920
what the default candidate is this

686
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,690
matches when the CNM mine don't match

687
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,360
any candidate and that means you've

688
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,240
gotta be<font color="#CCCCCC"> WA and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> its mucking with</font>

689
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,740
your stp but leaving a equals caturday

690
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,900
didn't without understanding it one it's

691
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,640
understood your<font color="#CCCCCC"> issue well i mean i</font>

692
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,670
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CNMI should obviously match</font>

693
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:10,280
some candidate I mean otherwise yes oh

694
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:11,990
yes so so we can of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course yeah we have</font>

695
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:14,090
we cannot take saying that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean</font>

696
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:16,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">it can say that the CNN line must must</font>

697
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,169
match a candidate we cannot say that's

698
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,030
what it says when<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the problem like</font>

699
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:22,819
you said is the BF CP case where you

700
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:24,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't you know is the cnmi i mean if you</font>

701
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,610
say see them on must match some

702
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:28,280
candidate and must use the same

703
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,690
transporters in the offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem the</font>

704
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem you want to do is the DFC pk's</font>

705
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,500
yes so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should go to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

706
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:35,780
issue we can come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because i</font>

707
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,730
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i described that that that's the</font>

708
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">next issue where you don't support the</font>

709
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,649
transport begin with so do you want to

710
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:45,379
comment on this or you wanna make okay

711
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:47,569
so some next slide please<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

712
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:50,060
basically did is the dress turn you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

713
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:51,800
so for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note taker sounds like</font>

714
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:59,450
there's no clear conclusion on this one

715
00:34:51,800 --> 00:35:00,740
is ok we got finally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the basic</font>

716
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,890
the background is for the same thing

717
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,379
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the transport in the arson in</font>

718
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:09,830
the answer has to match the offers an

719
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:12,350
excellent<font color="#E5E5E5"> please so this is basically</font>

720
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,270
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the answer does not support a</font>

721
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:17,150
transport in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a.m line of the offer</font>

722
00:35:14,270 --> 00:35:19,100
to begin wit and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess here we're</font>

723
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:25,880
mostly talking about the BFC be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> BF</font>

724
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:28,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">CP contains an offer in the CM line you</font>

725
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">have for example UDP and then you have a</font>

726
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:33,919
candidate<font color="#E5E5E5"> for tcp so the offer does</font>

727
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:35,750
support boat UDP and tcp but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font>

728
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,540
line it puts the UDP and then it has a

729
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:42,310
tcp candidate now let's say that that

730
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:44,420
answer he only supports tcp and

731
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,549
basically yeah that's fine though<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

732
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,770
sent me a tcp candidate so we can you

733
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:51,050
know establish but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again you have this</font>

734
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:53,900
rule that the answer damn line in the

735
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:56,210
answer must have a same transport so

736
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,339
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer has to put UDP</font>

737
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:01,160
in the ACM line of the answer even if it

738
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:03,680
doesn't support<font color="#E5E5E5"> UDP begin with so can I</font>

739
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,580
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gesture you know so so so now it's</font>

740
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">a next slide please so basically I had</font>

741
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:11,598
two alternatives of how we can solve

742
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">this first we could define that every</font>

743
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,190
protocol<font color="#E5E5E5"> supporting eyes must define a</font>

744
00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:18,950
mandatory to support transport again for

745
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:20,780
RTP I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the factoria you if</font>

746
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,118
you support if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do are to be used for</font>

747
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:25,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">two DP you may sue participe if you do</font>

748
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,520
the data channel you support you defeat

749
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:30,320
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again with BF CP you cannot assume</font>

750
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:38,630
that all endpoints are going to support

751
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">both UDP and TCP so basically that's it</font>

752
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:44,060
we define a mass support transport and

753
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:47,150
but the alternatives to is basically we

754
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:51,320
allow the answer to put whatever in the

755
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,730
CM line and because again it knows that

756
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:54,020
ice is going to be used so you're

757
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,609
actually going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the candidates</font>

758
00:36:54,020 --> 00:37:00,290
then to actually establish the

759
00:36:55,609 --> 00:37:02,359
connection so I know this is a little

760
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:04,400
hacky you put<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the CM I mean</font>

761
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:06,140
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the thing you know we shouldn't</font>

762
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,599
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 cm long to begin with when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

763
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">eyes but but but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

764
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:14,869
we have so so yeah I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exa me know</font>

765
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,580
the third possibility is as you said

766
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,080
there's you know you're just inferring

767
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,930
that the transports have to match the

768
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,940
offer and the answer I mean evil

769
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:26,690
anything break if I mean if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

770
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:28,820
say that if you're using eyes they don't

771
00:37:26,690 --> 00:37:31,250
you know they have to semantically match

772
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:34,010
but you know they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to actually</font>

773
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:36,530
match because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> default candidates</font>

774
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,690
might be different yeah as I said there

775
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,980
is nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 32 64 and please correct</font>

776
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,839
me if I'm wrong that say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

777
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,760
transporting offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> also has too much I</font>

778
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:46,250
was looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm right so that there</font>

779
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,720
is a wealthiest about that so so so hey

780
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:50,660
let's say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have to match and</font>

781
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:52,549
well sure if the community<font color="#E5E5E5"> can agree on</font>

782
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,250
that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

783
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:57,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">we need to agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on because a lot of</font>

784
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:59,150
people are talk to you are assuming yet

785
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,150
the Transport has too much in the offer

786
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:07,940
answer not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transport but I hold</font>

787
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:10,150
the whole proto proto value so so so if

788
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,650
we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to room</font>

789
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:14,420
you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's true maybe we</font>

790
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:15,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">should update to 26 for them to clarify</font>

791
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,339
that but but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a separate issue but</font>

792
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,779
but II if we make that assumption we

793
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:25,160
should have let's get it into the nose I

794
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:27,339
think of this meeting Charles<font color="#CCCCCC"> a call so</font>

795
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,769
I i agree with you<font color="#E5E5E5"> i kind of have that</font>

796
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:32,869
assumption that the what you put in the

797
00:38:30,769 --> 00:38:34,419
inline the<font color="#E5E5E5"> transport needed to match i</font>

798
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:37,609
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have that</font>

799
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:40,609
built in so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think it's safer to remain</font>

800
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:42,739
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that but relaxing the rule checking</font>

801
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:44,058
that you do is to like when<font color="#CCCCCC"> isis in</font>

802
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:46,579
effect i think is okay and i thought

803
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was the way it was that's why ice</font>

804
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:51,529
is written right and then if you happen

805
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:53,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">to like if you say UDP in your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> m line</font>

806
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,949
but the ice candidate you end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

807
00:38:53,449 --> 00:39:00,920
is TCP I thought you had to send

808
00:38:54,949 --> 00:39:02,420
re-invite yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I don't think today</font>

809
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,729
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to send entry in white</font>

810
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,469
but I mean that's after the real fur

811
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:09,098
answer first operons the transaction is

812
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:13,249
done right that's when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you basically</font>

813
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:17,239
update to to write another middle boxers

814
00:39:13,249 --> 00:39:18,948
I thought yes I think they issued but by

815
00:39:17,239 --> 00:39:21,619
relaxing this because let's say that I

816
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:24,469
offer you UDP I put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a transport</font>

817
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:27,589
and then you send me back for example

818
00:39:24,469 --> 00:39:30,109
tcp in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end line of your transport</font>

819
00:39:27,589 --> 00:39:33,229
let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't do eyes you know how</font>

820
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:34,940
do you know that I support tcp you do

821
00:39:33,229 --> 00:39:36,709
now sighs support UDP because that's why

822
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:40,699
I had in my not offer but now you send

823
00:39:36,709 --> 00:39:44,598
tcp back because that but so you don't

824
00:39:40,699 --> 00:39:46,969
know if I support<font color="#E5E5E5"> it no so what you put</font>

825
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,920
in the m-line you keep if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you said UD p</font>

826
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:50,719
and the m-line answer in the answer you

827
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,239
keep it as<font color="#E5E5E5"> UTP but you left the ice</font>

828
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">negotiations still happen yeah so you</font>

829
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:57,229
mean yeah sure yeah so that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

830
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,788
put UDP a name line on the answer even

831
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:01,160
though i may not support it to begin

832
00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:04,839
with because I do support<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tcp that</font>

833
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,839
you hadn't you in the candidate right

834
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:16,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll unfold on you have just to echo</font>

835
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:18,709
that number two seems the way to go here

836
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:21,910
clarification here would be useful and

837
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,910
yeah everything will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better</font>

838
00:40:22,099 --> 00:40:29,729
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a you know did</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discard port</font>

839
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:39,029
known invalid address and you know

840
00:40:29,729 --> 00:40:40,828
priority 0 candidate yeah well that

841
00:40:39,029 --> 00:40:42,660
brings another question if he put not

842
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:44,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">tcp in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> m-line do you have to</font>

843
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a dummy candidate also pointed to TV</font>

844
00:40:44,729 --> 00:40:48,598
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I don't think yeah but</font>

845
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:51,749
yeah but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't think what why should</font>

846
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:54,150
we do that I mean it's because at least

847
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:56,038
in the 5245<font color="#E5E5E5"> roles if it doesn't match</font>

848
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:58,410
you're not it's it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mismatching</font>

849
00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:01,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very nice the cni mine has to</font>

850
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:04,379
match one candidate<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe we</font>

851
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,450
shouldn't remove that restriction to

852
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:12,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">Italy in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I do get it in the</font>

853
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:14,399
offer but but but yeah I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> again we</font>

854
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:15,900
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remember that for most uses this</font>

855
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,869
is not going to be an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know i</font>

856
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">agree for rtb these diseases at this</font>

857
00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:24,420
moment I can only think of<font color="#CCCCCC"> B</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FCP where</font>

858
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:28,499
it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> made become an issue cause you</font>

859
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:31,319
want something edible that's right ah

860
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:34,098
first of all we're still having an issue

861
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:36,479
where we have a backwards compatibility

862
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,219
where for instance when you're sending

863
00:41:36,479 --> 00:41:40,529
did you fall when the remote party does

864
00:41:38,219 --> 00:41:43,229
not support ice and we send an offer

865
00:41:40,529 --> 00:41:45,059
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCP and it only supports ugp that</font>

866
00:41:43,229 --> 00:41:49,038
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will fail even though we</font>

867
00:41:45,059 --> 00:41:52,430
technically support<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp so that's issue</font>

868
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:55,739
number one which by still dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

869
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,719
issue number or the data proposal which

870
00:41:55,739 --> 00:42:00,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">I had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not sure if it's mighty little</font>

871
00:41:57,719 --> 00:42:03,749
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> radical is to also add the ice</font>

872
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:07,229
transfer tag so when we basically don't

873
00:42:03,749 --> 00:42:15,269
want to deal with selecting UDP or<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

874
00:42:07,229 --> 00:42:17,399
just put I so RT<font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls srtp and in the</font>

875
00:42:15,269 --> 00:42:19,200
offer and put the same in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer and</font>

876
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:21,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">put a bogus IP address in there and</font>

877
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,618
don't deal with default candidate at all

878
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:27,749
because in what way rookies if you put

879
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:29,249
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> so called the ice transport in the</font>

880
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:30,988
m-line of the offer then you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

881
00:42:29,249 --> 00:42:34,140
backward compatibility if the answer

882
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:35,040
doesn't support ice and the first thing

883
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,480
you said if

884
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,980
if the endpoints don't support the same

885
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,990
transport to begin with I mean obviously

886
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:41,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">then it's going to fail there's nothing</font>

887
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:44,009
we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that no matter if they do ice</font>

888
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:45,450
or not I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if they don't so if I only</font>

889
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:48,810
support you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a new only support</font>

890
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,339
disappear as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> session I mean I'm not</font>

891
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:52,860
trying to fix that because there is not

892
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:55,020
fixable no but I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just do what I was</font>

893
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:58,500
saying is when the offer offers support

894
00:42:55,020 --> 00:43:01,020
both what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a UDP and TCP it makes a</font>

895
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,570
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> of putting UD be in the offer</font>

896
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the answer only supports DCP it</font>

897
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:08,670
doesn't support ice that setup fails but

898
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:13,820
it's kind of a use case one use case 2

899
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:17,340
is where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you don't need any</font>

900
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:19,530
way you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't only want to</font>

901
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:21,990
support ice and with that's what we do

902
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:23,580
with WebRTC<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're with technically are</font>

903
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:25,950
putting a bogus IP address in the

904
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,840
default candidate so this whole dance

905
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:31,319
which will have with the default can do

906
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:33,750
this kind of pointless so if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just</font>

907
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,280
indicate it clearly that there is no

908
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:37,020
default candidate there and we have a

909
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,950
different transport we kind of bypass

910
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,170
that problem for cases where no nice use

911
00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,540
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not supported to begin with so</font>

912
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:46,950
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> two independent but the first</font>

913
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an issue in the second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

914
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:53,730
proposal for cases when I when I see is

915
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:55,770
required I agree and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bar</font>

916
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">t see another usage is so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fine</font>

917
00:43:55,770 --> 00:44:02,070
to mandate but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think in our</font>

918
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:04,500
documents we want to in this generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice</font>

919
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:06,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">stp I don't think we want to assume that</font>

920
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,590
the other endpoint supports eyes I mean

921
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:11,400
we want to have this backward

922
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:14,100
compatibility case but then essentially

923
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:16,350
what you probably want to do is if you

924
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,529
end point support both<font color="#E5E5E5"> you GP in TCP you</font>

925
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:23,420
want to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> to em lines one which would</font>

926
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:28,800
be a TCP and other which would be u GP

927
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:31,920
and have some way of basically the

928
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,050
answer picking one that's the that's the

929
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,080
backwards compatibility case that you're

930
00:44:34,050 --> 00:44:39,480
trying to achieve because the be

931
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:44,940
backwards compatible yes that's all stp

932
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,500
kapnek I mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Anderson but we're</font>

933
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,400
still kind of try we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to solve</font>

934
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,230
the problem which doesn't necessarily

935
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:54,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">souls itself quite quite cleanly right</font>

936
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:57,690
now because even if with the issue that

937
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,520
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> raised is basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

938
00:44:57,690 --> 00:45:01,050
generating an offer we need to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

939
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,259
protocol but we don't know which one

940
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:06,270
they answer will support and it doesn't

941
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:08,760
work for the oil and we kind of have

942
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:18,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">sold it when they answer just happens to</font>

943
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:21,240
support ice crystal just a time check

944
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:25,190
you got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 minutes left total so you</font>

945
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:25,189
decide how you want to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> that time</font>

946
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,419
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway so i'll just make a very</font>

947
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:50,759
quick answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roman's point in depth</font>

948
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:51,930
that problem it is today you have to

949
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:53,310
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> a guess at the surface it's a way</font>

950
00:45:51,930 --> 00:45:56,940
it's done yeah maybe you should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

951
00:45:53,310 --> 00:46:01,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> em lines but that's not the way</font>

952
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:04,619
it's done so we find it r is over yeah

953
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:06,930
so I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> we discussed this multiple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> m</font>

954
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:08,670
lines in the past many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago for all</font>

955
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:11,040
different kind of reasons if you for

956
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:13,680
example a if you want to offer about a

957
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,440
vp and sav p and all this kind of stuff

958
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,390
but but and obviously you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have bundled</font>

959
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">but that's not really fit because you</font>

960
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:21,470
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really doing multiplexing here you</font>

961
00:46:20,070 --> 00:46:24,300
differ you're giving different

962
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:31,770
alternatives and the mechanism we define

963
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:34,560
for that was captaining so so yeah but

964
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:37,650
anyway so so okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we move on I just</font>

965
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,600
like to go through<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no I was</font>

966
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:44,160
always trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this to resolution</font>

967
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:47,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Nobel okay can we can we agree</font>

968
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:49,529
that this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about an answer in</font>

969
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">answers behavior okay we have to i send</font>

970
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:54,359
points we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the offer will do</font>

971
00:46:52,050 --> 00:46:56,640
that we're wondering how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to answer okay</font>

972
00:46:54,359 --> 00:47:00,630
and we have basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> two possibilities</font>

973
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,850
a answer with a default candidate that

974
00:47:00,630 --> 00:47:08,000
doesn't exist

975
00:47:01,850 --> 00:47:12,770
or be use a candidate that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is in the</font>

976
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:15,200
list but relax the matching constraints

977
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:22,670
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those are the two choices and</font>

978
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:24,560
we can let vote that maybe hum Charles

979
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:29,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Echols I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of examples</font>

980
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:32,540
from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past where where the answer can</font>

981
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:35,509
be do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe isn't</font>

982
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:37,160
entirely correct by the standard when it

983
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:38,390
has enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> information from the offer</font>

984
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,310
and what it knows of its own

985
00:47:38,390 --> 00:47:42,290
capabilities to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right thing and</font>

986
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:44,420
the way we've always defined it is put

987
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:46,910
the right thing in the offer for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

988
00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:48,980
m-line so that for backward

989
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:52,210
compatibility something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't</font>

990
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:56,450
know this new thing whether it be ice or

991
00:47:52,210 --> 00:48:00,890
feedback parameters or rtcp here or if

992
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:04,939
it's using security that securing the

993
00:48:00,890 --> 00:48:07,129
RTP the right thing happens so for

994
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:10,100
example putting a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp but letting someone</font>

995
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,230
answer with leaving the m-line as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> vp</font>

996
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,810
even though they put feedback parameters

997
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:17,000
in there are sending a VPN and using

998
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:19,009
security you know you should have put

999
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:23,330
sav key but you didn't because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

1000
00:48:19,010 --> 00:48:24,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">the call might fail that's that's we've</font>

1001
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:27,110
done that a lot in the past it's always

1002
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:28,520
worked out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bad that we had</font>

1003
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,930
to do it but it seemed better than<font color="#E5E5E5"> kath</font>

1004
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:33,380
nigga<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one more</font>

1005
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:34,850
example take that same approach do the

1006
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:37,100
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the offer that's going to work</font>

1007
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,440
if for backward compatibility if the

1008
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,710
answer it doesn't support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the new thing</font>

1009
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,840
doesn't support ice then you know if

1010
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:48,110
they do they let ice do its thing and

1011
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:50,840
and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> echo back the inline what you</font>

1012
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:52,730
got a need in the offer so and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1013
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,170
have to send a reinvite great we do that

1014
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:57,370
that way the middle boxes are happy

1015
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,370
we've done that a lot boys

1016
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:09,250
Roman colleges we just plus our town

1017
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:10,869
here Roman go ahead again just I think

1018
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:12,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">the better solution is just to have a</font>

1019
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:14,410
must implement transport for the

1020
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,140
protocols right now the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing which</font>

1021
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:19,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of out of that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FCP and</font>

1022
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:21,578
that solves all the problems with legacy

1023
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,399
it solves all the problems with current

1024
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:27,280
stuff so might be easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it that</font>

1025
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,930
way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would have to say that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1026
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">must use that as default candidate also</font>

1027
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:32,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you might basic you and you will</font>

1028
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,599
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you must use it as a default</font>

1029
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:36,400
candidate to no for an answer and once

1030
00:49:34,599 --> 00:49:38,230
you pick something different for eyes

1031
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:45,369
you do another we invited to move to the

1032
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:47,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">next one and corrected that would work</font>

1033
00:49:45,369 --> 00:49:49,180
fine as long as no one had shipped the

1034
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:51,490
FCP yet but given<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have shipped it</font>

1035
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,618
for over<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 years changing it in any way</font>

1036
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:55,209
whatsoever is impossible for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case</font>

1037
00:49:53,619 --> 00:49:56,770
so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bad news this is the</font>

1038
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,690
really good news for everything that

1039
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,040
does ice it absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't matter</font>

1040
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:06,010
what you put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this field right because</font>

1041
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:07,750
it ignores it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I write it well and so</font>

1042
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,980
for what we should do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for so what</font>

1043
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:10,930
we should put in here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1044
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,390
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause the least surprises for stuff</font>

1045
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:14,919
that doesn't understand it um which is

1046
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:16,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's exactly what Charles</font>

1047
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,670
said is just like copy the data back in

1048
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:22,270
there and i don't know like we've we've

1049
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:23,500
discussed this probably what every six

1050
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,680
months for the past four<font color="#CCCCCC"> years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1051
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:30,970
always reach the same conclusion I let's

1052
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,859
kill it I mean that's that that it you

1053
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,299
know which choice which of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two you</font>

1054
00:50:32,859 --> 00:50:35,920
you nicely put what the choices<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

1055
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,180
which of the two choices we choose

1056
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,920
doesn't make any difference to someone

1057
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:40,328
who does ice so we're only talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1058
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,829
what happens to things that are on path

1059
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,480
on the signaling path and don't

1060
00:50:41,829 --> 00:50:45,130
understand ice and the thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font>

1061
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,960
cause them least surprises echoing the

1062
00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:50,380
value in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's the conclusion we reach</font>

1063
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:52,000
every time we discuss this so basically

1064
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:54,490
what you're saying here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is alternative</font>

1065
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,470
to we can't make alternative one because

1066
00:50:54,490 --> 00:50:58,959
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's too late for BF c p at</font>

1067
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:03,098
least alternative to is basically put

1068
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,859
whatever in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inline or does it put in</font>

1069
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:08,859
thief if you're doing ice in the blank a

1070
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:11,619
relevant field which no one reads copy

1071
00:51:08,859 --> 00:51:12,549
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data that was came from the other</font>

1072
00:51:11,619 --> 00:51:17,890
direction

1073
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:19,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on proposed it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so in</font>

1074
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:23,679
the interest<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to close something</font>

1075
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:29,439
here can we get a hum of people in favor

1076
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:35,709
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 and people opposed to two so if you</font>

1077
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:40,449
are in favor of option to hum now if you

1078
00:51:35,709 --> 00:51:46,239
are post option to Amell<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right for</font>

1079
00:51:40,449 --> 00:51:48,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> note-taker option through please so</font>

1080
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,439
Krista you got nine minutes what you

1081
00:51:48,009 --> 00:51:52,150
want to yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the previous one I</font>

1082
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:54,609
assume this also means that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1083
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">to remove the requirement to put the</font>

1084
00:51:54,609 --> 00:51:58,179
default candidate the damn line<font color="#CCCCCC"> adults</font>

1085
00:51:56,469 --> 00:52:00,249
or because you know we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font>

1086
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:02,499
that yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> put something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there I</font>

1087
00:52:00,249 --> 00:52:06,939
just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that didn't entry node</font>

1088
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:08,649
I mean that was my suggestion of the

1089
00:52:06,939 --> 00:52:18,160
previous if you go a couple of slides

1090
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:19,569
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> no that one more yeah there's a</font>

1091
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,098
spelling error they should be removed

1092
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:23,229
but basically we're not going to say

1093
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:26,289
that that you have to put their default

1094
00:52:23,229 --> 00:52:28,660
candidate in am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not answer alright so</font>

1095
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:31,410
again just asking real quick anybody

1096
00:52:28,660 --> 00:52:34,479
opposed to the proposed solution here

1097
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:37,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">John dies i think that implementation is</font>

1098
00:52:34,479 --> 00:52:38,618
doing a strict 5245 implementation will

1099
00:52:37,390 --> 00:52:42,429
have a problem with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

1100
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:44,170
propose instead add a it mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

1101
00:52:42,429 --> 00:52:47,140
to put something<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

1102
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:49,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">match a candidate so in these weird</font>

1103
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:51,670
transport mismatches cases which is the

1104
00:52:49,479 --> 00:52:55,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">only case that matters make it you know</font>

1105
00:52:51,670 --> 00:52:57,729
put a you know priority 0 invalid IP

1106
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:59,380
address dummy candidate as you know to

1107
00:52:57,729 --> 00:53:01,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">the list just to keep things like that</font>

1108
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:03,579
happening keep in mind that we have this

1109
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:05,140
ice to option this ice option which is

1110
00:53:03,579 --> 00:53:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be in the offer so if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1111
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,799
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something which is doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1112
00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:11,348
backward we can always<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that you</font>

1113
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:13,538
<font color="#CCCCCC">know this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something you can do if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1114
00:53:11,349 --> 00:53:15,929
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay they offer supports they send</font>

1115
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:15,929
that song

1116
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:22,890
come on Jensen I can easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> live with</font>

1117
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,930
that but don't we didn't we always

1118
00:53:22,890 --> 00:53:28,890
previously put whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought you</font>

1119
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:30,180
were using was what you put in here but

1120
00:53:28,890 --> 00:53:32,730
I thought we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> said in the earlier</font>

1121
00:53:30,180 --> 00:53:38,700
slide we will be harmed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for alternative</font>

1122
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:41,610
to which base a different field no this

1123
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:43,319
is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support right no I'm the</font>

1124
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:46,800
boat both issues are<font color="#E5E5E5"> barred to</font>

1125
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:53,210
transporting them line right<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1126
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">partridge okay yep it's copy across okay</font>

1127
00:53:53,210 --> 00:53:58,020
so so could you restate the conclusion

1128
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:07,020
because I'm not sure I understood how

1129
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:10,080
Jonathan modified it so my suggestion to

1130
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:14,040
avoid ice mismatch so I mean so my

1131
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:16,440
suggestion was that you know meaning you

1132
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:17,700
have to pick a candidate doesn't you

1133
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:18,720
know either it doesn't matter which or

1134
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:20,939
columns you know the one you think

1135
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll be using if you're in this case</font>

1136
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:25,770
where you have the transport mismatch

1137
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:28,109
include a dummy you know you know zero

1138
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:30,270
priority dummy candidate of the correct

1139
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:33,660
transport you know with lower priority

1140
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:39,120
than any of your of your other ones I

1141
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:40,649
think so you're basically okay with this

1142
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:43,350
but you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the stomach and</font>

1143
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:52,050
atomic a today and just<font color="#CCCCCC"> satisfies</font>

1144
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:53,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">mismatched issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1145
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:55,980
seems a particular enormous ounce of

1146
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,960
Hoops to fix something which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet to</font>

1147
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:59,070
be established<font color="#E5E5E5"> if your problem like if</font>

1148
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:01,200
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> nice miss match the connection</font>

1149
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:04,200
will fail and you will notice that and

1150
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,279
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> early</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lore early warning on that does</font>

1151
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,990
not seem like a particular important

1152
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,120
function is the ethicist<font color="#CCCCCC"> at was anybody</font>

1153
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:13,410
actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that like like again I</font>

1154
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:14,700
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incumbent on you like</font>

1155
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:15,810
demonstrate this is like something we

1156
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:19,890
actually is were thinking any

1157
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:21,720
accommodation for whatsoever<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1158
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think we still don't have a clear</font>

1159
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:24,750
conclusion on this one and if you want

1160
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:26,100
to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you spend your last</font>

1161
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,810
five minutes trying to get to a

1162
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,330
conclusion I like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to move on to the next</font>

1163
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:32,670
one I I think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we more or</font>

1164
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:35,130
less agree i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> jonathans issue</font>

1165
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:36,270
to make sure that that that maybe we

1166
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:37,890
need something for backward

1167
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:39,960
compatibility but again we can use that

1168
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">maybe we can say you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if</font>

1169
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:43,650
there is if if this ice to option is not

1170
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:47,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">there you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put this dummy</font>

1171
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:50,040
candidate otherwise we can remove<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1172
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:53,098
requirement also but but I think we uh

1173
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:54,750
we have a movie<font color="#E5E5E5"> part forward I don't</font>

1174
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:57,150
have text here so we need to do pull

1175
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:59,339
request and so on and see that so yeah

1176
00:55:57,150 --> 00:56:00,930
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some text and you know discuss</font>

1177
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,089
that on the list then you know Acker I

1178
00:56:00,930 --> 00:56:06,598
hope that satisfies you know your

1179
00:56:03,089 --> 00:56:09,020
concern as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so move</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on because</font>

1180
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:14,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I think that the last thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1181
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:17,299
important because it so<font color="#CCCCCC"> three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

1182
00:56:14,849 --> 00:56:17,299
forward

1183
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:41,339
one more one more one more yeah this is

1184
00:56:38,819 --> 00:56:42,960
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a text that we put</font>

1185
00:56:41,339 --> 00:56:46,020
together with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roman when we were</font>

1186
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,720
writing the AC TPS DP draft but then we

1187
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,059
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is generic ice</font>

1188
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">generica ssdp so it should be put into</font>

1189
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:56,670
that document so basically that some

1190
00:56:55,230 --> 00:56:59,550
background again you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have two endpoints</font>

1191
00:56:56,670 --> 00:57:01,619
that negotiate this media session you

1192
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:04,980
know they may have UDP<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP base</font>

1193
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:07,950
candidates and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

1194
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:10,020
nomination you based on removal of

1195
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:11,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">addressing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of all that so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> net</font>

1196
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:17,970
nomination that the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> media can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1197
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:20,670
sent on any valid pair and and you can

1198
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:23,490
switch between candidate pairs before

1199
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:25,020
you have done denomination you know if

1200
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,200
you trickle it may take a long time

1201
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:29,970
before you do nomination and so on and

1202
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,618
as you switch between candidates

1203
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,180
obviously the transport may switch

1204
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:41,880
because if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> both tcp and UDP</font>

1205
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:45,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">candidates so next slide please ok now</font>

1206
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,680
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> did you go backward or is this</font>

1207
00:57:56,580 --> 00:58:07,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah go yeah one more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that no no</font>

1208
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:09,720
one okay so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is basically rafin</font>

1209
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:12,240
here a couple of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't want to</font>

1210
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,680
change what what I just had their this

1211
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:18,540
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a clarification text so first we</font>

1212
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:20,279
we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's good to clarify that</font>

1213
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:21,840
when when the endpoints which is

1214
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,780
transport you don't need to send an

1215
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:26,640
offer on to offer to reflect that

1216
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:28,800
because that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means during nomination or</font>

1217
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,660
before nomination if you switch between

1218
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,280
UDP and candidates you would have to

1219
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:34,350
send a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> updates before the call</font>

1220
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:36,090
hasn't even been you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> accept it so</font>

1221
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,589
we want just I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think anyone would</font>

1222
00:58:36,090 --> 00:58:40,260
do that but I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to clarify</font>

1223
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:44,280
that to make sure that you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1224
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:46,380
send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> new offer the m-line is what it</font>

1225
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,830
is and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be while you switch you</font>

1226
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:51,780
can switch try the transport but then

1227
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:53,580
when an offer is sent for another reason

1228
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:55,830
and this could<font color="#CCCCCC"> off this could of course</font>

1229
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:58,440
be for example once you've done the ice

1230
00:58:55,830 --> 00:59:01,950
nomination but maybe you're sending an

1231
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:04,230
offer for a cone ice related issue then

1232
00:59:01,950 --> 00:59:07,890
within that<font color="#CCCCCC"> M line should always match</font>

1233
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:09,840
the currently used transport then not

1234
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:12,089
denominated transport I guess we should

1235
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:15,090
call<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so if you if you sent the</font>

1236
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:18,360
initial offer for example using UDP but

1237
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:20,640
then you're going to end up using a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP</font>

1238
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:25,250
candidate so next time you send an offer

1239
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,250
you should actually have<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a month</font>

1240
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:29,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">drop lines I think your question isn't</font>

1241
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:32,160
possible because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean by definition</font>

1242
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,840
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> something's nominated you know what</font>

1243
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:37,290
candidate parrot uses which is using a

1244
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,640
certain can't transport right so I think

1245
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:40,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">your question could only happen if</font>

1246
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:46,350
you're setting an update before

1247
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:48,450
nomination yeah but is it mandatory to

1248
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:50,100
send update once nomination is done no

1249
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,450
and then at all I mean mate I don't know

1250
00:59:50,100 --> 00:59:53,160
and then now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back to the I</font>

1251
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,569
know you have a shoes way to expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1252
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,790
there's been talking about these never

1253
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:59,540
doing the nomination I guess that

1254
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:01,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion doesn't get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also so i think</font>

1255
00:59:59,540 --> 01:00:04,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">is your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet point question under to</font>

1256
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:06,870
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> only applies before nomination</font>

1257
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:11,179
after nomination by definition are using

1258
01:00:06,870 --> 01:00:14,009
the same same transport because

1259
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:15,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">domination has sure but I think it would</font>

1260
01:00:14,009 --> 01:00:18,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">be good to say that off denomination</font>

1261
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:20,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">dead am line always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to match to</font>
