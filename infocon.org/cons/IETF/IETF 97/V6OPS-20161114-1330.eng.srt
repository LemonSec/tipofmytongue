00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,880
remind you of what this document is this

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:49,010
document has been around for a long time

00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I don't feel bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have</font>

102
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:58,370
hoping to put out it put it out of its

103
00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:00,919
misery shortly um the last time we

104
00:07:58,370 --> 00:08:03,620
actually presented this document<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

105
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:05,870
in Yokohama a whole year ago because I

106
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,849
then went AWOL for most of this year

107
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,649
were

108
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,558
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> another project and it was only due</font>

109
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:14,439
to victor over there and kindly sort of

110
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:16,449
but repeatedly prompting me saying we

111
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:18,039
should work on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> document we really</font>

112
00:08:16,449 --> 00:08:20,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">should work on the document that we're</font>

113
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,429
here at all so a little kudos to rip to

114
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:26,249
Victor for making it happen anyway so<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font>

115
00:08:23,429 --> 00:08:29,138
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to talk about their we</font>

116
00:08:26,249 --> 00:08:31,119
modified the document scope a little bit

117
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:32,680
or clarified i guess that's actually

118
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:35,139
clarified the document scope a little

119
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:36,609
bit we made a number of changes and i'll

120
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:39,729
go through this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there are the</font>

121
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:42,610
changes in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp section</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> uh just</font>

122
00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,680
adding a bunch of detail we tweaked the

123
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">bgb section and we did a complete</font>

124
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,000
rewrite of the addressing section

125
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,940
because we got hell for that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> yokohama</font>

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,399
so okay with that next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

127
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,079
here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one side so what is this</font>

128
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:03,040
document for all of you who have

129
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:08,680
forgotten it describes routing related

130
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:11,139
design choices in v6 only or dual stack

131
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,500
networks and these are if you will sort

132
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:17,319
of their sort of lower<font color="#E5E5E5"> level than most</font>

133
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:20,529
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher level here is how you do</font>

134
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:23,079
v6 deployments that the working group

135
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:26,439
has previously published though it has

136
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:28,899
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying 078 of those over the past</font>

137
00:09:26,439 --> 00:09:32,259
number of years so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font>

138
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,699
lower level than that and it assume so

139
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:39,910
it's running late and only first of all

140
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:43,870
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS it is not dhcp it is not</font>

141
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,600
and host<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it is Rowdy related and it</font>

142
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:49,720
assumes that the reader has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

143
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,490
knowledge of v4 network design and so

153
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:18,699
comments we last we're here discussing

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,839
Victor finally parted me we got back to

157
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:29,170
this uh we had a dash ten at dash 11 and

158
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,230
as of now today a dash 12 trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

159
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:36,819
actually finish this document up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

160
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:38,800
next slide okay changes so very early

161
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,420
with versions of this document actually

162
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,599
just said he would talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anything</font>

163
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:46,089
related to v6 design choices that was

164
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,740
obviously way too big you could write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

165
00:10:46,089 --> 00:10:50,830
hundred page document or something like

166
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,990
that with that type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> scope so we</font>

167
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:56,320
Claire cut<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one down actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty</font>

168
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,029
soon shortly it in the introduction it

169
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,270
is said routing related for quite a

170
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:04,510
while but we kept on having people sort

171
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:06,460
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> overlook that portion so this morning</font>

172
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,730
the dashed well version that publishes

173
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:12,580
now says routing related in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the title as</font>

174
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:14,620
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that was the probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

175
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:21,220
biggest single change that went in in

176
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:24,940
the dash 12 version okay next ah neutral

177
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:28,839
tone so when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document started it was</font>

178
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:31,360
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing one up there okay it was</font>

179
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,400
saying here's a choice here your options

180
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,700
here are some facts about these options

181
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:40,020
here some pros and cons as we worked

182
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:42,610
away on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> document a number of</font>

183
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,310
sections started slipping to be more

184
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,200
number two okay where they didn't

185
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:50,260
present pros and cons they just said do

186
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,050
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> this way one of the comments we got</font>

187
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,020
in Yokohama was that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was not good</font>

188
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:57,910
we agreed with them so part of the

189
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,650
rewrite that we did this<font color="#E5E5E5"> fall was to go</font>

190
00:11:57,910 --> 00:12:02,079
back through clean up the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

191
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,040
just do one<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere basically</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

192
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,390
idea is<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. mrs. network designer here</font>

193
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,310
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> your choices here are your options</font>

194
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,410
here are some facts that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

195
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,859
know maybe a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pros and cons now</font>

196
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:20,560
you make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own decision okay what way</font>

197
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:23,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next okay so I GP</font>

198
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,319
section so when this section was

199
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:29,260
originally published it focused mostly

200
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,760
around a survey that Victor and I did

201
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:37,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">about two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of operators on</font>

202
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,819
what I GPS they actually ran in

203
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,739
production networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that was the</font>

204
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,830
primary focus of this one of the

205
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,590
feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got was it would be good to</font>

206
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a little bit more to back that up</font>

207
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:53,200
so the now in the new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a lot</font>

208
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,450
more text about okay here are your

209
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">choices here are some pros and cons</font>

210
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,480
about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices and by the way here</font>

211
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,390
are as sort of supplemental information

212
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:07,960
heroes what people actually run today in

213
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:09,850
their network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and another comment</font>

214
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,410
we got somebody pointed out the mailing

215
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,770
list that we were missing one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

216
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:17,560
options<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can actually ruse ospfv3 to</font>

217
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">route both v4 and v6 so that's now</font>

218
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:21,040
there's a table<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that section and that</font>

219
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,599
we now added that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually thought it</font>

220
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">was there and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just point out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

221
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,750
actually forgotten about next bgp

222
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:30,310
section not really very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> changes</font>

223
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,110
they are just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going through</font>

224
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,680
cleaning things up making little tweaks

225
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:40,720
here and there next address section so

226
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:42,219
this is the big change so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if those</font>

227
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who actually remember youth the</font>

228
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Oklahoma discussion for a year ago and</font>

229
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys are probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are forgotten</font>

230
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,400
about it this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what everybody</font>

231
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,940
complained about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this section and we got</font>

232
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:56,560
tell for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> section uh so we did a</font>

233
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:58,990
complete rewrite<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we removed all the</font>

234
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,560
ipv4 stuff from it it talks now only

235
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:05,140
about b6 it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically starts and start</font>

236
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:08,349
says if you look at a v6 interface it

237
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:12,819
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a link local address on it it</font>

238
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,800
may have one or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more other addresses</font>

239
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:18,040
which we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of generic cool off there</font>

240
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,979
and culture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> multihop addresses okay</font>

241
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,170
so what do you wish to go there are

242
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:26,230
three choices that you can or no three

243
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">type that you can choose from and where</font>

244
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,130
do you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them do you want to</font>

245
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,800
use them on your loop backs do you want

246
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:35,020
to use them on your links okay and by

247
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,819
the way you know it well but your choice

248
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,260
probably depends on how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run your</font>

249
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,870
network are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one of those classic</font>

250
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,360
ISPs that carry your internet traffic

251
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">hop by hop through</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> court or you'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

252
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
of more

253
00:14:44,209 --> 00:14:49,189
recent variety that carries everything

254
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:53,449
inside a layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3 VPN that will determine</font>

255
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:55,639
a little bit which way you go next<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

256
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:57,349
actually why don't we walk back for two

257
00:14:55,639 --> 00:14:58,550
seconds and just remind everybody go out

258
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:59,959
there with the school remind everybody

259
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:01,550
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just said it because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I went</font>

260
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:04,008
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really quickly and then I'll</font>

261
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:05,389
go that last slide so yeah we did ya

262
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:07,639
start right from there so we did

263
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:08,929
document scope that's what their next I

264
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:10,759
should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this slide in i did this</font>

265
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:13,639
very last there we did neutral tone

266
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:16,339
through well we did this change the<font color="#CCCCCC"> igp</font>

267
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,230
section de-emphasizing the survey and

268
00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,019
adding a whole bunch of basic facts

269
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:24,050
about it we<font color="#CCCCCC"> tweaked the bgp section and</font>

270
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:26,509
we completely rewrote the addressing

271
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:30,498
section because people really hated the

272
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:31,699
previous version<font color="#CCCCCC"> ah so and at this point</font>

273
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:34,149
I'm I should help<font color="#E5E5E5"> you turn</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

274
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:39,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">dress the the chairs this is our</font>

275
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:41,990
thoughts about how we should proceed we

276
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:45,740
think it is done we think it is ready to

277
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:48,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">go I it would be good to get some comets</font>

278
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,569
there was two reviewers who reviewed it

279
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,059
last time one of them was so kind to

280
00:15:50,569 --> 00:15:55,248
email me a second<font color="#CCCCCC"> review just a few</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok at at this point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

284
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:06,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">should shut up and take questions and</font>

285
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:08,899
then let you<font color="#E5E5E5"> ties talk mics are open</font>

286
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:11,110
people moving towards them remember to

287
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:13,910
speak say your name you'll remember that

288
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,240
Tim Chang so yeah sent some comments

289
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:18,618
that it's like I guess the couple of

290
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,779
very major ones one is you've still got

291
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:24,139
you said it's a known at in there but

292
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:29,079
you do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> NP tv6 mentioned in the</font>

293
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:29,079
document we say it's out of scope well I

294
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:35,029
I would rather see nothing in there or

295
00:16:33,019 --> 00:16:37,939
something preferably saying it's not

296
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:40,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommended but as it is it's just a</font>

297
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:42,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">little teaser you've left in it is</font>

298
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:45,619
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people do it should we</font>

299
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:49,100
just leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as out of scope</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok and the</font>

300
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:51,439
other one remember now<font color="#E5E5E5"> you say that p I</font>

301
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,259
is you suggest it's kind of hard to get

302
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:55,730
but I think it's become not trivial but

303
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:57,230
next to trivial to get sending the

304
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:58,130
European region uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tara well it's the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">same worldwide</font>

306
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:03,760
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier to get that I think than</font>

307
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:06,500
you suggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have to i</font>

308
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,810
haven't i've looked at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

309
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,940
haven't looked at the right docket that

310
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:15,560
policy manual recently there was that

311
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:17,089
was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> recent change well if you look at</font>

312
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">the policy on the right page if you</font>

313
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:21,800
click it it sort of been obsoleted about

314
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,630
six times in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years it has</font>

315
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:26,240
changed<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot the most recent one is</font>

316
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:28,220
certainly makes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> leach okay okay</font>

317
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,950
so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to add a little bit more</font>

318
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how you know how easy or not it is</font>

319
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VI space although</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately of</font>

320
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,949
course there's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem if everybody</font>

321
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:43,550
gets p I space than our writing tables

322
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:45,650
are going to explode hahaha Jordie

323
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:48,560
Bellaire just to confirm about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> p.i I</font>

324
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:51,200
work it on the p.i policy changes in the

325
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,780
five resistor<font color="#E5E5E5"> regions and and all of</font>

326
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,840
them is possible to get yay yes it's

327
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:58,970
possible and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively easy so the</font>

328
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:01,669
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is can mom and pop florist get</font>

329
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,320
P I space yes yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we are</font>

330
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:04,900
definitely going to blow a blower added

331
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,669
address tables out of the water<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

332
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:09,620
glad you guys as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I work for a vendor</font>

333
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:11,750
actually both the Victor and I now work

334
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,610
for vendors so all you operators we are

335
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,770
happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this be true because you</font>

336
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,860
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy simply buy lots for product</font>

337
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:20,330
from us we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very happy go ahead</font>

338
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:22,459
luckily i think the section on

339
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:24,050
addressing is almost perfect because in

340
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,750
the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentence says it doesn't talk</font>

341
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:27,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hosts and when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're when you're</font>

342
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,330
use it when you're talking about

343
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:31,340
addressing assigned to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reuters you can</font>

344
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,510
use<font color="#E5E5E5"> bogan space for like her and you can</font>

345
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">use whatever you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want you can use the</font>

346
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,510
root server IP addresses that's my

347
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:38,690
favorite that's my favorite is<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> signs</font>

348
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:42,110
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> being said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with it was um</font>

349
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:43,820
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> tim i don't like seeing NPT 66</font>

350
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,649
there it's not clear to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me why you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

351
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,790
use NPT 66 it's the only thing that

352
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,310
you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about numbering is your</font>

353
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:52,580
Reuters but you know so what I would

354
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:54,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest is that you would say ula is not</font>

355
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:56,990
covered day so NPT 66 is not covered

356
00:18:54,770 --> 00:19:00,530
here and the drawbacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you lay are as</font>

357
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:03,490
follows and because we're only talking

358
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:06,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about Reuters here it doesn't matter</font>

359
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:07,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">tonight so like I said you can use my</font>

360
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:09,530
favorite<font color="#CCCCCC"> my favorite restaurant for the</font>

361
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,660
Reuters is the global root server IP

362
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,050
addresses if you want to use ula you can

363
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,490
use that

364
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,040
if you want to use my IP address you can

365
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:18,080
use that that's assuming you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

366
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:20,389
actually doing carrying<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet traffic</font>

369
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,630
respect bc p38 one assumes so you know

370
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,130
intense yeah although what but anyway

371
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:29,870
you'll have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerful job here you know</font>

372
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:31,280
the whole drop my addressing<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean if</font>

373
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:33,919
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> toy if you actually want to respond</font>

to pings and ICMP trace route and all

375
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,040
that so if you were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

376
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:42,050
hosts then you were not right yeah but

377
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,360
then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should absolutely that the p.i</font>

381
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:55,580
shameless plug and say yeah we have a

382
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:56,870
draft which is jayden cole and have a

383
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:59,030
draft which is actually talking about

384
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">how we potentially can solve a problem</font>

385
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:04,190
of fusion provider aggregate about

386
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,220
global address space for multi home and

387
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:09,170
connector prizes yeah so I I don't know

388
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:11,060
you probably might want to add a

389
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:14,180
reference in the section when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> send</font>

390
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> day address space as a disadvantage</font>

391
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,930
in multi home environment yes there i

392
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,370
mean there's a lots of stuff there we

393
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,200
didn't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go into it but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm happy</font>

394
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:26,360
to add references there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

395
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:28,430
references in this document wow I'm not

396
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,560
seeing more people jumping up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

397
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,860
microphones so but I've heard fairly

398
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,919
common minor<font color="#CCCCCC"> so it's fairly minor</font>

399
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:39,050
comments can I ask how many people have

400
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:42,920
wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay Victor's get one more this is</font>

401
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:44,870
my co-author by the way so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

402
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,510
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a personal his name is a picture</font>

403
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,929
oh sorry Victor person there you go she

404

does the name the on the pipe thing you

405
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,760
know I mean this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my personal opinion</font>

406
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:58,220
here is I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the draft we should</font>

407
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,440
still note that it's not trivial there's

408
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,870
a you know if we suddenly in the v4

409
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,480
world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what a lot of people had</font>

410
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:08,060
before they<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a v6 you could you know</font>

411
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,860
you just just saying I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get P</font>

412
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:11,990
I space there's things that operator has

413
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:14,360
to do if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have an ESN now you</font>

414
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,220
need to go get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have to start</font>

415
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:19,159
to do routing that you may not have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font>

416
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">before so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think glossing it over and</font>

417
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:25,520
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggesting that PAP I is all going</font>

418
00:21:21,410 --> 00:21:27,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be even is not a realistic I set</font>

419
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,510
you know that setting expectations not

420
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,250
realistic I would say with my back to my

421
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:34,730
previous operator had on it there's more

422
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:36,230
to do and we talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah yeah but</font>

423
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,700
yeah but we're saying is an operator and

424
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,680
I happen to agree with that if you you

425
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:42,170
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not you you have to have a</font>

426
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,780
relationship with whoever you're our IR

427
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:46,100
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and you have to go off and pay a</font>

428
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,800
yearly fee and all those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's</font>

429
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">not zero okay it's you know mom</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and pop</font>

Flores will find that owners Tim transit

433
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:58,939
about and we numbering when you change

434
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,660
provider there's perhaps different

435
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:04,040
trade-offs issue yes so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think just to</font>

436
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,150
have someone go for P I just a

437
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,710
multi-homed it's not something they

438
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:10,100
necessarily need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> given what Jen's</font>

439
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,960
say it yeah I mean just a comment<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

440
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:14,449
that a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit from my own vantage</font>

441
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:20,150
point Julie<font color="#CCCCCC"> egli area director um</font>

442
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:23,300
there's 55,000 entities in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world let</font>

445
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,300
United States than that so like I'm by

446
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:34,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">and large people already make this</font>

447
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,050
choice and they make it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular</font>

448
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,300
way that says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they'd actually don't</font>

449
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:40,639
value having that relationship most of

450
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,620
the time now whether or not we're

451
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,660
providing guidance to those people or

452
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,600
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> people who are a little bit higher</font>

up in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> food chain um who might be</font>

454
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,419
participants in the global routing

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,890

456
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,470
providing<font color="#CCCCCC"> guidance to people who are</font>

457
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,990
capable of making that decision or not

458
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">as opposed to the vast bulk of the</font>

459
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:07,550
population<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has no interest in</font>

460
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:10,159
making that decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to</font>

461
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggest well I'm gonna suggest first of</font>

462
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,880
all that sounds like we have one or two

463
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">sentences that we're discussing right</font>

464
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,080
now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if the four or five people</font>

465
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:20,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">who have comments on those one or two</font>

466
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,340
sentences would send suggested sentences

467
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,080
to the list we could probably move

468
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:25,220
through that fairly quickly and agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

469
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,689
and do the word smithing on the mailing

470
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:28,730
list which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a great place to do it</font>

471
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:32,180
because everybody can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the words</font>

472
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:34,520
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about okay good can I ask</font>

473
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:36,020
before we get on to path forward and the

474
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,170
mic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still open we've got plenty of</font>

475
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,870
time can I ask how many people have read

476
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,900
the 10 11 or 12 version of this

477
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:46,459
documents raise your hand please<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

478
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so that's that's a pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

479
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,230
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm here and actually</font>

480
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than half of those who've actually</font>

481
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:56,240
commented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Michael on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> document</font>

482
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:59,300
said it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> close so my suggestion</font>

483
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:02,720
will be that we have those couple of

484
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:06,860
minor tweak conversations on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list if</font>

485
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you guys can can can watch those you</font>

486
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:10,040
know figure out the consensus looks like

487
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,750
and spin another version in a couple of

488
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:14,210
weeks where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font>

489
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">44</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group last call</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> unless</font>

490
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,960
somebody disagrees that approach I'm

491
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:21,949
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to swing the gavel and say that's</font>

492
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:38,210
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do excellent i love it</font>

493
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:40,850
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we move forward the next item on</font>

494
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:47,180
our agenda was a unique ipv6 prefix /

520
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:50,719
out the main reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> we basically and the</font>

521
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,090
chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> for updates here is we start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

522
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,710
roll this out a comcast we're about

523
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:57,409
sixty-five percent of our Wi-Fi

524
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:59,780
footprint Wi-Fi footprint has this

525
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:01,370
rolled out the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> half we think we</font>

526
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:03,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">yesterday will be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out by say later this</font>

527
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:06,020
year or first part of you know first

528
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:07,160
quarter 2017 so we're well on our way we

529
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:09,650
had a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things that we had to</font>

530
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,150
kind of work through now nothing tragic

531
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:13,070
as relates to what we've written in the

532
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,870
document more kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of vendor bugs that</font>

533
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,300
sort of stuff there are some things that

534
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:19,550
were typically typically fall outside

535
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,600
the realm of ITF things that we had to

536
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,610
deal with from an internal systems

537
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:25,790
perspective things like being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

538
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:28,219
respond to you know law enforcement

539
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:29,870
agencies that sort of stuff but other

540
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,250
than that the only other<font color="#CCCCCC"> comment I think</font>

541
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,989
we you know that we'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make is</font>

542
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:37,550
we're seeing a lower than normal

543
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:38,900
expected you option or usage of<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 we</font>

544
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:40,190
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some some</font>

545
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,200
investigation we have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and do</font>

546
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:44,390
there it does not mirror what we're

547
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,680
seeing on the broadband side but it's

548
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:52,490
not affecting our rollout to stage of

549
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:53,900
the game so unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> we really don't need</font>

550
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,160
two slides because that's basically what

551
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:57,920
it all says<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll take a few questions</font>

552
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,540
from you guys see if hears anything that

553
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,860
you're curious about and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the only</font>

554
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">other piece to this for those who've</font>

555
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,820
read the draft is there's two parts to

556
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:07,970
this work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing in and</font>

557
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,470
Comcast one of them is your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ue your user</font>

558
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,430
equipment and its connectivity which is

559
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:12,020
basically everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've talked</font>

560
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,370
to you about here and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

561
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,050
part of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you'll see that's also</font>

562
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,820
documented in the giraffe is the

563
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,379
underlay technology right so so the

564
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,120
former we're going to call overlay the

565
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:21,680
underlay you know in this case for us we

566
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:25,909
use ya jari and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're starting</font>

567
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at l2tp right that's going to be</font>

568
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,270
part<font color="#CCCCCC"> two of this project where we</font>

569
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,860
convert the underlay be v6 only as well

570
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think that's less interesting to this</font>

571
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,159
crowd for the most part but it's still

572
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,600
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is germane to be</font>

573
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,400
six apps and and the work<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

574
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,040
generally talk about here so with that

575
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,600
I'll pause for any<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions comments</font>

576
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:45,800
curiosities I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we the only other</font>

577
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,959
thing that we're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at doing is if</font>

578
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,040
we can get this draft submitted most of

579
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,800
the feedback<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've gotten so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> far it</font>

580
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:53,149
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty editorial nature will pitch</font>

581
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,560
it to you and the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the working</font>

582
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:57,050
group to feel any additional questions

583
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:59,120
and then ultimately ask for some next

584
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:02,780
steps perhaps in the form of working

585
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:04,370
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wes call learn is clearly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple</font>

586
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,440
of comments you mentioned it less v6

587
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,768
traffic than expected I wonder if them

588
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:13,429
if using l equals 0<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some some</font>

589
00:28:09,769 --> 00:28:15,440
version of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple it was reported that</font>

590
00:28:13,429 --> 00:28:17,029
they don't do they don't reply to

591
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,450
neighbor solicitation sent from a global

592
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:21,620
address if l equals 0 and so you might

593
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">be seeing their happy eyeballs</font>

594
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,479
algorithms to be four instead you could

595
00:28:24,409 --> 00:28:27,799
switch to using the link local address

596
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,750
to do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> neighbors field station then</font>

597
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:31,250
that might work better<font color="#CCCCCC"> I that's just an</font>

598
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,870
idea can't say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not doing that</font>

599
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:35,029
though<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

600
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:36,018
will look at is we haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't we</font>

601
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:38,179
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about this at lunch we have</font>

602
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:39,860
to dive in and take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at blogs and</font>

603
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:42,320
that's where thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't we don't</font>

604
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,600
think it's insurmountable it just

605
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,519
requires some time to dig in other than

606
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,379
that I'm sure you're aware of it but you

607
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:50,539
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe for others to there's a draft</font>

608
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:52,459
in going forward in six men or going to

609
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:55,700
be discussed in<font color="#CCCCCC"> six-man tomorrow's it</font>

610
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,289
tomorrow yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> about because you provide</font>

611
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">any unique prefix for host just adding a</font>

612
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:00,830
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the to the proof</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the RA that</font>

613
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:02,929
says this prefix is dedicated to you

614
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,189
because it's already dedicated and then

615
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:06,440
the host can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lots of</font>

616
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:07,909
optimizations and so if anyone's

617
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,580
interested in that you know come<font color="#CCCCCC"> to six</font>

618
00:29:07,909 --> 00:29:12,950
men read the draft so one comment on

619
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:15,259
that one part of the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why we even</font>

620
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:16,460
wrote this to be shared here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in v6</font>

621
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">offices because we've got some feedback</font>

622
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,190
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> other part other people the</font>

623
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:21,200
community say hey you know this looks

624
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,610
like it's interesting and useful since

625
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,049
then we've also started looking at it

626
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,580
using another contact to be on Wi-Fi

627
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,320
right so Colleen or<font color="#CCCCCC"> collie and I do</font>

628
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:29,360
together is really kind of me and Wi-Fi

629
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,590
related but we're looking at it in many

630
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,699
other contacts you know the day<font color="#E5E5E5"> Center</font>

631
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">would have you I know there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

632
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook folks here that I've had the</font>

633
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:38,509
conversations with or at least kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">is going as well thanks David not butter</font>

640
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,019
just as feedback I do have a heck of

641
00:29:55,309 --> 00:29:58,820
implementation of this and I'm hoping to

642
00:29:57,019 --> 00:30:03,740
deploy it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> another conference at the</font>

643
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:05,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">end of this year so that's great all</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">agree with what you described it sounds</font>

646
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:11,240
like it's it's pretty mature and we'll

647
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:13,039
give it a little you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a little</font>

648
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer or a feedback and then do a</font>

649
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,090
working group last call unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

650
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,259
further has comments on that because

651
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,090
this is also<font color="#CCCCCC"> has seemed like its head</font>

652
00:30:18,259 --> 00:30:27,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">fairly strong consensus over</font>

653
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:29,899
it's its life<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay excellent our next</font>

multihoming<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did not get your slides</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">becoming too effective that's possible</font>

658
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:48,070
it's not the junk folder

659
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:37,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so it's actually hopefully we'll</font>

participants to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see you when</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made on a TFR 96 so the problem</font>

671
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,140
statement we'd like to solve problem

672
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,550
which has already<font color="#E5E5E5"> been mentioned today</font>

673
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:29,560
about how can we do multihoming an

674
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:31,870
enterprise network using provider

675
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:35,230
address space yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was out to get in</font>

676
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,479
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> address space or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> runyon bgp</font>

677
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:40,960
who's your isp because in many cases had

678
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,420
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the good choice and there are</font>

679
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,060
two part of the problem first how can

680
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:49,600
you send precarious particular source

681
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:52,570
address to the right is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p and this is</font>

682
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,669
routing part of the draft which talks

683
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:58,450
about source address dependent routing

684
00:33:54,670 --> 00:34:00,010
and then how can you make host to choose

685
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:03,220
the right address<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever right means</font>

686
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:05,650
in particular case so this packet could

687
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,290
be delivered and yeah yeah we as humans

688
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:11,168
there are providers out there who do

689
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:13,418
implement bcp search it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed we do</font>

690
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:16,388
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk about not</font>

691
00:34:13,418 --> 00:34:17,828
oh and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> apparently there is no proper</font>

692
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,819
where you couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it currently</font>

693
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:24,250
without where else nice dear hugs so and

694
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:26,589
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there actually</font>

695
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:28,690
already started doing some not pity and

696
00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:30,460
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> on because there is no as a proper</font>

697
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:33,339
solution for this problem so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

698
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:36,369
link<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the right place slides from the</font>

699
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:38,739
last idea where some nice pictures

700
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:42,159
illustrating what I'm talking about so

701
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:44,020
if you do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to read the draft you</font>

702
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,129
can just look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the slides and next</font>

703
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:52,629
slide please so not many changes I

704
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:54,339
didn't dance or clarified some sections

705
00:34:52,629 --> 00:34:58,240
about default address selection because

706
00:34:54,339 --> 00:35:01,779
basically the whole a trick we are

707
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,529
proposing is relying on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Muslim 055 for</font>

708
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:09,099
default address selection algorithm and

709
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,290
then are aware that a section to discuss

710
00:35:09,099 --> 00:35:14,260
a problem of selecting dinners because

711
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:16,869
selecting the right address it's just a

712
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,940
part of the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do some</font>

713
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:22,150
interesting things using default text

714
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:24,970
selection and slug as described in the

715
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:27,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">draft but apparently host also might</font>

716
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,890
need to properly select other

717
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:33,910
configuration parameters like<font color="#CCCCCC"> dienes and</font>

718
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:35,680
search list and it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually maybe</font>

719
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:38,618
even more interesting than<font color="#CCCCCC"> selection</font>

720
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,069
source address and i will talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

721
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:46,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">a second</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and janna some references have</font>

722
00:35:42,069 --> 00:35:49,569
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> added to the document so next slide</font>

723
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,430
please yeah and I think Lawrence I

724
00:35:49,569 --> 00:35:54,069
suggested last<font color="#CCCCCC"> time that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

725
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:57,540
because the current<font color="#E5E5E5"> version of the draft</font>

726
00:35:54,069 --> 00:36:00,609
relies on the rule 5 5 which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font>

727
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:06,308
supported<font color="#CCCCCC"> by all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your ranking systems</font>

728
00:36:00,609 --> 00:36:09,220
out there so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and we tried in the</font>

729
00:36:06,309 --> 00:36:13,150
draft to cover as many possible use

730
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:16,000
cases not just to ice<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece when you can</font>

731
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:19,089
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> either</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both of them one of them as a</font>

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,450
primary and secondary backup but also

733
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:25,299
various<font color="#E5E5E5"> three key use cases when there</font>

00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:28,040
my

736
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:31,580
provide some special services and soul

737
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:34,070
however it looks like one of the few

738
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:36,650
most common use cases could be easily

739
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,050
addressed without even relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> all 55</font>

740
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:43,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it could be done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even today</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

741
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:46,190
help from router vendors so I'm still

742
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,380
going definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next ATF to fork</font>

743
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:50,780
a separate draft from this one to cover

744
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:53,180
most common use cases not solving cold

745
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:56,950
problem it's not a silver bullet but

746
00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:03,649
just they describe a most useful

747
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:06,799
scenario and uh next slide<font color="#CCCCCC"> please yeah</font>

748
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:09,170
so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to describe what's going on so</font>

749
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,600
this draft actually has two big section

750
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,840
a section<font color="#CCCCCC"> Swan is mostly talking about</font>

751
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:17,660
routing<font color="#CCCCCC"> quad about creative about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Eugene</font>

752
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:20,390
source address dependent routing so how

753
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:22,640
routers are going to forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> packets I</font>

754
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:24,830
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source address I'm I</font>

755
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,980
created scoped forwarding tables and

756
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:31,369
second<font color="#CCCCCC"> a section for Chile I was a draft</font>

757
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:34,730
is mostly talking about a source address

758
00:37:31,369 --> 00:37:37,010
selection on a host and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost could</font>

759
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:39,080
interact with the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> opera or thurs</font>

760
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:42,109
the first hop routers could influence

761
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:44,029
source address selection on a host based

762
00:37:42,109 --> 00:37:46,910
on the current routing state of the

763
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,560
network so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually thinking about</font>

764
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:51,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">calling for adoption for the current</font>

765
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,400
graft and routed working group and

766
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,260
indeed we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a feedback from v6 ops on</font>

767
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,180
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the section 4 of the draft</font>

768
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the second draft which I'm going to</font>

769
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:06,440
fork from it i will i will present at 36

770
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:09,200
jobs because it does that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going</font>

771
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> routing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rosen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> palette will</font>

772
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,660
mostly host default address selection

773
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:18,440
and interaction is first hop router so

774
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:23,000
stay tuned for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next ATF and our next</font>

775
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide please actually next slide so the</font>

776
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,340
tricky part so obviously if you have

777
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:31,220
more than one<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-speed quite possible</font>

778
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:35,150
unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> i spin lazy and just sent you</font>

779
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:38,569
google dns dennis error I hosp might

780
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:43,700
provide its own set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> I dns</font>

781
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:47,510
our servers IP and even search list just

782
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,640
uh just sending that information to host

783
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:51,350
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> relatively easy right because the</font>

784
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,850
whole draft is basically talking about

785
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:59,089
how can we lock to configure host and

786
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:03,259
influence address selection of a cost so

787
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:06,160
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use our DNS s to do this and it's</font>

788
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:09,230
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to also duplicate the</font>

789
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:12,140
info<font color="#CCCCCC"> dinners information from one of the</font>

790
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:15,230
ISP if connectivity to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> PSP is lost</font>

791
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:18,589
so further scenario is a reasonably

792
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:21,470
straightforward next slide how yeah

793
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:24,020
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this so as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I discussed in</font>

794
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:27,799
the draft if scoped forwarding table for

795
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,120
one all right I spirit<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cobra DSP a dozen</font>

796
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,300
her finger out we don't have

797
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:35,779
connectivity to zach is<font color="#CCCCCC"> fee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we not</font>

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">just duplicated addresses from is PB</font>

799
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">block</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will sit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and duplicate dns</font>

800
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,950
information provided but that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> p if</font>

801
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:45,170
needed our next slide please however<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

802
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:50,379
see at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least two problematic scenarios</font>

803
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:54,260
so if host has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to set of dns servers it</font>

804
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,540
will probably pick up just one of those

805
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:58,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">dns servers and random and there is no</font>

806
00:39:56,540 --> 00:40:02,330
way you can currently influence the

807
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,540
source selection for dns server so it's

808
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:07,460
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible that packet to read isp</font>

809
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:11,330
dns will be sent from blue address space

810
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:14,690
and next slide please yeah and it could

811
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:16,850
go through blue eyes they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are playing to</font>

812
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:19,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mike might even</font>

813
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:21,529
actually reach the daily server but we

814
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,090
do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if the if the host will get</font>

815
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,920
required<font color="#CCCCCC"> cancer because the dinner</font>

816
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,740
server might be not reachable or might

817
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,680
not answer on my<font color="#CCCCCC"> gif different answer</font>

818
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,140
depending on the source address so

819
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:36,290
basically did a split horizon so it's

820
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:39,770
basically not desirable<font color="#CCCCCC"> desire scenario</font>

821
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:41,779
and next slide please and another

822
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,490
problematic scenarios again if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

823
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:47,330
some local namespaces and you basically

824
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:52,080
could not resolve some namespaces if you

825
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:54,000
ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dinner set of one isp</font>

826
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,100
particular namespace which only could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

827
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">resolved through second tiles and the</font>

828
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,650
indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> host will just get an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> X domain</font>

829
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:03,779
from name server it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even try</font>

830
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:06,420
to ask the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one looks like please</font>

831
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,450
yeah basically samsonite also hostess

832
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,900
pick him up the first dinner server and

833
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:16,770
the least ask dinner server for some

834
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:18,990
special a name from is<font color="#CCCCCC"> pp namespace get</font>

835
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:21,950
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> X domain and it will be resulted</font>

836
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:25,680
communication failure next slide please

837
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:28,770
so ideally<font color="#E5E5E5"> an ideal world it would be</font>

838
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,080
nice if host could somehow knows widget

839
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:33,800
in a server to ask for which lane but I

840
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:37,650
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually possible now I</font>

841
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,620
in genetics scenario so what I'm

842
00:41:37,650 --> 00:41:42,420
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is probably we just need</font>

843
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:45,390
to kind of say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we could not solve</font>

844
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:47,610
all possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> insane solaris you might</font>

845
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:50,339
see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real life so probably a</font>

846
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,500
recommendation should be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do have</font>

847
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:55,590
such complex scenario in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your network it</font>

848
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:57,540
probably makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

849
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,950
server within the network and let<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

850
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:01,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">inner server to solve all those problems</font>

851
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:04,169
and just provide a local dns server

852
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:07,080
which is located within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

853
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:08,850
hosts and do not try to make host to

854
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:11,250
make all those complex decisions I

855
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:14,910
probably update the text of the draft

856
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:17,040
that will<font color="#CCCCCC"> bend the version 02 and the</font>

857
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:21,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">next slide is actually questions</font>

858
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:24,720
comments suggestions so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philip Matthews</font>

859
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:29,819
nokia<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm wondering what about the case</font>

860
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,549
where the ISPs that you know the two dns

861
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,730
service in the ice piece will answer

862
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:37,650
differently to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same query um you</font>

863
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:40,560
know there's a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cases there and</font>

864
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:42,870
so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you get if you ask one</font>

865
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,900
and you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> an answer you have to send a</font>

866
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:47,490
packet that way to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and if you</font>

867
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,020
get if you actually ask the other one

868
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:53,040
you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> send the packet that way</font>

869
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:55,560
instead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure even running a</font>

870
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,200
recursive name server inside is going to

871
00:42:55,560 --> 00:43:00,390
solve that problem you talking about

872
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,970
like cages like cadenas<font color="#CCCCCC"> base geolocation</font>

873
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:05,328
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I might be rejected two different</font>

user might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be directed to different</font>

875
00:43:05,329 --> 00:43:11,450
like Sudan for examples yeah oh that one

876
00:43:08,539 --> 00:43:13,369
possibility i was also thinking you know

877
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:14,749
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the days like you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rap</font>

878
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:17,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">people get to the point but they</font>

879
00:43:14,749 --> 00:43:20,180
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> start ready nat64 for example</font>

880
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:22,609
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS 64 then you can you get a whole</font>

881
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,200
bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can see</font>

882
00:43:22,609 --> 00:43:26,299
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> keys getting to there at some point</font>

883
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,259
it is funny I actually think you will

884
00:43:26,299 --> 00:43:32,660
have the same problem in before right

885
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:36,019
you potentially can if even if you use

886
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:38,089
not right you ascend the packet to DNS

887
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:40,399
or blue genus<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me use my</font>

888
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:42,828
terminology<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ison</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like it to blue dns get</font>

889
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,130
an answer but actual data packet to a

890
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:48,440
server going to read<font color="#CCCCCC"> is P because they</font>

891
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:52,099
either the company's doing load

892
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,079
balancing or it's just our<font color="#CCCCCC"> out in policy</font>

893
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:56,959
yeah so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think this problem could</font>

894
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:00,469
be completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> solved Oh at least I have</font>

895
00:43:56,959 --> 00:44:04,009
no ideas how to prevent all possible

896
00:44:00,469 --> 00:44:06,140
like all this corner cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes</font>

897
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:08,299
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> put I think you know a little bit</font>

898
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:12,170
of data as college into their nafs to

899
00:44:08,299 --> 00:44:14,180
make some of this stuff work oh so you

900
00:44:12,170 --> 00:44:15,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">know or are you there so I'm just</font>

901
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:22,299
mentioning I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a case which</font>

902
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,299
may be yeah yeah yeah yeahs appreciated

903
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:28,910
rentokil<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad so I think we know the myth</font>

904
00:44:27,499 --> 00:44:32,689
working group discusses problem at

905
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:34,879
length when it was forming and a long

906
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:36,890
time ago I think even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> RC</font>

907
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,569
the myth architecture RC we wrote down

908
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:40,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the only way to solve these</font>

909
00:44:38,569 --> 00:44:42,650
problems is to have each bit of

910
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:44,089
configuration information the one that's

911
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:48,140
communicated to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> host have an ID on</font>

912
00:44:44,089 --> 00:44:50,029
it and that would so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> both of</font>

913
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,680
problems one and two because it ties the

914
00:44:50,029 --> 00:44:55,190
deep because you problem one is tying

915
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:56,690
the source address to thee to the forget

916
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:58,729
but I think they're risking well this

917
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:01,839
was this one is solved by basically

918
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:08,269
saying yes if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if you put the DNS a</font>

919
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:10,069
into PVD one and then ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> then then you</font>

920
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:12,828
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use the sorceress from PVD</font>

921
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:15,890
one and as long as the network knows how

922
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:17,839
to route based on PV DS which you can do

923
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:18,440
usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> by our source test most of the</font>

924
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:20,630
time

925
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,339
then it works and the other suit and the

926
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:24,650
other is I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it would solve both the</font>

927
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:26,720
problems and I think somebody's<font color="#CCCCCC"> writing</font>

928
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:29,720
a draft somewhere in six men may be to

929
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,180
actually provide ways of doing this we

930
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:34,220
the myth working group was shut down but

931
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:35,690
there's no they're still interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

932
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:37,779
doing this work and I think we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

933
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,890
expect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this eventually will become</font>

934
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,569
part of operating systems right because

935
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:44,150
because operating systems already have

936
00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:45,800
they already have to do this on a per

937
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:48,470
network basis right that was sold years

938
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,930
ago and so it's a matter of

939
00:45:48,470 --> 00:45:58,399
communicating the bits of information

940
00:45:49,930 --> 00:46:02,089
correctly dead<font color="#E5E5E5"> lampeter so two separate</font>

941
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,589
comments for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns i think actually what</font>

942
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:07,040
this is coming down to is that it's it's

943
00:46:03,589 --> 00:46:09,078
ultimately a policy decision and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

944
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,940
easy way out that I see here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to just</font>

945
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">say well you should really really be</font>

946
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:14,060
running a recursive resolver and

947
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:17,270
actually put your policy on that

948
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,099
recursive resolver because if you really

949
00:46:17,270 --> 00:46:21,560
get different replies for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same name</font>

950
00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:22,880
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your eyes peas and you want to</font>

951
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:24,799
decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> for your entire network and</font>

952
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,980
manage that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's gonna be on that</font>

953
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">recursive resolver so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not even</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

954
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:32,450
I would discuss other options because I

955
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:34,609
agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of very complicated</font>

956
00:46:32,450 --> 00:46:35,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">and complex and maybe even unsolvable so</font>

957
00:46:34,609 --> 00:46:38,750
I would just stick with that

958
00:46:35,810 --> 00:46:44,328
recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be done with it and</font>

959
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:46,460
no um what we're trying to do because I

960
00:46:44,329 --> 00:46:48,710
personally feel scenarios when you have

961
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:49,760
a small<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network it's part of enterprise</font>

962
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,589
network but it's small vacation

963
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:55,010
somewhere and I have 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> people seated</font>

964
00:46:51,589 --> 00:46:57,710
right and yeah and I tended resolver

965
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:59,810
right there it's not always a good

966
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:01,640
option but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again I think it depends on</font>

967
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">the scenario if you just chew eyes feast</font>

968
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,450
for just for internet access we don't

969
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,270
need to dissolve it we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> used our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

970
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,578
s and everything works if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

971
00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:12,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something more complex than</font>

972
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:14,210
most likely yeah it's what I will go

973
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:16,010
into putting the draft yeah if it's

974
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:18,589
something more complex and just to

975
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,190
internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> applix resolver will be best</font>

976
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:23,990
option currently until our bright future

977
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:27,829
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> hasn't been evenly distributed</font>

978
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:30,290
here finally comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so it's</font>

979
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:31,970
basically it can be made to<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

980
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,680
this for easy cases but not really

981
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:35,509
for complicated ones i have a different

982
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,348
<font color="#E5E5E5">question can you go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the slide</font>

983
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:43,400
with the draft split up beginning way

984
00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:45,530
way earlier that<font color="#CCCCCC"> beckley at this one I</font>

985
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,480
don't understand why the split is where

986
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,640
it is to be honest why is the source

987
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,770
address stuff split apart in the middle

988
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,810
and we have to select<font color="#E5E5E5"> source address</font>

989
00:47:51,770 --> 00:47:55,970
selection in the routing area draft

990
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:57,920
amateur the current draft is kind of

991
00:47:55,970 --> 00:48:00,230
genetic right we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not trying to solve</font>

992
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:03,650
just a problem of who to<font color="#CCCCCC"> are pleased you</font>

993
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:07,130
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about various titles like</font>

995
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:12,500
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a easy way to</font>

996
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:16,040
solve that problem without relying on

997
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,880
the rule 55 and all those things related

998
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,490
to do that and but we probably still

999
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,520
would like to have some discussion on

1000
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:29,629
this topic and have some solution are

1001
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,119
providing you can use your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 55 so</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the current draft right hmm and</font>

1003

covered in one particular but most

1008
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,369
common use case has nothing to do with

1009
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:52,790
routing so it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to v6 ops yeah</font>

1043
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,400
the slides but now that I've just messed

1044
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:19,610
with Jen's slides there I'm in the wrong

1045
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,610
folder

1046
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:54,990

1050
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:06,029
must have been some sort of scheduling

1051
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:07,860
error because from my calculations I

1052
00:52:06,030 --> 00:52:12,540
think I over an hour to talk about the

1053
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:13,800
prefix and I think yeah I'll be you'll

1054
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:17,279
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to hear that you'll get an</font>

1055
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:19,560
early coffee break because I only have

1056
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,490
two slides so you can just move on to

1057
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:26,340
the first one of those which is

1058
00:52:23,490 --> 00:52:30,620
basically an update or not I did since

1059
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:33,990
the last ITF meeting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> controversy</font>

1060
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:38,490
during the last meeting<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the prefix</font>

1061
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:42,870
itself / 16 that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was just too large</font>

1062
00:52:38,490 --> 00:52:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I think we agree that it got reduced</font>

1063
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:51,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> our / 48 which has the added side</font>

1064
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:55,320
benefit that it does not encompassed the

1065
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:57,089
prefix from RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60-52 which kind of</font>

1066
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,920
makes things so much easier since now

1067
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:02,520
this is completely distinct and does not

1068
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:06,480
really relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the 60-52 prefix arrow</font>

1069
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:08,880
and well there was some further

1070
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:13,110
discussion on the list about the prefix

1071
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,270
whether it should be a / 32 or if it

1072
00:53:13,110 --> 00:53:18,570
should be somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the address</font>

1073
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:22,460
space I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I got at least I got</font>

1074
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:27,590
the feeling from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 64 ff9</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1075
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">148 this is okay and that's basically</font>

1076
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,670
what I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to aim for I don't think</font>

1077
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:36,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we should make more adjustments</font>

1078
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:40,080
there um other than that other the

1079
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:41,210
section of about checksum neutrality per

1080
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,319
request

1081
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:46,500
fixed up the eye on a consideration

1082
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:49,650
section so that that has the proper

1083
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:52,770
format other than that I got some

1084
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,960
various feedback on how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mete out the</font>

1085
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:59,009
text there add some references some

1086
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:01,980
editorial stuff I was intending to

1087
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:04,109
update the draft that day you have got

1088
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:08,220
in the vase I didn't make the submission

1089
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:14,009
deadline so but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a matter of</font>

1090
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:15,509
getting that though last slide please so

1091
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:19,200
basically at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this point I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

1092
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:22,349
draft is Adam as far as what the draft

1093
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:26,310
really does to reserve the prefix it is

1094
00:54:22,349 --> 00:54:27,930
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> done I mean we can polish it</font>

1095
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:32,790
there and there add some references

1096
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:35,368
probably fix up some<font color="#E5E5E5"> text but I think at</font>

1097
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:36,839
this point it's we really need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide</font>

1098
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:42,900
if this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that we should do</font>

1099
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:44,490
or not and if if we should go proceed

1100
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:49,410
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I think it should be a</font>

1101
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:51,930
rather quick journey through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the through</font>

1102
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:56,450
the working group and last<font color="#E5E5E5"> call and so</font>

1103
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:59,569
on because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean if we agree that</font>

1104
00:54:56,450 --> 00:55:02,310
reserving<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pre</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a flash 48 prefix for</font>

1105
00:54:59,569 --> 00:55:04,259
translation is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay them that's</font>

1106
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:07,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically everything this draft us it</font>

1107
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:12,030
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be should be a non-controversial</font>

1108
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:15,030
the rest is just polish or if not then

1109
00:55:12,030 --> 00:55:18,510
of course then I'll just stop using my

1110
00:55:15,030 --> 00:55:21,750
time on it so so that's it that's my

1111
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:24,180
presentation and now you can go have

1112
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:27,060
coffee or ask your questions for<font color="#E5E5E5"> over an</font>

1113
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,250
hour that was less than<font color="#CCCCCC"> an hour that was</font>

1114
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:30,660
impressive so we had a lot of

1115
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:32,670
conversation at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last meeting about</font>

1116
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:35,490
this document and it was it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1117
00:55:32,670 --> 00:55:37,920
clear to me then whether we should

1118
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:40,259
allocate a prefix or if the conversation

1119
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:42,690
lead more against what size prefix so

1120
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:45,150
that has so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions has</font>

1121
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:48,089
been we has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect aureus</font>

1122
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:49,770
responded to it I'm we need to know is

1123
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:54,599
this something that we think ought<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

1124
00:55:49,770 --> 00:55:57,930
and are we there Rancic really I am

1125
00:55:54,599 --> 00:56:00,839
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not opposed to either way</font>

1126
00:55:57,930 --> 00:56:04,529
but i think if we if we do if we do say

1127
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:06,749
if we reserve a 48 for<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSPS we should</font>

1128
00:56:04,529 --> 00:56:08,430
provide some guidance as to when you

1129
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:11,939
would use your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own address space and</font>

1130
00:56:08,430 --> 00:56:14,999
when you would use a cig for<font color="#E5E5E5"> ff9 be</font>

1131
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,489
something right because previously you

1132
00:56:14,999 --> 00:56:21,479
could use<font color="#CCCCCC"> NSPS right you just allocate</font>

1133
00:56:17,489 --> 00:56:22,769
them and so I think maybe maybe it

1134
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:24,269
wasn't a previous version of rough i

1135
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,160
just did skimmed it again and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i didn't</font>

1136
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:28,078
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but we should provide guidance as</font>

1137
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,210
to when do you use this and when do you

1138
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:32,009
not because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people might assume that</font>

1139
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:35,819
that's what you have to do but it's it

1140
00:56:32,009 --> 00:56:37,829
does you know it's not necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1141
00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:40,890
best option and the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that you</font>

1142
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:42,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">say in your draft is implementations</font>

1143
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,190
must not assume anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> about these</font>

1144
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:47,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">addresses well we know how that's not</font>

1145
00:56:44,190 --> 00:56:49,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so we we we should think about</font>

1146
00:56:47,819 --> 00:56:51,450
what guidance we want to give at least a

1147
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:54,720
point though into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right direction</font>

1148
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:57,499
and then you know that's what we can do

1149
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:03,269
right but we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about that</font>

1150
00:56:57,499 --> 00:57:05,249
yeah so and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not sure if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually</font>

1151
00:57:03,269 --> 00:57:08,249
put that into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the draft in very clear</font>

1152
00:57:05,249 --> 00:57:10,828
terms but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea is that you to have a</font>

1153
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:14,209
prefix that's very distinct from<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

1154
00:57:10,829 --> 00:57:18,150
own address space so that it does not

1155
00:57:14,210 --> 00:57:19,859
you know share the properties of your

1156
00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:22,680
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> other space with regards to you know</font>

1157
00:57:19,859 --> 00:57:24,690
having full access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mail servers</font>

1158
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:27,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">free laying or your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers for</font>

1159
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:29,249
resolving and so on so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

1160
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:32,579
addresses that basically represent the

1161
00:57:29,249 --> 00:57:35,910
ipv4 internet does not masquerade us a

1162
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:38,640
subset of your own address<font color="#E5E5E5"> bay so now</font>

1163
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:46,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into the next draft if</font>

1164
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:48,299
it's not already there thank you those

1165
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,769
concerns would be mostly interesting if

1166
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:51,719
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they were used as source</font>

1167
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:53,098
addresses right but there and they're

1168
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:56,309
never used as source addresses right

1169
00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,979
these addresses um oh no sorry yeah when

1170
00:57:56,309 --> 00:58:01,799
when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the place so but the nat64</font>

1171
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:05,640
stateful so it keeps say but yeah I did

1172
00:58:01,799 --> 00:58:07,200
yeah this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just not 64 this is RFC</font>

1173
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:08,040
65 to do so you can use it for<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1174
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:10,598
translation

1175
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:12,460
technology you want and that's why I say

1176
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:15,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should not assume anything</font>

1177
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these addresses because for</font>

1178
00:58:15,460 --> 00:58:21,190
instance if you assume oh this is not 64

1179
00:58:17,849 --> 00:58:22,599
RFC 6146 that's only thing they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1180
00:58:21,190 --> 00:58:24,130
to be used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that assumption might be</font>

1181
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:27,190
wrong and if you make the such an

1182
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:30,190
assumption about dr FC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60-52 prefix that</font>

1183
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:33,220
assumption might be wrong as well the

1184
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:37,960
same thing you cannot know if the even

1185
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:40,390
if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> that 64 and 62 algorithm</font>

1186
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:44,530
with it you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can still not know if it's /</font>

1187
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:47,859
64 or if it's a 96 and if so you cannot

1188
00:58:44,530 --> 00:58:49,750
know where in the address space the ipv4

1189
00:58:47,859 --> 00:58:53,950
addresses so basically it's the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1190
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:55,599
with a with a global unicast address

1191
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:59,770
right you cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if that's and I</font>

1192
00:58:55,599 --> 00:59:05,710
before embedded address and if so where

1193
00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:10,890
do I pee for addresses yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good</font>

1194
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:10,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a section on this yeah sure a</font>

1195
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,670
little surprised based the conversation

1196
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,320
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last meeting not to see more</font>

1197
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:21,220
people running to the microphone this

1198
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:22,869
was a an interesting topic even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1199
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:24,430
somebody just wants to say yes this

1200
00:59:22,869 --> 00:59:31,690
solves my concerns that I raised the

1201
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:33,910
last minute<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be useful</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> David's</font>

1202
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">cannot see Apple as one of the people</font>

1203
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:39,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">who had concerns last time the new</font>

1204
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:44,500
prefix and draft address my concerns

1205
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:47,500
thanks for doing that thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> at day</font>

1206
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:49,000
favor the section on that checks on

1207
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:55,119
neutrality addresses my concerns thank

1208
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:56,650
you thank you all right so uh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

1209
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:58,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to ask if this is a I was</font>

1210
00:59:56,650 --> 01:00:00,160
gonna ask you if this was a problem

1211
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:02,020
space that we need to address but I

1212
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,810
think they were we're sort of arriving

1213
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:09,220
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead I told this is tarick</font>

1214
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sarah's and I have a read the RFC or the</font>

1215
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:17,319
rough so far but I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the nat64</font>

1216
01:00:12,310 --> 01:00:21,650
and dns 6490 six bits prefix so can I

1217
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:25,220
ask that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have discussion with toe</font>

1218
01:00:21,650 --> 01:00:27,980
on emails about this issue earlier two

1219
01:00:25,220 --> 01:00:30,649
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we were doing the ipv4</font>

1220
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:34,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 habit network deployment projects</font>

1221
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:38,000
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> my question is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there increasing</font>

1222
01:00:34,099 --> 01:00:48,400
the host ID portion can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we solve the</font>

1223
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:51,410
multicast salut issues in translation I

1224
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:55,339
don't really know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer that the</font>

1225
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:58,670
RFS if this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used in RFC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6052</font>

1226
01:00:55,339 --> 01:01:00,440
context them them them it's basically a

1227
01:00:58,670 --> 01:01:02,599
matter of embedding a night before

1228
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,559
address in the 956 address or vice versa

1229
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:08,119
so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a multicast address or</font>

1230
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:10,789
unspecified addressed or whatever it's

1231
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:13,339
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting bits in a larger</font>

1232
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:17,020
sequence or bits or extracting bits from

1233
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:19,339
a larger sequence of bits but

1234
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:22,160
operationally if you can use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1235
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:26,328
make multicast work<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no</font>

1236
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:30,368
provisions for that or any feature that

1237
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:33,770
would make<font color="#CCCCCC"> strong ipv4 to ipv6</font>

1238
01:01:30,369 --> 01:01:35,750
translation of multicast traffic work so

1239
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:37,819
I guess it depends on the technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1240
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:39,500
you have a technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that allows that</font>

1241
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:41,000
to happen and it needs a translation

1242
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:44,119
prefixed and I'm sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can use</font>

1243
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:49,390
this prefix as any other prefix for that

1244
01:01:44,119 --> 01:01:53,839
solution but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm a</font>

1245
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:58,009
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this draft to to make multicasts</font>

1246
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:59,750
work so to speak I hope that was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a bad</font>

1247
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:03,049
answer but I think it's best when I have

1248
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:05,990
so sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that but before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you sit</font>

1249
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:09,890
down let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me ask you do you do you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1250
01:02:05,990 --> 01:02:12,410
it solves the problem and either way

1251
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:13,910
does this do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a section</font>

1252
01:02:12,410 --> 01:02:15,710
in this document describing it or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1253
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:17,299
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a separate document if we</font>

1254
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:20,990
adopt this saying here's another

1255
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:24,859
application actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more practical</font>

1256
01:02:20,990 --> 01:02:27,950
than believing in drafts and others is

1257
01:02:24,859 --> 01:02:30,098
actually unless I see I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and I</font>

1258
01:02:27,950 --> 01:02:33,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">implemented and if it it works for me</font>

1259
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:35,030
only then I can answer to your question

1260
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:38,600
currently

1261
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:41,600
if 96 cannot if if we were using 96 bits

1262
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:44,509
and we just need two bits for the ipv4

1263
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:47,060
address to to be translated in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TV 6</font>

1264
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:49,870
address space I don't understand that if

1265
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:53,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> increase the host ID portion and</font>

1266
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:57,290
compressing the prefix network prefix

1267
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:59,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">248 built so can it still solve the all</font>

1268
01:02:57,290 --> 01:03:03,770
those issues that we were facing in net

1269
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:06,650
64 if it cannot that because only we are

1270
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,420
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only using a unicast traffic and not</font>

1271
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:11,510
and the network is not specific to unica

1272
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:14,180
staffing basically ipv6 has so many

1273
01:03:11,510 --> 01:03:17,810
multicast traffic so the translation

1274
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:22,640
should be focusing the multicast traffic

1275
01:03:17,810 --> 01:03:25,310
as well in net 64 when the 64<font color="#CCCCCC"> cullen FFM</font>

1277
01:03:25,310 --> 01:03:29,930
the it was not supporting the

1278
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:32,150
multi-class issue so that that I I

1279
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:34,549
question this in that in that

1280
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:37,730
perspective actually it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two years</font>

1281
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:40,790
back I hope tour remember my emails

1282
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:43,940
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't exchanged email after</font>

1283
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:47,900
the debt project when we concluded so

1284
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:50,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">hopefully unless i implemented to your</font>

1285
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:54,290
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can have comment on that i</font>

1286
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:56,300
would say thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would say I I hope</font>

1287
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:58,100
that you will and come back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in either</font>

1288
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:59,630
way let us know<font color="#CCCCCC"> how it works I think</font>

1289
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,569
they'll be really useful to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

1290
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,790
group<font color="#E5E5E5"> perfectly yeah and I just like to</font>

1291
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,760
add that this prefix does not mandate

1292
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:10,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you use it with not 64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spit or any</font>

1293
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,640
other particular technology so if you

1294
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:16,629
sit at home and you cook up some

1295
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:22,339
technology that solves your problem and

1296
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:30,230
you need a certain number of bits length

1297
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:33,590
prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen if the 8080</font>

1298
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:35,150
bit of host ID or host plus whatever you

1299
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:38,000
want to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in them is enough then you</font>

1300
01:04:35,150 --> 01:04:41,150
can use this prefix if it / 48 is not

1301
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:46,210
long enough them then or short enough

1302
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:46,210
dun dun account so that's basically it

1303
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:54,589
full of Matthew's so I just scanned this

1304
01:04:50,630 --> 01:04:56,900
draft and it's been a few years with<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

1305
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:59,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">the stuff with well-known prefix why my</font>

1306
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:03,440
memory is a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> poor and all this</font>

1307
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:08,060
you're pulling<font color="#CCCCCC"> a slash</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 48 with colon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font>

1308
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:13,840
there and the well-known prefix has a

1309
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:17,500
colon<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 but is only a 96 um what's</font>

1310
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:21,710
what's happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the rest of the</font>

1311
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:23,600
colon 0 / 48 I guess is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole ideas</font>

1312
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:28,550
we're not saying anything about what

1313
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:30,410
that's being used for is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just cuz</font>

1314
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:32,870
you won't use do suggest that you could

1315
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:35,029
summarize everything up with a slash 47

1316
01:05:32,870 --> 01:05:38,630
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

1317
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:40,700
whole that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of sitting there and I</font>

1318
01:05:38,630 --> 01:05:43,100
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> remember if there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1319
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:44,660
about that way back when the well-known

1320
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,880
prefix thought was there as I said my

1321
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:53,270
memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that is faded now over the</font>

1322
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:57,200
years so anyway that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my question that</font>

1323
01:05:53,270 --> 01:06:00,860
space is allocated or reserved by the

1324
01:05:57,200 --> 01:06:03,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITF or as in it will remain in the in</font>

1325
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:07,820
the registration state it is currently

1326
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:10,370
I'm it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not being touched so so that's</font>

1327
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,400
it presumably then this document should

1328
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:16,490
probably say at least don't allocate it

1329
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:20,150
for something totally unrelated because

1330
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:24,740
otherwise the using the<font color="#CCCCCC"> slash 47 doesn't</font>

1331
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:28,430
make sense yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> something related so</font>

1332
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:33,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the slap 47 makes sense now or I</font>

1333
01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:36,020
can just not suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people used /</font>

1334
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:42,010
47 to refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the space because these</font>

1335
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:48,590
this prefix on the RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6052 prefix are</font>

1336
01:06:42,010 --> 01:06:51,890
sorry screensaver see there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go they</font>

1337
01:06:48,590 --> 01:06:54,200
are distinct they are not overlapping

1338
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:55,520
not really related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to each other even</font>

1339
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,029
though they might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be used for very</font>

1340
01:06:55,520 --> 01:07:01,430
similar purposes or even the same exact

1341
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:09,260
purpose they are not related to<font color="#E5E5E5"> each</font>

1342
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:11,509
other really Eric wine<font color="#E5E5E5"> um I'm neither in</font>

1343
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:14,600
favor nor opposed to this per se I just

1344
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:16,760
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the way that I feel about is it</font>

1345
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:20,420
seems to me to be semantically identical

1346
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:27,520
to allocating ay ula that happens to

1347
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:32,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">just neighbor the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 60-52 space no because</font>

1348
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:36,590
it is well known prefix right do you

1349
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:37,610
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know to do this and this</font>

1350
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:40,070
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying what we're just gonna</font>

1351
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:41,600
pick a ula to do it not from the UL a

1352
01:07:40,070 --> 01:07:43,610
space of course but you know it just

1353
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,730
happens to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be neighboring so that it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1354
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:50,810
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> covered with / 47 yes yes absolutely</font>

1355
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:54,290
so so that is basically I I prefix for

1356
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:57,560
that purpose so and I'm glad you

1357
01:07:54,290 --> 01:07:59,750
clarified that you did not specify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1358
01:07:57,560 --> 01:08:02,180
actual uli space because that it has

1359
01:07:59,750 --> 01:08:04,340
special treatment in host and add a

1360
01:08:02,180 --> 01:08:10,460
selection so it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used for this</font>

1361
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:11,840
in a proper manner to the address

1362
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,670
selection point is they're special

1363
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:16,250
handling of the 62 g to prefix in a

1364
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:19,460
dress selection or is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> solid under</font>

1365
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:28,490
zero is entered 0 / 3 right i believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1366
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:29,630
out yep thanks well thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i feel</font>

1367
01:08:28,490 --> 01:08:32,568
<font color="#E5E5E5">better that more people were involved</font>

1368
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:34,580
and showing interest and have at least

1369
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:38,690
read the document<font color="#E5E5E5"> and understand what's</font>

1370
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:41,299
going on so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is time to</font>

1371
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:42,439
respond<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say and ask whether this is</font>

1372
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:44,479
something we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so we're</font>

1373
01:08:42,439 --> 01:08:46,068
going to take a hum i'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask if</font>

1374
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,089
you think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should adopt this document</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask if you think we should</font>

very little humming in both directions i

1378
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:55,760
might ask whether you are in different

1379
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:58,010
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> i minused because that would also</font>

1380
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,839
matter to me so but let me start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with if</font>

as a working group document please hum

1383
01:09:04,299 --> 01:09:08,089
thank you if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should not</font>

were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do another revision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyway</font>

1390
01:09:23,799 --> 01:09:29,618
you can name that v6 ops and also

1391
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:31,179
successful one so to speak or<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

1392
01:09:29,618 --> 01:09:33,488
adopted<font color="#CCCCCC"> i couldnt hear from here we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1393
01:09:31,179 --> 01:09:34,899
it yes i am sorry i forgot to gavel we

1394
01:09:33,488 --> 01:09:36,669
have adopted this document as a working

1395
01:09:34,899 --> 01:09:38,348
group document so when you spin your

1396
01:09:36,670 --> 01:09:42,670
next revision you can name it draft IETF

1397
01:09:38,349 --> 01:09:51,520
v6 offs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you thank you all</font>

right<font color="#CCCCCC"> bye-bye and that was so now we are</font>

1399
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,119
up to our additional bonus agenda item

1400
01:09:54,040 --> 01:09:58,949
Victor asked for five or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten minutes</font>

1401
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:14,409
Victor you<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for five or ten minutes</font>

1402
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:19,570
these are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hour one</font>

1403
01:10:14,409 --> 01:10:21,909
slide so this was related to comments we

1404
01:10:19,570 --> 01:10:23,409
got on the design draft there was a

1405
01:10:21,909 --> 01:10:25,110
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I thought was important I</font>

1406
01:10:23,409 --> 01:10:27,460
thought it was important to bring out

1407
01:10:25,110 --> 01:10:29,739
which was there was suggestions about

1408
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:33,159
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> v6 you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we were talking</font>

1409
01:10:29,739 --> 01:10:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">about v4 vs v6 design and v6 is great we</font>

1410
01:10:33,159 --> 01:10:37,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do a lot of really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cool things v6 it</font>

1411
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:39,159
can make operations better etc what I

1412
01:10:37,210 --> 01:10:41,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought you know I thought it wasn't</font>

1413
01:10:39,159 --> 01:10:42,969
appropriate<font color="#E5E5E5"> instead try to in line at a</font>

1414
01:10:41,619 --> 01:10:44,949
bunch other documents that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have</font>

1415
01:10:42,969 --> 01:10:47,980
other intended purposes to try to fit in

1416
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:50,650
all the greatness of v6 versus what if

1417
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:52,449
we then had a series of documents if

1418
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:54,369
people are willing to write them that

1419
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:56,259
went and talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the specific use</font>

1420
01:10:54,369 --> 01:10:58,139
case and extrapolated a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1421
01:10:56,260 --> 01:11:00,639
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was relevant to how</font>

1422
01:10:58,139 --> 01:11:02,440
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different with v6 how it's</font>

1423
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:04,000
used there and you kind of take it top

1424
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:06,489
to bottom showing the operational

1425
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,170
components of it it is it savings is it

1426
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:09,580
beneficial<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is there more things</font>

1427
01:11:08,170 --> 01:11:10,989
you can do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know we</font>

1428
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:13,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">should try to capture these in separate</font>

1429
01:11:10,989 --> 01:11:15,759
documents as opposed to hiding things in

1430
01:11:13,690 --> 01:11:17,669
line in other documents like I mentioned

1431
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:21,550
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> they had intended purposes uh</font>

1432
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:24,040
that may not have been specific or you

1433
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:25,000
know specifically for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> name that's</font>

1434
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:26,030
the point I just want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

1435
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,290
highlight them<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring out</font>

1436
01:11:26,030 --> 01:11:29,599
you know what does a working group feel

1437
01:11:27,290 --> 01:11:31,610
about this does that make more sense or

1438
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,080
do we continue to try to stuff

1439
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:34,370
information into a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

documents no one's interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1441
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:38,360
apparently understood so I mean that was

1442
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:40,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">the that was intended purpose and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1443
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:41,480
what I thought I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> just bring up and</font>

1444
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:44,690
figure out what how people feel about

1445
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:46,099
that the opinion train is coming Michael

1446
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:48,139
Abramson so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1447
01:11:46,100 --> 01:11:51,050
useful I run into this all the time with

1448
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,370
them people are used to ipv4 and they're

1449
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,230
trying to do the same thing in ipv6

1450
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:55,940
because they don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what that</font>

1451
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:58,790
you can't do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things differently in ipv6</font>

1452
01:11:55,940 --> 01:12:00,080
that might actually be easier and help

1453
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:05,840
them so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be extremely</font>

1458
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:21,830
of that involves pointing at 79 34 and a

list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other documents the you know</font>

don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that it could be captured in</font>

a single document without looking super

religious or you know extra fervent or

<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually I like the timing because</font>

01:12:52,850 --> 01:12:57,260
we just had was doing discussion on

Eastern European a curator circle group

help promote enemy six and explain to

<font color="#E5E5E5">people how to deploy it we probably need</font>

1474
01:13:05,660 --> 01:13:11,300
to document our sinks which you can do

1475
01:13:09,230 --> 01:13:15,019
better or differently and v6 compare

1476
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:17,570
them to a<font color="#CCCCCC"> four year</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so great idea and so</font>

1477
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:19,820
as you guys walk up in the thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font>

01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:22,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm not sure one document is the way to</font>

1479
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:25,820
go maybe it's per use case or you break

1480
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:27,590
down again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have no intended thought as</font>

1481
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:30,950
to how we captured but I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

1482
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:32,630
important that we do uh and as opposed

1483
01:13:30,950 --> 01:13:34,880
to sticking it in line is make it

1484
01:13:32,630 --> 01:13:37,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific you know here's how top to</font>

1485
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:40,389
bottom why it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> better and how we do it</font>

1486
01:13:37,070 --> 01:13:43,130
operationalize<font color="#E5E5E5"> it etc sir</font>

1487
01:13:40,389 --> 01:13:45,440
absolutely i mean this you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1488
01:13:43,130 --> 01:13:46,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">i've been involved in ipv6 advocacy kind</font>

1489
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:48,860
of work and and this is the kind of

1490
01:13:46,969 --> 01:13:50,630
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is needed and the more</font>

1491
01:13:48,860 --> 01:13:55,219
specific you can get and the more you

1492
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:57,440
can define what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found in this case</font>

1493
01:13:55,219 --> 01:13:59,389
or why you know anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do in</font>

1494
01:13:57,440 --> 01:14:04,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">that regard is good so yes I would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

1495
01:13:59,389 --> 01:14:05,840
any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these docs good learn security</font>

1496
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:08,059
yeah I think that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you'd about you</font>

1497
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you said jen is right it's time the</font>

1498
01:14:08,060 --> 01:14:11,270
reason so when I saw this I said well

1499
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,250
wait that's stupid why didn't we have

1500
01:14:11,270 --> 01:14:15,380
this already<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then and then I said oh</font>

1501
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:17,540
that's why so we we couldn't have this

1502
01:14:15,380 --> 01:14:19,550
because it would risk because it would

1503
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:21,260
it would have fallen on<font color="#E5E5E5"> deaf ears before</font>

1504
01:14:19,550 --> 01:14:22,909
right if we'd written as 5 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1505
01:14:21,260 --> 01:14:24,949
would have been just more fan fairing

1506
01:14:22,909 --> 01:14:26,929
and like you know zealotry but now that

1507
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:28,699
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 is real that people are actually</font>

1508
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:30,469
deploying it for different<font color="#E5E5E5"> reasons now</font>

1509
01:14:28,699 --> 01:14:31,339
is the time to tell I'm locating this v6

1510
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:33,679
think that you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for other</font>

1511
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:35,540
reasons here's what you can do with it

1512
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:36,739
and as you look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at deploying it in</font>

1513
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:38,480
various parts of your network<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1514
01:14:36,739 --> 01:14:40,610
different ways think about how these

1515
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,199
things you would you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you maybe not</font>

1516
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:43,849
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do today but you might</font>

1517
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:46,250
want to do in two years how they would

1518
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:48,380
fit into how you design things like 11

1519
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:50,210
ideas like the 64 / host with like I'm

1520
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:52,070
IP address / app right that's good

1521
01:14:50,210 --> 01:14:54,110
that's an obvious example right but

1522
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:55,730
there may be more I don't know about how

1523
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:57,619
you put them in one document versus

1524
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:59,000
multiple documents but I do think it's

1525
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:02,659
it's a good time to start writing this

1526
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:04,639
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was just going to second at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

1527
01:15:02,659 --> 01:15:06,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">Yuriko second go Lorenzo's point2 about</font>

1528
01:15:04,639 --> 01:15:08,510
the timing wise the other advantage is

1529
01:15:06,619 --> 01:15:10,699
that we now have very solid measurements

1530
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:12,020
etc you know that show when you start

1531
01:15:10,699 --> 01:15:14,000
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the measurements out of the</font>

1532
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:16,310
world ipv6 launch stuff that shows<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1533
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:18,290
you know verizon's network at the high

1534
01:15:16,310 --> 01:15:22,460
percentage it is the other networks are

1535
01:15:18,290 --> 01:15:25,040
there you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear that you</font>

1536
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:26,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that ipv6 is being deployed so</font>

1537
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:32,630
we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see that that</font>

1538
01:15:26,510 --> 01:15:36,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">happening Jordi palette I submitted the</font>

1539
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:40,969
document in 2006 to this working group

1540
01:15:36,909 --> 01:15:44,210
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain how to deploy how to</font>

1541
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:46,969
how to do the point-to-point links I

1542
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:50,480
think at that time the working group

1543
01:15:46,969 --> 01:15:54,050
basically said you should not<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell so</font>

1544
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:56,489
much indeed to the ISPs how to do this

1545
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:58,679
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't reach the deadline for</font>

1546
01:15:56,489 --> 01:16:00,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">submitting a new person but I think</font>

1547
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:03,329
that's somehow related to this and I I

1548
01:16:00,900 --> 01:16:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably also meet a new person today or</font>

1549
01:16:03,329 --> 01:16:07,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">tomorrow I think it's related to tal</font>

1550
01:16:06,030 --> 01:16:11,869
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually it's it's going to the</font>

1551
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,869
details about how to do the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1552
01:16:12,469 --> 01:16:17,880
Tom Herbert so it sound like a great

1553
01:16:15,750 --> 01:16:20,519
idea one question I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> though is</font>

1554
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:25,099
is the intent of this to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1555
01:16:20,519 --> 01:16:27,059
document experience with ipv6 and say

1556
01:16:25,099 --> 01:16:28,860
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some like extension</font>

1557
01:16:27,059 --> 01:16:30,929
header so we know extension headers have

1558
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:33,989
a problem than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet how would we</font>

1559
01:16:30,929 --> 01:16:36,449
phrase that in terms of utilizing ipv6

1560
01:16:33,989 --> 01:16:40,440
capabilities would we advocate that or

1561
01:16:36,449 --> 01:16:43,739
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of say well you can but you my life</font>

1562
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:46,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">may vary how would you phrase that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1563
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:46,888
might well say your luck may vary you

1564
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:50,039
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in the following</font>

1565
01:16:46,889 --> 01:16:52,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">circumstances you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you can</font>

1566
01:16:50,039 --> 01:16:55,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">describe this is you know I'm just sort</font>

1567
01:16:52,019 --> 01:16:56,789
of sorry responding for you that's a

1568
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">great option although</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i also have a</font>

1569
01:16:56,789 --> 01:17:00,329
further question that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was about to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ask</font>

1570
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:02,730
the working group which is are we

1571
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:04,590
talking about writing documents that

1572
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:07,079
describe clever things that people have

1573
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:08,519
done with ipv6 because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ipv6 and</font>

1574
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:09,929
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't do it before or are we</font>

1575
01:17:08,519 --> 01:17:15,360
talking about clever things that people

1576
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:17,699
could do with ipv6 so just before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1577
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,920
come up with what else what again I was

1578
01:17:17,699 --> 01:17:22,138
still thinking through this I think baby

1579
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:25,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">both might be relevant in like if you go</font>

1580
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:26,969
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 10</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years it was a lot of theory</font>

1581
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:29,789
that we would have put towards this

1582
01:17:26,969 --> 01:17:32,219
right we mean we thought we knew over

1583
01:17:29,789 --> 01:17:34,139
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into but we've</font>

1584
01:17:32,219 --> 01:17:35,699
experienced a lot of v6 over the last

1585
01:17:34,139 --> 01:17:36,989
number year so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's going to</font>

1586
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:38,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen now is we can talk about</font>

1587
01:17:36,989 --> 01:17:42,419
practical things that we've actually

1588
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:44,250
done you know case in point with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gunther</font>

1589
01:17:42,420 --> 01:17:47,219
in the you know Brazil's we talked about

1590
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:49,199
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Comcast's etc but now if we</font>

1591
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:51,780
extrapolate we have more experience by

1592
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:53,940
which to then base maybe some additional

1593
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:56,400
theory on right like I mean we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1594
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:57,839
behind us to then figure out what could

1595
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:59,369
also be the art of the possible so i

1596
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,219
think thick times have changed my

1597
01:17:59,369 --> 01:18:03,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">opinion you know Eric line I think</font>

1598
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,489
actually we could probably document

1599
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,630
stuff that people have attempted to one

1600
01:18:05,489 --> 01:18:07,379
degree or another actually at this point

1601
01:18:06,630 --> 01:18:10,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">because</font>

1602
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:12,540
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jeff Houston documented last month</font>

1603
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:16,679
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how he was doing / 54 to a</font>

1604
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:19,350
host and serving all manner of IP

1605
01:18:16,679 --> 01:18:22,230
addresses from that we have done<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font>

1606
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:26,610
data centers for not quite a decade now

1607
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:28,428
but just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the core</font>

1608
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:31,199
thing for me is trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

1609
01:18:28,429 --> 01:18:34,050
well when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain people what it's not</font>

1610
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:36,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">125 before it's all about like you have</font>

1611
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:38,520
18 million trillion addresses in a slice

1612
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:40,888
CT for right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of abundance</font>

1613
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:44,820
is like way outside of our ordinary

1614
01:18:40,889 --> 01:18:46,260
scope of thinking so to convey the idea

1615
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:49,110
that you have this abundance and you

1616
01:18:46,260 --> 01:18:52,920
don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be as parsimonious as you</font>

1617
01:18:49,110 --> 01:18:54,719
were in before uh I would approve if

1618
01:18:52,920 --> 01:18:59,010
somebody could yeah i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would</font>

1619
01:18:54,719 --> 01:19:02,909
support anyone who could craft such

1620
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:05,550
statement well<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dean York I would not I</font>

1621
01:19:02,909 --> 01:19:06,929
would focus on what have we learned what

1622
01:19:05,550 --> 01:19:09,420
are the real things that are out there

1623
01:19:06,929 --> 01:19:11,250
we have endless documents to talk about

1624
01:19:09,420 --> 01:19:13,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happen and</font>

1625
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:16,110
would happen if Lee everybody did ipv6

1626
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yahoo let's talk about what people have</font>

1627
01:19:16,110 --> 01:19:20,099
actually seen whether they learned you

1628
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:22,889
know to Eric's point about the abundance

1629
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:25,230
issue around that you know do we have

1630
01:19:22,889 --> 01:19:27,360
any instances that people can show where

1631
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:29,218
they went ipv6 only on the inside and

1632
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:31,230
got and you know we're able to take the

1633
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:32,790
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are you know previously spent</font>

1634
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,290
doing all the sudden that allocation

1635
01:19:32,790 --> 01:19:36,420
stuff that they had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and figure out</font>

1636
01:19:34,290 --> 01:19:38,219
to go and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all work across an</font>

1637
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:39,870
enterprise<font color="#E5E5E5"> when that were they able to</font>

1638
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:40,949
retask those people on other things

1639
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:42,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they were able to make their</font>

1640
01:19:40,949 --> 01:19:44,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">internal networks more efficient let's</font>

1641
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:46,980
look at how we can document the things

1642
01:19:44,340 --> 01:19:49,290
that are that we can you know are

1643
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:51,780
observed and we've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because now</font>

1644
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:54,389
we have real deployments because that's

1645
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:58,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need is real facts real things</font>

1646
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:58,250
real stuff that people can talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1647
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:04,380
angeline colossal<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan said we</font>

1648
01:20:02,190 --> 01:20:06,299
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably recommend what have</font>

1649
01:20:04,380 --> 01:20:08,400
been done to prove that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's possible</font>

1650
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:10,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's beneficial because there are</font>

1651
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,449
countries out there when the adoption

1652
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:14,310
rate is like below one percent and when

1653
01:20:12,449 --> 01:20:17,849
you go there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> those people</font>

1654
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:20,760
and ask them why you get two answers I

1655
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:21,210
can't I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how and I don't know</font>

1656
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,930
why

1657
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:30,660
and we can help awesome give exams at

1658
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:32,850
answer other insecurities<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think these</font>

1659
01:20:30,660 --> 01:20:34,500
two things are really just that what

1660
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:36,270
scale does it need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to be does it</font>

1661
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,520
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to have been done before</font>

1662
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:41,070
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can talk about it right if I yeah if</font>

1663
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:45,360
I build some code and hunt and run it on

1664
01:20:41,070 --> 01:20:46,920
my 56 at home and I can you know or

1665
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:48,480
whatever this there's some stuff that I

1666
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:50,219
can do and we won think one idea that

1667
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:51,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'd have and which which may be a dumb</font>

1668
01:20:50,219 --> 01:20:53,820
idea and I don't know until somebody

1669
01:20:51,570 --> 01:20:55,710
works out the math but like right now we

1670
01:20:53,820 --> 01:20:57,599
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and I right and and SN eyes in</font>

1671
01:20:55,710 --> 01:20:59,100
the clear and everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see it but if</font>

1672
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you if we went back then it's</font>

1673
01:20:59,100 --> 01:21:02,820
like why do we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> s and I well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cuz we</font>

1674
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:06,269
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an off IP addresses right but</font>

1675
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:07,500
but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do now right so so you could</font>

1676
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">say well you know that's one thing that</font>

1677
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:14,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do and I could say well here's</font>

1678
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:16,440
how you use one ipv6 address / host and

1679
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,840
so you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to leak anything</font>

1680
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:21,570
inside DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sorry instead the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> S&I</font>

1681
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:24,060
handshake so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know that that</font>

1682
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:25,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">seems useful to document even if no</font>

1683
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,570
one's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing it another</font>

1684
01:21:25,770 --> 01:21:29,040
reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you if you insist on</font>

1685
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:32,190
documenting stuff that people have done

1686
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:34,320
then they're gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to you</font>

1687
01:21:32,190 --> 01:21:36,750
then they're gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say well I</font>

1688
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:39,000
was this is who I am and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and here's what</font>

1689
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">I did and then maybe that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna</font>

1690
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:44,850
involve people going to lawyers and

1691
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:47,219
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so put myself back in</font>

1692
01:21:44,850 --> 01:21:49,040
line I mean I'm not personal thing one

1693
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:51,450
excludes the other so I think

1694
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:53,700
documenting what we've done is important

1695
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:55,530
I also think document we can do

1696
01:21:53,700 --> 01:21:57,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">personally think is important because</font>

1697
01:21:55,530 --> 01:21:58,950
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of as I've heard is no</font>

1698
01:21:57,210 --> 01:21:59,910
list right there<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1699
01:21:58,950 --> 01:22:01,260
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old way you're thinking</font>

1700
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,400
you're thinking in a constrained

1701
01:22:01,260 --> 01:22:04,710
environment the answer is we'll know

1702
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:05,730
let's open let's open up people's minus

1703
01:22:04,710 --> 01:22:07,380
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could potentially view although</font>

1704
01:22:05,730 --> 01:22:09,299
we may not have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> it or not done at</font>

1705
01:22:07,380 --> 01:22:12,060
scale I remember having conversations

1706
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:14,460
with won't name where but you know folks

1707
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:16,380
in the past and we're in we suggested

1708
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:17,790
models that I gots crazy talk who would

1709
01:22:16,380 --> 01:22:19,080
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now we have enough</font>

1710
01:22:17,790 --> 01:22:20,519
the points behind us where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1711
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:23,309
actually have open conversations about

1712
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:26,610
the art of the possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> make based on</font>

1713
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:28,110
experience so that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so as</font>

1714
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:29,610
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group chair knowing this was</font>

1715
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:31,650
coming it did reread the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Charter to make</font>

1716
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:33,750
sure that I knew what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said and it</font>

1717
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:35,039
says<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we're here to da / 82 document</font>

1718
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:37,109
operational experiences and

1719
01:22:35,039 --> 01:22:39,329
issues with ipv6 and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're</font>

1720
01:22:37,109 --> 01:22:42,749
necessarily describing<font color="#CCCCCC"> ipv describing</font>

1721
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:45,289
issues here so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I may have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go back to</font>

1722
01:22:42,749 --> 01:22:48,059
my co-chairs an area director and say

1723
01:22:45,289 --> 01:22:49,530
that I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think there's interest in</font>

1724
01:22:48,059 --> 01:22:51,869
discussing this I think it made its

1725
01:22:49,530 --> 01:22:55,199
require a recharter is a fairly minor E

1726
01:22:51,869 --> 01:22:58,530
charter yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is totally</font>

1727
01:22:55,199 --> 01:23:00,869
doable yeah so obviously we'll come back

1728
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:02,789
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you will try and draft a charter</font>

1729
01:23:00,869 --> 01:23:06,089
and ask if you like it but I'm hearing

1730
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:08,398
pretty strong support as a chair my

1731
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:09,809
inclination is to push back<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

1732
01:23:08,399 --> 01:23:12,659
harder on things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that haven't actually</font>

1733
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:15,179
been done if you've got code even if

1734
01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:17,219
it's working in a lab yes that's that's

1735
01:23:15,179 --> 01:23:19,949
that's more interesting than a clever

1736
01:23:17,219 --> 01:23:20,999
idea you had once in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the shower if</font>

1737
01:23:19,949 --> 01:23:22,530
you've actually deployed something

1738
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:25,619
network that's even more interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1739
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:28,228
I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to hear that so that's the</font>

1740
01:23:25,619 --> 01:23:29,728
way I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would lean but I don't own the</font>

1741
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:32,849
working group I just facilitate its

1742
01:23:29,729 --> 01:23:35,010
operation so willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take feedback on</font>

1743
01:23:32,849 --> 01:23:37,289
that I'm either now or another time and

1744
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:41,219
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> my in direction for my ad of course</font>

1745
01:23:37,289 --> 01:23:43,759
yeah I'm so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit mused by um</font>

1746
01:23:41,219 --> 01:23:45,689
the cases where we don't seem<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1747
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:48,809
experience with it because for example

1748
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:51,839
like the prefix<font color="#CCCCCC"> edition thing I've been</font>

1749
01:23:48,809 --> 01:23:55,499
binding prefixes to loop backs on<font color="#CCCCCC"> host</font>

1750
01:23:51,839 --> 01:23:59,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">for like like Eric for about a decade um</font>

1751
01:23:55,499 --> 01:24:02,010
and we definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of</font>

1752
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:05,189
experience with that sort of thing so I

1753
01:24:02,010 --> 01:24:06,749
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should be able to tease out</font>

1754
01:24:05,189 --> 01:24:08,760
the ones that we're we're quite

1755
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:11,809
comfortable with I think pretty easily

1756
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:14,789
yeah if no one does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> then well I guess</font>

1757
01:24:11,809 --> 01:24:17,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're sort of speculating about thing</font>

1758
01:24:14,789 --> 01:24:19,049
and I could imagine one to that case and

1759
01:24:17,069 --> 01:24:20,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could absolutely imagine saying</font>

1760
01:24:19,049 --> 01:24:22,199
somebody having a clever idea they want

1761
01:24:20,609 --> 01:24:23,849
to say hey is anybody thought about

1762
01:24:22,199 --> 01:24:26,188
doing this and giving them some agenda

1763
01:24:23,849 --> 01:24:28,229
time if there's interest on the list but

1764
01:24:26,189 --> 01:24:29,549
that doesn't I probably would resist

1765
01:24:28,229 --> 01:24:32,429
publishing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as a working group</font>

1766
01:24:29,549 --> 01:24:34,049
document if<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean I a lot of the</font>

1767
01:24:32,429 --> 01:24:35,819
things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space seem to be driven by</font>

1768
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:39,239
business requirements so if nobody has

1769
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:40,709
done it then like that's a pretty

1770
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:42,509
significant argument for not doing

1771
01:24:40,709 --> 01:24:44,280
anything about it right now

1772
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:46,679
like I was going to say that Eric

1773
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:48,750
Lanigan that uh I can point you to the

1774
01:24:46,679 --> 01:24:51,210
to the blog post for Google Cloud SQL

1775
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:53,670
where they give one ipv6 address per

1776
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:58,829
customer for free if you want to be

1777

1 colon<font color="#CCCCCC"> I just realized that probably we</font>

1779
01:25:02,219 --> 01:25:05,760
do not have the right people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the room</font>

1780
01:25:04,019 --> 01:25:09,659
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a community out there</font>

1783
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:17,190
another region and it's probably right

1784
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:19,440
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> too we should reach to hear what</font>

1785
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:20,940
they're doing and do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it the comment</font>

1786
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:23,428
about if people has not done it yet

01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:25,169
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> smoke</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed sometimes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1788
01:25:23,429 --> 01:25:28,440
do not do it because they don't know

<font color="#E5E5E5">about that all they do not have required</font>

1791
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:37,349
to your suggestion that operators should

give input to the v6 operations working

1794
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:44,759
so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i agree</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's definitely</font>

1795
01:25:43,349 --> 01:25:46,230
room within the IETF to discuss things

1796
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:48,750
that haven't been done before that's a

1797
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:51,169
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> place I'm not sure v6 ops is the</font>

place to publish documents for fresh

1799

all the help we can get so and I was

01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:22,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">just going to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one bit of advice to</font>

01:26:35,940 --> 01:26:39,239
who we after here there may there may be

1814
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:42,170
multiple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that what I</font>

1815
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:44,428
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I heard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from victor is that</font>

1816
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,719
there's interest in saying here are some

1817
01:26:44,429 --> 01:26:47,730
cool new things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can do with</font>

1818
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:49,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">ipv6 that you couldn't do in ipv4 which</font>

1819
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:51,209
probably would be targeted<font color="#CCCCCC"> at people who</font>

1820
01:26:49,260 --> 01:26:53,070
are thinking about deploying ipv6 and

1821
01:26:51,210 --> 01:26:55,320
trying to develop more reasons to

1822
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:56,340
support that but I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak for</font>

1823
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:59,309
Victor and

1824
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh I know what you just said the one of</font>

1825
01:26:59,310 --> 01:27:04,560
the promises were not thinking about it

1826
01:27:01,619 --> 01:27:06,839
yep we should be and I think here's an

1827
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:08,520
opportunity to get us thinking about it

1828
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:11,190
if we can solve problems that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1829
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:12,869
that would be great yes so I mean

1830
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:14,250
there's more than one way to look at

1831
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:16,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">this however one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

1832
01:27:14,250 --> 01:27:18,599
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably I mean we are</font>

1833
01:27:16,889 --> 01:27:20,099
technology organization so I think the

1834
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:22,050
technology has to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> up somehow in the</font>

1835
01:27:20,099 --> 01:27:23,460
writing probably a rollup of that

1836
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:24,630
whether that's done here or elsewhere I

1837
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:26,340
mean I didn't mean leave that out

1838
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:28,739
because that's the most valuable<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece</font>

1839
01:27:26,340 --> 01:27:30,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying I agree I love it</font>

1840
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:33,089
my boss won't understand it so we won't

1841
01:27:30,630 --> 01:27:35,010
do it yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I think expand and</font>

1842
01:27:33,090 --> 01:27:37,590
simplify so we have the details we have

1843
01:27:35,010 --> 01:27:39,239
the information and we simplified and it

1844
01:27:37,590 --> 01:27:40,619
gets simplified I'm not don't know who

1845
01:27:39,239 --> 01:27:41,940
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this and how we do this but I</font>

1846
01:27:40,619 --> 01:27:43,409
agree because you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to</font>

1847
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:44,969
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> speak at some point where you</font>

1848
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:47,699
so some executive says yeah that's worth

1849
01:27:44,969 --> 01:27:49,739
money I see why would do this I mean I'd

1850
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:51,449
be beneficial at some point well then in

1851
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:52,739
advance thank you if we publish

1852
01:27:51,449 --> 01:27:54,239
technical documents and we need

1853
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:55,860
management's translation than i would

1854
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:59,540
ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan York to help us out because that</font>

1855
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:59,540
seems like a thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's really good</font>

1856
01:28:00,230 --> 01:28:04,049
that brings us to the end of our

1857
01:28:02,099 --> 01:28:05,699
modified agenda as anybody have anything

1858
01:28:04,050 --> 01:28:10,590
else they'd like to talk about related

1859
01:28:05,699 --> 01:28:14,879
to v6 operations hearing none we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1860
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:16,710
adjourned<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much I'm</font>

1861
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:20,929
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the blue sheets back I see</font>

1862
01:28:16,710 --> 01:28:20,929
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> one other than there thank you</font>

1863
