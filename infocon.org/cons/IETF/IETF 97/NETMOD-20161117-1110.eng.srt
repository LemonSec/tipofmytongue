23
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:58,360
should be familiar with it everything

24
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,340
you say here becomes part of our record

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:06,430
and you have certain obligations if you

26
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:10,060
contribute to the IETF<font color="#CCCCCC"> yes we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are again</font>

about to jump in if anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else wants to</font>

31
00:02:16,299 --> 00:02:21,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">jump in that'd be great most</font>

32
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:24,609
importantly we have etherpad for

33
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:28,239
collective crowd-sourced note-taking

34
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:31,890
please join please contribute even if

35
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,890
it's just fixing someone else's edits

36
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:44,770
we're in our second session we have an

37
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:46,720
agenda now with that this wasn't updated

38
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:47,830
who's giving these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things Phil's going</font>

39
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:55,470
to be giving these slides Phil are you

40
00:02:47,830 --> 00:03:02,530
here Phil are you here let me text<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok uh</font>

41
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:05,370
Dan are you hear that that would be

42
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:09,010
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess we're moving too quickly I</font>

43
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:16,360
bet um let's try our third presenter

44
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:18,130
chiffon he's here he is reliable as

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,860
always I think we're gonna start off

46
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:26,350
with the chiffon and then we'll so we'll

47
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:30,640
end up going out of order just one last

48
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:37,739
little peek etherpad it's off the tools

49
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:43,029
pages if you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there quicker</font>

50
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:48,430
sure and this is called which<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

51
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:51,220
this this is scheduled oh you won't go

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,310
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> motor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so Phil came in just</font>

53
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:57,730
in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want oh so we'll take Phil</font>

54
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,920
yeah where's Phil he's right here Phil I

55
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:02,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see oh there you go standing up I</font>

56
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,140
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the end of it at the door</font>

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,518
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> chief on we'll make sure you get</font>

58
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,399
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure you have your full</font>

59
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:14,620
time because being reliable so this is

60
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,060
sir but that I got sidetracked into it

61
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,260
that's the long conversation on

62
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:22,680
internationalization because there

63
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:22,680
aren't any short conversations<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font>

64
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:35,500
ah so yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had I just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

65
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:37,200
finding them hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> on i'll go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and start</font>

66
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,780
so yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had a breakout meeting</font>

67
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:42,849
in the afternoon it was 137 and we

68
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,500
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were joking when Kent gave us</font>

69
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:47,290
that minute that many hours<font color="#E5E5E5"> and turns</font>

70
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:53,580
out we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> used them all um it was</font>

71
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:58,000
uh i think uh yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

72
00:04:53,580 --> 00:05:01,109
positive meeting it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think was it</font>

73
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,790
confirmed the design of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the of the</font>

74
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:14,500
design team yeah says powerpoint crash

75
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:22,930
we'll see whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> i clicker works no no</font>

76
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:24,670
we'll try what we're time it was in

77
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">general positive experience things</font>

78
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:36,100
things went well there were some issues

79
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:38,740
with the draft of the big thing lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:40,540
questions lots of clarifications we walk

81
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:45,820
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications and the issues</font>

82
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:51,040
section from the presentation of tuesday

83
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:54,690
and and had some answers and some still

84
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:57,400
remain open issues the big things were

85
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:59,740
more examples and more descriptive text

86
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,840
I think the draft covers the material

87
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,000
but it covers it very briefly and I

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,539
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd be better serviced by more</font>

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,280
in-depth discussions in turning some of

90
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,590
the discussions of the design team into

91
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,200
text in the draft instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just</font>

92
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:15,719
presenting the conclusion and so we'll

93
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,190
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that essentially through examples</font>

94
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,760
there's also the issue of type of

95
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:20,760
timeliness

96
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">eric had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point that data in running</font>

97
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,120
essentially appears immediately sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

98
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:34,469
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say me it appears in sync with</font>

99
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,240
intended the two are lockstep and

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,490
there's also a lockstep relationship

101
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:42,450
between applied and operational state

102
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:44,910
simply because applied can be viewed as

103
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,830
a subset of operational state so so

104
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,930
those two need to be that point needs to

105
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:52,950
be more clearly made that those really

106
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,740
are bound together the other issue we

107
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:57,840
discussed was factory default

108
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:01,560
configurations a lot of devices when

109
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,000
they start up will if the config is

110
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,970
length<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero or if they know it's the</font>

111
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,160
first boot or if some magic happens they

112
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,790
will load a default configuration<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

113
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:16,290
is in running or in candidate and it's a

114
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,000
it's it's typically<font color="#E5E5E5"> just a static file</font>

115
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,650
that gets loaded<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point users in the</font>

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:25,010
right direction but we want to call that

117
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:25,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">out in the draft as as expected behavior</font>

118
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,919
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk through some of the</font>

119
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,310
examples i'm going to add and and make

120
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,169
sure because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think these because i</font>

121
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,570
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to i want to do two things i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

122
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:41,219
to use them as a mechanism of explaining

123
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:43,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the draft and also as a means of saying</font>

124
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:46,220
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what we're going to put in so</font>

125
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:48,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you're aware of the ongoing work</font>

126
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,040
the first example will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a just</font>

127
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,800
straightforward configuration a full

128
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,250
walkthrough from edifact config payload

129
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,580
into running intended applied and op

130
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:01,050
what you shall state what you can expect

131
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,479
in each of the databases how they'll

132
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,990
behave and well at the same time we'll

133
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,349
discuss the the perhaps an example of

134
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:13,650
inactive or<font color="#CCCCCC"> template or something to to</font>

135
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that more to give an example of</font>

136
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,039
that the the second example we discussed

137
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:23,910
was a system system control

138
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,820
configuration an example of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this would</font>

139
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,490
be a loopback interface where your l 0 0

140
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,010
shows up implicitly<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your</font>

141
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:36,000
configuration let's say it<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows up with</font>

142
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:36,360
a 127 2020 got one address whether the

143
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,429
user

144
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,740
were these e likes whether the user

145
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:43,348
likes it or not if you if you commit

146
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:45,779
you'll see that in applied and

147
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,000
operational state with the origin of

148
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:50,370
system if the user then steps into the

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,690
configuration and<font color="#E5E5E5"> adds creates</font>

00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:03,600
ero interface and adds say a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

153
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,160
knobs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then then that interface</font>

154
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,500
will now show up in running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

155
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:11,610
intended and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in applied an operational</font>

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:14,310
state and the origin will be static it's

157
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:20,760
a good example of of the different types

158
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:24,439
and how they how the how the flow

159
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,439
between the between the database happens

160
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,910
the third example would be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> BGP peer</font>

161
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,519
list this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's explicitly</font>

162
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:41,490
creating and running it's fully

163
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,550
populated in in applied and in op state

164
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:45,779
and what I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> by fully populated is no</font>

165
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:48,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">Leafs that aren't specified in the</font>

166
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:49,620
configuration will show up an

167
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:52,709
operational state for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a local</font>

168
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">address in a local port that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are left</font>

169
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:59,010
unconfigured will show up in in the

170
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:01,880
applied in the applied and operational

171
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,880
state configuration I

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:14,019
that's a typo these will show up in

173
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:18,649
operational state but not in applied

174
00:10:14,019 --> 00:10:20,540
because they'll show up as system and

175
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:24,829
system doesn't appear and<font color="#CCCCCC"> applied my</font>

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:26,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">mistake um Phil sorry Jason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Stern here I</font>

177
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:29,719
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the previous slide we might</font>

178
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:31,760
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a similar gotcha on the</font>

179
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,800
loopback interface right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't I</font>

180
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't does that one show open up applied</font>

181
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,880
or is it show up in system as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well just</font>

182
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:39,579
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry offers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> offer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state yes it is</font>

183
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,620
I've made that mistake here as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

184
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:48,620
so that'll be that'll this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will appear</font>

185
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:49,850
in operational state not applied so

186
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,329
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you go into your configuration</font>

187
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:56,750
you delete 55 peers and do a commit

188
00:10:52,329 --> 00:10:58,459
there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a time lag before those</font>

189
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,769
those peers are actually removed from

190
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:04,010
applied they'll they'll continue to to

191
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:06,170
exist you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see them as the</font>

192
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:09,380
as a responsible system subcomponent

193
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:12,019
steps up and does the work you know as

194
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,899
sockets closed and and resources are

195
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:24,019
released they will disappear<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

196
00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:28,130
applied and operational state the fourth

example it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a the fourth example</font>

running it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> no installed through so</font>

203
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:44,420
it doesn't appear<font color="#E5E5E5"> in applied or</font>

204
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,930
operational state when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you plug in your</font>

209
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,160
isn't created it will actually or it may

210
00:12:02,209 --> 00:12:07,369
depending on the data model create

211
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,709
additional additional objects like ports

213
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:15,459

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operational state at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that point</font>

215
00:12:15,459 --> 00:12:19,920
field replaceable unit yes please repeat

216
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:21,420
or go to the microphone the

217
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,310
the question is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fru stand for</font>

218
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:24,930
and through his field replaceable unit<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

219
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:35,268
think that's a standard industry term

220
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:35,269
but AC please use the microphone yeah

221
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:42,389
one other minor point that was made

222
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,990
during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the breakout was when you when</font>

223
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:47,130
you replace when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you insert or through</font>

224
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:49,649
statistics for that interface should be

225
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:52,850
reset to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero it should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a fresh new</font>

226
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:55,019
interface you shouldn't reclaim a

227
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:57,029
interface statistics should not persist

228
00:12:55,019 --> 00:13:02,070
from a previous incarnation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

229
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:04,579
object and the key here<font color="#E5E5E5"> which i think is</font>

230
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:08,310
made in this point is made in the yang

231
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:10,529
RFC as well the key<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't</font>

configuration state your configuration

234
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:16,740
validity should not depend on cruise in

the box if something can be removed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

236
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,910
inserted you you that's operational

237
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:27,540
state which should not affect the

these will appear regardless of

may<font color="#CCCCCC"> appear regardless of supporting</font>

245
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:49,310
ephemeral instances for example if you

246
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:51,690
make a lag interface with five members

247
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,849
five-member interfaces and none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the of the state of the freeze under</font>

00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:07,380
sorry the lag interface will appear in

applied and operational state of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

253
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:16,500
because it's configured it will appear

00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:19,319
in intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> and running and the Fitz</font>

example it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a dynamic data we</font>

256
00:14:19,319 --> 00:14:23,160
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want to step at this point</font>

257
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,630
into solving all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITRs problems</font>

258
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,329
but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to give a direction of of</font>

259
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,420
how this facility can be used to solve

260
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:32,769
those problems you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

261
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:35,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">about how data is merged between</font>

262
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:42,939
uh between dynamic data stores and

263
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:44,229
intended into active and I while writing

264
00:14:42,939 --> 00:14:47,589
the slide I think I came up with another

265
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:55,839
issue from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft in the original</font>

266
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:58,439
picture we had lines going into into our

267
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,480
data stream between active and

268
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:03,998
operational state and I don't believe

269
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's accurate because operational</font>

270
00:15:03,999 --> 00:15:10,029
state is this is a proper subset of

271
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:12,790
sorry active is a is a proper subset of

272
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:16,149
operational state so all the config true

273
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:25,988
knobs in operational state should appear

274
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:27,699
in active no nevermind I'm incorrect

275
00:15:25,989 --> 00:15:30,519
because we talked about origin nevermind

276
00:15:27,699 --> 00:15:35,769
<font color="#CCCCCC">all right so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not an issue do you</font>

277
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:39,610
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> imply me incentive sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah yep</font>

278
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:42,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'd sorry clearly I have not gotten over</font>

279
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:44,589
jet lag even now as I head back Phil do

280
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:47,230
you have a drawing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that later because</font>

281
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:50,199
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a drawing over that later uh</font>

282
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:51,309
no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we'll just the rest of us</font>

283
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,449
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be confused that the</font>

284
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:54,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation that just happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

285
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:56,498
but thanks see anyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I I simply used</font>

286
00:15:54,999 --> 00:16:05,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">the wrong term</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was I was staying</font>

287
00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:06,730
active and what I meant was applied so

288
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:08,559
we went through the issues list the

289
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,709
first issue was do we need an active

290
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:13,809
which is why it's stuck in my head do we

291
00:16:11,709 --> 00:16:16,569
need an active data store simply for the

292
00:16:13,809 --> 00:16:19,118
removal of inactive nodes and the

293
00:16:16,569 --> 00:16:22,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">consensus in the in the breakout session</font>

294
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:24,669
was that we do not that intended<font color="#E5E5E5"> serves</font>

295
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:28,449
that purpose and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it serves it without</font>

296
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:32,230
specifying how any any templating

297
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:35,559
mechanism or expansion interacts with

298
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:40,019
inactive and and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to</font>

299
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,019
ignore that until it's defined um

300
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:50,319
we talked a bit about the constraints on

301
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:52,569
applied and operational state in general

302
00:16:50,319 --> 00:16:57,819
there's a feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that these should</font>

303
00:16:52,569 --> 00:17:01,449
apply but the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be able to</font>

304
00:16:57,819 --> 00:17:03,160
send send data as accurately as possible

305
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:06,339
for example if there's a constraint that

306
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,859
says you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know many elements is seven and</font>

307
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:10,178
you actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> have one you should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

308
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:11,678
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have one you shouldn't feel</font>

309
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:14,319
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to make up six fake ones</font>

310
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:19,480
simply to satisfy<font color="#E5E5E5"> their the constraint</font>

311
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:21,250
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> data model the the particular one</font>

312
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,230
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we really that we really</font>

313
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,510
feel should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very very should</font>

314
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,240
is when because that that will break

315
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,760
expectations of what data is received if

316
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,400
you say you know these this this

317
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,890
augmentation happens when the interface

318
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:41,760
type is sonnet and you start showing

319
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:47,620
those that object on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet or or or</font>

320
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:49,840
any other interface type the the

321
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,729
receiver will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be quite surprised in</font>

322
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,840
general we want to apply the pastel

323
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:58,179
principle so be as accurate as you can

324
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,750
and beers relax as you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can on the</font>

325
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:03,490
receiving side robots in cisco and would

326
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,409
to think about it would also choice

327
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:11,890
statements fit again into that should

328
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:14,620
category do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think um they're not</font>

329
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:16,539
very similar to win yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

330
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:18,428
it's it's a it's a it's a sliding scale

331
00:18:16,539 --> 00:18:20,350
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to push people as far toward</font>

332
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:22,450
must as possible without actually saying

333
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:29,350
must yeah so these are very very very

334
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:33,130
shoulds we talked a bit so the next

335
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:35,289
issue is applied in rest comp and after

336
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,730
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it a bit we decided that</font>

337
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:37,929
that wasn't an issue we were going to

338
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,020
take on we were going to push it off to

339
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:42,520
the networking group in in general<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

340
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:44,379
just want to remark that there's a still

341
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,379
a disagreement about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goals of rest</font>

342
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:49,510
comp is it is it a another means of

343
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:52,210
getting to net comp or is it some sort

344
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:53,970
of easy button for programmers who want

345
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,210
an easy button

346
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:58,290
that's that's that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> really at this</font>

347
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,730
point we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should have an answer to that</font>

348
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:05,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't seem too so that's kind of</font>

349
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:09,030
surprising<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks um anybody</font>

350
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:12,680
have any comments or questions all right

351
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many people have read the draft a</font>

352
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,669
good number and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many people would</font>

353
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,920
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull for consensus on adopting</font>

354
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:23,790
the draft so how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would like</font>

355
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> adopt the draft a good number</font>

356
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:28,680
interesting that's approximately the

357
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:31,620
same but it's more than who have read

358
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,660
the draft I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows the</font>

359
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:35,370
appetite for a solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this problem</font>

360
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,980
and we can't see the right hands raised

361
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:42,750
on me dekho but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I assume okay so we'll</font>

362
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:48,930
take the call for adoption to the

363
00:19:42,750 --> 00:20:11,670
mailing<font color="#CCCCCC"> list Thank You</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Phil then I think</font>

364
00:19:48,930 --> 00:20:15,300
you're up next hi Dan Bogdanovich on

365
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:19,140
behalf of the design team presenting the

366
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:23,310
work the update on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing they've</font>

367
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,520
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working since the Berlin IDF since</font>

368
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:30,389
then we added three new members to the

369
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,120
design team urban areas jus<font color="#E5E5E5"> Fangio and</font>

370
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:35,760
Ian Jenn zoo so kudos<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them into the</font>

371
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,580
new work and energy<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're bringing to</font>

372
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,940
the team next slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> please give a</font>

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,920
clicker no straight down<font color="#E5E5E5"> with him oh</font>

376
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:56,280
it's black on black yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it will</font>

377
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:58,290
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a short recap of the status and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> draft</font>

378
00:20:56,280 --> 00:21:00,899
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion and then if we have</font>

379
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:04,770
time at the end we might go for some

380
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:07,920
examples the current work is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

381
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:09,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">have three drafts now in process</font>

382
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,330
that from a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> draft that that was</font>

383
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,600
that you were working on we have split

384
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:18,899
it up into three different drafts and

385
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:21,510
some of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts are moving forward</font>

386
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,600
but we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> something in depending on</font>

387
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:27,750
the Upstate and you know the operational

388
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:30,330
state and we added<font color="#CCCCCC"> some new conventions</font>

389
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,060
and we are planning to expand on the

390
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,080
model classification draft that has been

391
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:42,210
done by some other authors which I was

392
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:45,000
one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so the what when we started</font>

393
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:47,340
originally we started with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> metamodel</font>

394
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,950
for the whole device and as we were

395
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">building that we were realizing that the</font>

396
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,210
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> build inside</font>

397
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,280
this one graph was in or getting too

398
00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:00,170
complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we split it up into</font>

399
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,720
three drafts so the basic essentially

400
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:09,170
draft the device model draft how to

401
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:12,390
organize is essentially a very simple

402
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:16,140
draft which says just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basics</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

403
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:19,920
model and then the logics of that are in

404
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:22,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> eleanii and in the NI so the two</font>

405
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,600
drafts the logical network element and

406
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:28,139
the network instance they are providing

407
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,600
the how you can build administrative

408
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:37,410
domain elements and just how to do

409
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:41,429
routing and switching separation<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

410
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:45,120
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> part is when we were creating</font>

411
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:47,910
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LME model and the NI model the idea</font>

412
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is that you get a basic object and</font>

413
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:52,230
then you're assigning resources to that

414
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:56,399
object because we have to assign

415
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,500
multiple and we don't know what the user

416
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,870
within the administrative the domain

417
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,060
wants to run what protocols what

418
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:05,939
interfaces have to be assigned and not

419
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:09,770
all Ella knees are you know created the

420
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,510
same we had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out how to mount</font>

421
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,490
external modules into that module that

422
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,550
has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> created for that we have been</font>

423
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">using scheme amount and for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the</font>

424
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:21,659
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases the scheme amount is answering</font>

425
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:24,330
the requirements but for some of them

426
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:28,230
we had to come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some new ideas</font>

427
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:37,379
and for that we you know we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

428
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:39,270
proposal<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the key requirements</font>

429
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:42,780
you know essentially that<font color="#E5E5E5"> any data</font>

430
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:45,629
module can be instantiated within the

431
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:47,490
logical network element this is this the

432
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:50,190
key requirement because once the logical

433
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:52,950
network element is created it has a like

434
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:55,050
a system ID has a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic system</font>

435
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:58,050
management information so since you

436

456
00:24:54,900 --> 00:25:00,300

<font color="#CCCCCC">Network for most network services except</font>

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware specific resources like</font>

459
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,370

460
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:13,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">can we map scheme amount and interface</font>

461
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:15,330
without because that's a shared resource

462
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:19,470
and then how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how to share</font>

463
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:22,340
that resource between two administrative

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:22,340
domains

465
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:32,770
as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are mounting all the modules</font>

466
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:39,580
relative to the mount point so once we

467
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:41,080
have created<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you go back</font>

468
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:43,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous slide 17 because you</font>

469
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:44,379
skipped over the thing about our PC

470
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:47,320
operations and I was just<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to point</font>

471
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:50,320
out that actions and nested

472
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:53,020
notifications will just work they just

473
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,480
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a different path to</font>

474
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:58,060
the node in it they can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in</font>

475
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,650
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're relocatable our pcs are</font>

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:02,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">always at the top level and they're</font>

477
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:04,690
always going to be a problem because the

478
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:08,350
top level you want to shift down into

479
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:10,690
the eleanii but actions if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you so if you</font>

480
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:16,750
don't use our<font color="#CCCCCC"> PC and use action instead</font>

481
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:20,590
then then this would work well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

482
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:23,290
got one more question to this slide do

483
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,169
expect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that all modules will be</font>

484
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:28,510
available in advance in the moment that

485
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:31,210
you construct the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lake a model or</font>

486
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:34,120
before you start provisioning the

487
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:36,630
virtual<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to the ideal that they</font>

488
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:40,419
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> all available but from the</font>

489
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:43,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">real-life use cases dead folk definitely</font>

490
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:45,700
we will have to see how because people

491
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,280
might add modules later after the

492
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">eleanii has been accentuated and then</font>

493
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:52,570
how to add those new modules that has

494
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,700
been created because the question is how

495
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:57,100
once you create an eleanii and you have

496
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,680
a new service that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add to</font>

497
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:02,020
that eleanii how will you add it to it

498
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:04,150
will it be can you edit your live

499
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:08,050
eleanii or will<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have to destroy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

500
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:10,030
then you know rebuild it<font color="#CCCCCC"> lata before you</font>

501
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,830
go away<font color="#E5E5E5"> two things was your question</font>

502
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:16,270
about school amount in general or about

503
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:18,669
the LNA and I usage of scheme amount no

504
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:22,030
in scheme amount in general we assume

505
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:25,960
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there will be use cases similar to</font>

506
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:30,010
pier mount very really the<font color="#CCCCCC"> schemas is</font>

507
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,530
supplied dynamically at runtime<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

508
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">great what I was wondering whether it is</font>

509
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:38,200
it could be also this case or if you

510
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,230
really assume that you can just you know

511
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,419
everything in advance<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have to</font>

512
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,000
for both before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go the the prior</font>

513
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:48,210
comment from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andy was really a scheme</font>

514
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,890
amount comment not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a eleanii right this</font>

515
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,020
is mentioned in the scheme amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob</font>

516
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:54,780
that essentially RP she's become a

517
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:58,139
action that's that's what fear for it is

518
00:27:54,780 --> 00:28:02,990
so that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so any I don't know</font>

519
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:02,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you heard that answer but thanks yeah</font>

520
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:10,470
so the scheme amount xpath issues for

521
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,240
the mainly what we've seen so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for</font>

522
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:14,910
interfaces which are shared resources

523
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,150
because the physical interfaces belong

524
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:20,910
to the top level device to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top level</font>

525
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:27,049
eleanii and from there we have to assign

526
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:30,660
them to the child LME's based on how the

527
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:32,400
based on administrative decisions how

528
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,830
many interfaces will be assigned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a</font>

529
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,630
particular eleanii is it one or one

530
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:42,418
hundred we<font color="#E5E5E5"> never know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

531
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:44,700
the device<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know capacity so we have</font>

532
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,510
you know essentially some ideas how to

533
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:53,220
solve that we've been looking into the

534
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:57,419
HTTP protocol in order you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how how</font>

535
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,400
to do that it's the mod rewrite and if

536
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:01,890
somebody else have some other ideas how

537
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,690
to do that it this would be you know for

538
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:08,910
discussion and we discussed the de la de

539
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:11,780
edad<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kosh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that there is some</font>

540
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,169
confusion about terminology here because

541
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:20,129
even if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you use absolute xpath like</font>

542
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:23,220
xpath it means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if it is</font>

543
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:25,950
absolute that it's really confined to

544
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:28,590
them mounted<font color="#CCCCCC"> itit rewrite so that the</font>

545
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,010
route that address by by a slash in

546
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:34,080
XPath expression is is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mount</font>

547
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,480
point so there is no current of a

548
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,549
relative to the mount point<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

549
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,880
what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are talking about is to either</font>

550
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:45,000
and then some notation how to get out of

551
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:47,640
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> mouth jail so to say and reach</font>

552
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that's outside or which i</font>

553
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,850
think is maybe but

554
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:58,300
approach that Lou suggested to invent

555
00:29:54,850 --> 00:30:01,510
some way how the mounted betatry can

556
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:04,899
borrow stuff from like some kind of

557
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:07,960
symbolic link or things like that so we

558
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:10,270
have to really discuss this so we have

559
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:15,420
to always there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some complications</font>

560
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:17,889
there because we have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

561
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:20,380
administrative rights to access this

562
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,970
information as you're going down<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

563
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,440
if you're passing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're creating</font>

564
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:25,330
administrative domain within the

565
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,150
administrative domain but it doesn't

566
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,649
then also pass the administrative rights

567
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:31,600
from the upper domain to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> lower</font>

568
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,580
domain the lower box can be completely

569
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,679
black box and you have them to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

570
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:37,330
that the you cannot read from one to the

571
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,070
other and what you essentially do<font color="#E5E5E5"> code</font>

572
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:48,310
you can't go reading from top to down

573
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:52,080
and vice versa from down to the top so

574
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:55,120
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Upstate we are essentially</font>

575
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,210
tracking what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> net mod design team is</font>

576
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:02,370
doing in many places we are leaving the

577
00:30:58,210 --> 00:31:07,090
Upstate you know as the placeholder and

578
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:08,830
based on that what the the design team

579
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:11,080
will come up with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recommendations</font>

580

581
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:18,179
essentially follow up on that so on the

582
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:28,959
now so essentially the just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one this the</font>

583
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:31,510
RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 60 87 I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the from the</font>

584
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:38,080
last one this wasn't updated I think

585
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:40,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was power I think the so routing</font>

586
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,280
config is now published yes so that that

587
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,130
so there's impoverishes that's published

588
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:50,770
and sixty eighty seven<font color="#CCCCCC"> basis is in the</font>

589
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:52,390
pipeline oh oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so in that case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

590
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:54,790
know based on this new recommendations

591
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:57,310
you know when they<font color="#E5E5E5"> come out we will end</font>

592
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:59,260
with the you know if this will as the

593
00:31:57,310 --> 00:32:01,649
work world process on that part will be

594
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,490
upgrading between the versions the

595
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:11,920
drafts that we are

596
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:14,980
working on so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the conventions this is</font>

597
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:17,710
you know the kudos to the new guys that

598
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:20,650
have joined us and they have been

599

<font color="#E5E5E5">working on that on that part I am a</font>

600
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,960
little bit weak because I be no read it

601

but on going<font color="#E5E5E5"> into details if you ask me</font>

I'll have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the if somebody from</font>

00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:43,300
details on that part but essentially you

607
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,530
know what we have done is we initially

608
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:49,870
or what the team did is they the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial</font>

609
00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:52,899
set was defined and it was put into a

00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,669
draft so getting feedback from the

611
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,070
working group would be appreciated and

612
00:32:54,670 --> 00:33:02,440

certain a typedef you can search type

00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:40,450
that on the entire set<font color="#E5E5E5"> of young models</font>

that would be great<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

627
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,479
happens thanks for the comments since

628
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:01,090
you mentioned this a scope must be

629
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:04,690
perfect<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what go to the address you</font>

00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:08,799
mentioned the coop broadcasting address

632
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:20,260
remember you have a comment about this a

633
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:21,909
mighty fast I address so type therefore

634
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,520
i typed that for multicast this is just

635

639
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,050
question should we include that there

640
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:37,359
now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the answer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

642
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,670
it's consistent across all yang models

643
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:47,460
if not consistent discuss with the

choose a lime module but we will also

658
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:44,590
perhaps we can discuss it whether it is

notice I said please provide feedback

00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:51,550
and desire that the additions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

662
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,750
i'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure i think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same type</font>

663
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,370
i'm not sure but even if it's a

664
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:56,920
different even if it is a different type

665
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:58,420
i think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hold your are you</font>

666
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,640

you saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need to figure out</font>

669
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:08,399
where it goes

670
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:10,770
oh oh yes so she fought yesterday it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

funding the lime the working group so we

673
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:20,490
don't strongly own intuitive fun here

674
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:22,740
and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> too funny in the land so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

675
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:26,250
just want to reuse the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and it also</font>

can defend unawares at the pen<font color="#CCCCCC"> fatigue</font>

678
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,570
systems and routing a design team yeah i

679
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:38,550
think what then was said is for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

680
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:41,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">be useful we have to move fast on it so</font>

681
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:44,130
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh we can't make it be a bottleneck</font>

682
00:36:41,369 --> 00:36:47,030
for the other models that we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

683
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the initial set and standardize them</font>

684
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:51,150
but but if so if you could move fast on

685
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,049
what things you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be common to</font>

686
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:57,780
others and send them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us the logical</font>

687
00:36:55,050 --> 00:37:02,130
I'm whoppers yes yes i like to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

688
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,830
and um like to contribute<font color="#CCCCCC"> assists 22 or</font>

689
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:06,990
whatever what kind of young pastors<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

690
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:08,460
that's great thank you so one

691
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:12,779
interesting thing here is to note that

692
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">this document is well it's coming from</font>

693
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,500
the routing yang design team their

694
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,869
product is aimed at the routing working

695
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,670
group so that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's some</font>

696
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:23,310
common types that are headed there

697
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,619
rather than here<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint I</font>

698
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:28,080
just want them defined and I don't it's

699
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:29,310
not so important to me where what model

700
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,830
they come in but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure</font>

701
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the group is aware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> common</font>

702
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:35,640
type def<font color="#CCCCCC"> SAR going on there and I want</font>

703
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure our ad doesn't want to</font>

704
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,290
object and my co-chair<font color="#CCCCCC"> too of course</font>

705
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think time check you know</font>

706
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,480
getting three minutes yeah that's a

707
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:47,540
fight so the on the model classification

708
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:51,030
it grew out you know from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

709
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:53,100
organizational model that you know we

710
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:57,869
were discussing<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the last couple of</font>

711
00:37:53,100 --> 00:38:00,299
meetings there is a draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this past</font>

712
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:02,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> discuss mode no classification but</font>

713
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:04,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was just you know giving basic</font>

714
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,540
guidelines and the idea there was that

715
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:11,940
the developer of the modules are able to

716
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,890
classify because they know the intention

717
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:16,260
of the module so they can do a basic

718
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,990
classification is the device model

719
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,480
or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service module but then</font>

720
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:24,720
there was more classification needed

721
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:28,290
because in order really to be able to

722
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,859
search the ideas that Chris Hobbs came

723
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:34,800
up with this to add tags that the author

724
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:36,960
can bet you know can add tax to the

725
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">module and based on that be able to</font>

726
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,010
forget it better classification as well

727
00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:46,320
in a better search ability on that the

728
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:48,420
dist<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding mechanism there are some</font>

729
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,820
different thoughts but some of them is

730
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be completely no just on structured</font>

731
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,230
string and the other one is to put at

732
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:59,009
least you know some guidelines on how to

733
00:38:55,230 --> 00:39:01,590
do it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> allah leave majority of the of</font>

734
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:04,620
the attack to be privately constructed

735
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:06,720
because as you know each<font color="#E5E5E5"> librarian might</font>

736
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,480
have in their own way how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

737
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,370
structuring of the of the books or the

738
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,620
data what they are keeping so for that

739
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:16,259
reason you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to make</font>

740
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:18,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">it flexible for the developers that they</font>

741
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:22,320
can or within a certain organization

742
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:28,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they can create a string according</font>

743
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:32,790
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> their internal needs uh yeah yeah</font>

744
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:36,180
this this one used to say remember

745
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:37,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">second this so there are more details</font>

746
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">here but come to the routing working</font>

747
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:42,000
group yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's they're gonna be</font>

748
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:44,490
presented there yeah because this was

749
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:55,820
like the examples ND yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

750
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:55,819
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> it slide over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right well huh</font>

751
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:23,410
hi I'm mischief Emilio this draft is by

752
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,450
Helen chin and she cannot be here today

753
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:34,200
so i<font color="#CCCCCC"> justá--</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the print edition</font>

754
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:37,450
instead and so we have some become

755
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:42,430
specific specification requirement here

756
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:45,788
each namespace in the model need to be

757
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:48,970
unique color blue and also the module

758
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:53,589
name and the sub-module<font color="#E5E5E5"> names I'll need</font>

759
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:58,419
to be unique so<font color="#CCCCCC"> what do we do is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

760
00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:59,920
issue currently I'm sorry I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry</font>

761
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,819
before you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the search one let</font>

762
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,259
every know at the end of this

763
00:41:00,819 --> 00:41:05,049
presentation when I asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> for call for</font>

764
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:08,079
adoption<font color="#CCCCCC"> so please pay attention thanks</font>

765
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:10,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah so this is a the draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was up</font>

766
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,930
attended here before and also called

767
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:17,890
comments so there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some revisions and</font>

768
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:20,499
updated after that so the the drives

769
00:41:17,890 --> 00:41:25,690
trying to solve the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how do</font>

770
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:28,439
we do the naming so<font color="#E5E5E5"> currently and many</font>

771
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:32,289
companies are writing their own

772
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:38,230
enterprise models and with the different

773
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:41,980
ways some<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube URL some user you are</font>

774
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:45,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">in and each has its own convention so</font>

775
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:50,440
there's a risk to hide the name conflict

776
00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:56,710
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to define</font>

777
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:58,839
a top-level name so then after this

778
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:02,230
top-level names and that each

779
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:05,319
organization can refine the name and

780
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:09,970
define the sub system for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

781
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:13,029
naming convention so the whatsits

782
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:13,770
top-level name we can still discuss and

783
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:17,760
can come

784
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:24,270
but here the proposed kind of Apollo's

785
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:27,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">18s reverse it penis so here the grammar</font>

786
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:30,030
would be like this so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> top-level you</font>

787
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:33,600
have this keyword so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would register</font>

788
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:38,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> trainer and after that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

789
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:40,740
reserved a dee-nice string and then the

790
00:42:38,610 --> 00:42:48,410
organization can put whatever they want

791
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:51,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">afterward so he example would be say</font>

792
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:56,850
some company you can I become company

793
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:58,470
want to have their own ospf model so

794
00:42:56,850 --> 00:43:02,400
what they do would be after there's a

795
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:04,529
top-level name they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> com example and</font>

796
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:12,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">then put the young name there that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

797
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:18,030
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> so oh that's it so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a the</font>

798
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:21,020
request for this a name registration was

799
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:24,480
written in another draft so<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

800
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:27,180
revealed so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically we come to the</font>

801
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group trying to get consensus so</font>

802
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:34,710
we need to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> this uh because uh many</font>

803
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:37,190
informations implementations are going

804
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:39,750
so we would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be better to hide this a</font>

805
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:43,230
result soon so that they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

806
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:45,560
laning right<font color="#CCCCCC"> mahesh cisco systems so</font>

807
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:48,180
when you talk about modules are these

808
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:51,480
vendor specific modules or these are

809
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:53,730
modules that are extensions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of standard</font>

810
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:58,260
models which models are we talking

811
00:43:53,730 --> 00:44:00,150
aren't specifically about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the UH so</font>

812
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:02,880
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the vendor specific</font>

813
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,580
modules buttery from vendor trying to

814
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comment is a standard</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> amodio then</font>

815
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,460
can be falling<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the disc</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Academy</font>

816
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:11,820
anyway so they said your own

817
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:14,100
augmentation so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're don't want to</font>

818
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,720
standardize nobody or care so you have

819
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:17,670
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own naming convention let's hop to</font>

820
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,520
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you're clearly saying that</font>

821
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:24,950
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is for augmentations of standard</font>

822
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:24,950
yang models that's where this applies

823
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:32,740
or vendor specific models yeah yeah

824
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:35,890
either way yeah that's right oh so if it

825
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,589
refers to vendor specific models we have

826
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,060
a problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sense that what happens</font>

827
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:44,640
to existing models that have already

828
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:46,720
been published by a particular vendor we

829
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,790
will not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through a</font>

830
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:55,149
namespace change without impacting RSS

831
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:57,520
you we go for example has already

832
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:00,160
published models that customers are

833
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:02,500
using and if you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> us to change</font>

834
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,870
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> name it's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to impact I assist</font>

835
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:07,570
you at this point it's good point so

836
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:09,549
this is limited<font color="#CCCCCC"> to new modules that were</font>

837
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:12,730
vision zero type modules right right

838
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:14,710
then they'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be up to cisco's of product</font>

839
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,720
planning anger so if you want to

840
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:22,510
continuous<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're the old one that's a</font>

841
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:24,480
new one<font color="#E5E5E5"> for this reason um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think</font>

842
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:27,370
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably want to make it clear</font>

843
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:30,220
what I mean I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to</font>

844
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:32,350
just leave it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco or anyone to</font>

845
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,720
choose which one it is applicable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

846
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:37,720
regenerate is not applicable for I think

847
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">you might want to specify what are you</font>

848
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:44,529
doing now um we have I can bring up the

849
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:48,490
specific string but it's suddenly not

850
00:45:44,530 --> 00:45:51,340
this format<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there a convention that</font>

851
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:53,200
you're using that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be compatible</font>

852
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,210
with this and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could add a</font>

853
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,609
backward compatibility section that

854
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:58,720
describes how to be compatible but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

855
00:45:57,610 --> 00:46:06,430
we also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out if there's</font>

856
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:07,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">some commonality there right so backward</font>

857
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:11,279
compatibility okay that'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

858
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:13,930
interesting to see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Howard Mac</font>

859
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,090
matches into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the existing string let me</font>

860
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:18,669
just look at what we have and i can tell

861
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:25,630
you whether but to tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you yes cisco</font>

862
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:30,400
has defined a set of your ends that all

863
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:35,560
our models are supposed to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rob</font>

864
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:37,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Wilson assistant Mike so Tim Carey just</font>

865
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,578
to let you know we've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same</font>

866
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,950
thing with the BBF we've

867
00:46:39,579 --> 00:46:44,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I are we standardized what we put</font>

868
00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,239
for yang modules for our templates and

869
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:50,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">we actually just do it a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font>

870
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:53,140
different we we use the we used we place

871
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:55,660
we don't we don't do yang then the

872
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:57,279
company<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do the company than the yang</font>

873
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,558
so we just kind of swap those two

874
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:03,609
positions around a bit so it's you<font color="#CCCCCC"> RN</font>

875
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,229
you know BBF yang then whatever we do

876
00:47:03,609 --> 00:47:09,788
right well<font color="#CCCCCC"> here since you already have</font>

877
00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:11,919
PBF right so and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find so</font>

878
00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:14,380
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the dredge recipe / here is a</font>

photo company they don't I'm register

880
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:21,670
anything so at the top level will have

881
00:47:17,019 --> 00:47:24,189
potential conflicts so words that

882
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:26,619
conflict come in I don't understand

883
00:47:24,190 --> 00:47:30,039
after you are in say you<font color="#CCCCCC"> you may have</font>

884
00:47:26,619 --> 00:47:33,219
you are in comm the cisco and another

885
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:36,160
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some other organization you</font>

886
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:39,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">think you are an income dioxin out such</font>

887
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,879
then you may have you are your us you

888
00:47:39,309 --> 00:47:45,009
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> a dt the whatever its sorted because</font>

889
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,799
you can't do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> right so here this</font>

890
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:50,410
is a there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules here so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

891
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:55,749
we only trying to suggest a top-level

892
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:57,578
token so you're quibbling to your PBS we

893
00:47:55,749 --> 00:47:59,828
as a fine you already happy b i<font color="#E5E5E5"> ieft</font>

894
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:03,009
also fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll stand the model following</font>

895
00:47:59,829 --> 00:48:05,229
you are an ATF<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so you're my top</font>

896
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:09,039
level is to indicate that this is an<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

897
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:10,989
eat here what's it what's what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> at all</font>

898

<font color="#E5E5E5">double</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> august under the model</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> currently</font>

899
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:15,699
started over you are an ietf so which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

900
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:18,729
already unique we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we already have</font>

901
00:48:15,699 --> 00:48:21,130
our own space<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay for PDF you are the</font>

902
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:24,999
how you are NPPF you are fine also right

903
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:32,199
but for the private enterprise model we

904
00:48:24,999 --> 00:48:33,968
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any way to start so instead</font>

905
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:35,469
of our darkness or yang there could be a

906
00:48:33,969 --> 00:48:36,489
potential collision because people are

907
00:48:35,469 --> 00:48:39,579
just choosing whatever they want to

908
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:41,229
choose so he's providing some structure

909
00:48:39,579 --> 00:48:42,940
here so that there's to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> conflict</font>

910
00:48:41,229 --> 00:48:46,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright so this is only going to deal</font>

911
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,009
with with with non with organizations

912
00:48:46,299 --> 00:48:49,869
that have not standardized there you are

913
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:52,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right I just want to make</font>

914
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:54,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure yeah so</font>

915
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:56,230
Rob Wilson Cisco so my question is just

916
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:59,230
clarify one is is this an optional thing

917
00:48:56,230 --> 00:49:04,660
to use or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it mandatory that all</font>

918
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:08,310
modules accuses come forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> I say up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

919
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:12,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it's your proposal so popolo</font>

920
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:18,400
before the event was a experimental<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

921
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:19,810
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know but so my question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

922
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,310
easiest just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scheme this is a</font>

923
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:22,660
recommendation should do it this way you

924
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,430
don't have to if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing a</font>

925
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,450
different way that works that's fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

926
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:28,029
think it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to be a</font>

927
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,549
recommendation and that no in fact the

928
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,410
existing namespace using HTTP would

929
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,960
still be valid but you know there'd be

930
00:49:32,410 --> 00:49:37,660
as sixty eighty seven is is that would

931
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,490
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> suggest people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to use your n</font>

932
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,080
because it doesn't have the appearance

933
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:43,569
of a URL that you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> click on and</font>

934
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:45,549
resolve to a page it's better that way

935
00:49:43,570 --> 00:49:47,860
yep but of course the Cisco or others

936
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:49,570
you know stos are using your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ends of</font>

937
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:51,190
their own that's fine as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so I</font>

938
00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:54,700
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> support that so again</font>

939
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:57,400
just a recommendation yep that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not by</font>

940
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:01,330
the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's informational right now it</font>

941
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:04,750
is what how it's written<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my age</font>

942
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:06,840
cisco systems so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm glad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's going to</font>

943
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:09,460
be a recommendation not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a requirement</font>

944
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,050
because i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just checked we haven't</font>

945
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:14,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">decided what we're doing but this is an</font>

946
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:17,260
individual all right let's hope that's

947
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:20,590
the direction they go into but um just

948
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:22,660
an update<font color="#E5E5E5"> on so we use HTTP so it's</font>

949
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:25,840
we're using a URL we are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even using</font>

950
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:33,220
ND /<font color="#CCCCCC"> URM at this point yeah let that</font>

951
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:38,320
follow in the URL category you're done

952
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:39,939
oh so you great um so as I mentioned

953
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,640
beginning the presentation we'd like to

954
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:44,350
do a call for adoption but first how

955
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,450
many people have read this craft before

956
00:50:44,350 --> 00:50:49,240
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask that question how many think this</font>

957
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:51,419
is a useful function whether or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

958
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,410
specified<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether it's this draft or</font>

959
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:57,040
different craft how many think that this

960
00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:58,359
type of function is useful so that seems

961
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a really good number it's more than</font>

962
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:01,890
the Upstate discretion

963
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:07,549
Phil<font color="#CCCCCC"> Schaefer Juniper Networks I guess</font>

964
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:12,049
I'm I guess I'm really Boston because

965
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:16,460
what problem is it really solving I mean

966
00:51:12,049 --> 00:51:21,259
what is the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that given that we</font>

967
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:24,950
have what I guess that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I did what from</font>

968
00:51:21,259 --> 00:51:28,519
me I see it is it's giving ad conflicted

969
00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:30,618
namespace for private modules that

970
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:32,479
doesn't look like a clickable URL look

971
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:33,950
the latter parts the more important part

972
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">of it that it doesn't look like a</font>

973
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:39,589
clickable URL that you can resolve to a

974
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:41,209
page it does not<font color="#E5E5E5"> show given that given</font>

975
00:51:39,589 --> 00:51:43,308
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these are you our eyes and their</font>

976
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:44,809
and their opaque strings the fact that

977
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:48,970
it might point to something useful is

978
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:48,970
something useful not something unusual

979
00:51:51,309 --> 00:51:57,349
well apparently<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous present any</font>

980
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:59,119
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the original presenter said that</font>

981
00:51:57,349 --> 00:52:00,650
there was issues that people were always

982
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking that there it would resolve to</font>

983
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:04,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">the page and they never did and there</font>

984
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,420
were complaints about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so we're trying</font>

985
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:07,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">to resolve those complaints the money</font>

986
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:08,859
they also can't have potential name

987
00:52:07,279 --> 00:52:12,680
conflicts right so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> ought to</font>

988
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">independently so it's a if you're going</font>

989
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:19,578
to URL categories so you how when you

990
00:52:17,779 --> 00:52:24,859
checked you I all not conflicting with

991
00:52:19,579 --> 00:52:29,329
some other URLs then so if it's a if

992
00:52:24,859 --> 00:52:32,109
it's a if it can so assume<font color="#CCCCCC"> ibly the</font>

993
00:52:29,329 --> 00:52:34,309
string the string follows the URL

994
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:37,130
standard and there's a element that is

995
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:39,589
the host name or the domain name of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

996
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:41,930
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> pub well that model may not have</font>

997
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:43,400
domain name so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I write a young model</font>

998
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:46,868
not necessary<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to have a domain</font>

999
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:50,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">name you're right but if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't then</font>

1000
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:53,089
then your father whittled so think of it

1001
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:56,839
this way the proposal is for the case

1002
00:52:53,089 --> 00:52:58,788
that you are using a namespace that

1003
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:02,299
begins you RN and it's a private

1004
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:05,450
namespace here's a format that must be

1005
00:53:02,299 --> 00:53:07,819
followed is that something may be no

1006
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:09,890
must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> followed if you start with you</font>

1007
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:11,749
RN and doing private if we go down this

1008
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:14,749
path<font color="#E5E5E5"> that'll be a must is that something</font>

1009
00:53:11,749 --> 00:53:16,549
that's worthwhile so you can still start

1010
00:53:14,749 --> 00:53:16,910
with HTTP there's nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> wrong with</font>

1011
00:53:16,549 --> 00:53:20,470
that

1012
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:23,480
it's because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're not viewing aur n</font>

1013
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:26,660
i'm not i'm not advocating i'm stating

1014
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:30,500
what the options are is that it would

1015
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:32,089
that be acceptable to you or from your

1016
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,450
perspective ni can't imagine anyone

1017
00:53:32,090 --> 00:53:36,680
using this but that must be me as this

1018
00:53:35,450 --> 00:53:38,600
this would this goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the bottom</font>

1019
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:40,640
into the bucket of things<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't care</font>

1020
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,839
about and things that aren't useful<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1021
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,370
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure i wasn't</font>

1022
00:53:41,840 --> 00:53:47,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">missing something and it seems like I'm</font>

1023
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:49,520
not it seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a class of</font>

1024
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:51,950
people who care about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and there's a</font>

1025
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:53,960
class that don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's the way I</font>

1026
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:57,500
read it the question is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is there enough</font>

1027
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:59,510
in the working group who read it that as

1028
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,630
useful that we should pursue it as a

1029
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:05,120
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do agree that we</font>

1030
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:08,870
shouldn't we shouldn't end can't break

1031
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:13,490
current usage<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay my hey Cisco Systems</font>

1032
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:16,430
so is the fact that if a URL leads to a

1033
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,859
link that returns a 404 I mean isn't

1034
00:54:16,430 --> 00:54:21,259
that some extent<font color="#CCCCCC"> renders problem to fix</font>

1035
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:23,000
if they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really fix it I mean is</font>

1036
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:25,910
that a big issue personally I agree with

1037
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">you but that's that's my personal</font>

1038
00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:34,520
position not chair position so again how

1039
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:36,670
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that this type of solution is</font>

1040
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:42,770
something we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good excuse me</font>

1041
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:44,330
working on is this a problem we should

1042
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:48,320
be worked out dressing in the working

1043
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:52,069
group so it's less people but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1044
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,950
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> still a reasonable number who many</font>

1045
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:56,540
how many think it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> completely useless</font>

1046
00:54:54,950 --> 00:55:00,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm gonna ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a third question after</font>

1047
00:54:56,540 --> 00:55:03,890
this completely uninterested so it's

1048
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:07,250
slightly less how many think that it's a

1049
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:12,109
mistake for us to go down this path they

1050
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:17,030
have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um so Kent if you want to</font>

1051
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:21,010
poll or do you want good good<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

1052
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:21,010
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have read this draft</font>

1053
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:29,350
okay and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many people would like to</font>

1054
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">adopt this as a working group item</font>

1055
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:37,870
okay good number can't see anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1056
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:39,340
me<font color="#CCCCCC"> dekho um will confirm the adoption on</font>

1057
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:50,170
the list<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we have a</font>

1058
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:52,900
reasonable number on both of those all

1059
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:55,330
right last person now this one's gonna

1060
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:59,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good smell this one's a little</font>

1061
00:55:55,330 --> 00:56:03,460
unusual in terms of what we normally do

1062
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:09,420
this isn't a proposal but more of a

1063
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:12,550
report on some experience of a

1064
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:15,100
implementation as a chair I'm a little

1065
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:18,490
uncomfortable that the culprit name is

1066
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:20,230
being mentioned so much but I still

1067
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:23,709
think it's valuable information to hear

1068
00:56:20,230 --> 00:56:25,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">about an implementation so next time you</font>

1069
00:56:23,710 --> 00:56:27,280
do an implementation report<font color="#E5E5E5"> just drop</font>

1070
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:33,700
off your company name from melt all over

1071
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:35,230
the place oh you changed it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font>

1072
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,319
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the first light now all right</font>

1073
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:44,020
sorry never<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind thank you for</font>

1074
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:46,780
anticipating my comment thanks to the

1075
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:48,280
chair into my age for evenly the

1076
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:50,710
opportunity to present<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco's</font>

1077
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:58,270
implementation pretty like fun little

1078
00:56:50,710 --> 00:57:01,870
closer um ok so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the agenda of this slide</font>

1079
00:56:58,270 --> 00:57:03,790
is that we'll talk about I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ETFs rule</font>

1080
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:07,270
name handling and Cisco's rule name

1081
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:09,160
Hanley and we will see how this pans out

1082
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:12,490
in all the Edit config operations and

1083
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:15,730
then we'll see how Cisco augmented the

1084
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:19,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">IETF interface model to accommodate the</font>

1085
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:19,590
application of the ACL on the interface

1086
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:37,740
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the problem here is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1087
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:40,589
sequence key in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF model for an</font>

1088
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:42,899
ace is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alphanumeric string well it's</font>

1089
00:57:40,589 --> 00:57:49,290
not the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF model defines it</font>

1090
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:51,990
that way in iOS XR in / ace we

1091
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:55,770
configured the ace on a sequence number

1092
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:59,848
so we had a problem on how we map the

1093
00:57:55,770 --> 00:58:01,800
rule name to a sequence number now this

1094
00:57:59,849 --> 00:58:04,349
was a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because all our data</font>

1095
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:06,599
structures as system data stores

1096
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:09,420
everything index it by a sequence number

1097
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:11,190
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to change things to</font>

1098
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:14,880
accommodate an alphanumeric string it

1099
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:16,770
really became an issue so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> came up</font>

1100
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:19,950
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> an algorithm on how we reuse</font>

1101
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cisco's current implementation and we</font>

1102
00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:25,919
accommodate the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF alphanumeric string</font>

1103
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:29,848
as well so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are four steps to the</font>

1104
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:33,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level algorithm the the first step</font>

1105
00:58:29,849 --> 00:58:36,240
is that when we get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Yank data tree</font>

1106
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:39,240
request an edit config request we first

1107
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,930
look up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MSS DB data store to find</font>

1108
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:44,609
the existing ACL and we create a

1109
00:58:41,930 --> 00:58:47,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">on-the-fly data structure to represent</font>

1110
00:58:44,609 --> 00:58:49,020
this we then read all the Edit config

1111
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:52,589
operations in the yang framework data

1112
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:55,800
tree and we then walk<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the data</font>

1113
00:58:52,589 --> 00:59:00,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">three to generate sequence numbers would</font>

1114
00:58:55,800 --> 00:59:02,369
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> given alpha numeric strings and at</font>

1115
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:04,529
this point in step<font color="#CCCCCC"> number three we</font>

1116
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:07,710
actually have the ACL on how it would

1117
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:09,900
look when you commit it and the fourth

1118
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:12,180
step is to commit the configuration in

1119
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:18,720
the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> database and also trigger and</font>

1120
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:22,290
hardware updates so in RSC 6020 be

1121
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:26,759
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> Marge replays delete and remove</font>

1122
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:30,089
were the four for the amps five edit

1123
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:32,490
config operations so we have implemented

1124
00:59:30,089 --> 00:59:35,569
all five as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as yet which includes</font>

1125
00:59:32,490 --> 00:59:35,569
get and get config

1126
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:40,790
so here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a get these are just some</font>

1127
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,799
examples i'm going to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> through so</font>

1128
00:59:40,790 --> 00:59:46,550
here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a get config example so we have</font>

1129
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:48,560
an access list ACL one and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font>

1130
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:51,920
is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying to get all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ACLS</font>

1131
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:55,600
of ty 34 and we see on the right side

1132
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:57,859
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the v4 acl's have been returned</font>

1133
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,359
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time so can you</font>

1134
00:59:57,859 --> 01:00:03,140
jumped like if you have a specific

1135
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:07,490
whatever you can to type um sure so this

1136
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:11,359
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a replace so this actually just tells</font>

1137
01:00:07,490 --> 01:00:13,430
us the algorithm I have a few<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples</font>

1138
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:18,880
on this but we can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through create so</font>

1139
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:21,740
let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say before we had an ACL with</font>

1140
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,830
sequence numbers 10 20 30 and the

1141
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:27,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">alphanumeric string is a B and C so on</font>

1142
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:30,830
the right side so we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an</font>

1143
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:33,200
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> that map's 10 to a 22</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> B and 32</font>

1144
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:36,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">C so now let's say we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to create ad</font>

1145
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:39,080
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the default operation is to</font>

1146
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:46,490
put it right at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the end we see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> D</font>

1147
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:49,340
gets a 40 / t in our system database so

1148
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:51,140
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when we also have we use the</font>

1149
01:00:49,340 --> 01:00:54,109
first last before<font color="#E5E5E5"> and after in the</font>

1150
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:57,950
insert operations when they say insert d

1151
01:00:54,109 --> 01:01:00,680
after be you see that d gets inserted

1152
01:00:57,950 --> 01:01:02,750
after be the sequence number the new

1153
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:07,940
sequel stamp is generated and you have

1154
01:01:02,750 --> 01:01:12,380
see occurring after d replace is kind of

1155
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:14,210
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> because here you have just</font>

1156
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:18,050
say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to replace be with E and</font>

1157
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:22,880
insert after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a so what you do is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1158
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:26,060
you find where<font color="#CCCCCC"> B is you replace it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

1159
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,830
E and also put be in the delete<font color="#E5E5E5"> queue</font>

1160
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:31,549
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a specific delete</font>

1161
01:01:27,830 --> 01:01:34,520
request that has to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insert e</font>

1162
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:36,320
giving it a sequence number and followed

1163
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:40,220
by see whose sequence number is

1164
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:43,820
unchanged delete is fairly

1165
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:46,399
straightforward the last slide deals

1166
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:48,260
with how<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cisco augmented the IETF ACL</font>

1167
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,799
model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a fairly simple</font>

1168
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:53,910
augmentation where

1169
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:59,670
have in the ingress and egress you have

1170
01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:02,670
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a v4 v6 and esa CL and this</font>

1171
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:06,329
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> example only allows one ACL</font>

1172
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:08,429
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think as we progress there'll be</font>

1173
01:02:06,329 --> 01:02:10,910
further extensions to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

1174
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:13,829
different platforms and running XR

1175
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:17,578
accommodate different number of acs on

1176
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:20,069
the interface all right so no thank you

1177
01:02:17,579 --> 01:02:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">a very quick</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one yes it's a sea lindo</font>

1178
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:26,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">cisco</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't state it there's no way</font>

1179
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:29,489
there's no APR on this right is there

1180
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:31,229
any IP are on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay great thanks as</font>

1181
01:02:29,489 --> 01:02:34,439
Sheppard i previously pulled for IPR

1182
01:02:31,229 --> 01:02:37,049
there was none um and also it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1183
01:02:34,439 --> 01:02:39,058
cool and also thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you for showing this</font>

1184
01:02:37,049 --> 01:02:40,829
implementation also add Andrew pagana

1185
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,779
vetch also had mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a volta</font>

1186
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:45,029
had done an implementation of the ACL

1187
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:47,880
draft so two implementations this is

1188
01:02:45,029 --> 01:02:49,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">great and as the Shepherd I'm gonna make</font>

1189
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:52,469
it was a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy right up for me so</font>

1190
01:02:49,439 --> 01:02:55,979
thank you very much and oops<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font>

1191
01:02:52,469 --> 01:02:59,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">126</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again well we found out in the young</font>

1192
01:02:55,979 --> 01:03:02,999
model that we could do optimization in

1193
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:07,679
the ITF packet header in the idea packet

1194
01:03:02,999 --> 01:03:10,078
Heather model because the we matched the

1195
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:13,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">we did the leaves for the Heather</font>

1196
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:15,449
matching instead of using a leaf list if

1197
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:19,160
we would change from leaf to leaf list

1198
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:22,589
it would it would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to create</font>

1199
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:24,989
entries AC entries about say terms but

1200
01:03:22,589 --> 01:03:26,849
it's AC entries where we could have

1201
01:03:24,989 --> 01:03:31,289
multiple match conditions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you</font>

1202
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:33,119
know single line with an action<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the</font>

1203
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:36,809
risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> of keeping everybody from lunch</font>

1204
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:38,640
that only applies to our fields that are

1205
01:03:36,809 --> 01:03:41,939
the same that are exactly the same type

1206
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:43,379
the source and desta to but like other

1207
01:03:41,939 --> 01:03:46,038
fields you couldn't put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in that list</font>

1208
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,429
so it only optimizes for those two right

1209
01:03:46,039 --> 01:03:52,709
if if you support mixed models you you

1210
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:56,339
could you could then you know if sorry

1211
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:58,259
if you support mixed types then then

1212
01:03:56,339 --> 01:04:01,710
then then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know have even</font>

1213
01:03:58,259 --> 01:04:03,940
you know like mac and IP

1214
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:05,530
so let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> this the list I think you</font>

1215
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,690
already put an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email to this right now</font>

1216
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:09,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I need to reply to that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as Shepherd</font>

1217
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:10,869
and decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether or not we need to</font>

1218
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:13,360
pull this back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the working group</font>

1219
01:04:10,869 --> 01:04:15,130
consideration but to my impression is it

1220
01:04:13,360 --> 01:04:17,440
looks like its effect of scalars

1221
01:04:15,130 --> 01:04:18,580
becoming a vector and it's a safe change

1222
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,590
we don't really need to bring it back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1223
01:04:18,580 --> 01:04:25,029
the working group but again I'll confer

1224
01:04:22,590 --> 01:04:26,410
blue sheets and if you haven't filled in

1225
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,610
the blue sheet can you please make sure

1226
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:28,750
you ensure that you've filled in the

1227
01:04:27,610 --> 01:04:31,690
blue she do we know where the blue

1228
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:35,950
sheets are located currently hold up the

1229
01:04:31,690 --> 01:04:38,500
blue sheet if you have it I think well

1230
01:04:35,950 --> 01:04:41,470
Tim's got one back great<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you want</font>

1231
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:43,320
to mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> com okay so there's</font>

1232
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:49,118
going to be following<font color="#E5E5E5"> more discussion um</font>

1233
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:50,890
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> netcom on what's happening with the</font>

1234
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52,780
multiple data stores the revised data

1235
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:54,940
stores so if you're interested<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1236
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:57,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">topic it would be good to show up there</font>

1237
01:04:54,940 --> 01:05:00,130
in this afternoon section session neck

1238

techniques in there oh I have seen your

1244
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:31,920
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> early August their companies</font>

1245
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:35,890
to file a GRL so that's what I<font color="#E5E5E5"> meant</font>

1246
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:39,600
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You fact yes yes because because</font>
