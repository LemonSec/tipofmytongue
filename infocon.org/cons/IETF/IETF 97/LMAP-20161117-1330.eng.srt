41
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:58,289
let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the work working rib stash</font>

42
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:00,599
real quick so we have to we have both

43
00:04:58,289 --> 00:05:02,340
the framework and use cases as our<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas</font>

44
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:05,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">that have been published we have a</font>

45
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,960
metric actually we have another RFC that

46
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:11,609
was an IP p.m. the supporting<font color="#CCCCCC"> L map work</font>

47
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,500
the current work items that we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

48
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:17,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">to discuss today hinge around the</font>

49
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,229
information model the yang draft

50
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,820
discussion and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest comp but those</font>

51
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:25,080
both are relying on the information

52
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:27,570
model so the goal today is to hopefully

53
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,580
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the end of our discussion and go</font>

54
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,259
to working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups last call on the info</font>

56
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:39,509
be doing has three presentations so

57
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:46,740
he'll be remotely presenting all of

58
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:48,150
these anything else and then we'll see

59
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we end up at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

60
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:56,940
discussion is there any agenda bashing

61
00:05:51,500 --> 00:06:01,320
so you want to add anything I just know

62
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,030
for the the working group both both

63
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,870
shares are now

64
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:09,450
or I'm art<font color="#CCCCCC"> I know Dan you can feel free</font>

65
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,270
i'm not sure what your they have no

66
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:14,070
longer employed by via so it's not clear

67
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:17,549
whether or not either one of us will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

68
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:20,640
participating<font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf so i think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

69
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,280
as if we can wrap up the work today or

70
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:26,700
we wrap up the<font color="#E5E5E5"> work this year for in my</font>

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,520
instance that would be a good thing we

72
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:31,140
can also we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always add new chairs if</font>

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,960
there's if there's interest in the

74
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,180
working group to uh to movie on the

75
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:38,849
current work chartered items but these

76
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,570
three items on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in queue or will</font>

77
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,000
satisfy the current charter as it is

78
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,090
yeah in what what I am<font color="#CCCCCC"> concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the I'm</font>

79
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,020
retired I plan to continue to to

80
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,130
participate in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF work but</font>

81
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:57,830
participating in meetings will become

82
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,469
rather see exceptions answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> rules so</font>

83
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:05,969
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> my next my next meeting</font>

84
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:08,700
probably will be as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one in Prague yeah</font>

85
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:13,830
so i will call<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will continue to to to</font>

86
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:15,900
support the elm at work but probably it

87
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,020
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be difficult to participate in</font>

88
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">meetings so if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work continues</font>

89
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,320
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> the current chapter if there are</font>

90
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,669
new proposals or such SNL you people to

91
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:32,310
think about at least one extra chair who

92
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:36,300
can participate in meetings on a more

93
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,850
regular basis yeah i think i'm in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

94
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,620
same boat for now the good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing for me</font>

95
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:42,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the chicago i should be able to get</font>

96
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:44,070
to fairly easily so i think between the

97
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,350
two of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we can cover chicago and</font>

98
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">Prague's so that'll def that she goes</font>

99
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:50,370
through the current work I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't yeah we</font>

100
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:54,030
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> good probably we look good good</font>

101
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:58,140
probably for 2017 because Singapore may

102
00:07:54,030 --> 00:08:02,190
also be in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> chance but let's see maybe</font>

103
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:06,330
we wrap up sooner and there won't be a

104
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:11,300
need to talk to much<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll have energy</font>

105
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:14,430
if it's not so much that seriously

106
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:16,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright well don't take this is an</font>

107
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:21,450
invitation not to submit a new proposal

108
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:25,410
so if you have anything in mind very

109
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:28,490
true<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I think we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready</font>

110
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,490
first up

111
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,820
I

112
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:59,899
you're gonna you there hello can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

113
00:08:56,809 --> 00:09:03,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">me hello yes we can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear you apparently</font>

114
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:07,309
so good afternoon so we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few</font>

115
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:09,050
issues left on the information model the

116
00:09:07,309 --> 00:09:10,939
first one and we had some discussion

117
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,969
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the list I was actually</font>

118
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:16,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">raised as part of the yang doctors</font>

119
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:21,170
review of the young data model and the

120
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:24,139
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was raised was why the arm</font>

121
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,300
up information model or the data model

122
00:09:24,139 --> 00:09:29,240
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it also applies to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information</font>

123
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,040
model fields in charge of configuring

124
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,990
the device ID it seems that the device

125
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,089
ID is something that isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an</font>

126
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:39,499
obscure so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that's</font>

127
00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:41,179
specific to the a map infrastructure

128
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,649
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that's used by the arm up</font>

129
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:45,199
infrastructure but it's not specific to

130
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,939
the MF infrastructure and so the

131
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:48,829
question is why does the above

132
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:52,939
information model talks about

133
00:09:48,829 --> 00:09:55,370
configuring the device ID and so the

134
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:57,399
proposal is to actually remove the

135
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,029
configuration of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device ID because</font>

136
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's outside of the arm up scope and</font>

137
00:10:01,029 --> 00:10:05,569
somehow we haven't settled this finally

138
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:14,540
on on the list so<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopefully we can</font>

139
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:18,229
settle it now I think Tim will<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh so</font>

140
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:21,199
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is tim carry nokia so the the</font>

141
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,269
device ID let's let's step back right so

142
00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,040
the pre configuration elements

143
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:28,610
information elements that were in the

144
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,449
information model actually was driven

145
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:35,720
from text that's in the that's in the

146
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:38,149
framework document that says you're

147
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to need you're going to need to</font>

148
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:42,980
provide a couple things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the agent you</font>

149
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:47,209
may very well need to provide its its ID

00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,829
as well as<font color="#CCCCCC"> its the device identifier and</font>

151
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:51,888
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very explicit in the framework</font>

156
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:05,660
as being and I'll quoted it says the

157
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,460
information is the minimal information

158
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,520
that needs to be pre-configured to the

159
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:11,690
MA in order for it to be successfully

160

communicate with control or during the

161
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:16,550
during the registration process some of

00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,100
the pre configuration information

163
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:21,050
elements are repeated in the information

164
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,880
configuration information in order to

165
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,359
allow the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Elm app controller to update</font>

169
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,720

170
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:38,420
some elements that are not under the

the device identifying device security

174
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,320
element that's in the pre config section

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,330
that really the controller is not going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to have any access to and the collector</font>

177
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:54,590
in terms of configuring and the

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,080
collectors not going to have any access

179
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,480
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's been stated clearly in the</font>

180
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,120
information model the pre-configure is

181
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:05,270
not a subset of what the configuration

182
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,280
is in fact it's those two elements are

183
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:10,130
two different elements that just so

184
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:13,910
happens to share some configuration

185
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,980
elements and so I don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,880
device<font color="#E5E5E5"> identifiers necessarily needs to</font>

be removed if we do remove it we got to

188
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,350
go fix the framework probably as an

189
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:27,319
errata and we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove we need to</font>

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,170
fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this text documentation in section 3</font>

dot one personally from a BBF

192
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:36,530
perspective<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would remove it because it</font>

193
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:38,660
actually conflicts with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that we</font>

194
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,630
have other elements that allow you to

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:43,069
config the<font color="#CCCCCC"> device identifier they call</font>

197
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:48,200
the BBF so it actually makes my chance

198
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,030
easier but it will cause you guys

199
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,820
problems in the ITF because you got

200
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,380
framework problems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you got you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

the information model problems that you

that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff dribbled down through</font>

203
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:01,550
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say the reason why we do in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the BBF we allow this thing to be</font>

the serial number<font color="#CCCCCC"> i needed to be</font>

210
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,080
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> else in the serial number</font>

211
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,570
because guess what the serial number

212
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,550
between two different vendors they use

213
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,350
the same serial number right or have the

214
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,449
same potential for a serial number so

215
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:25,070
they use their own identifiers so that's

216
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:29,780
the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> driven down that</font>

217
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:31,040
way right again if you choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> to remove</font>

218
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,839
it we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have to do something</font>

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the framework document and we're</font>

220
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:38,780
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to figure out what to do</font>

221
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:42,160
with this section 3 dot one so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

222
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:46,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hearing that you are basically</font>

223
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:50,839
agreeing with yoga's proposal with some

224
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:56,720
text twist by the way Cecilia number

225
00:13:50,840 --> 00:14:02,210
flesh can also be solved by using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

226
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:06,050
vendor identifier and we have one is the

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:07,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass there's a BB a problem and well</font>

228
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:12,020
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a day and I think</font>

229
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a concern that I have that maybe</font>

230
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:18,439
we might not have understood mr. nuance

231
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:20,870
is that the pre config is not a subset

232
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,190
of the many of the config it's that

233
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,020
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a subset of what the</font>

234
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:25,970
configure is and if we're treating that

235
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,800
in our data models as a subset of the

236
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,360
config then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably missed the boat</font>

237
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,189
on on that particular relationship

238
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,230
because they should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just two separate</font>

239
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:35,840
information elements and guess what the

240
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:39,260
pre config between the controller and

241
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,630
the MA and the pre config collector and

242
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,189
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MA shouldn't come into any bearing</font>

243
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,580
on any of the data models that we're

244
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,580
dealing with

245
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:57,020
so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> saying if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remove if you do</font>

246
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:59,449
what the proposal is we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh go</font>

247
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:01,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">back and adjust the framework you would</font>

248
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go back up and at least fix the</font>

249
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,400
framework because the framework was

250
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,260
explicit which is why it was in the pre

251
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,730
config on the information model and

252
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,310
you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to fix the information model</font>

253
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,290
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> again the pre config has no bearing</font>

254
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,420
on should have no bearing on the data

255
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:17,660
model unless you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make your</font>

256
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:20,839
data model your yang data model a

257
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:22,910
bootstrap model to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> MN and if it's a</font>

258
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:25,340
bootstrap model for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MA then yeah</font>

259
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:28,930
then it does come into play but it's not

260
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,930
going to the collector or the controller

261
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:43,460
so so I hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have agreement to</font>

262
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,050
remove it from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MA convict right so</font>

263
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:49,010
the discussion is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the pre config</font>

264
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:51,469
oh so is this in the ma this is an MA

265
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,850
pre config certainly remover from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> MA</font>

266
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,530
config I don't think you want it in

267
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:59,750
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jurgen for sure because the only</font>

268
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that the the framework or</font>

269
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:15,050
the information model talks about it in

270
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:21,530
is the is as part of the pre config so

271
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:25,099
now its<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> him that look looking</font>

272
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:28,579
as I'm speaking as a contributor now and

273
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:31,130
speaking loud to some<font color="#E5E5E5"> extent on the</font>

274
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:34,880
precum freak so it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we have</font>

275
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:38,510
like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of options maybe more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

276
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:42,620
two why would it be to take it out from

277
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:49,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the pre config and decide whether we</font>

278
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:54,230
want to to amend the<font color="#CCCCCC"> framework which is</font>

279
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:57,800
kind of let's say optional to some

280
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:00,500
extent because as a framework we can

281
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually put a note pay attention we may</font>

282
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:05,539
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be we are not consistent with a</font>

283
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:09,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">fremont here but the framework is unique</font>

284
00:17:05,539 --> 00:17:13,449
document and during the work we realized

285
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:17,799
that this is kind of a better resolution

286
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:24,470
and the other one would actually be

287
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:27,319
leaving the pre config<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID inside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be</font>

288
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,499
ways another note that kind of shows

289
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:34,190
that we'd like to we did it mainly

290
00:17:30,499 --> 00:17:36,499
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of consistency with other models</font>

291
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:41,479
in the industry but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be not</font>

292
00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:49,239
necessarily expect for this<font color="#CCCCCC"> item to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

293
00:17:41,479 --> 00:17:49,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">always used or to be used too often</font>

294
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so it sounds like we have</font>

295
00:17:57,019 --> 00:18:06,169
agreement to remove it from them a

296
00:17:58,599 --> 00:18:07,609
config anyone disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that so then</font>

297
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:13,940
the only question is do we leave it in

298
00:18:07,609 --> 00:18:17,840
the pre-configured now speaking as a

299
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:20,320
chair now I would very much like to try

300
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:24,109
to get out with resolutions here and

301
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:28,428
actually give instructions<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Jurgen as</font>

302
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:31,070
editor what to do in the next iteration

303
00:18:28,429 --> 00:18:36,200
should come very shortly<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

304
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:39,529
he make him make him a k1 on his machine

305
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,749
already and then if there are really

306
00:18:39,529 --> 00:18:47,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">strong opinions about what he has done</font>

307
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:50,929
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the revised</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text then this audience</font>

308
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:55,940
be expressed as last call comments but I

309
00:18:50,929 --> 00:19:04,690
I would prefer not<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave open issues</font>

310
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:04,690
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> this meeting I agree</font>

311
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:18,370
alright so do we have an agreement to

312
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:20,530
remove both then I would your you and

313
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:21,879
push back<font color="#E5E5E5"> again ok yeah so I'm just</font>

314
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:31,928
going to push back on that one<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

315
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:34,510
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh again I I know it needs it</font>

316
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,760
needs not to be in the in the config but

317
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,350
it's but it makes sense to be in the pre

318
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,240
config and the pre config doesn't have

319
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:41,620
anything to do with the data model

320
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,500
unless you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some type of</font>

321
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:46,780
bootstrapping I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just saying so if you</font>

322
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,940
just remove her from the config itself

323
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:50,678
that's all you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do to that IM</font>

324
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,990
draft and everything's still consistent

325
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:55,390
with the framework and consistent<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

326
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:58,059
the text<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the in the IM draft that's</font>

327
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:59,919
all huh gotcha bitch to me it's the

328
00:19:58,059 --> 00:20:02,260
easiest change right and that's see no

329
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,909
ring makes everything consistent<font color="#E5E5E5"> alright</font>

330
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:10,570
say Jurgen I think you might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font>

331
00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:13,750
one are you okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that um it works</font>

332
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,549
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> suns</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that Tim is right the yang</font>

333
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,830
data model doesn't model the pre convict

334
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,710
so it explicitly says we don't do this

335
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,908
we only do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> config so the issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

336
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:26,049
came up in the young Gator model would

337
00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:28,860
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> resolved by that that's probably the</font>

338
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:30,429
cheap cheapest pass forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah</font>

339
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so we keep it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

340
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:39,510
pre-configured remove it from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Macon</font>

341
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:39,510
thing excellent all right number two

342
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:51,740
the second issue is about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reporting</font>

343
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:56,090
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the agent ID</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm right now the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

344
00:20:51,740 --> 00:21:00,940
logic is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's a flag saying</font>

345
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:03,590
report agent ID of you set it to false

346
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,809
but there's no group ID set<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still</font>

347
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,879
sending the agent ID which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font>

348
00:21:05,809 --> 00:21:11,299
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit surprising if you just look</font>

349
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,040
up what you intuitively expect that this

350
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:16,520
boolean just targets whether the agent

351
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:19,190
ID is sent or not<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so the proposal</font>

352
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">was to actually have two bits one saying</font>

353
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:23,090
whether the agent ID is set another bit

354
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:26,750
saying whether the group ID is sat and

355
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:30,350
to leave it up to the system configuring

356
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:32,780
the agent to select which agent ID or

357
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:34,959
group ID is being<font color="#CCCCCC"> send or if none or</font>

358
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,960
both

359
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:52,650
do you have a recommendation yeah yeah

360
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:54,330
the proposal is have the report agent ID

361
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,700
bit just control whether the agent ID

362
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:58,740
bit is sand have the report group ID bit

363
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:01,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">only control whether the group ideas son</font>

364
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:06,990
and leave the policy decision to the

365
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that configures the mo dma all</font>

366
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:10,860
right Ian so it's tim karaoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have no</font>

367
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:12,000
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that because it's it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

368
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,620
going to be the controller that's gonna

369
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,870
set this stuff anyway so they should

370
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:19,709
know these stupid controllers are gonna

371
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:23,429
do stupid things so little bit a little

372
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">bit all right we have agreement then</font>

373
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:31,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jurgen on this one okay and I think that</font>

374
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">was it for our next step so I think the</font>

375
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,300
edits are reasonably clear I can do them

376
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:39,210
relatively quickly so there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> dash</font>

377
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:41,460
13 soon and I assume that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one we</font>

go to hand over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the chairs for a</font>

381
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:06,000
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's been some discussion on</font>

382
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:12,030
the list um around on the reference<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI</font>

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to the in to the registry I'm wondering</font>

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">if we should have a brief discussion on</font>

385
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">that issue so that we can close it /</font>

386
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:25,830
dans request jörgen did you have that

387
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:27,630
as a item<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't have that as an item</font>

388
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">because I thought we had agreement</font>

389
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,820
before that we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved from that</font>

390
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:36,360
we changed the labor from metric you I

391
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,520
to just registry<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI or whatever it's</font>

392
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,969
called know before so that's why I made

393
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> edit if we have to revert</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

395
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,940
need to understand it a bit on I think

396
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,830
what I've seen in you're going to

397
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,870
correct me<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm wrong is what you're</font>

398
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,999
saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that it does not have to</font>

400
00:23:56,999 --> 00:24:01,889
be any registry would<font color="#CCCCCC"> it would your</font>

401
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:04,769
expectations still be though that it is

402
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:10,198
in the registry format or would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be in</font>

403
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:12,389
some other format this so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> value of</font>

404
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:16,549
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> object is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the UI so the UI can</font>

405
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:20,188
point to pretty much anything the

406
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:21,989
metrics registry that's done an IP p.m.

407
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:25,079
is about metrics so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about anything</font>

408
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:27,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can measure however a map has a</font>

411
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:34,408
things like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so they naturally fall</font>

412
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:38,849
outside of the scope of the metrics

413
00:24:34,409 --> 00:24:40,319
registry and it does it make if you want

414
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:42,779
to either have an identifier for these

415
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:47,459
tasks as well it makes sense to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

416
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:50,849
to point to wherever there's a registry

417
00:24:47,459 --> 00:24:53,489
for this kind of task I'm wondering<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

418
00:24:50,849 --> 00:24:55,559
it might make sense that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it's</font>

419
00:24:53,489 --> 00:25:00,269
something that doesn't fit into a

00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:03,178
registry format / the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I ppm registry</font>

421
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:05,489
format then maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not too useful to</font>

422
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,039
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI so maybe the URI gets left</font>

423
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:10,589
blank in that case but I think it would

424
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:12,929
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> useful if there were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a stipulation</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that this particular you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I pointed</font>

434
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:43,079
absolutely correct sometimes you know

439
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,589
to want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do housekeeping you're going</font>

440
00:25:53,129 --> 00:25:59,218
to want to do stuff even in the BBF we

441
00:25:55,589 --> 00:26:01,438
use that that that that same parameter

442
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:04,439
to point to the BBF registry which is an

443
00:26:01,439 --> 00:26:06,899
IP IP p.m. when we do our<font color="#CCCCCC"> care 1.3</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

444
00:26:04,439 --> 00:26:08,069
yes but it's in the format so you would

445
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:10,739
that would mean that you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

446
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:16,860
then put all your housekeeping tasks and

447
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:19,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same format</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for I ppm oh I sous I'm</font>

449
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:23,970
question to tim was do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you actually need</font>

450
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:25,200
to describe to have some<font color="#E5E5E5"> place you know</font>

451
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,880
where there's a URI where you're

452
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,710
describing your housekeeping tasks I

453
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,210
he's gonna have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes so that would</font>

454
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:32,309
mean that if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to not put it</font>

455
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:34,200
in the I ppm format you<font color="#CCCCCC"> neva if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font>

456
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:35,850
you're gonna have to have a repository

457
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,010
for your registry because you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

458
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:40,110
point somewhere right and it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

459
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:41,670
in some format that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known right</font>

460
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:45,840
and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you can have that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font>

461
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:47,460
part of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you point to but yeah so I</font>

462
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,928
guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> jörgen is is that</font>

463
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:52,830
free for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things that aren't</font>

464
00:26:48,929 --> 00:26:54,600
directly related to the I ppm tasks what

465
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,189
were you thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about me like your</font>

466
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,809
housekeeping tasks how are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

467
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,540
about defining those were they always in

468
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:05,970
the the same format that the I ppm

469
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:10,230
format is in um so personally I would

470
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:12,840
expect this to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely different or a</font>

471
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:16,410
subset but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to say I think</font>

472
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,570
the I ppm metrics registry format isn't

473
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:20,970
really final yet or well I didn't follow

474
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:23,040
the IP p.m. session but whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font>

475
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:25,920
there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in the IPM I</font>

476
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,809
ppm metrics format that definitely are

477
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,640
needed and there might be things that

478
00:27:27,809 --> 00:27:33,710
are needed for the tasks that aren't<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

479
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:36,840
the IP p.m. vetrix registry um so but

480
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,559
for the information model<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

481
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,000
fine if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have this pointer and my</font>

482
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,570
preference would be to get information

483
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,100
model done with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pointer that can be</font>

484
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:51,240
extended and clarified later on because

485
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:55,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's pretty generic pointer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well marcelo</font>

486
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,570
annular here and so as far as i

487
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,840
understand i think with the current

488
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:03,450
information model that it i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this</font>

489
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,919
supports everything we need so what I

490
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:09,690
understand is you will have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least</font>

491
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,850
three type of different registries that

492
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,660
you will<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for this to work you will</font>

493
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:18,209
need the matrix registry you probably

494
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:19,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">need like the public metric registry you</font>

495
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably need something like a private</font>

496
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:24,600
registry that the operator or whoever is

497
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:26,250
running this

498
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:28,379
things for whatever they want to measure

499
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,020
that it's not in the in the public

500
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,420
registry and you probably need something

501
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:35,910
but it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> l map operations type of</font>

502
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,200
registry that are there are tasks that

503
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:38,820
you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that are not really</font>

504
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,190
related to measuring anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

505
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,780
understand that that basically what the

506
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:45,000
current scope is them in the car

507
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:49,860
approaches each of these registers will

508
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,260
have their own your I a type of a naming

509
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:54,449
hence when you include a task you can

510
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:57,000
clued it which you start with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> URI of</font>

511
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:59,010
the of the of the performance metric

512
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,500
registry then you will go to those if

513
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,110
then the private one should get their

514
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:06,900
own<font color="#CCCCCC"> URI and the real map one probably</font>

515
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:10,770
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> one specified in the el</font>

516
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:17,370
mac protocol specification so is that

517
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:19,620
what you have in mind Jurgen well the

518
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">the information model just has a URI it</font>

519
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:23,909
always had your<font color="#CCCCCC"> eye pointer it still has</font>

520
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:26,370
a UI pointer we just changed the name

521
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,830
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it doesn't say metrics registry it</font>

522
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:30,449
just says registry that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

523
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:34,199
technical change and information modern

524
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,540
i think that's that's what we want where

525
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,580
did if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are additional</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well known</font>

526
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,409
registry formats and when and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

527
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,449
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be defined</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I really don't</font>

528
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:45,570
know better that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something for the</font>

529
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,980
future to sort out right then I mean the

530
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">question I think the real question</font>

531
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:50,040
because you can you can envision other

532
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:51,540
ways of doing this where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

533
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,510
actually envision that there will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

534
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:56,210
single<font color="#CCCCCC"> L map registry that actually then</font>

535
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:58,740
sub contain super registries that

536
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:00,720
contained<font color="#CCCCCC"> the performance registry for</font>

537
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:02,550
instance or so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> make on call</font>

538
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,440
different kinds of structures of these

539
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:06,090
registries but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the current</font>

540
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:07,890
information model support any of those

541
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:09,750
right because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> generally enough to</font>

542
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,070
support any of those so forth from the

543
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:12,960
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> model I think that's fine</font>

544
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,669
probably this will deserve more

545
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,740
discussion on the on the protocol itself

546
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,980
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that that's that would be my</font>

547
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,980
take

548
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:29,129
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounds like we have no dissenters</font>

549
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:32,820
with leaving<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as proposed I'll eat it</font>

550
00:30:29,129 --> 00:30:37,830
after you get the draft well as in draft

551
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:41,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">12 what what's written there they're all</font>

552
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:44,418
right excellent so you're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

553
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:52,649
marching orders on on the / 13 and then

554
00:30:44,419 --> 00:30:56,720
we'll move will move ahead good<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

555
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:59,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">right let me bring up there the gang</font>

556
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,720
discussion

557
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:18,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright you're ready to go for yang okay</font>

558
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:20,040
so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the 30</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pitches</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on on</font>

559
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:21,900
the yang data model the first one is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

560
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,550
device ID now we have settled it on the

561
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,030
information model Saudi the<font color="#E5E5E5"> only thing</font>

562
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:31,680
really here is to adapt<font color="#E5E5E5"> that solution so</font>

563
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:38,520
that's I think non-controversial so we

564
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:39,870
go to the next one second issue some

565
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,870
objects<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the information model are</font>

566
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:44,969
marked as optional<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of secret</font>

567
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:47,939
sensitivity concerns now in principle in

568
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:50,600
the yang world we do have access control

569
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:53,550
models that can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> take care of</font>

570
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:58,110
hiding objects that shouldn't be exposed

571
00:31:53,550 --> 00:32:00,600
to whoever is accessing the system and

572
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:04,189
so one could consider making some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

573
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,330
those optional elements actually

574
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:10,590
non-optional in the yang data model

575
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,750
thinking a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> further about it I</font>

576
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:14,879
my proposal<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually to do nothing</font>

577
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:17,910
because having optional options objects

578
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,400
is by itself not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem and the main</font>

579
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:22,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">reason is that not necessarily all</font>

580
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:26,010
implementations might actually support

581
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:29,070
the access control model that we have

582
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:32,280
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> having these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are objects optional</font>

583
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,129
optional might actually simplify certain

584
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:36,600
implementations so so my proposal on

585
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:39,470
this issue is just to do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

586
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,469
drop it

587
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:54,520
I see no comments at the mic so sounds

588
00:32:48,580 --> 00:33:00,760
like that a good idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay then we move</font>

589
00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:03,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the third one arm that was raised by</font>

590
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">Martin during his review we have a</font>

591
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:07,629
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of objects</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that report the</font>

592
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,970
current<font color="#CCCCCC"> Hardware the MA is running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

593
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:13,440
the firmware it's running on and the

594
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:15,910
device ID and these objects overlap with

595
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,890
objects that we have already some of

596
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:19,690
them in our seas and some of them on the

597
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,260
way to become our<font color="#E5E5E5"> seas so that some</font>

598
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:24,370
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ietf system model has</font>

599
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:27,310
something that overlaps with a hardware

600
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:29,320
and firmware and the idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hardware</font>

601
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:32,379
model will have something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that overlaps</font>

602
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,510
with the device ID and so the question

603
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,960
is that Martin raised shall we remove

604
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:39,850
those overlapping documents and I think

605
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,550
personally that's a good idea so the

606
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:44,949
proposal is to actually remove the

607
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:48,190
hardware and<font color="#E5E5E5"> film relatives from the Elm</font>

608
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:50,230
up data model and<font color="#CCCCCC"> instead at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> text</font>

609
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:55,930
somewhere that says those objects can be

610
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:58,450
found in<font color="#CCCCCC"> RC 7317 and for the device ID</font>

611
00:33:55,930 --> 00:34:02,850
to essentially the same and point to the

612
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:05,650
hardware the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ITF hardware model the only</font>

613
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:07,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">little detail is that the hardware model</font>

614
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,560
is still being worked on in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> net much</font>

615
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,719
so that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet on our see but I</font>

616
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,489
checked for all the other objects where

617
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,989
we do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same thing where we say well</font>

618
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:16,449
we don't find it here it's defined over

619
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:17,979
there all these references actually

620
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:19,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">information</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are reference or so it would</font>

621
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:23,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">not be a blocking blocking thing that</font>

622
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:23,069
holds off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the document</font>

623
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,179
Tim so yeah so Tim karaoke<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee yeah I</font>

624
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,310
completely agree that's exactly the way

625
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:36,320
I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the BBF is that we already</font>

626
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:38,210
had a bunch of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff already and so</font>

627
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:46,369
I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference what what was already</font>

628
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:48,800
there i didn't try to duplicate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok if</font>

629
00:34:46,369 --> 00:34:55,490
nobody is against art then i will put

630
00:34:48,800 --> 00:35:00,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next revision angry so we</font>

631
00:34:55,489 --> 00:35:01,879
get to the summary slide so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have to</font>

632
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:05,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">make some edits and post another version</font>

633
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:10,460
again edit should be relatively minor at

634
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:13,490
this point in time<font color="#CCCCCC"> um I did respond to</font>

635
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:15,980
Martin's review I didn't hear back from

636
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:19,100
Martin so I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they had time to</font>

637
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,770
look at this or not but probably once we

638
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:23,868
have all seven that might be reasonable

639
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:26,930
to check what<font color="#CCCCCC"> Martin whether he is fine</font>

640
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:29,540
with the changes and so forth so that we

641
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,790
can conclude the young doctor review

642
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,770
cycle I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think but I leave that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

643
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:37,850
chest to organize so that's one

644
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:41,390
necessarily my job well one way to go

645
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:45,049
would be to to send the proposals to

646
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:47,690
Martin and ask him<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he's happy with a</font>

647
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:51,980
resolution the other way would be to

648
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:58,040
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> make I personally believes that he</font>

649
00:35:51,980 --> 00:36:01,460
shouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be he shouldn't oppose any any</font>

650
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:03,680
of the proposals but just my opinion the

651
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:08,480
other solution would be to go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

652
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:11,930
boozy edits and at last call time sent

653
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,680
to Martin CID and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lich king now well</font>

654
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:18,020
this is a last the last call and the

655
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,700
please let us know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have any</font>

656
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:27,500
problems with proposed solutions<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

657
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:32,899
personally inclined to force a later

658
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:37,150
because it's it's quicker yeah I'm with

659
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:37,150
you Dan on the set on the letter

660
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,480
and you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> you what are you asking</font>

661
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a few other people to review this</font>

662
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">document Oh John always yep yeah it</font>

663
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:02,180
would be that it would be very nice if

664
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:04,190
people that the last call if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

665
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,009
happy with what is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on with a</font>

666
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,420
Content<font color="#E5E5E5"> who just like us now i have read</font>

667
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:11,839
the document and I don't have any

668
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:15,109
pending problems with it is very useful

669
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,820
as well because it gives us a feeling

670
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:28,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the document having been read and</font>

671
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:32,300
agree traders and ignored so you're

672
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:35,390
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make this the the edits uh and</font>

673
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,450
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll submit it let's see what</font>

674
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:39,950
Martin has<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same and if somebody if</font>

675
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:41,990
we get one or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

676
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:50,509
interested in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the a model to review it</font>

677
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:57,310
that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> extremely helpful all</font>

678
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:59,690
right justic for my personal<font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

679
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:02,359
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to team i guess and</font>

680
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">as our folks who are participating as a</font>

681
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:09,970
BBF that doesn't BBF have also a young

682
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:12,829
model or do they take any position about

683
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:20,419
the data modeling language is<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used</font>

684
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:23,359
to accentuate the data model this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is Tim</font>

685
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:26,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">Carey so the from a BBF perspective</font>

686
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,940
we're doing this and we use the t69

687
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,069
protocol with the with its associated

688
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:33,980
data model so it has its own data model

689
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would suspect and I can't speak for</font>

690
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:41,060
the BBF but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would think that we would</font>

691
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:43,700
from for my from my<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective is that</font>

692
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:46,578
we would use<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the IETF is done</font>

693
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:48,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">because that's generally are the way</font>

694
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we do things is we look to see if</font>

695
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:50,540
there's already modules out there before

696
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">we better</font>

697
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,830
so the fact that these are here we

698
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,629
probably would use them we'd probably

699
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,910
have to question about the use of rest

700
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:03,500
comp<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus neck off but you know that</font>

701
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:09,080
but the yang module certainly thank you

702
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:11,420
is it useful is there anyone else in the

703
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:13,880
room that's looking at use it using the

704
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,250
yang model I think they're I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mean if</font>

705
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:20,360
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone actively yurgin you're</font>

706
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:23,740
probably only<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1i that's got a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

707
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:29,440
development in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in flight that I know of</font>

708
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:42,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">but i'm sure there's others all right</font>

709
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:47,440
all right onto a rest comp either Jurgen

710
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:55,720
