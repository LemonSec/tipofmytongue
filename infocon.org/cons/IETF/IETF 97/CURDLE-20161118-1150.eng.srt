template to follow and you just you know

109
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,219
document a one or two paragraph one or

my before I had my first RFC still

145
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:24,120
haven't had<font color="#E5E5E5"> my first rc okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all right</font>

146
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:28,030
so CMS dress um we got<font color="#CCCCCC"> more set on that</font>

147
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:32,169
DNS SEC that Tim working group last call

148
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:33,549
I got updates from Daniel s yesterday<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

149
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:36,098
said oh that's already unless call so I

150
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:40,380
went that's why you saw like 5am tracker

151
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:43,210
updates um he's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> shepherd for this</font>

152
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:46,930
nothing particularly about it how many

153
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:50,920
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> here have read the ed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> da e dds a</font>

154
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:53,199
used as dns keys document anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know</font>

155
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,729
that Paul and some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dana's folks</font>

156
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,000
have looked at it so I feel pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

157
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:57,000
about it

158
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:04,790
the PK x rafts<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay um notice Daniel</font>

159
00:09:02,629 --> 00:09:08,050
shepherding this too will have Jim up in

160
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:10,490
a minute this<font color="#E5E5E5"> process does not scale um</font>

161
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:12,170
I mean in theory could always be a

162
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group author a working group</font>

163
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,990
chair but we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do some more of</font>

164
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:20,209
that do more than just that um so we'll

165
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,860
turn have Jim come up and present his

166
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:26,739
sort of one and a half slides on the

167
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:26,740
status of P kicks so give me a sec here

168
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:33,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">yeah do now cuz this is this is the</font>

169
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:38,559
agenda and this is the thing of the

170
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:43,869
meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> just so folks know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hang else oh</font>

171
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:47,868
ok ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> so talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is real fast</font>

172
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:50,269
solving it may not be<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's</font>

173
00:09:47,869 --> 00:09:52,850
basically one contentious open issue

174
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,369
that we need to deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with and one issue</font>

175
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:57,350
which has been pushed by the chairs to

176
00:09:55,369 --> 00:10:03,290
the in the meeting which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably not</font>

177
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:06,679
contentious and this is do we keep the

178
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:10,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">current language which says ca's must</font>

179
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:14,959
not use the pre hash version um

180
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:17,029
basically arguments pro is you've got

181
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:20,300
much better security if you make the

182
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:22,579
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> um there used to be an</font>

183
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,139
argument which says if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't make</font>

184
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:25,819
this statement you've exposed yourself

185
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:27,769
to an attack but we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> at least</font>

186
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:33,620
cleared that attack up when we finish

187
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:36,740
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> EDD essay draft</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in c FR g and the</font>

188
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,899
cons are basically people who generate

189
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,399
really long<font color="#E5E5E5"> CR l's are going to be in</font>

190
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:44,120
this situation where there are going to

191
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,959
be devices h SMS which will not be able

192
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to consume and hold</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that much in memory</font>

193
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:54,979
in order to run the hash over<font color="#E5E5E5"> it twice</font>

194
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:56,899
my basic response to that is that's what

195
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,569
crl distribution points are for keep

196
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:02,420
them short but some of these guys say

197
00:10:59,569 --> 00:11:04,990
you know h SMS can only handle you know

198
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:08,910
really really small things and but

199
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:12,480
response in that case is I'm sorry

200
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:17,360
so if there is anyone who really thinks

201
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:20,970
that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change this language I</font>

202
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,700
need to know and now's a good time to

203
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,520
stand up and make an<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument that I'm</font>

204
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,190
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the clarification so right</font>

205
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,980
now text says we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using pre hash</font>

206
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:44,880
the text<font color="#CCCCCC"> says must not that is current</font>

207
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:47,430
text I'm going dang so 42 options um you

208
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,360
know Whitney has version if somebody

209
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:55,800
uses a good hash function then the two

210
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,140
options are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all secure to me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dad</font>

211
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,770
about security and the choice up which

212
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:04,949
one to use I don't have install pinion

213
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:07,290
over dass either way if it works<font color="#CCCCCC"> for be</font>

214
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">bold and that's fine</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are but for</font>

215
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:11,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">security of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> funds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if the hash function</font>

216
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:15,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">is good then there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are no security</font>

217
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:17,940
issues with either approach and you work

218
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,290
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization its specified shot</font>

219
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">to and Joffrey correct ah yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mom no</font>

220
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:28,439
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> too but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason if you know</font>

221
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,750
on the technical ground we if something

222
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,060
wrong with the hash function<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

223
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:35,780
will speak it out if something<font color="#CCCCCC"> secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

224
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,540
good then we confirmed that it's good ah

225
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:42,540
but you know the group here is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

226
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,209
choose whatever one we all you know have

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,640
a consensus<font color="#E5E5E5"> on which one would work for</font>

228
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:51,150
most people right and I I would totally

229
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,740
support that sure I actually was yeah i

230
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,060
was making kind of a joke but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also</font>

231
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,680
wanted to point out that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you come from</font>

232
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,170
replace it when you talk about hash

233
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,969
functions you bring in some expertise so

234
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:02,430
that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my boo was actually my</font>

235
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:06,060
main point yeah Thank thats that's our

236
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:07,859
hope to yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do want to make clear</font>

237
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,369
that the only thing we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

238
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,250
but this must not is things which are

239
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:18,500
generated by CR else this does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not apply</font>

240
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,210
to you know somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's generating a</font>

241
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:24,110
big signature on you know like an

242
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,110
archive document

243
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,729
there are giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I think it's very</font>

244
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">good to have only one option of saying</font>

245
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:37,199
must not for pre hash and I don't think

246
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,878
actually is any of our anywhere in<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF</font>

247
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">our code usually pre hash in anywhere</font>

248
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:44,220
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think ipsec is not and I think</font>

249
00:13:41,569 --> 00:13:45,628
TLS is probably not<font color="#CCCCCC"> done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if it happens</font>

250
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,519
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are not going to be using pre</font>

251
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:49,410
has anywhere else than this would be the

252
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,870
only I know only place in IETF I think

253
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,519
it would be the bad idea because then

254
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,990
you know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only reason to</font>

255
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,480
implement the pre has would be the DS

256
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,069
and I hate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a you know stuff that</font>

257
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,290
would be implemented only for you know

258
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:03,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">very limited you so I think we'd</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better</font>

259
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:08,219
to just say must not for pre hash also

260
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:15,000
hear from my own experience I have not

261
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:17,850
yet seen anybody use pre half<font color="#E5E5E5"> rush</font>

262
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">housley what I i started this or when</font>

263
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:23,000
the started I thought yes just leave it

264
00:14:19,649 --> 00:14:25,170
alone but as I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about it</font>

265
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the reasons we're having trouble</font>

266
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:34,920
specifying EDD<font color="#CCCCCC"> sa is because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> broke</font>

267
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:42,990
the API if we used only pre hash we get

268
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:47,329
the other API back so program

269
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:47,329
inconvenience compared to the security

270
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's certainly the industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> standard</font>

271
00:14:53,449 --> 00:15:13,859
yeah okay anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> else oh</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> alright uh</font>

272
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:17,609
we'll just take a quick consensus home

273
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:19,439
here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> confirm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the list in those</font>

274
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,809
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> faith so the question will be are you</font>

275
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:28,620
in favor of must not on pre hash are you

276
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:31,079
opposed to must not cumulative or do you

277
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,899
not have<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information to decide so</font>

278
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:39,128
all those in favor please hum advance

279
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:40,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay are you in favor of the texts are</font>

280
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:42,910
you it's like prom about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ballot</font>

281
00:15:40,809 --> 00:15:44,759
propositions are you in favor of the

282
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:50,769
text as written in the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet</font>

283
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:52,389
please home now okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you opposed to</font>

00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:57,189
the text in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first bullet you</font>

285
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:58,540
disagree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it okay do you not have</font>

286
00:15:57,189 --> 00:16:02,589
enough information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to a</font>

287
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:04,540
conclusion right now okay so that was

288
00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:06,670
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong could consensus to leave</font>

289
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,618
the text is currently written will

290
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:14,259
confirm it on the mailing list you got

291
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:16,600
that action item for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me m okay next</font>

292
00:16:14,259 --> 00:16:19,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">slide I think is basically punt yeah</font>

293
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,480
we're getting to bring it up okay um

294
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,429
assuming<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the next issue goes the</font>

295
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,410
way it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I need to do a read-through</font>

296
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:31,119
but I think actually the document is

297
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:34,149
probably finished okay arm so we'll look

298
00:16:31,119 --> 00:16:36,369
sick will expect the number there has

299
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:41,170
been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group last call called on</font>

300
00:16:36,369 --> 00:16:42,790
it was it yes okay and if you update it

301
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,069
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this morning yeah okay let's</font>

302
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:49,740
remember those<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security</font>

303
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:57,579
considerations as was explained calm

304
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:59,980
bullet no<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that devil okay</font>

305
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:02,739
for the record the question was<font color="#E5E5E5"> does the</font>

306
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,220
security considerations contain the con

307
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,659
bullet will put that I mean yeah making

308
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,959
the trade-offs explicit is a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

309
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:12,610
will I don't think we need to redo a

310
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,839
less call it just add that sentence

311
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:18,520
assuming yeah so Kyle Rose does does

312
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,849
that belong in the security

313
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,770
considerations section is more like an

314
00:17:21,849 --> 00:17:26,948
<font color="#CCCCCC">implementation consideration that is a</font>

315
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:30,158
result of the security consideration put

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:32,140
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the chair use your editorial</font>

the ssh dress so one of them we believe

323
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,720
is ready for last call how many people

324
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:14,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">have read how to use RSA sha-2 with ssh</font>

325
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Kyle good that's almost enough expertise</font>

326
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:23,149
for the chairs too Kyle yeah that's his

327

333
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,780
we'll go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> last call it's basically</font>

334
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:46,340
ready there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing wrong with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it uh</font>

335
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:50,389
these three has anybody been involved

336
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:53,750
with the ssh curdle drafts at all mark

337
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:55,850
is not here at juniper he's bent over

338
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,280
backwards to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with folks um</font>

339
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,469
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened is sort of two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

340
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,870
sets of authors have come together<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

341
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:04,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not convinced and I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think anyone</font>

342
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,320
has actually convinced that we've split

343
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,830
things out into the necessary set of

344
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:16,429
documents yet um so any bud ice has

345
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:18,770
anybody here read any of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we'd</font>

346
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:20,630
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to none of them are very</font>

347
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:22,070
long I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we have any document</font>

348
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:24,590
in our queue that's more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 pages</font>

349
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,899
and if you consider three of those or

350
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:35,209
boilerplate you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty simple</font>

351
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:38,300
um so sorry uh Kyle<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose the the third</font>

352
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:41,270
one does that incorporate the discussion

353
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:43,490
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the problems with finite field</font>

354
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,680
to be home in like and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically</font>

355
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">does it a numerator way to choose groups</font>

356
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,350
I mean I since i'm ready i don't even

357
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,460
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the scope of that document is</font>

358
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,469
I don't remember cuz<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

359
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,690
risa it was past my cutoff deadline for

360
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:58,140
reading dress for this thing so yeah I'm

361
00:19:54,690 --> 00:20:00,180
not sure I think what we'll do is we'll

362
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:02,550
try to start a discussion over the

363
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:06,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">following week or two about in general</font>

364
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:08,399
the ssh documents these these three<font color="#E5E5E5"> arm</font>

365
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,680
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of overlap we want to make</font>

366
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,200
sure there isn't we had problems point

367
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:16,440
into old drafts and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so please if</font>

368
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,810
you'd all care or use about<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH and I</font>

369
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">think almost everybody does you know</font>

370
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,720
read it get your colleague to okay so

371
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,330
that concludes the drafts<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

372
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:31,230
probably a couple more coming one of the

373
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:33,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">things that Dana and I talked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about was</font>

374
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,310
doing something<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar for ipsec where</font>

375
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,370
we just go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through the rfcs and made me</font>

376
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:42,690
make an eye on a registry um he'll bring

377
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,969
that up later on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the list and of course</font>

378
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:49,410
I'd be sec me he's got main ownership

379
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:54,570
that contexts I'm not going to move to

380
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:56,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mic acting not as chair um so we all</font>

381
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,639
thought security<font color="#E5E5E5"> context a signature</font>

382
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,700
context for a good idea maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

383
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:06,210
months ago six months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago because TLS</font>

384
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:09,330
thought so because at the time TLS had

385
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:11,550
issues till the way TLS 13 was going to

386
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,590
work is you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> do key reuse in some</font>

387
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:15,600
bad ways and you could make you could

388
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:20,790
end up signing things it could be reused

389
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:24,449
in the wrong spot TLS 13 since fixed

390
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:27,530
that problem I for the cases where we

391
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it say the EDD SI p kicks</font>

392
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,730
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we've come up with better</font>

393
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:36,179
solutions to that like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> no hash</font>

394
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:40,110
mechanism so while the CFR<font color="#E5E5E5"> g signature</font>

395
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:43,920
formats<font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> include a context say for</font>

396
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:49,290
future extensibility we the general

397
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:51,420
advice from people on this side of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

398
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">room is probably that we don't need them</font>

399
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:58,950
anymore and so what I propose that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

400
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:02,760
is we say look we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> just gonna don't do</font>

401
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:06,310
them so that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the proposal</font>

402
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,560
more formally as co-chair whenever this

403
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:11,500
signature format has a context for the

404
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:15,730
existing specs that we've got and the

405
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:18,250
way they're being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used in PK xcm sssh we</font>

406
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:21,490
say it's an empty context you know 00

407
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:26,290
link bites um so I any<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion on</font>

408
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:29,770
that anyone disagree<font color="#E5E5E5"> with my history or</font>

409
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:32,230
view of how TLS sort of confused us all

410
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:40,480
for a bit and now we're not we then woke

411
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:44,560
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yeah any let's take a hum</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

412
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:46,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">consensus of the room um I think it's</font>

413
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:48,790
good you know you agree that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should</font>

414
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,470
have zero length context you disagree

415
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">with that or you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know enough to</font>

416
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:55,570
decide and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again these will all be</font>

417
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:59,320
reconfirmed on the list<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all those in</font>

418
00:22:55,570 --> 00:23:01,030
favor of no contexts<font color="#E5E5E5"> all level-</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stake</font>

419
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,370
all those in favor of saying it's an

420
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:09,280
empty context in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our specs please</font>

421
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:14,320
have now all those opposed to requiring

422
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:16,120
an empty context come down all those not

423
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">ableton to all those who need more</font>

424
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,810
