1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,500
as long as it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you everyone</font>

2
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:20,970
sorry for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the late start so welcome</font>

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,820
today to the EDT edu tutorial on DNS

4
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,029
privacy my name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sarah Dickinson very</font>

5
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,429
glad to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see so many faces here today so</font>

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,040
I'll move forward on to the overview<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

7
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,870
what we'll talk about today so the

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,390
tutorial is basically split up into

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:39,629
three sections the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> section is</font>

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a background of why are we</font>

11
00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:44,940
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> dearness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy as an</font>

12
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:48,300
issue and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> did this arise and to kick</font>

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">that off Daniel can't Gilmore has kindly</font>

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:52,649
agreed to give a few slides to set this

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,809
in the context of the bigger picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

16
00:00:52,649 --> 00:01:00,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet privacy after that we'll move</font>

17
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:02,039
on to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the huge amount of work</font>

18
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's been done over the last three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

19
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,820
four years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this area a lot of it</font>

20
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,159
through the ITF a lot of it through the

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">deep</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I working group and then finally</font>

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,390
I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> status of</font>

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:16,229
implementations deployment and tools

24
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,549
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are available today so thank you so</font>

25
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,548
<font color="#E5E5E5">without further ado I'll hand over</font>

26
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:34,309
so I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a little bit to</font>

27
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:39,979
set the frame for why dns privacy

28
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:41,360
matters more generally it matters sort

29
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,119
of there's a bigger picture why<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,649
privacy on the Internet itself matter so

31
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:50,000
just to try to motivate it so that we're

32
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:54,259
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this stuff sort of on the</font>

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,429
same page<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can looks like it doesn't</font>

34
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:57,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to do the full screen thing</font>

35
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:16,170
is it a one page yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so so</font>

36
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,560
the concern here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there's sort of</font>

37
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:22,079
an issue of possibility of a centralized

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,000
surveillance state acting as a form of

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,370
social control now you might you might

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,650
be concerned about governmental control

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:31,650
you might be concerned about criminal

42
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,690
control blackmail a range of other

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">things but basically whoever controls</font>

44
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,810
the network if the network is

45
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:38,790
transparent about what's going on has

46
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,310
potentially a lot more power over the

47
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:43,530
citizens so the people who use the

48
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,350
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a this is a plan for</font>

49
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the panopticon which is a prison that's</font>

50
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:50,489
designed so that a warden sitting in the

51
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,830
central tower of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prison can</font>

52
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:54,510
effectively see everybody in<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of the</font>

53
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,000
cells around the outside and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that</font>

54
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:59,100
allows one or a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> small amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,570
people to the guards in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case to</font>

56
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">have control</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over a very large</font>

57
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,430
population I find that troubling and I'd

58
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,960
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that network where the</font>

59
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,400
smarts are at the edges doesn't make it

60
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:12,680
so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the center actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has control</font>

61
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:18,630
over the smarts at the edges so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

62
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:20,459
so so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS when we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think about what</font>

63
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:23,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">goes on in the DNS we're often thinking</font>

64
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,170
about sort of that is basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,089
little bits of metadata like what host

66
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,220
names are you looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and that's</font>

67
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,010
associational host data so a request

68
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,020
comes from you for a particular name

69
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,100
those names potentially mean things and

70
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,780
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just point out that like</font>

71
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,519
associational surveillance is actually

72
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the most sophisticated form</font>

73
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,900
surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have if you're</font>

74
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:44,160
thinking about global surveillance the

75
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,989
it feels creepy to think of somebody

76
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,760
knowing what you're saying but actually

77
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,209
the things that machines can learn at

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,579
scale are significantly<font color="#CCCCCC"> more powerful</font>

79
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,770
these days than just content analysis

80
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,690
and so this associational<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff this is</font>

81
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,640
a slide from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the elite slide from the</font>

82
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:01,920
NSA<font color="#CCCCCC"> their only one of the groups who are</font>

83
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:05,160
doing sir like intense associational

84
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,420
surveillance but the the kind of

85
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,310
associational surveillance they can do

86
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,410
is mapping particular people to

87
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,800
particular groups so you can imagine

88
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,490
with the DNS the mapping the sorts of

89
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,860
mappings that could go on

90
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,329
like did you visit Alcoholics Anonymous

91
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,370
that well that tell somebody something

92
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,440
so whoever<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls the network has an</font>

93
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:25,630
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know if they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

94
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">watching what traffic goes on what sorts</font>

95
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,590
of people have connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what sorts</font>

96
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:35,230
of groups so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS is part of that so</font>

97
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:37,390
you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides here so it's</font>

98
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:40,420
also not just host names right the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

99
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,830
has we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it as most commonly it's</font>

100
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,450
just we're going to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up an address</font>

101
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,099
from a name but there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

102
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,960
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can be stored in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and</font>

103
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,640
if you look around what's going on at

104
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,250
the IETF there are a bunch of other

105
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:53,229
opportunities to use the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS that are</font>

106
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,760
not just host names they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

107
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,950
widely used of course as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

108
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,270
lookups that we're all familiar with but

109
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,800
in fact there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other stuff</font>

110
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:03,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's coming down the pike there's old</font>

111
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,080
stuff like<font color="#E5E5E5"> MX records which which will</font>

112
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,599
actually leaked information about what

113
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,800
what domain you're emailing to and then

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
there's things like Oakland pgp key

115
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,580
where you might actually end up sending

116
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,570
the name of whoever you're contacting

117
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,669
directly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so another name but the</font>

118
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,349
individual email account which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

119
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,310
significantly larger privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak so</font>

120
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,920
there's a bunch of other stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

121
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:25,450
could go on in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS and people want</font>

122
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use the DNS for that and so we need</font>

123
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:29,979
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that DNS queries aren't as</font>

124
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:35,890
obviously subject to associational

125
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:37,390
surveillance and so so just just to sort

126
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of reinforce why I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the social</font>

127
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,219
control issue is a thing here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

128
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:44,140
a study that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was done i think this this</font>

129
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,460
year at the beginning of this year where

130
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,590
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically took a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

131
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:49,270
and they asked them their opinion on

132
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:51,940
some topics that were fairly contentious

133
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:56,620
and then they asked them their opinion

134
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,880
of about the sentence is it like

135
00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:00,490
basically is sent<font color="#CCCCCC"> is centralized</font>

136
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,500
surveillance<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and it turns out that</font>

137
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,820
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of along the lines of if</font>

138
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,110
you're not worried about it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

139
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,280
nothing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hide you've got nothing to</font>

140
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,690
worry about right<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lot of</font>

141
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who have that sort of instinctive</font>

142
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,590
response and it turns out the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

143
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,419
say if you're not you know I've got

144
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:14,859
nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide I'm not worried about</font>

145
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,720
surveillance surveillance is justified

146
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,850
to eat society safe the people who say

147
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,380
that when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to things where they</font>

148
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:22,150
are in the minority where they feel like

149
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,850
they are more in conflict they're

150
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,650
actually less likely to speak up so this

151
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">is actually an ecosystem problem where</font>

152
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that we have all of this</font>

153
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,980
additional

154
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,750
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are less likely to</font>

155
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:35,270
dissent and our society was less likely

156
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,100
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to evolve so these are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

157
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,330
like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are different groups of</font>

158
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,730
people who have different<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinions about</font>

159
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,219
the legitimacy of surveillance and the

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">graph here shows friendly neutral and</font>

161
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,040
hostile so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're saying</font>

162
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">something into a hostile environment and</font>

163
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,630
you think surveillance is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you're</font>

164
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,310
actually less likely to speak up at all

165
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,840
so there's a chilling factor of having

166
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:55,730
the centralized surveillance<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's not</font>

167
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about are you individually</font>

168
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:59,600
concerned about being spied on it's

169
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,190
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what can society do as a like how</font>

to society change have the behavior

people to not to feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are</font>

communicate with<font color="#E5E5E5"> people even in an</font>

00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:17,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel like it's hostile environment and I</font>

178
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,310
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to point out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that DNS is one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

179
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,800
piece of these leakages right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

180
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:23,810
a boat here dns is leaking in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle</font>

181
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,270
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the boat but there's leaks coming</font>

182
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:28,610
from the TLS layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the server name</font>

183
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:30,620
indication in TLS leaks there's leaks

184
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,020
from the traffic size of different kinds

185
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of packets that you send timing patterns</font>

186
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,159
there's probably lots of other leaks

187
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:39,500
that we don't know about and a lot of

188
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,070
times in IETF we're working in<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

189
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,630
little silos and I've heard in multiple

190
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,920
situations people say oh well we don't

191
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,630
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry about that leakage because</font>

192
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:49,850
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just as bad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as this other leakage</font>

193
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:51,680
that's happening somewhere else well in

194
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">a leaky boat scenario you actually need</font>

195
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to fix all the leaks you can't just say</font>

196
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,320
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to fix my leak because</font>

197
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,910
this other leak over here is leaking

198
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,090
also right we want the boat to stay

199
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,710
afloat so the motivation here is to try

200
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,929
to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get I</font>

201
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,549
mean there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work ahead of us</font>

202
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,930
we actually these are theoretical

203
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,250
concerns and some of these like the

204
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,690
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> marks there are real question</font>

205
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:13,790
marks like these are there's ongoing

206
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,200
academic research about what kind of

207
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:16,970
information can be determined<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

208
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,440
things like timing patterns and we don't

209
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">have all the answers but we know that if</font>

210
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,719
we don't fix the things that we know how

211
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,580
to fix we're not going to get to all of

212
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,500
them so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just a motivation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for why</font>

213
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,640
we care about DNS privacy it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

214
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,920
to solve all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems but it's a</font>

215
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,580
step in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that direction so give it back</font>

216
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,580
to server

217
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
wait

218
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:53,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much so I hope</font>

219
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's given you a flavor for some of</font>

220
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:57,810
the context of what we'll talk about

221
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:01,000
today so what I first<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to do is</font>

222
00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:02,680
before we dive right deep into what's

223
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,180
been happening doing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it's talk a</font>

224
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,760
little bit about what's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening</font>

225
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,550
at the ITF level in general in terms of

226
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,620
privacy now of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the Snowden</font>

227
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,719
revelations were a big thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it got</font>

228
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:16,390
popular awareness about mass

229
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,100
surveillance and out there a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

230
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:20,380
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of tend to think that kind</font>

231
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,820
of caught the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IETF napping but what I</font>

232
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to illustrate here is that really</font>

233
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">really isn't true the IDF was very</font>

234
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,120
actively involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> in all sorts of</font>

235
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:30,700
privacy work well before that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there were</font>

236
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,530
numerous workshops and quite importantly

237
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:37,870
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> March 2011 work was started on a</font>

238
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,030
draft that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to guide protocol</font>

239
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:42,220
developers on how to add privacy

240
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:43,900
considerations into their drafts in a

241
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,090
very similar manner as to the way

242
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:48,910
security considerations are quite

243
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:51,430
naturally put in draft so the folks

244
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,050
behind that started back in 2011 and

245
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:55,180
they were right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the verge of getting</font>

246
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,560
it published as an RC when Edward

247
00:09:55,180 --> 00:10:01,569
Snowden revealed his<font color="#E5E5E5"> um a data to the</font>

00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">world so you kind of got a feel for</font>

249
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,430
these guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit get me my</font>

250
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,709
Thunder stolen there but what the IDF

251
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,620
did is it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back swinging it very</font>

252
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:15,670
quickly reacted with a very important

253
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:17,880
document which is RFC 7258 and this

254
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,130
declares clearly that pervasive

255
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:23,800
monitoring is an attack I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

256
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:25,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more in a moment the work</font>

257
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,750
at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea level has continued though</font>

258
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,580
there are several other RFC's in this

259
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,110
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> drafts in progress</font>

260
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,390
so I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to illustrate that there</font>

261
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:36,460
is a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work going on at the</font>

262
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,640
leadership level in the ITF with regards

263
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:42,940
to privacy I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pull out</font>

264
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:47,050
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of statements from RFC</font>

265
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:49,240
2558 in terms of clarifying that the

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">IITs position on this is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pervasive</font>

267
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,820
monitoring is an attack on internet

268

users and organizations and the declared

269
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,160
aim in future protocol developments is

270
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,000
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> mitigate the effects of monitoring</font>

271
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,520
through pro

272
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,710
Cole design so doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at the lowest</font>

273
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,170
level not necessarily operationally but

274
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:14,170
making sure protocol design takes us

275
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:17,920
into account so to move on to see where

276
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:21,030
this inter intersected with<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS so if</font>

277
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,010
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think back back in time a little bit</font>

278
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:25,839
first of all I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to time travel you</font>

00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:41,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">music and the DNS has been standardized</font>

285
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:45,340
at that time and to put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in context at</font>

286
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:48,430
that time it was a building block in the

287
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:51,030
internet and the main goals behind the

288
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:55,540
design of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure of the DNS</font>

289
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:58,150
were availability redundancy and also

290
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:59,530
speed so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things that for</font>

291
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,640
most in the people who are developing

292
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:06,760
the protocol in privacy terms the DNS is

293
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,310
described as an enabler it's a system

294
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:11,589
that you use to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to other services</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

295
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,390
you want to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a web page you go via</font>

296
00:12:11,589 --> 00:12:16,589
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS you want to email something you</font>

297
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:19,360
go via the DNS so that's where it sits

298
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:22,240
now the Sun it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was still true of the</font>

299
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,400
standards in 2003 that the standard

300
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,470
transports for<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS work UDP and TCP and</font>

301
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,970
even last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> over ninety-nine percent</font>

302
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:34,030
of the traffic going up to the route

303
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:36,880
went over UDP and importantly this is

304
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:39,400
clear text so all you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

305
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,950
queries are going clear text over the

306
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,870
internet so this meant this was fair

307
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:46,510
game for<font color="#CCCCCC"> somebody like the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA with</font>

309
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:51,939
a tricky<font color="#CCCCCC"> job for them to monitored in</font>

310
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,550
ass traffic because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way it moves</font>

311
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,950
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Internet there was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> small</font>

312
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,699
of TC amount of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp around but it was</font>

313
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:02,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">really only used for corner cases there</font>

314
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,560
was also at this time and for much of

315
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:08,530
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25 year time period here</font>

316
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:09,699
that I'm spanning a perception that the

317
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:12,009
DNS is

318
00:13:09,699 --> 00:13:13,868
like right<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean anybody can query</font>

319
00:13:12,009 --> 00:13:15,879
these records anybody can get to them

320
00:13:13,869 --> 00:13:18,309
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't contain personal or sensitive</font>

321
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:20,139
information so we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need to</font>

322
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:22,329
worry<font color="#E5E5E5"> about encrypting this or</font>

323
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:25,949
protecting us in any way it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

324
00:13:22,329 --> 00:13:28,929
and that was out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a long time</font>

325
00:13:25,949 --> 00:13:30,758
so you have to bear those things in mind

326
00:13:28,929 --> 00:13:33,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">when you look at the design of the dns</font>

327
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:37,119
and be a bit forgiving so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

328
00:13:33,249 --> 00:13:39,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">basics of how the dns works you're on</font>

329
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:42,249
some client machine you want to resolve

330
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:43,929
a name you send the full name up to the

331
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:46,720
recursive server that you're using now

332
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:49,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the DNS does is if it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doesn't have</font>

333
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">that name in cash it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sends the entire</font>

334
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:56,019
name up to a root server to get a

335
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:58,629
delegation for in this case dot org then

336
00:13:56,019 --> 00:14:01,540
it sends the entire query to the doctor

337
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:03,069
or authoritative server and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

338
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,738
the chain until it gets to the one that

00:14:03,069 --> 00:14:08,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">can provide the answer now with</font>

341
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:12,910
look at this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and go oh that infamous bad</font>

342
00:14:11,109 --> 00:14:15,910
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> ferry was around when they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

343
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,759
of this right because those do queries

344
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:21,399
are leaking information who a troop

345
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,499
needs to know the full question that the

346
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,079
client asked they don't need to in order

347
00:14:23,499 --> 00:14:31,119
to resolve it but this was how the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

348
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:33,399
was designed originally something else

349
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:37,239
interesting happened just about this

350
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:38,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">time frame as well 2013 and that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

351
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:42,249
standardization of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanism called</font>

352
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:44,319
Eden s0 now this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a really nice idea</font>

353
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:47,230
and something the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS really needed it</font>

354
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:50,789
enabled embedding information inside DNS

355
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:52,989
query that was flexible it could contain

356
00:14:50,789 --> 00:14:55,209
capability options it could allow

357
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:57,249
clients and service to negotiate things

358
00:14:55,209 --> 00:15:01,569
like path MTU it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> great the dearness</font>

359
00:14:57,249 --> 00:15:05,339
needed it as a side effect though what

360
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:08,108
this did is it enabled certain

361
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,079
organizations to take advantage<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

362
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:13,959
to embed user data directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> inside those</font>

363
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:15,878
<font color="#E5E5E5">DNS queries but the way this was</font>

364
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:18,488
positioned at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time was that it was</font>

365
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,429
all for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> greater good so for example</font>

366
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mechanisms here was ISPs</font>

367
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:25,290
saying

368
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:27,509
we want to offer you filtering parental

369
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:29,728
filtering protect your kids or even<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

370
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:32,579
sophisticated filtering and we can do

371
00:15:29,729 --> 00:15:36,649
this at our cursors if we know who's

372
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:40,349
making those queries similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDNs</font>

373
00:15:36,649 --> 00:15:42,720
argued that if we know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

374
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,789
located geographically we can divert you

375
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,009
to your nearest server and you will get

376
00:15:44,789 --> 00:15:48,929
great streaming and your cat videos will

377
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:50,579
never bother again isn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wonderful</font>

378
00:15:48,929 --> 00:15:53,069
aren't we<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing you a great</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> customer</font>

379
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:55,738
service so this all sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> great and</font>

380
00:15:53,069 --> 00:15:58,189
people sign up for it what they don't

381
00:15:55,739 --> 00:16:02,309
realize is what this means in practice

382
00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:04,978
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way the user identification</font>

383
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:07,829
worked is that your<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP would give you a</font>

384
00:16:04,979 --> 00:16:10,199
Rooter and very often<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Russa</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

385
00:16:07,829 --> 00:16:12,209
add into the DNS queries as they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came</font>

386
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:14,368
out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your home network information</font>

387
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,829
about you that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a MAC address in</font>

388
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:19,799
some cases it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> observed that it was</font>

389
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:22,138
usernames or user IDs something unique

390
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,539
and that meant they could do their

391
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:27,029
filtering<font color="#CCCCCC"> at recursive but it also meant</font>

392
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,129
that anybody who is passively monitoring

393
00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">that link could immediately correlate</font>

394
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:35,069
all those queries with the activities of

395
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:37,079
individuals behind that router so that

396
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:39,029
could allow not only for identification

397
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,969
of individuals but<font color="#E5E5E5"> tracking of</font>

398
00:16:39,029 --> 00:16:45,089
individuals as well in a very similar

399
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:47,609
manner the way the client subnet worked

400
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:49,709
was that there was an implementation in

401
00:16:47,609 --> 00:16:52,859
the recursive that said well we know who

402
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">sent us this query pick up the subnet</font>

403
00:16:52,859 --> 00:16:57,059
and send that<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to the authoritative so</font>

404
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,069
it can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out their geolocation but</font>

405
00:16:57,059 --> 00:17:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">again this is leaking information to</font>

406
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:03,839
anybody passively monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> that link</font>

407
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">up the authoritative again creating</font>

408
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,269
correlations within the data with the

409
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:10,889
activity of users or groups of users so

410
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:12,628
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this really means is even when</font>

411
00:17:10,888 --> 00:17:14,938
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're sat at home you're behind in that</font>

412
00:17:12,628 --> 00:17:16,678
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anonymity you</font>

413
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,209
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily and even though you're</font>

414
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:21,299
behind a recursive only think you've got

415
00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:23,069
anonymity you don't necessarily and both

416
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:25,289
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these were done originally with</font>

417
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,059
non-standard options some of them are

418
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:30,139
now coming through the standards process

419
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:32,100
but there really<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't anything to stop</font>

420
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:33,719
organizations doing this because people

421
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,300
happy to sign up to the services which

422
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,060
sounded

423
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:41,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">eight and as dkg alluded to the kind of</font>

you on both of these legs so I don't

00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:48,280
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> me but I'm at home before I</font>

427
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,350
came here I was looking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

428
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,940
conference I was going to what<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotel I</font>

429
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,949
was staying a hat with<font color="#CCCCCC"> flights I was</font>

430
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,560
taking so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> reveals an awful lot</font>

431
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:58,120
about me including how distracted I can

432
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,560
get when I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put a big slide</font>

433
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,629
deck together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what site so go</font>

434
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,280
wandering off ting but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font>

435
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:07,510
information they can correlate back to

436
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,639
me so I hope at this point I've got your

437
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">spidey senses tingling with the idea</font>

438
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,420
that there's all sorts of stuff going on

439
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,370
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS that you don't necessarily</font>

440
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,360
know about an end user even if you're

441
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,550
quite technically aware to take this

442
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,860
another step further so we've looked at

443
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:26,470
the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of leakages you get on DNS</font>

444
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:30,010
queries that are in flight this is

445
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:32,530
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them at rest so you have</font>

446
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,360
a recursive resolve that you're using so

447
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:36,399
you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop considering who are the</font>

448
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,290
people who have authorized access to the

449
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,900
data there to what's been blogged about

450
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:42,879
all the queries coming in what's third

451
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:44,740
parties<font color="#CCCCCC"> are they sharing it with what</font>

452
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,500
legal commitments do they have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> gather</font>

453
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">data on users equally what are the risks</font>

454
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,030
of unauthorized access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that data how</font>

455
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:55,390
solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the security could there be</font>

456
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:57,070
breaches and also those concerns will

457
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:00,250
change as you move around different

458
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,659
curses<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as you're at home at at work I</font>

459
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">should rent a coffee shop as you're in a</font>

460
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">hotel so and these are things that</font>

461
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:08,860
people aren't necessarily aware of

462
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:10,420
equally<font color="#E5E5E5"> those concerns extend up to the</font>

463
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,550
authoritative because as you can see

464
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:18,210
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up to that level</font>

465
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:20,560
about the activity of individuals so

466
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,940
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of salient points</font>

467
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,470
about DNS data leakage there are an

468
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,060
awful lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of complications I want to</font>

469
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,590
just touch on one here which is

470
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,090
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which particularly lately has</font>

471
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,959
become more active and that's Dennis

472
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:34,449
filtering so this is happening a country

473
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,450
level and isp level organizational level

474
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,850
and its activities whereby people

475
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,410
running recursos will have a black list

476
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,669
of sites they don't want people to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

477
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:47,440
to and they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually tell Dina</font>

478
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,730
in order to block access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to those sites</font>

479
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,590
again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying to be done</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

480
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,800
greater good keep you away from websites

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:56,540
infected with malware etc although

482
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,639
accidentally some other sites get

483
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,980
blocked every now and again that you

484
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,740
might want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get to like Google this</font>

485
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:05,930
has happened by accident um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

486
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:07,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing to think about is if you are using</font>

487
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:10,700
a recursive it engages in this kind of

488
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,350
behavior with these<font color="#CCCCCC"> black lists how</font>

489
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,020
likely do you think they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are to track</font>

490
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:17,149
users who trigger their black blocking

491
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,280
do to try to access one of these

492
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:23,990
blacklisted sites<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you do it by</font>

493
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:25,940
accident so this table tries to

494
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:28,730
summarize the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hotspots in terms of DNS</font>

495
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:31,490
data liquid leakage in terms of what's

496
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:33,740
happening on the wire and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> rest and</font>

497
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:35,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll come back to this later and show</font>

498
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,940
you where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are in terms of tackling</font>

499
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:42,500
this so that's a picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> in classic DNS</font>

500
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,670
as you know it I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend just a</font>

501
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,280
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time talking about</font>

502
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:49,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">something which is called dns service</font>

503
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:53,420
discovery so this happens within local

504
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,610
networks and the mechanisms used can be

505
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,730
regular<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS constrained to that local</font>

506
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,649
network or it can be multicast DNS what

507
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,630
this does is essentially the procedure

508
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:06,170
whereby a device can advertise some

509
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:09,080
services that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is willing to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> make</font>

510
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:11,990
public and other devices can discover

511
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,370
those services and use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

512
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,650
really cool because it means<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can do</font>

513
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,060
stuff like file sharing photo sharing

514
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:20,330
all sorts of stuff directly over the

515
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:22,429
network and that's nice and most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

516
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,040
services that utilize this are secure

517
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:27,800
the problem comes in advertising those

518
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:29,690
services now I can see a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch of</font>

519
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:31,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">max here and I know that if you simply</font>

520
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:35,030
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> open find when look in your sidebar</font>

521
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,070
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can probably see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole load</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

522
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:39,590
devices advertised and I bet a whole

523
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:42,320
bunch of them have names or identifies

524
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:44,270
in them and very typically the kind of

525
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,669
thing you might see is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

advertising what you're doing here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

with um<font color="#CCCCCC"> the way this information is</font>

557

advertising the amount of detail it

contains so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might quite</font>

advertised from an individual<font color="#E5E5E5"> user and</font>

561
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,800
you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what they want to</font>

00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,350
then suddenly<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a really good</font>

569
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea of who Alice actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you also</font>

570
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,219
know that she's got two devices and you

571
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,650
know she's willing to share photos and

572
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,870
that she uses<font color="#E5E5E5"> a chat application that</font>

573
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:40,490
supports presence so not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you</font>

574
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,439
know a bit about her but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you've got</font>

575
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:44,150
is a fingerprint here so you can see

576
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fingerprint as it moves around</font>

577
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,010
networks and that means you've got user

578
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:52,070
tracking capabilities and this goes

579
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:55,400
beyond tracking user it can go deep dive

580
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:58,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">into exposing information about for</font>

581
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,910
example when you advertise these

582
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,590
services you also often advertised

583
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,840
attributes about<font color="#E5E5E5"> them so for example</font>

584
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:07,840
which ports they use which part it says

585
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,000
you they use lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of details</font>

586
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,908
and intelligent attackers it has been

587
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,159
shown can actually use this to determine

588
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:16,929
things like which software version you

589
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:19,299
are running and therefore that means

590
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:22,510
they might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect known</font>

591
00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:24,129
exploits in unpatched software similarly

592
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:26,140
they can actually dive right down to

593
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,080
specific devices if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

594
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:31,870
information so<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this is leakage of</font>

595
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:33,789
personal information that non-technical

596
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">users are probably very unaware of and</font>

597
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:40,270
even technical users might not

598
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:42,428
understand the full gravity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

599
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:45,520
what I wanted to do quickly was just say

600
00:24:42,429 --> 00:24:47,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so back then if he were savvy to</font>

601
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,320
dinner perfectly being a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

602
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:52,960
were your choices at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there were</font>

603
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,789
a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things available DNS curve</font>

604
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,010
was around for a little while<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dena</font>

605
00:24:54,789 --> 00:24:59,200
script was developed and is still<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

606
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,740
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number of implementations so</font>

607
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,740
and in fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> OpenDNS offer that as a</font>

608
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:08,110
mechanism when you use their resolvers

609
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,360
and what I do want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to spell out though</font>

610
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,149
is that the real<font color="#E5E5E5"> motivation behind these</font>

611
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,889
mechanisms was authentication of the

612
00:25:13,149 --> 00:25:16,959
information exchanged between clients

613
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,200
and servers so it was about anti

614
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,330
spoofing and anti dosing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the privacy</font>

615
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,880
benefits largely came as a side effect

616
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:27,250
because crypto is used to achieve that

617
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,690
these weren't first and foremost privacy

618
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:33,669
mechanisms to protect users also

619
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:35,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">although these were documented neither</font>

620
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually made it to through the</font>

621
00:25:35,169 --> 00:25:40,600
standards process other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

622
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">people were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chose to</font>

623
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,889
run local resolvers on their machines

624
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:46,659
and the main aim here was to bypass

625
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:48,880
those intermediate recursos so you

626
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:50,260
weren't exposing your data to them it

627
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,240
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve the whole problem because</font>

628
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:54,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're then exposing your client address</font>

629
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,630
directly to the authoritative but some

630
00:25:54,429 --> 00:26:00,630
people felt<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was a better choice</font>

631
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:03,460
than using an intermediate<font color="#E5E5E5"> worker sir</font>

632
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,500
also what came out around this time was

633
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:07,570
a total dns trigger now again<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

634
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:10,510
motivation<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this was to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enable DNS</font>

635
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:12,700
SEC on an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user computer and the</font>

636
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy aspects were a byproduct but</font>

637
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:17,200
what it did was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> used as a last ditch</font>

638
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,229
to tempt DNS over TLS

639
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,870
port 443 but what this did mean is there

640
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,360
was an implementation of encrypted DNS

641
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,639
out in the wild that some users were

642
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,219
able to monopolize and use for<font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font>

643
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:35,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">ends to do private DNS even at this</font>

644
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:37,750
early stage so having talked about the

645
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:40,090
historical context of this I wanted to

646
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:41,620
move on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and talk about what's been</font>

647
00:26:40,090 --> 00:26:44,740
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the most in the recent</font>

648
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:46,870
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when the main places this work</font>

649
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:49,779
has happened is the deprived working

650
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:51,939
group and this was created<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 2014 in</font>

651
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:54,610
the wake of the Snowden revelations and

652
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:57,669
the desire by the IETF to mitigate

653
00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,879
monitoring through protocol design now

654
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:02,919
this had no small task before it you're

655
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,010
talking about taking the DNS which has

656
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,169
been a bass rock of the internet for

657
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,210
30-some years and worked in largely the

658
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:12,789
same way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 30-some years and</font>

659
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:15,100
what you have to magically do sprinkle

660
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:16,809
it with a layer of privacy with minimal

661
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,168
impact and try not to disrupt the

662
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:23,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet while you do it so where do you</font>

663
00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">start well this was a big problem and</font>

664
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">what the working group decided in its</font>

665
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,908
initial<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter was to focus solely on</font>

666
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:33,429
the stub to recursive and step of this

667
00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:36,429
and there are various reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> for this</font>

668
00:27:33,429 --> 00:27:40,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">two are summarized are one is that that</font>

669
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:42,309
stub to recursive stage leaks the most

670
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:43,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so if you can tackle that</font>

671
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:47,379
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going a long way towards helping</font>

672
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,049
and users secondly the recursive to

673
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,429
authoritative stage is quite challenging

674
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you come to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about how you're</font>

675
00:27:51,429 --> 00:27:55,090
going to do authentication of

676
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:58,360
connections in that environment and the

677
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:59,830
reason is this if you're an<font color="#E5E5E5"> end-user you</font>

678
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:03,549
your relationship<font color="#CCCCCC"> with recursive</font>

679
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:05,980
services is one to a few you have the

680
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:07,629

681

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> but generally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you either have a</font>

683
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:13,480
resolver all you make a conscious choice

684
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,110
to use it by going through<font color="#CCCCCC"> a captive</font>

685
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:18,429
portal or joining a network whatever

686
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:20,799
whereas if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're a recursive server</font>

687
00:28:18,429 --> 00:28:22,690
your job is to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to all and any</font>

688
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:25,658
authoritative servers that you need to

689
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:27,190
in order to resolve a name that you have

690
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:29,560
been asked for and many

691
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:32,620
you may never ever have talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you</font>

692
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:36,100
before so that makes authenticating the

693
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:37,810
one too many unknowns difficult so think

694
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,520
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit like your phone</font>

695
00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:45,429
contacts compared to your Twitter

696
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:47,110
followers who do you know best so the

697
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:50,440
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the working group did</font>

698
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:54,550
has it decided to enumerate the problem

699
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">space and it produced RFC 7626 now this</font>

700
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">is highly recommended read it basically</font>

701
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,480
goes through the kind of situations that

702
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,430
I talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the first part of the</font>

703
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,010
discussion here today but in much more

704
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:07,720
detail and also goes through other cases

705
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:09,340
of leakage so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really worth</font>

706
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:13,000
looking at to understand the details of

707
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:14,919
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I'm really keeping that</font>

708
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,610
this document does though is it robots

709
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:22,030
the alleged public nature of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and</font>

710
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:25,949
the distinction it makes is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yes the</font>

711
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:29,350
data in the DNS might be public but an

712
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:32,320
individual DNS transaction is not and

713
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,540

00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:52,240
to get that record<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not and should not</font>

be public that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is your personal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data so</font>

721
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,900
that's a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clear idea to keep in</font>

722
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:01,209
your mind as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> move forward so having</font>

723
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:03,490
established the problem we now start

724
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:04,810
looking at solutions and there were

725
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:06,520
various ones that could have been looked

726
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,970
at and some of the well-known

727
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,920
technologies some dns specific solutions

728
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:13,240
were offered as well and drafts on all

729
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,360
of these came forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

730
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,860
group at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time the ones that got</font>

731
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:21,429
really serious consideration with these

732
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,530
three starts here<font color="#E5E5E5"> less initially seemed</font>

733
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:26,380
very attractive it could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> done on port</font>

734
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:28,060
53 it could be incrementally deployed it

735
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:31,720
was a known technique that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> all nice</font>

736
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,000
on downside though obviously the

737
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,700
negotiation can be susceptible to a

738
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,380
downgrade attack that negotiation can

739
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:44,580
also introduce latency and l word

740
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:46,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">dear</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> folks really don't like and there</font>

741
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,000
was also sort of big question mark about

742
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:50,700
hang on there's all these<font color="#E5E5E5"> Reuters that</font>

743
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">get DNS traffic on port 53 are they</font>

744
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,940
certainly going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> freak out if they</font>

745
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:56,399
start seeing encrypted traffic and just

746
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,150
block it Oh again I have real deployment

747
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:02,070
problems here it was an unknown so if

748
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,010
discussion moved on to looking at doing

749
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:09,929
TLS or detail s over a brand new port if

750
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:13,020
we could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> one now if we could TLS is</font>

751
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:14,700
you know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

752
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,680
there's a lot of implementations it's

753
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,690
quite widely deployed so that was

754
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:21,090
attractive there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was some concerns about</font>

755
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,780
scalability of it if you try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> use it</font>

756
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:26,250
within the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS and then in some ways you</font>

757
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,139
might want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at detail s and say</font>

758
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:31,940
well isn't that a more natural solution

759
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:34,230
for DNS because it's UDP based and

760
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:38,340
initially it you might think that

761
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:40,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">however it runs into the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

762
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:43,199
that UDP does and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason there's</font>

763
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:46,260
this scattering of<font color="#CCCCCC"> tcp around which is</font>

764
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:50,310
that if<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer to a DNS query is too</font>

765
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,140
big to fit within the MTU then the

766
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">server has to indicate the client it</font>

767
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,240
needs to retry over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP because you can</font>

768
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:00,150
send<font color="#E5E5E5"> that large response over TCP the</font>

769
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,400
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem happens over</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dtls if the</font>

770
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:04,350
response<font color="#E5E5E5"> won't fit in the packet the</font>

771
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,150
server cannot send the whole response

772
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:08,340
and it has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to request the client to</font>

773
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:10,200
retry over another mechanism when you're

774
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:12,389
dealing with privacy that means if you

775
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:16,050
want to maintain privacy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to use</font>

776
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:17,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">another protocol like TLS all you have</font>

777
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:21,000
to completely sacrifice your privacy and

778
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:23,580
retry over clear text so the upshot of

779
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,650
that was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> detail</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> s couldn't be a</font>

780
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,310
standalone<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution to DNS previously</font>

781
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:34,380
you had to do dns over TLS regardless if

782
00:32:29,310 --> 00:32:35,940
you wanted a deployable solution so in

783
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,910
that case it meant we had to revisit

784
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,190
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> with dns and tcp i mean</font>

785
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:43,650
some people sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of shocked shocked to</font>

786
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:47,370
find the tcp is even used for<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns at all</font>

787
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:49,830
but it was but none such a great way and

788
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:53,100
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason was a historical one it was</font>

789
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,928
that clients took the easy route and

790
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:57,418
if they were doing lots of UDP queries

791
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:00,299
and they got this signal to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you need</font>

792
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,799
to retry over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP they would do one shot</font>

793
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:04,530
over TCP and then go straight back to

794
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:08,220
UDP and that was the pattern that

795
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:09,720
clients implemented across the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS so on</font>

796
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,460
the server side the service we're all

797
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,140
sitting there<font color="#E5E5E5"> going well I don't really</font>

798
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to worry about TCP I'm going to get</font>

799
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:19,799
one query you know every now and again

800
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:22,379
so servers had very basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP</font>

801
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:25,530
capabilities operators didn't routinely

802
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,840
worry about tuning for<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP or a bust us</font>

803
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:29,730
against TCP attacks so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it's</font>

804
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,020
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in some ways at this point</font>

805
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:41,669
treated as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> second-class protocol oh</font>

806
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:45,990
sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lykos in fact I'm completely wrong</font>

807
00:33:41,669 --> 00:33:48,150
side<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal</font>

808
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:51,390
with tcp / TLS implementations at a

809
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:53,510
later point in time another problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

810
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:56,820
we will have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with is</font>

811
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:58,350
authentication so what do most other

812
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,408
protocols do when they want to

813
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,658
authenticate something hmm they do a DNS

814
00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:07,409
lookup first so we're gonna have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

815
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:08,399
around that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS the other thing</font>

816
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:09,869
to worry about is some really

817
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting work that was done on</font>

818
00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:14,669
traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analysis and what this showed</font>

819
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:17,369
was great go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and crypt your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS</font>

820
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:19,679
that's fine but<font color="#CCCCCC"> if I'm observer and I</font>

821
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:22,379
can see both<font color="#CCCCCC"> sides are recursive then I</font>

822
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,060
can see lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of messages I can still</font>

823
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,219
figure out how big they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I can</font>

824
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:28,230
still see the timing correlations

825
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:30,629
between them which means with a bit of

826
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:32,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">work I can still do juice a whole bunch</font>

827
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:35,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">of stuff about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what individual users are</font>

828
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:38,279
doing so just encrypting the traffic is

829
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,899
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to obfuscate that so you need</font>

830
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:46,020
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> consider options that can defeat that</font>

831
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:48,029
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> traffic analysis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so top of</font>

832
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,969
that list was guessing you port how easy

833
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,700
is that well it turns<font color="#CCCCCC"> out if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

834
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:56,969
really solid use case which this was

835
00:34:53,699 --> 00:35:00,689
it's pretty easy we asked and we got

836
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:03,000
fantastic so a year ago poor 853 was

837
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,579
assigned for use for encrypted dns who

838
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,869
are

839
00:35:04,579 --> 00:35:14,869
next problem deal with this issue with

840
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:17,550
DNS over<font color="#E5E5E5"> TCP to enable DNS over TLS so</font>

841
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:19,250
this wasn't an insurmountable problem it

842
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:22,980
was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a question of</font>

843
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:25,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">engineering so what do we do well we</font>

844
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,089
throw the kitchen sink at it or you know

845
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">as matt damon might said we need to</font>

846
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:34,650
science<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hmm out of this so what we</font>

847
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,329
do is you look at all the techniques

848
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:38,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are used in all the other protocols</font>

849
00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,770
that use these and you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure to</font>

850
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:43,440
introduce them into the DNS space in the

851
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,970
standards so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example when DNS</font>

852
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,099
clients and servers are setting up

853
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:49,078
connections you need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

854
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:51,089
they're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques like fast open</font>

855
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:52,770
session resumption and you want to have

856
00:35:51,089 --> 00:35:54,029
a really close eye on till s 1 point 3

857
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:56,670
because that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do good things</font>

858
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:59,309
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of reducing latency for setting</font>

859
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:00,990
up these connections when you set the

860
00:35:59,309 --> 00:36:03,750
connections up you want to stop this

861
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:06,569
behavior of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one shot tcp you want to</font>

862
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:08,309
recommend that clients wants to have a

864
00:36:08,309 --> 00:36:12,480
queries over it not waiting for

865
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,630
responses just send them that when the

866
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,119
server gets them it actually processes

867
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,700
them concurrently not see really<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

868
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,160
that when it gets the responses it sends

869
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,140
them as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as it gets it now that will</font>

870
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,390
sounds really obvious but that is not

871
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,299
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> dn.m implementations have done</font>

872
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:32,250
historically so work was done to ensure

873
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:34,650
that in the standards this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was how</font>

874
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,230
implementations should mature moving

875
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:39,030
forward you'll also note there's a

876
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,400
persistent connections are see here

877
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,740
until last year there was no standard

878
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,569
way for a DNS client and a dealer server

879
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:48,118
to agree that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they wanted to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

881
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,599
spec it is now also in terms of managing

882
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:56,400
TCP connections on a DNS server then

883
00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,020
there's this huge amount that we can

884
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,099
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from the HTTP world these</font>

898
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:47,559
we want to be okay so having done some

899
00:37:46,479 --> 00:37:50,979
work on that we now move on to

900
00:37:47,559 --> 00:37:52,710
authentication the work that's going

901
00:37:50,979 --> 00:37:55,509
through deep right at the moment has

902
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,989
attempted to present<font color="#E5E5E5"> two profiles in</font>

903
00:37:55,509 --> 00:38:00,910
order to clarify to users what security

904
00:37:58,989 --> 00:38:02,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can expect when they use one of</font>

905
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,469
these two profiles because this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

906
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:08,339
of a new idea to DNS users so at the

907
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:11,680
moment what specified are two profiles

908
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:14,319
strict an opportunistic so the strict

909
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,890
profile is one where as a client you

910
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:20,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">decide that if I'm going to do Dennis I</font>

911
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:22,808
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an encrypted connection and</font>

912
00:38:20,529 --> 00:38:24,670
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authenticate my server and if</font>

913
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:26,890
I can't do both those things then I am

914
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:28,359
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> prepared to compromise my privacy so</font>

915
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:32,680
I just won't do doing this resolution

916
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:35,019
and I can't get to the internet but that

917
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:37,118
is somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying my privacy is more</font>

918
00:38:35,019 --> 00:38:39,488
important than my connectivity and

919
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,359
that's a choice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make as a user so</font>

920
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:44,829
it's kind of a purist take on if you

921
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">like I like to think of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a kind of</font>

922
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:48,759
Jedi way of doing this I've let the

923
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:51,519
words of Master Yoda described the

924
00:38:48,759 --> 00:38:54,430
philosopher here and whereas the

925
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:57,788
opportunistic profile is much more

926
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:59,229
pragmatic it's I really like the idea in

927
00:38:57,789 --> 00:39:01,869
its privacy and I think it's important

928
00:38:59,229 --> 00:39:04,779
i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to try every mechanism i can</font>

929
00:39:01,869 --> 00:39:07,539
to do it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the day i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> am</font>

930
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,329
willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to clear text in order</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

931
00:39:07,539 --> 00:39:12,479
get connectivity and again that's just a

932
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:14,350
usage profile for users to make

933
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:16,299
depending on what they

934
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:18,370
that are important in terms of exposing

935
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:22,440
their dns queries when they use the

936
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:25,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet so hopefully this is something</font>

937
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're opportunistic is a stepping</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stone</font>

938
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,880
to everybody being enabled to do strict

939
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,920
and it's not an issue but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

940
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,360
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to determine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as we roll</font>

941
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:39,880
this out so how do you do this

942
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:42,520
authentication well right now there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

943
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,500
two<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways specified one that starts off</font>

944
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:49,420
from a domain name and one that starts

945
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:52,240
off from an SP ki pin set now if you're

946
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:54,310
out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're thinking okay these are</font>

947
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,100
doing as folks and not these the folks

948
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,870
that tell every other protocol if you

949
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:03,730
want to do authentication you should be

950
00:39:58,870 --> 00:40:07,299
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane so shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we be kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

951
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:10,390
eating our own dog food here well yes so

952
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:12,970
we do specify how to do authentication

953
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,950
by day but<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really interesting idea</font>

954
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,259
came out of the work on this<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

955
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:20,700
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got DNS servers involved in this</font>

956
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:23,470
interaction so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very quick</font>

957
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:26,319
demonstration of how it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> work using</font>

958
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:30,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of classical Dane so you start from</font>

959
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:32,770
a DNS client that has DNS SEC validating

960
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:36,610
capabilities you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure it with a</font>

961
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:37,960
domain name and<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP address and one of</font>

962
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:41,110
the bootstrapping problems here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font>

963
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,790
it may need to do opportunistic so not

964
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,390
necessarily encrypted lookups to get

965
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:48,009
that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with again at</font>

966
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,009
this point I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have a connection to</font>

967
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:53,320
a privacy server so if I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

968
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:56,320
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> damn records that also has to be</font>

969
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:59,380
opportunistic so probably we<font color="#CCCCCC"> encrypted</font>

970
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:01,240
but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> Senta cated but I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go off</font>

971
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,940
and talk to some resolver and get those

972
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:06,370
records once I have those records<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

973
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:09,490
used in a sec<font color="#E5E5E5"> to validate them say I'm</font>

974
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:11,920
good to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> then the client can start the</font>

975
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:16,060
dl stls connection get the credentials

976
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,960
from server validate them and dns

977
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:22,150
resolution can start the alternative

978
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,210
mechanism is one using something called

979
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:26,540
the TLS DNS SEC chain extension and this

980
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:29,570
is a draft which is currently

981
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:31,370
through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> TLS working group what this</font>

982
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:34,250
does is it starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> from exactly the same</font>

983
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,100
point but it shifts the responsibility

984
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,540
for getting those<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dane records onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

985
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:41,210
day and its privacy server because after

986
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:43,400
all it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS server it should know how</font>

987
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,830
to get them and it should it can

988
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:49,340
prefetch them and it can cash them or it

989
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:51,799
can get them on demand in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this case once</font>

990
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:55,190
that server has the records the client

991
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,830
can then in the client hello indicate

992
00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:00,590
that it supports this new extension tip

993
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:02,540
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tea</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> LSD in a sec ascension so hey</font>

994
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:06,740
server I I know all about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this new</font>

995
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:09,259
extension do you hmm yes I do here have

996
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,660
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane records in the server hello</font>

along with<font color="#E5E5E5"> my credentials have at them</font>

998
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,730
client goes fine lovely okay first up

999
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,170
I'm going to validate your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dane records</font>

1000
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,230
with doing a sec<font color="#CCCCCC"> because I'm a father</font>

1001
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:23,060
dating client I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that next up I</font>

1002
00:42:21,230 --> 00:42:25,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">validate your credentials against them</font>

1003
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,740
and off we<font color="#CCCCCC"> go dns resolution begins</font>

1004
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,780
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beauty of this is that all</font>

1005
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:32,839
that happened inside the TLS handshake

1006
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,600
in this case so what you avoid is the

1007
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:38,330
latency<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those separate lookups by the</font>

1008
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:41,360
client and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also remove the need for</font>

1009
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:43,100
a separate resolver that can provide the

1010
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:48,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">dane records so the streamlines the</font>

1011
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:50,930
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> process</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so on this slide I'm</font>

1012
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:54,260
just presenting where D<font color="#CCCCCC"> prive is today</font>

1013
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:57,649
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of the documents it has in the</font>

1014
00:42:54,260 --> 00:43:00,770
solution space for the stub to recursive

1015
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:06,710
part of the problem so in May of this

1016
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:08,630
year<font color="#E5E5E5"> 78 58 got it right that was</font>

1017
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:13,910
published which is a specification for

1018
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:17,060
DNS over TLS alongside that 7830 was

1019
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:19,040
published which is the ed and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a serum</font>

1020
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:22,070
mechanism so that you can pad a DNS

1021
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,830
query by an amount and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

1022
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:26,810
follow-up work to talk there about what

1023
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,430
algorithms to use to pad that but at

1024
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:32,029
least we have the basic mechanism in

1025
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:33,470
place there's also a draft going through

1026
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:36,230
the working group which is completed

1027
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,118
working group last call to specify DNS

1028
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,720
over TLS

1029
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:44,509
and there's a separate draft which is in

1030
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,209
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> last call to specify all</font>

the details of the authentication<font color="#CCCCCC"> maxims</font>

1032
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:53,569
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I touched on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1033
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:55,670
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good work for two years of a</font>

1034
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:57,079
working group I think hats off you know

1035
00:43:55,670 --> 00:44:03,529
this wasn't an easy problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of</font>

1036
00:43:57,079 --> 00:44:05,539
progress has been made so what next now

1037
00:44:03,529 --> 00:44:07,279
we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> start biting the bullet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1038
00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:10,369
thinking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the recursive to</font>

1039
00:44:07,279 --> 00:44:12,140
authoritative problem and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1040
00:44:10,369 --> 00:44:14,210
working group is meeting this Friday

1041
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:16,640
here in Seoul and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agenda</font>

1042
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:17,869
items is the recharter discussion how do

1043
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,618
we move forward<font color="#CCCCCC"> from where we are to</font>

1044
00:44:17,869 --> 00:44:23,599
tackle this there is a draft available

1045
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:26,119
and what that attempts<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is</font>

1046
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,190
enumerate six options for how to do that

1047
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:29,960
authentication between<font color="#E5E5E5"> them curses and</font>

1048
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,289
the authoritative and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> also going</font>

1049
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:34,700
to be discussed in the working group

1050
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:37,670
there's also quite a desire to get some

1051
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:40,249
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the experience of what it</font>

1052
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:42,410
really means to do DNS over TLS on

1053
00:44:40,249 --> 00:44:43,788
Stubbs recursive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> feed that into</font>

1054
00:44:42,410 --> 00:44:45,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about how to do that</font>

1055
00:44:43,789 --> 00:44:48,980
recursive<font color="#E5E5E5"> to authoritative as well</font>

1056
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:50,749
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is new territory one thing</font>

1057
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,489
I do want to touch on is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay we</font>

1058
00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:54,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't have an encryption solution for</font>

1059
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:57,049
recursive to<font color="#CCCCCC"> authorities yet but what</font>

1060
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:58,940
came out of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns up working group is</font>

1061
00:44:57,049 --> 00:45:01,069
a nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work you know</font>

1062
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:02,960
minimization so we go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1063
00:45:01,069 --> 00:45:05,239
picture earlier where the bad idea fairy

1064
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,890
said<font color="#E5E5E5"> leak all your information and we</font>

1065
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:10,069
come along with an idea from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the better</font>

1066
00:45:06,890 --> 00:45:12,828
idea fairy who says well no you don't do

1067
00:45:10,069 --> 00:45:15,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that just send what you need to and stop</font>

1068
00:45:12,829 --> 00:45:17,509
leaking information now this looks

1069
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,509
totally<font color="#E5E5E5"> trivial and it's not quite</font>

1070
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:22,339
there's some really icky corner cases in

1071
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:25,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">this when you have to go following see</font>

1072
00:45:22,339 --> 00:45:27,380
names and the like but the good news is

1073
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,930
those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being solved in</font>

1074
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:32,410
implementations<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is now being</font>

1075
00:45:29,930 --> 00:45:38,480
rolled out in some the major<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source</font>

1076
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:40,910
name server implementations today so i

1077
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,609
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this slide up here and this is to do</font>

1078
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,848
with the day to handling and honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1079
00:45:43,609 --> 00:45:49,069
think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the area that has had the</font>

1080
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:51,650
least attention and probably has the

1081
00:45:49,069 --> 00:45:52,000
least progress and needs<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be somewhere</font>

1082
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,570
with

1083
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,360
kissing now um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could start</font>

1084
00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:00,670
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying hands up who in this room has</font>

1085
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">read the small print of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP contract</font>

1086
00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:06,070
and knows exactly what their isp does

1087
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:08,290
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> their DNS data Alan I'm not one of</font>

1088
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:13,450
them say wow you'll have lives that's

1089
00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:14,620
great so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing and we're the</font>

1090
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,640
kind of people who should really know

1091
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:21,609
and care about that so what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1092
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:23,400
be doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is looking at more it</font>

1093
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:26,320
needs to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> done so for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> example</font>

1094
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,770
government policy and practice in terms

1095
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,640
of surveillance and data sharing

1096
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,800
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> in like some recent</font>

1097
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:39,910
political events we might all want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

1098
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:41,440
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this headset also what</font>

1099
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:43,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">you really want is much more</font>

1100
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,480
transparency from users and providers

1101
00:46:43,930 --> 00:46:48,790
about what are they doing with a data

1102
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,180
why is it in small print why isn't it up

1103
00:46:48,790 --> 00:46:54,460
front and easy for you to find out

1104
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,980
similarly<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay if you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to keep data</font>

1105
00:46:54,460 --> 00:46:59,050
do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can to do identify it</font>

1106
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,420
you can still do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the data but</font>

1107
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:03,220
but in terms of certainly academic

1108
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,750
exercises where you try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and collect data</font>

day in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> life of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

1110
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:09,190
like there<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs to be thought given to</font>

1111
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:16,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">D identifying that data to protect users</font>

1112
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:21,340
a very quick note on a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> topics</font>

1113
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:23,770
here um so DNS over HTTPS has actually

1114
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:26,290
been around<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a while non-standard but</font>

1115
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:28,210
used there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good review of why</font>

1116
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:30,610
it was used and some of the motivations

1117
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,980
well one was privacy it brings that with

1118
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:34,840
it others were bypassing middle box

1119
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,390
interference others were exposing

1120
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">high-level api's but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is kind of</font>

1121
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,359
gathering a bit of momentum so it's not

1122
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually being positioned as a</font>

1123
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:47,980
previously solution<font color="#E5E5E5"> first and foremost</font>

1124
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:50,700
it's much more a new technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1125
00:47:47,980 --> 00:47:53,230
their address to specify how to do this

<font color="#CCCCCC">Google is actually offering a DNS over</font>

1131
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:04,920
Tuesday night on this topic so if you

1132
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:07,890
interested in this side of things I'd

00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,809
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to go so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:48,630
there's progress in this area as well so

to quickly move on to implementation

briefly just to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is</font>

00:49:07,349 --> 00:49:11,729
illustrate<font color="#CCCCCC"> it but there's work in all of</font>

these on the new standards that are

happening the purple box in front of

1161
00:49:17,999 --> 00:49:22,558
approach of the buying folks is not to

1162
00:49:20,009 --> 00:49:25,410
put tier less directly into the name

1163
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:28,049
server rather what<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and proposing</font>

1164
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:29,640
is using a TLS proxy in front of a name

1165
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,440
server and there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> lots of technical</font>

1166
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:33,058
reasons this makes sense and there are

1167
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots of one's available so this is</font>

1168
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:42,029
certainly a viable way to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on</font>

1169
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:43,499
the stub side most of the energy and

1170
00:49:42,029 --> 00:49:45,630
effort has been expended over the last

1171
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:47,339
few years towards get dns and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll talk</font>

00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:51,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">about that a little more on the next</font>

00:49:47,339 --> 00:49:53,479
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you'll notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some emission</font>

1174
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:56,069
notable emissions from this in terms of

1175
00:49:53,479 --> 00:49:57,749
deployed and used at libraries and

1176
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:59,190
that's a real challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

1177
00:49:57,749 --> 00:50:04,618
getting new features into those

1178
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:06,960
libraries so essentially there's uptake

1179
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:08,640
of this as implementations<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Dennis</font>

implementation of Dennis every TLS

1182
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:14,819
that'll be good to add to the mix

1183
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:18,170
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> bii has a DNS over HTTP</font>

1184
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:21,030
implementation that's available as well

1185
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:23,010
so to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what's deployed and</font>

1186
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:24,780
what's actually out there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

1187
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,060
handful of test servers available today

1188
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are up and running to start on</font>

1189
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:32,640
getting operational experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how</font>

1190
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:35,760
you do DNS over TLS so and on that labs

1191
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,359
are running 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> our car running one as a</font>

1192
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:42,990
few hosted by surf net dkg the man has

1193
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:46,050
put one up there and so these are there

1194
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:47,819
to start doing activities there's a

1195
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:49,860
question marking its ITF because we've

1196
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,800
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of started exploratory talks about</font>

1197
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:56,310
well maybe the next ITF could offer a

1198
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,900
privacy server maybe this one even I'm

1199
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:00,660
getting faces from Warren I won't ask

1200
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,100
that but but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice step</font>

1201
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:05,520
just to offer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so people can get</font>

1202
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:07,290
experience and if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1203
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:12,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">details</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these servers they're at a</font>

1205
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">use those servers you need some client</font>

1206

software that will connect to<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and</font>

1207
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:20,819
what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been being developed over the</font>

1208
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:23,370
last few years is based around get dns

1209
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:26,520
so if you're not familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it get</font>

1210
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:29,850
dns is a modern asynchronous dinner

second abled<font color="#E5E5E5"> api bunch of information at</font>

1212
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:35,549
the website what it does do is it

1213
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:38,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">already implements DNS over TLS and it</font>

1214
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:42,090
is already<font color="#E5E5E5"> a natively validating DNS SEC</font>

1215
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,360
client stub so it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> two boxes in</font>

1216
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:46,830
terms of enabling privacy so what has

1217
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,990
recently been developed in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last</font>

1218
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:51,980
release is a new mode of using get dns

1219
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:54,540
which is called stubby this is the

1220
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:56,720
mascot for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sergeant stubby i'll let</font>

1221
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:00,150
you google him if you're interested

1222
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:04,049
basically what stubby does is it runs as

1223
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:07,920
a demon on your machine you<font color="#CCCCCC"> point your</font>

the authentication information you might

00:52:26,749 --> 00:52:30,319
want to use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can specify which of</font>

00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:32,229
those two profiles do you want to do

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,058
stricter opportunistic this is all

1236
00:52:32,229 --> 00:52:36,799
configurable there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> web page on how</font>

1237
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:38,989
to build stubby configure it and use it

1238
00:52:36,799 --> 00:52:40,910
and if anybody's interested in actually

1239
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:43,759
getting hands-on with this then come and

1240

1254
00:53:16,759 --> 00:53:19,549
doing a lot of interrupt testing between

1255
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:21,589
stubby and some of these upstream

1256
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:24,339
service so we're hopefully maturing this

1257
00:53:21,589 --> 00:53:26,479
and making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more usable a</font>

1258
00:53:24,339 --> 00:53:30,859
challenge that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't really touched</font>

1259
00:53:26,479 --> 00:53:33,678
on much is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> of integrating not only</font>

1260
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:36,739
study but other client solutions into

00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:39,109
os's making them accessible making them

1262
00:53:36,739 --> 00:53:40,459
usable for users and this face is very

1263
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:42,828
similar challenge to do in a sack in

1264
00:53:40,459 --> 00:53:45,499
that respect so hopefully we can learn

1265
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:46,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from that we need your</font>

implementations more deployment and

1268

obviously there's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> the recursive to</font>

summarize I hope I've convinced you that

1271
00:53:57,489 --> 00:54:02,689
DNS privacy is is a real problem and

1272
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:04,519
it's relevant problem as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well one we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">need to be thinking about and working on</font>

1274
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:09,198
that there is active work but this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

1275
00:54:07,279 --> 00:54:10,969
large loose and space there isn't gonna

1276
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:14,349
be an overnight solution but that work

1277
00:54:10,969 --> 00:54:16,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">is in progress and that there are tests</font>

1278
00:54:14,349 --> 00:54:18,439
implementations out there that you can

1279
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,969
use today if you're interested and there

1280
00:54:18,439 --> 00:54:24,379
are more privacy services and more

1281
00:54:19,969 --> 00:54:26,989
solutions on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way also I think in the</font>

1282
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,679
very near future the public awareness of

1283
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:31,939
this is going to continue increasing

1284
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:34,189
after all edward snowed and got

1285

that one day there might be an<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF the</font>

1289
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:45,620
movie to recognize all the folks here

1290
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:48,110
all have braces and all the implementers

1291

fighting the good fight to defeat vasive

1292
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:54,020
monitoring and that that will happen one

1293
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:55,730
day and casting suggestions for that

1294
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:59,410
movie will be very gratefully received

1295
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:02,450
in the bar later on so with that I will

00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:05,450
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for your time I will point you</font>

1297
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:08,930
at a survey monkey website at as I have

1298
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:10,609
been instructed to buy the edu team if

1299
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,160
you can give feedback on this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

1300
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:21,980
be great and thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much I'd be</font>

1301
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:25,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">happy to take any questions lorenz are</font>

1302
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:27,410
clearly not sadly not dns specific so

1303
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,350
for as long as s and I exist this is all

1304
00:55:27,410 --> 00:55:33,109
in vain right yeah so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> d can he take</font>

1305
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:36,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">it away to fix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you came in you came</font>

1306
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:37,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in late um so leaky boat you missed I</font>

1307
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:39,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">hardly use all of leaky boat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yeah</font>

1308
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:42,410
so what was it how do you fix yellow

1309
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:46,759
leak so that's not something to be can

1310
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:48,440
fix in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS there are a couple of</font>

1311
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,840
possibilities I tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get that into</font>

1312
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,880
TLS 1.3 and I got pushed back<font color="#CCCCCC"> from some</font>

1313
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:55,400
large server operators that didn't want

1314
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:59,030
to incur an extra round trip which is

1315
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:04,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">understandable so it's not going to be a</font>

1316
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:05,870
automatic in TLS 1.3 at any rate so we

1317
00:56:04,250 --> 00:56:11,990
have there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of possibilities</font>

1318
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:13,850
that would allow<font color="#CCCCCC"> s and I cover traffic</font>

1319
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,930
basically and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go into</font>

1320
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that right now because I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

1321
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:17,629
people with questions about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DNS but</font>

1322
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,580
I'm happy to talk with you afterwards

1323
00:56:17,630 --> 00:56:21,620
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone has other specific ideas</font>

1324
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,590
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> tina's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> taylor says and I I don't</font>

1325
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:29,390
hear him also this is not just for TLS

1326
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:31,820
so right generate I just happened have

1327
00:56:29,390 --> 00:56:34,490
wandered in off the street<font color="#CCCCCC"> Shara I</font>

1328
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:36,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanting to introduce a leonine question</font>

1329
00:56:34,490 --> 00:56:37,580
here have you had any conversations with

1330
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:40,670
any of the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection authorities</font>

1331
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:42,380
about whether this DNS query traffic

1332
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:46,370
would be considered as personal data or

1333
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,740
not not direct ones and also that's

1334
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:50,870
going to vary country by country I mean

1335
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,569
that's a huge issue

1336
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:56,240
and I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure it's for necessarily</font>

1337
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:59,150
for us protocol folks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to time travel</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1338
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:03,109
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes up a level to an</font>

1339
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:04,460
organizational question what has been

1340
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:08,540
remarked is that it would be quite

1341
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:10,730
interesting if these there's uptake in

1342
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,470
terms of this test servers and it's

1343
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:15,470
observed that DNS traffic is being

1344
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">retained encrypted and how certain</font>

1345
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:21,020
monitoring authorities might react to

1346
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:23,089
that in terms of exact outfit occasion

1347
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:24,710
of personal data I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's an</font>

1348
00:57:23,090 --> 00:57:27,920
unanswered question I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking</font>

1349
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:29,810
this memory to help with optic of these

1350
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:33,020
technologies<font color="#E5E5E5"> once the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> big become more</font>

1351
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:34,100
widely accepted and widely deployed and

1352
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,720
there's also should probably where

1353
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:37,520
there's a lot of operators particular

1354
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,500
the European Union a very concerned

1355
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,020
about data retention<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all those other</font>

1356
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:44,300
considerations so stuff like DNS query

1357
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:45,980
traffic is already an issue for them so

1358
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:47,840
if there's a reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> which that problem</font>

1359
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:49,580
can be can be minimized from their point

1360
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,650
of view by using some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these office</font>

1361
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:53,360
keys and technologies that could also be

1362
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:54,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but the message didn't have</font>

1363
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:56,750
to be coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things like the data</font>

1364
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:58,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">protection authorities disease we can</font>

1365
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">serve this personal data you need to</font>

1366
00:57:58,550 --> 00:58:01,790
start taking things much more<font color="#CCCCCC"> sisa by</font>

1367
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:04,280
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you treat</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than handle that data yeah</font>

1368
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:05,840
and I i agree i think that's that's an

1369
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,060
error<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hasn't received as much</font>

1370
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:10,490
attention as it<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have and</font>

1371
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:19,190
certainly will need to in future thank
