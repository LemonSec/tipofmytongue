00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:18,220
your hand if you've used XML to RFC to

28
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:22,410
create an internet draft before great

29
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:24,639
and raise your hand if you have XML RFC

30
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,550
installed on your machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> you run it</font>

00:05:35,229 --> 00:05:40,800
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enroth edit has anyone ever used</font>

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,210
in rough edit to make an internet draft

36
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,259
mm-hmm

37
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:51,349
one person and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a feel for</font>

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,910
RFC it's another mark down option that's

41
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:08,880
not on this nope how about licks to RFC

42
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:12,360
which is listed<font color="#CCCCCC"> there nope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I'd say</font>

43
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,610
XML the RFC is really popular from what

44
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,990
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing in terms of I only see the</font>

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:25,099
are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML to RFC how they actually</font>

some of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about today so</font>

50
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,030
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is geared for at the</font>

51
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,130
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your process so this slides</font>

52
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,099
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Scott Radnor's newcomer tutorial</font>

53
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:42,780
but before it even goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

54
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:44,460

55
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:47,729
a good time to choose your authoring

56
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,710
tool and some people don't choose and

57
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:52,500
then later they have co-authors who say

58
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:54,810
oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd really like to do this in XML RFC</font>

59
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,340
or that whatever their favorite oh

60
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,469
that's one of the other ones I didn't

61
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,448
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask that is the word template has anyone</font>

62
00:06:58,469 --> 00:07:03,229
used the microsoft word template to

63
00:07:00,449 --> 00:07:07,979
create an<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet dressed okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple</font>

64
00:07:03,229 --> 00:07:09,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">um so you know you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stick</font>

65
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:13,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">with the same authoring tool through</font>

66
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,669
this whole process and but it helps if

67
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,039
you choose at the beginning when<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

68
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:20,580
authoring your internet draft<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

69
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,370
that works for you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can focus on</font>

70
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:26,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">the content and less so on the</font>

71
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:32,009
formatting so going<font color="#CCCCCC"> through some of the</font>

72
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:34,620
options here<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enroth edit is using an</font>

73
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:37,440
inner off source file and the tool

00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,840
credit is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Stefan Sanderson and this is</font>

75
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,120
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> website where it's available you can</font>

76
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,479
you install<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as a GUI that's a</font>

77
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">side-by-side</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you see the inner off on</font>

79
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:54,389
side it starts<font color="#E5E5E5"> off with a template for</font>

80
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:56,039
an internet draft it has easy reference

81
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:58,140
creation meaning you put in

82
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:00,690
RFC number and it just pops in the

83
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:03,300
reference information automatically

84
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:06,420
creates your table of<font color="#E5E5E5"> contents</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

85
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,830
stands for table of contents and in

86
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,390
brief you edit within the application

87
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:17,460
I'd say this is a pretty easy one for

88
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:19,169
someone who's scared of XML and doesn't

89
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:22,940
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do microsoft word in turn off</font>

90
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:27,180
that it's pretty quick quick to start

91
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,020
XML<font color="#E5E5E5"> to RFC is one that most people a lot</font>

RFC's is also internet-drafts and then

104
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:04,170
there's citation library for<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Triple E</font>

105
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:06,410
references and i'll be going into<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

106
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,089
detail on this but also for other stos

documents not necessarily as<font color="#E5E5E5"> up-to-date</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">as is useful but it's a good starting</font>

109
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,020
point the table<font color="#CCCCCC"> of contents is created</font>

110
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,260
automatically you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> edit in your</font>

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">favorite editor and then run the</font>

112
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,380
converter there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> v2</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the if you</font>

113
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:30,900
install it locally it has a GUI see and

114
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,200
you can theoretically edit in there but

115
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,170
it's pretty lightweight um the word

116
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:41,900
template relies on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Word and</font>

117
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:46,199
it's written up completely in RFC 53 85

118
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:48,930
um you run in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own copy of word</font>

119
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:52,070
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a template to start with it's</font>

120
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:55,229
not quite as easy for making references

121
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,600
and you do have to run<font color="#E5E5E5"> a perl script</font>

122
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:00,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">after you use a special template with</font>

123
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,120
special margins set etc then you run a

124
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,120
perl script to get the plain text output

125
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,120
yes

126
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:17,370
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying the</font>

127
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,580
question into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mic the question is</font>

128
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,800
what operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems do these run on</font>

129
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:25,560
so right word wherever you have word

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,900
marked down so that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rich</font>

141
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:10,319
text basically that you use to create a

00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:13,319
wiki page very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> cram down it has</font>

143
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:16,020
a github page<font color="#E5E5E5"> also there was a tutorial</font>

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:20,550
at IHF 92 that went into the details of

145
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:22,650
crammed down and i'll be going over more

146
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:25,620
detail in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> tutorial but basically</font>

147
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:28,020
the file that you create is mark down

148
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:33,480
but also some<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah mille which is a</font>

149
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:35,310
subset of JSON and you run the converter

150
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,510
and you can get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml file that you</font>

151
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:43,560
then feed to xml to RFC to get your

152
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:45,510
plain text the licks to RFC also has a

153
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:47,400
github page and all of these do because

154
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:55,020
their work in progress to a certain

155
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:57,569
extent yeah it the converter relies on

156
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,980
various software for<font color="#CCCCCC"> liquor RFC that you</font>

157
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:00,930
have to have installed so it's worth

158
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,920
going to read the documentation to see

159
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,560
if it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

160
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,319
already have you probably know if you

161
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,260
already use<font color="#E5E5E5"> latex or licks that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

162
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,430
would like this one<font color="#CCCCCC"> pan dr. RFC's</font>

163
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:20,460
written up in RFC 7328 it's fairly

164
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:21,540
similar to to cram down RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 26 29 in</font>

165
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,730
terms of the mark

166
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:26,939
but they made different decisions about

167
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:31,290
how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> handle internet-draft specific</font>

168
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:34,940
things like references and figures<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

169
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:37,380
tables it<font color="#E5E5E5"> references within the document</font>

170
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:42,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so I'm going to go into more detail</font>

171
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:46,680
on and off edit it's what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see is</font>

172
00:12:42,449 --> 00:12:49,439
what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side-by-side view</font>

173
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:51,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">you download it it has spell checker</font>

174

175
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,160
updated um why would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you choose it</font>

176
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,569
because it's an easy way to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

177
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,050
internet draft that's going to be

accepted by I Dean<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's it automatically</font>

180
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:09,389
generating the references from RFC ref

181
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:12,388
text that's a plain text file provided

182
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:14,670
by the RFC editor so it's going to be up

183
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:17,250
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> date with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right format and also</font>

184
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,849
the most recently published RFC's it's

185
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,889
pretty straightforward you could provide

186
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:24,680
also the in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Raphael sure if your</font>

00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,769
approved for publication as an RFC you

189
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,019
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> provide in Raphael to the RFC</font>

190
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:33,930

raw files and we're edit<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML files</font>

192
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:41,579
during the publication process that said

you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to have a source file to</font>

example edited plain text from scratch

00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:55,410
or used microsoft word template so quick

198
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,209
start with in roth edit you download you

199
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,540
install and you say new draft from

200
00:13:57,209 --> 00:14:03,869
template it builds the reference list

201
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,899
automatically it's the same file that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

202
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:09,180
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the preloaded</font>

203
00:14:06,899 --> 00:14:10,980
template which you can also just

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,750
download if you want it if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you for</font>

207
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:23,699
simplistic and makes text output there's

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:28,769
another in Roth template available from

209
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:30,209
the RC editor site and I meant<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

the being these slides are available

basics the commands i'll start with a

217
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:58,470
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's very basic and is that</font>

218
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:00,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">interoffice developed decades ago so you</font>

219
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,510
tell it exactly how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you want to</font>

220
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,670
indent you tell it if you want text to

221
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:07,439
be wrapped or not wrapped line<font color="#E5E5E5"> breaks</font>

222
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:10,949
and page breaks and keeping lines

223
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,470
together it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all very explicit so to</font>

224
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,630
contrast with xml RFC you wouldn't be

225
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:18,120
worrying about things like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with xml</font>

226
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:21,240
RFC it's going to choose for you how

227
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,370
many spaces to indent<font color="#E5E5E5"> and depending on</font>

228
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:26,910
what element you used it'll choose when

229
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:31,050
to wrap the text but if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> already</font>

230
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:34,020
familiar with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not too</font>

231
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:36,599
complicated this is a screenshot of the

232
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:42,170
automated table of contents so you're

233
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:46,350
not trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull that together as</font>

234
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:48,209
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reference insertion is</font>

235
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,700
pretty straightforward and you can even

236
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:52,170
give the references different labels you

237
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,430
know some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to label the</font>

238
00:15:52,170 --> 00:16:01,050
reference<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could v2 instead</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the RFC</font>

239
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:04,709
number and it has that functionality and

240
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:06,359
then my recommendation here for if

241
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:09,570
you're inserting references to other

242
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,370
sources like internet-drafts or non rfcs

243
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:13,110
then i would recommend copying and

244
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:16,770
pasting them from existing documents

245
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:18,420
rather than typing them from scratch but

246
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:21,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically you're just putting an indent</font>

247
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:25,040
command before each one so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:29,190
screenshot of the managed reference list

249
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,040
you can see at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> top there's it's in</font>

250
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,900
an inner off comment that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> a ghosted</font>

251
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,959
out so it's hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see it on this slide</font>

252
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:39,829
but basically as the author you just put

253
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:42,990
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a list of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers of RFC numbers</font>

254
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:45,210
optional labels and then it the pro in

255
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:47,910
turn off edits creating everything below

256
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:49,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the yellow arrow so it's automatically</font>

257
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,140
creating the reference entry

258
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:54,890
which is nice another<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason you might</font>

259
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:57,180
choose and Ralph edit is if you're

260
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:59,160
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an internet draft that</font>

261
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,160
someone you don't have a source file for

262
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,309
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can take an existing</font>

263
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,199
internet draft in plain text and feed it

264
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,439
to enter off edit and it will try to

265
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:12,030
convert it to enter off as assuming that

266
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:15,689
internet draft that you started with is

267
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:19,740
in I'd units formed it'll succeed and

268
00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:21,929
then you'll have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a source file to start</font>

269
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,819
with so that would be i'd say the quick

270
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:25,860
and easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get to a source file as</font>

271
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,540
opposed to if you're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a an</font>

272
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,209
internet draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

273
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:35,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">XML file there's not a really viable</font>

274
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:38,040
text to XML tool that exists currently

275
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,719
so it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a manual process and</font>

276
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,820
i'll talk more about that later there's

277
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:47,190
also some integration with the ITF tools

278
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:52,250
diff service so you can see the changes

279
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:54,750
in post URL this is the automated diff

280
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:56,820
generation you can tell it's relying on

281
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:02,040
RFC diff which does the<font color="#E5E5E5"> side by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> side</font>

282
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:08,178

<font color="#CCCCCC">inner off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> edit some of its on this slide</font>

284
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:18,090
so I was going to demo this but I think

285
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:20,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the sake of moving forward basically</font>

286
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:22,620
like I said the text to enter off demo

287
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,960
would be that you feed it a plain text

288
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:30,989
file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it will try to create a source</font>

289
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,550
file front from there any questions

290
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:37,530
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enroth edit before I move on to</font>

291
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:39,540
XML to RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this is the one that</font>

292
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,428
there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most familiarity in the room</font>

293
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:45,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">but feel free to stop me if you have a</font>

294
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:48,000
question it converts your<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml source</font>

295
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:52,710
file into text HTML in raw fun paginate

296
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,510
text or expanded<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and so you can</font>

297
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">create an internet draft that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

299
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,720
it change a few attributes and it

300
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:02,720
creates an RFC

301

307
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:26,369
would get HTML output or even PDF and

00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:30,299
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> also exchanging the source file</font>

309
00:19:26,369 --> 00:19:35,100
with authors is more useful if you have

310
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:36,989
<font color="#CCCCCC">if everyone likes to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use XML and you can</font>

311
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,119
you know theoretically put metadata in

00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:42,119
it at this point<font color="#E5E5E5"> the XML files that are</font>

uploaded to the ID submission tool there

314
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:47,730
is no automatic metadata just extraction

315
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:49,409
but in theory you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how</font>

316
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,950
many of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML files in the ID</font>

00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,889
and we will take your<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml file another</font>

319
00:19:56,609 --> 00:20:01,799
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is looking toward the future you</font>

332
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:44,220
what the RSC is doing take a look at the

RSC format<font color="#E5E5E5"> FAQ this is slated for</font>

334
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:52,409
upcoming years so maybe we would see

335
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:55,919
this in a year and draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> hoffman xml RFC</font>

336
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:58,080
is defining a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> vocabulary for xml RFC</font>

337
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,730
in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add some of the</font>

338
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,059
functionality needed for the new output

339
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:07,320
formats so in theory if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> choosing</font>

340
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:09,029
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use xml RFC today then in a couple</font>

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you wanted to use your source</font>

342
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:16,440
file you would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML RFC v3 available</font>

343
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:18,750
and a converter from v2 to v3

344
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:21,840
vocabulary so that your file would make

345
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,510
the new pretty output that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

346
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">available some people are excited about</font>

347
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:30,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">this format effort also because it will</font>

348
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:36,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">allow non-ascii characters for example</font>

349
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:38,070
in your name so back to v2 this tool was

350
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,320
rewritten from scratch if you're

351
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,620
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the old XML tariff see</font>

that it's now written it's been you know

353
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,360
more maintained it is stricter when you

354
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:52,190
run the converter you might be seeing

355
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:55,830
errors that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you didn't see a while ago</font>

358
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:03,000
there and there's also an f<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight sorry</font>

361
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:10,020
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd say most of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bugs for you to</font>

362
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:11,790
our ironed out works works well so for

363
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,500
initial setup you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> choices if</font>

364
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,940
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use the tool on the web or</font>

365
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,680
install it if you want to use the

366
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:20,130
citation libraries as they're available

367
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:22,620
online or maintain your own copy and

368
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:27,630
edit you know whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> editor you'd like</font>

369
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,919
to edit XML in so if you just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

370
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,900
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> started as quickly as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible just</font>

371
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:32,580
use the online converter use the

372
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:35,460
citation libraries that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> available</font>

373
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,760
online use<font color="#E5E5E5"> your favorite text editor</font>

374
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:41,130
edit the raw<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML as opposed to you know</font>

375
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:45,930
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people want to use XML mind and</font>

376
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:49,500
then have special configuration you're

377
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:52,860
welcome to do that but this is the quick

378
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">start also the template so the templates</font>

379
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:57,840
are available here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a generic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> draf</font>

380
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:00,540
i'd recommend the draft davies template

381
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,929
bear which has some instructions in

382
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,370
comments and then if you're writing<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

383
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:10,350
mid which is a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of document</font>

384
00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:14,129
there's also a special template that for

385
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:16,310
writing a mid available there are some

386
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:20,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> options for creating an xml file</font>

387
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:23,100
so the ID creation wizard kind of lets

388
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:27,270
you fill<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a form on the web and then</font>

389
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:30,418
it creates the xml file for like your

390
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">author element and title basically the</font>

391
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:38,519
the starting front matter it takes care

392
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:41,190
of it for you so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I were starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

393
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,359
a text file that I had no source file

394
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:44,460
for and I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to create</font>

395
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:47,369
internet-draft I might just<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with</font>

396
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,889
this ID wizard because you could copy

397
00:23:47,369 --> 00:23:52,320
and paste from<font color="#E5E5E5"> your existing draft and</font>

398
00:23:49,889 --> 00:23:56,100
it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> just get you started with it a</font>

399
00:23:52,320 --> 00:24:00,168
nice template with your author elements

400
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:04,080
and all that also the markdown tools

401
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:09,379
will create xml files so crammed down

402
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:12,149
our<font color="#E5E5E5"> panda RFC as well as looks RFC</font>

403
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:16,709
create xml files that you then could

404
00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:22,619
feed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML to RFC just some basics for</font>

405
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:26,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">XML the elements are nested have opened</font>

406
00:24:22,619 --> 00:24:28,379
and closed tags excuse me that

407
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:31,470
attributes have quoted values<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

408
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:34,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">sensitive replace certain characters</font>

409
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,749
that you don't want the<font color="#CCCCCC"> XML parser to</font>

410
00:24:34,649 --> 00:24:39,209
parse like your left<font color="#CCCCCC"> hand sign or an</font>

411
00:24:36,749 --> 00:24:40,889
ampersand if you're putting<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a big</font>

412
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,039
I'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this more but you're</font>

413
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:47,519
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a chunk of XML into your</font>

414
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:49,859
internet draft then you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use see</font>

415
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:51,960
data a special tag for the figure

416
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:53,428
artwork so it tells it not to parse that

417
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:58,859
so you don't have to replace all the

418
00:24:53,429 --> 00:25:04,019
characters this authoring document has

419
00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:05,609
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML basics so the document</font>

420
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:11,369
structure is basically a front middle

421
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:12,960
and back this slide doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the</font>

422
00:25:11,369 --> 00:25:14,639

or tables or even lists nested lists

437
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:59,580
it's tricky to automate some of that

438
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,929
especially complicated tables so if

439
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,309
you're creating an internet draft you

440
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,419
want to make an author element for

441
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:11,850
yourself as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IID wizard</font>

442
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:14,490
can make that easy<font color="#CCCCCC"> T tags go around</font>

443
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:18,658
every paragraph figure artwork both

444
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:20,340
elements go around each figure and when

445
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:23,850
you want to cite a reference you've put

446
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,000
in an xref xref standing for crossref

447
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:29,399
it's a little confusing because xref is

448
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,010
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only for in-text citations it's also</font>

449
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,159
xref if you want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> see section</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 9</font>

450
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:37,830
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would also use extra target equals</font>

451
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:40,289
and you will give given an identifier<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

452
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:52,110
section 9 and tell put that as the

453
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:57,090
target<font color="#E5E5E5"> yep the drawing meaning like how</font>

454
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:59,820
to create ascii art<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so the question</font>

455
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,260
is am<font color="#E5E5E5"> I going to talk about drawing tips</font>

456
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,510
or how to create figure artwork so

457
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,280
because as mentioned because output is

458
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:14,730
plain text a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people have fancy</font>

459
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:18,960
ascii art in there internet-drafts I

460
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:22,110
don't really dive into that in in this

461
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,260
tutorial my primary recommendation for

462
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:29,010
getting ascii art into your source file

463
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,530
is to go and look at another internet

464
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:36,049
draft or RFC where you like what they've

465
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,049
done<font color="#CCCCCC"> and start with that as your</font>

466
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:50,070
I agree so he said it would be good to

467
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">know which ones are good examples to</font>

468
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:54,600
follow and which aren't I've actually

469
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:59,730
been thinking about that lately in terms

470
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:01,620
of saying some specific RFC numbers that

471
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:05,070
might be good examples<font color="#CCCCCC"> for bid diagrams</font>

472
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:09,449
or flow charts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:13,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting points yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tamashii Curtis net</font>

474
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:19,370
I have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question can i put figure into</font>

475
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:23,070
paragraph I mean figure inside of D or

476
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:26,250
outside I actually think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DTD lets</font>

477
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:28,320
you do either one um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

478
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:29,970
remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> off the top of my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> head but if</font>

479
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,970
you it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to affect your</font>

480
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,010
spacing like if you close the tea close

481
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:38,100
your paragraph and you put in the figure

482
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:41,370
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you extra white</font>

483
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:43,529
space so I I think you close the tea and

484
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:48,570
then open your figure generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

485
00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:51,720
thank you yep would it be possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

become a copy of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation yes</font>

with if your text relies on old RFC's

512
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:31,950
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend looking at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FAQ</font>

this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an empty author block I wouldn't</font>

516
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,090
recommend starting with an empty author

517
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:48,129
block in philly and then so much as<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

518
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:49,659
mentioned that ID wizard kind of you

519
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:51,070
just fill in a form with your name and

520
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:55,810
then it spits it out with your

521
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:59,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">information all in the right places if</font>

522
00:31:55,810 --> 00:32:02,050
you're using lists and ID's definitely

523
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,990
seem to have a lot of lists these are

524
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:07,510
the styles that are available so empty

525
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,760
is simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> indentation you have numbers</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">lists symbols you can control what the</font>

533
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:35,530

535
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:42,340

544
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:11,020
mentioned earlier see data so in a

figure artwork it won't parse the

546
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:15,150
content if you put in this see data

547
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:24,520
especially useful if you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

548
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">put XML or HTML into your draft because</font>

549
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:32,200
you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replace all the angle</font>

550
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:35,409
brackets so references is usually the

551
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,140
sticking point as I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> there are</font>

552
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:41,860
citation libraries and they have names

553
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:45,910
that you can expect so for RFC's it's

554
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:48,669
always RFC capitalized and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> four digit</font>

555
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:55,750
identifier and for internet-drafts it

556
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:57,730
always starts with I hyphen D and when

557
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:03,610
you don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> include a version number it it</font>

558
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:09,429
chooses<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most recent</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so this is a</font>

00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:21,639
people maintain a copy locally but

564
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,080
there's no need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that in the sense</font>

565
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:25,389
that if you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the online</font>

566
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,340
converter it recognizes the names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

567
00:34:25,389 --> 00:34:30,370
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> pull the reference information from</font>

568
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:31,690
these libraries so as mentioned there's

569
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,618
RFC an internet draft

570
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:40,020
and then there's w3c documents jsf which

571
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:42,609
is like XMPP the jabber documents freak

572
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,849
3gpp documents and then miscellaneous

573
00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:48,190
has a big mix of different SEOs and

574
00:34:45,849 --> 00:34:52,240
they're not very<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date there is a</font>

575
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:56,409
new one which is bib<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML 6 which has I</font>

580
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:08,319
to reference so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tricky parts</font>

581
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,720
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML RFC is that there are</font>

582
00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:13,810
different ways to get the references to

583
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,470
do what you want the short way is just

584
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:21,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">using and include it's relying on an RFC</font>

585
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:24,910
specific processing instruction so some

586
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:27,160
people don't don't like it the long way

587
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:30,700
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you define an entity at the top</font>

588
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:33,549
and then you call the entity in the

589
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:35,470
references section and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really long</font>

590
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:37,089
way would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you copy and paste in</font>

591
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:39,879
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> holding of the complete reference</font>

592
00:35:37,089 --> 00:35:41,230
element which you need to do if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

593
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,060
referencing something that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

595
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:55,210

596
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:57,329
they're making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it works offline so if</font>

597
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,859
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> relying on the citation libraries</font>

598
00:35:57,329 --> 00:36:04,119
and you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copy of them on</font>

599
00:35:59,859 --> 00:36:05,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">your machine then it's nice to have the</font>

600
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,599
complete reference in there if you're

601
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:27,970
trying to get output from XML RFC while

602
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:31,380
you're offline right so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's a</font>

603
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:33,700
sync problem right because as you know

604
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,250
internet-drafts often get replaced so

605
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,200
what was on version 05 when you wrote

606
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:40,480
your you reference version 05<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font>

607
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,080
internet draft and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then I you know a</font>

608
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,380
month<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it could be on version 10</font>

609
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:49,930
um or other SD owes documents obviously

610
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,760
change change over time so the downside

611
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:54,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">of doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> number three is that you're</font>

612
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,740
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard coding all the content of</font>

613
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:00,700
the reference into your document and

614
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:02,919
some references are a moving target so

615
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,049
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an example of the short way you</font>

616
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:08,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">just put the include into the reference</font>

617
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:11,230
section and you get this text output

618
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:18,550
based on the reference elements that are

619
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:20,440
in the citation library this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an</font>

620
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">example of the long way at the top of</font>

621
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,980
the document you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have these entities</font>

622
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,710
it's helpful if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

623
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:29,310
template so you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in</font>

624
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:34,870
there and then in the references section

625
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:36,880
you use the ampersand and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

626
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:40,509
long way is to put in the whole

627
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,160
reference element so for RFC<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2119 it</font>

628
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,630
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make sense to put in the</font>

629
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,029
whole reference because it's an easy one

630
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:49,600
to use the citation library for but if

631
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:52,270
you wanted to reference a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia page</font>

632
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,509
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you know you're gonna have</font>

633
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make a reference from scratch so this</font>

634
00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:02,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">is a template for a reference from</font>

635
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:04,570
scratch you um the DTD does require the

636
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,160
date element but it can be empty so you

637
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:10,840
can have an empty date element in there

638
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,640
another trick with the reference from

639
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:18,370
scratch is let's say you're citing

640
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,410
another stos document and you want the

641
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:24,100
organization to be listed<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the author</font>

642
00:38:20,410 --> 00:38:28,210
you leave the author attributes empty so

643
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:31,270
initial surname full name blank and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

644
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:33,310
you put organization you put in the

645
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:35,800
right now that organization element is

646
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:37,570
empty but you put in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a content there and</font>

647
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,680
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> it will list that organization as</font>

648
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:44,740
the author cuz thats helpful in that you

649
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:49,569
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack the author attributes</font>

650
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:52,180
to try to get the output you want so for

651
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:56,440
reference tags some people like to use

652
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:57,520
one instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of RFC</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2119 you know one two</font>

653
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,980
three numeric or

654
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:02,520
Frances you can control that with a

655
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:07,120
processing instruction called sim refs

656
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,710
so if you set sim refs equal to no sim

657
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,160
means symbolic then you would get the

658
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:15,550
the numbers and also some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font>

659
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,529
get use the names instead of the RFC

660
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:22,360
numbers like mentioned I could be too

661
00:39:19,530 --> 00:39:25,120
this is a one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the downfalls I think</font>

662
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,680
of XML<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tower of cv2 is in order to do</font>

663
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,930
that you actually have to put the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole</font>

664
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:30,759
reference complete reference element

00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:32,980
into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> document and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then change the</font>

666
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,170
anchor whereas when we were talking

<font color="#E5E5E5">about in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roth edit it was easy you just</font>

668
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:41,080
put the label next to the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it</font>

669
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:43,330
generated the right thing also<font color="#CCCCCC"> once</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

670
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:44,650
change the anchor to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I could be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two then</font>

671
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:46,930
every time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to cite that</font>

672
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:49,570
document in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the body you know within the</font>

673
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">body of your document you need to have</font>

674
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:55,840
xref target equals I could be too

675
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,029
because you've renamed it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay going</font>

676
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">into the table structure in XML Darcy</font>

677
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:05,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's called text table it does not have</font>

678
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:09,089
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> much functionality as an HTML table</font>

679
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:13,780
obviously it's pretty pretty basic

680
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:15,520
that's why I put the little white box in

681
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:18,400
the bottom that says figure artwork

682
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:19,990
elements are another option so basically

683
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,420
if you want to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything fancy with</font>

684
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:24,129
the table like you want to have to row

685
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,740
you know combined rose or component

686
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:30,340
behind columns you have to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

687
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:32,680
yourself meaning it's basically ascii

688
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:36,970
art table and you put it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a figure</font>

689
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:43,410
artwork text table works well for

690
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:46,509
straightforward tables some tips<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

691
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:48,879
recommend using X rough for references

692
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:52,510
instead of typing in square brackets

693
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,720
into your the body of your document that

694
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,790
would similarly for section references

695
00:40:55,720 --> 00:41:00,850
you don't want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> see section 9 you</font>

696
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:06,490
want to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> see xref target equals I</font>

697
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:08,980
Anna considerations and for lists you

698
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:11,200
want to use the list element don't put

699
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:14,320
the list in as a figure and do the

700
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,848
indentation yourself the beauty of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

701
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:19,060
list element is that it'll line

702
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:25,119
everything up nicely<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it does nested</font>

703
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:27,820
lists just fine so some people with v2

704
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,220
are seeing errors like the DTD errors

705
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:33,250
that they hadn't seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> before because V</font>

709
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:45,099
you have to put a<font color="#CCCCCC"> tee tag around the</font>

710
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:49,780
whole list or simply leave a preceding

712

713
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,390
and it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> not complain but now it</font>

complains so<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML parts entity ref no</font>

715

name it's basically you have an

716
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,310
ampersand in your text you need to

717
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:08,140
replace it<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the entity for an</font>

718

720
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:16,119
but then you can put your xml file to

721
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,579
work you can exchange it with your

722
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,920

if you consolidate your ex

into one file for example some people

748
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:34,690
use local citation libraries run the

file using XML to RFC as available

750
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:40,090

and output might not be there one

757
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,660
problem people<font color="#E5E5E5"> run into with XML Darcy</font>

758
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,480
is white space how do I control the

759
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:05,549
white space within my a document how do

760
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:07,930
I get blank lines between list items or

761
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,670
compress the text so there are no blank

762
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,279
lines so there's a processing

763
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:16,780
instruction compact and there's also a

764
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:18,430
sub compact compact equals yes will not

765
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,330
start each main section on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new page</font>

766
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:26,109
which in the opinion of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the RFC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etter is</font>

767
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:29,140
good subcompact equals no puts one blank

768
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:31,570
line between each list item and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> V</font>

769
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:36,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">space is an element that's kind of a</font>

770
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:39,490
hack that forces blank lines or even can

771
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:41,799
just force a line break but hopefully

772
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:43,930
you can just set compact equals yes and

773
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,230
subcompact<font color="#E5E5E5"> deals no and you'll be happy</font>

774
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:49,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">with output but if you're not you can</font>

775
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:54,430
turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> them on and off within the document</font>

776
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:56,860
and compact also affects the text table

777
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:59,230
output so some people like their tables

778
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:04,210
to have a blank line between each row

779
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:08,620
and compact actually you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> set</font>

780
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:14,850
compact equal to<font color="#CCCCCC"> no there's lots more</font>

781
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:18,220
functionality and i recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> the faq</font>

782
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:24,549
that's the last link is also linked to

783
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:26,649
from the main page<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wrote it so that's</font>

784
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:29,710
part of why i recommend it but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

785
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:34,020
some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the common things that people</font>

786
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:34,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">run into so I</font>

787
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:41,098
I think I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> do the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font>

788
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:53,770
demos so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what the I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

789
00:45:51,700 --> 00:46:01,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">if I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be of my display to do the</font>

790
00:45:53,770 --> 00:46:04,660
right thing for this this is the

791
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:08,200
converter form so you can see the

792
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:10,390
options you have there basically if you

793
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:14,910
if your goal is to upload your internet

794
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:25,060
draft you want it set to plain text and

795
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:28,140
file this RFC markup option is the

796
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:36,270
script<font color="#CCCCCC"> fit if you ever look at the tools</font>

797
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:39,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ITF torg HTML it has the links it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

798
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:42,220
haven't actually tried that out but that

799
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">would give you an HTML output with with</font>

800
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:52,240
links and then scrolling down on this

801
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:53,799
page as I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned is the list of the</font>

802
00:46:52,240 --> 00:47:01,959
citation libraries if you're looking for

803
00:46:53,800 --> 00:47:05,280
that and I thought there was a link to

804
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:10,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wizard on this page but there's not</font>

805
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,470
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> X melt RFC hyphen wizard so this</font>

806
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:15,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one I mentioned a couple of times</font>

807
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:17,049
just for it's basically like making your

808
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:18,700
own template instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> starting with a</font>

809
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:21,430
template you know you fill out this form

810
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:25,839
and then farther down on the page it's

811
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:28,960
creating the xml file so it won't help

812
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,710
you with tricky things like tables or

813
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:38,410
lists but it will help you get that

814
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:41,920
frontmatter going so personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> I edit</font>

815
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:46,990
my xml file in Emacs and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> I convert</font>

816
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:49,890
using XML Darcy and its installed on the

817
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:49,890
command line

818
00:47:51,800 --> 00:48:08,220
which there's not much to demo there

819
00:47:54,150 --> 00:48:10,470
just creates your<font color="#E5E5E5"> txt file</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

820
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:13,169
over them mark down one of the markdown

821
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:17,939
options so this tool is created by

822

carsten<font color="#CCCCCC"> bormann as mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the link to</font>

space was his<font color="#E5E5E5"> tutorial that goes into</font>

825
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:27,270

826
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,120
highlights from his<font color="#E5E5E5"> tutorial to give you</font>

you wanna if it's appealing to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

829
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:40,170
basically you feed a markdown file to

830
00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:44,130
his tool it creates<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML and then you</font>

831
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:46,470
feed<font color="#CCCCCC"> that XML to XML RFC which you could</font>

832
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:51,420
either do on the command line or do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

00:48:46,470 --> 00:48:54,779
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the online converter so why would</font>

834
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:56,610
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> choose this tool as Hugh describes</font>

835
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:01,290
its<font color="#CCCCCC"> distraction-free writing so you can</font>

836
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:03,690
focus on the content the QuickStart

837
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:07,140
guide is used gem to install his tool

838
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:09,060
and pip to install<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML RFC then you edit</font>

839
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:11,700
your mark down<font color="#CCCCCC"> in your favorite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> editor</font>

841
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:17,460
down or<font color="#E5E5E5"> markdown pad and this is what it</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looks like if you've edited a</font>

844
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:31,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it gets a little clunky is the</font>

845
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:35,420
table I mean you could argue the tables

846
00:49:31,050 --> 00:49:38,550
also clunky writing in XML directly

847
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:40,200

Tilda's in a row there and that's

850
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:51,150
basically going to create a figure

851
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:53,430
artwork in the xml output and then every

854
00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:06,390
equivalent of like extra target equals

slides there's also a side-by-side

864
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:35,020
converter that's a work in progress so

865
00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:37,839
you have the mark down on the left and

866
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,690
your text output on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so that's</font>

872
00:50:54,069 --> 00:51:02,920
the basics and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's relying on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cram down</font>

template which you can also get from the

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:24,060
cram down page so finally looking

879
00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:30,400
briefly at licks to RFC this is nique

880

um apparently this for some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> likes</font>

883
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,609
this is something they're already

884
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:56,770
familiar with and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is an easy way to</font>

885
00:51:47,609 --> 00:52:02,020
get an<font color="#CCCCCC"> xml file and you use licks which</font>

886
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:04,390
is available on<font color="#E5E5E5"> linux and as mentioned</font>

887
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,460
mostly used in academia free stable easy

888
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:10,060
to use a<font color="#E5E5E5"> complete internet-draft can be</font>

889
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:14,800
written with no xml it does all the

890
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:16,930
functionality we've talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about and it</font>

891
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,290
does let you rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the citation</font>

892
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:25,720
library and you can get HTML plain text

893
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:30,819
or xml to feed xml dark sea so this site

894
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:33,180
for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the URL at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the beginning</font>

899
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:54,210
that's not his um there's a github page

900
