1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,300
how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here are new to the IETF</font>

2
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:18,130
excellent welcome at the end of this

3
00:00:14,289 --> 00:00:20,859
tutorial you're going to see a link for

4
00:00:18,130 --> 00:00:23,410
a survey we are actively looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at how</font>

5
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:25,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to improve EDT materials and the</font>

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,710
tutorials and we ask that if you take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:32,140
few minutes to fill out that survey that

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:35,890
would be most appreciated so today to

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:39,940
provide the interior / / you is suresh

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:42,969
krishna from erickson he is a long long

11
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,890
time participant in the IETF he has been

12
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:47,320
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> nam com chair he's currently working</font>

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:50,649
group chair of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> inter area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,140
group and the SoftWIRE working group you

15
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,660
will occasionally see him on Saturdays

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,640
participating in code sprint and he's

17
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,890
also worked on the diversity effort here

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,570
at the IETF so you see him in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the halls</font>

19
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,530
afterwards and you have any questions he

20
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,870
has a broad swath of experience in the

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:12,790
ITF and so at this point I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:13,750
leave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suresh thanks Karen so I</font>

23
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:15,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know you've you know the</font>

24
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,410
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> others overviews but there's</font>

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,240
like several areas in the IETF and every

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:22,000
idea if we tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to cover one of the</font>

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,369
areas so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is the turn of the</font>

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,650
internet area<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and so we had like</font>

29
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:28,350
tutorials for routing and security

30
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:30,460
before and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

31
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Proceedings of the previous meetings you</font>

32
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,399
can find those<font color="#E5E5E5"> too so if you want to get</font>

33
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:41,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a brief introduction to the other areas</font>

34
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,910
and it's like so what I want to cover

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,610
here today is like pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much like the</font>

36
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:48,070
background of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet area and what</font>

37
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:51,460
kind of work<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being done here yeah and</font>

38
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:52,929
some pointers for you to read so if you

39
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,550
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get more into the internet area</font>

40
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,800
what are the documents you need to start

41
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:58,539
with yeah so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

42
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,009
exhaustive you're not going to get all

43
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,610
the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of it but it'll give</font>

44
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:08,709
you an idea of what<font color="#CCCCCC"> to expect in the</font>

45
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:10,959
area yeah next slide so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

46
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:13,450
area is like one of the seven areas in

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,450
the IDF and so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

48
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers like the numbers look like very</font>

49
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">much like 17</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we are like four</font>

50
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,239
person of the documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

51
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:25,870
published we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like 14 person of the</font>

52
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">80s almost and so the working groups</font>

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,659
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all like we are around like one</font>

54
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,329
seventh of everything so like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

55
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,969
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of pulling our weight</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the IDF</font>

56
00:02:31,329 --> 00:02:36,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in turn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> area used to be much larger</font>

57
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,409
like in the earlier days but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

58
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,950
the lot of the reorg some the<font color="#E5E5E5"> art area</font>

59
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">has kind of become bigger and we also</font>

60
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:45,010
like make it a point to close down

61
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">working groups when they are done so</font>

62
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,459
like working group stone and stick

63
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:51,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for too long but there are</font>

64
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,169
exceptions that I'll talk about but

65
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's something like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we are very</font>

66
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,659
diligent in opening new things and

67
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:02,230
closing like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> all-stars yeah next</font>

68
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:04,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">thing so um what you see there is like</font>

69
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:06,369
the code protocols of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet area</font>

70
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,530
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the OSI model like if</font>

71
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,060
lot of you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have studied this in</font>

72
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,340
school right like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like very</font>

73
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">realistic in the world today but they</font>

74
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,370
are in the layer<font color="#CCCCCC"> three of the OSI model</font>

75
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:20,469
so the network layer and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking</font>

76
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,909
more downloads on the internet layer and

77
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:26,909
looking downloads not as much upwards

78
00:03:21,909 --> 00:03:31,000
yeah and so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> pee like before and ipv6</font>

79
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:34,750
are like the core protocols of this area

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and along with DNS so these things kind</font>

81
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,739
of are required for everything that

82
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,708
connects to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so we're kind</font>

83
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:44,169
of the basis for everything connecting

84
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,379
to the internet yeah and we also have

85
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">other protocols like dhcp mobile IP and</font>

86
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:52,929
ntp which are also very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> critical so</font>

87
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,430
dhcp kind of gives you configuration

88
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:57,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">parameters which are not your address</font>

89
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,560
and dns servers they all come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> dhcp</font>

90
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,720
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know what are your</font>

91
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,599
time servers or like where your proxy is

92
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:10,000
like you use something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like dhcp yeah</font>

93
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:13,388
and mobile IP is stuff that's useful

94
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,310
mobility so when you have like phones or

95
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,918
devices that move so how do you keep

96
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:19,959
connected with the same information like

97
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:21,698
connectivity information so that comes

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,080
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of mobile IP so if you see a lot of</font>

99
00:04:21,699 --> 00:04:25,630
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things have like v4 and v6</font>

100
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,300
versions and that's by design so we

101
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want to mix configuration</font>

102
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,380
information on mobility information

103
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:35,020
across versions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so ipv4</font>

104
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:37,450
has been the very strong base on which

105
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,010
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet has been built but it's not</font>

106
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,390
going to take us much far into the

107
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,270
future if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> running out of</font>

108
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,219
addresses there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of hacks that</font>

109
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,719
we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we have like gnats and</font>

110
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,120
bigger nuts you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a gnat in your home</font>

111
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,910
not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the providers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network and so on</font>

112
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,800
and it's making life very very<font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult</font>

113
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,040
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody so like v6 is the way</font>

114
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,390
going forward so if you go into sessions

115
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,150
you'll see like lot of the stuff is

116
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:05,919
focused on v6 and that's by design<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

117
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and ntp is like a protocol for time</font>

118
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,680
so if your computer like shows the right

119
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:13,479
time most likely it's because of ntp

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,400
okay so like you're picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the time</font>

121
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,640
from somewhere else which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is probably</font>

122
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:21,460
got a higher accuracy clock ok so like

123
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,930
ntp is a protocol that does it so these

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,359
are kind of the core protocols in the

125
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,450
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll give you pointers like for the</font>

126
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,730
RFC's to read about these things so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

127
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:39,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a brief overview of what</font>

128
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:43,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to know before</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks like next</font>

129
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,430
life<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what I've done is I don't</font>

130
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:48,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know if you can see clearly in the back</font>

131
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,770
do you see the text clearly or<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay yes</font>

132
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,710
so what I've done is like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of done</font>

133
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:55,859
like a scatter of like the groups in the

134
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:59,409
area okay so this is like a very very

135
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:01,180
approximate grouping off working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

136
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,160
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet area yes this is like</font>

137
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,680
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking groups could be in one</font>

138
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,940
place another but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a idea of</font>

139
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,460
like where you want to concentrate on

140
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:10,960
yeah so for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example if you want to look</font>

141
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the core stuff in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet area</font>

142
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,520
like the stuff about IP dhcp dns these

143
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,190
are the working groups you need to pop

144
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,299
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay or if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're interested in</font>

145
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:25,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">like mobility and multihoming you can</font>

146
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,700
look at the stuff in blue yeah the

147
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,940
slides are available at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the editing</font>

148
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:32,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vicki and there's a link at the end you</font>

149
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:36,460
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a photo off if you want to look</font>

150
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:38,050
at the stuff afterwards and so these are

151
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">the kind of broad area so there's like</font>

152
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">core protocols which I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going on</font>

153
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:43,720
for a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's mobility stuff</font>

154
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,000
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also on going for a bit and</font>

155
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,380
there's also the low

156
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,080
our stuff that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> new in the area</font>

157
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so what we're trying to do is build</font>

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,219
IP on top of lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the low power</font>

159
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:56,469
networks so if you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

160
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,870
6lowpan or like some sensor device so

161
00:06:56,470 --> 00:07:01,270
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make them first-class</font>

162
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,830
citizens in IP world instead of putting

163
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,380
them behind some proprietary protocol

164
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:08,349
and having a gateway<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so we are</font>

165
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,390
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do those kind of efforts in</font>

166
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:13,090
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet area as well to make IP</font>

167
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,659
down on everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the time</font>

168
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:18,239
stuff is over there it's kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like</font>

169
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:21,190
isolated from the rest of the area and

170
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,020
so Karen will like fill us in on like

171
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:26,080
what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening on the time side yeah</font>

172
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:27,549
and there's also the transition work so

173
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,370
the transition work is kind of twofold

174
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:33,760
first thing is like how do we get v6

175
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:36,100
into people's network and following that

176
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,599
like how do we get out before<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

177
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,450
how do we gracefully transition out

178
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:43,810
before and go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a v6 hunting at work</font>

179
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:49,510
or provide v4 services<font color="#E5E5E5"> or v6 that's like</font>

180
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:51,220
a set of working groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> next like so</font>

181
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:53,140
that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> way of looking at stuff ok so</font>

182
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,240
I'm talking about technology right so

183
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,800
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and the second set of</font>

184
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,260
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this is like very very</font>

185
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,880
subjective this is my view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of like how I</font>

186
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:03,479
see the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so people may</font>

187
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,969
disagree even reasonable people yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

188
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:09,580
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in like the faces</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

189
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:10,990
working group ok so like something on

190
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,120
the left is something that's recently

191
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,440
started up which<font color="#E5E5E5"> means that let's say</font>

192
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,390
your new like you probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> have more</font>

193
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,669
things to do there rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than something</font>

194
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,080
that's shutting down<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so when a</font>

195
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:25,150
working group is shutting down they

196
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,560
probably know like all the things they

197
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:28,359
have to do and they're probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

198
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,419
less open to new people coming in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

199
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,159
bringing up in your ideas<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so try to</font>

200
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:34,750
focus on the stuff on the left or in the

201
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:38,229
middle let's say for<font color="#CCCCCC"> your first</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting</font>

202
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">ok and the stuff on the right you go in</font>

203
00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:44,140
more for information like don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> expect</font>

204
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,580
like people to be always looking for new

205
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:47,880
ideas over there so the stuff on the

206
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:53,290
right is probably like winding down so

207
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,820
don't try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually keep the right</font>

208
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:56,439
mind frame and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to these things ok</font>

209
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,820
so like the stuff on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left like</font>

210
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,649
people are like more looking for new

211
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:01,809
ideas stuff in the mid

212
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,369
it's like a mix of old ideas and new

213
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:05,350
ideas and like<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintenance and things</font>

214
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:11,949
like that stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the right it's gonna</font>

215
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:14,559
probably closed down some okay okay so

216
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:16,689
any questions till now like I'm gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

217
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,429
like a brief overview of each<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

218
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:19,779
group so I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna have much time to</font>

219
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:21,970
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about each one that's like 19 of</font>

220
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:30,699
them so I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take some questions</font>

221
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:44,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">now if you have questions okay perfect</font>

222
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:47,229
oh there is um so I'm gonna get into

223
00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:49,899
that so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a something called</font>

224
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,970
a data tracker where we it's kind of the

225
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:53,470
tools that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use for ITF itself right</font>

226
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:55,149
like so we can find information about

227
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:56,290
all the working groups and all the

228
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,339
documents in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the working groups I'm</font>

229
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,040
gonna cover that at the end of the

230
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,639
presentation okay and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's like</font>

231
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,719
a very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question that you asked and</font>

232
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:07,179
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of information it's very</font>

233
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">hard to find and we done like really</font>

234
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:11,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">good job bringing this up okay like so</font>

235
00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:13,569
maybe 10 years ago things are much

236
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,579
harder to find then today if it's like

237
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:18,009
it's tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> believe but it is so I</font>

238
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:20,319
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I will cover it and then we</font>

239
00:10:18,009 --> 00:10:27,970
can talk a bit more at the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

240
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:28,990
thanks um yeah so<font color="#CCCCCC"> six slow is one of the</font>

241
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,550
new working<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups so what I've done is</font>

242
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:32,800
like a color-coded like each working

243
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">group like to the kind of the area so</font>

244
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,540
like it's kind of you can correlate it

245
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:42,459
with like low power or not so six Louis

246
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,549
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> work which is developing the ipv6</font>

247
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:47,378
stuff on link layers that are very

248
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:50,199
constrained<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so if you look at like</font>

249
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:54,220
a sensor it runs like 80 route 15 for

250
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:57,459
which is like a lo pan any kind of

251
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,899
optimizations for the IP protocols for

252
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,929
those layers is getting done<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font>

253
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:05,740
working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and they have like</font>

254
00:11:01,929 --> 00:11:07,449
lot of relationships<font color="#CCCCCC"> with other standard</font>

255
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:09,009
bodies who do these kind of link layers

256
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:12,639
because we don't do the link layers in

257
00:11:09,009 --> 00:11:13,089
the IDF okay so we kind of liaised with

258
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,269
them

259
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:17,860
we take their specifications and we work

260
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:19,600
according to their constraints because

261
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,850
let's say for example this like a link

262
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,149
layer that doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> support multicast</font>

263
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,949
very well and ipv6 is like that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

264
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:28,329
of multicast<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so something's gotta</font>

265
00:11:26,949 --> 00:11:31,469
change so those kind of adaptations

266
00:11:28,329 --> 00:11:36,969
happen in a working group like this okay

267
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:40,689
so it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like so six man is like kind</font>

268
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:43,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the maintenance working group for</font>

269
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:45,550
ipv6<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we had</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like an ipv6 working</font>

270
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,979
group for<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the longest time and at</font>

271
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,559
some point we wanted to signal<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

272
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,259
industry that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of ipv6 is ready to</font>

273
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,329
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we don't want to keep working</font>

274
00:11:53,259 --> 00:11:57,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">on enhancements all the time so we said</font>

275
00:11:55,329 --> 00:12:00,399
okay like ipv6 is like ready for

276
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:02,559
deployment and six man is like a

277
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:05,199
maintenance working group for ipv6 so if

278
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,689
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go to the field and there's like we</font>

279
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:09,519
find issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> there and the issues come</font>

280
00:12:07,689 --> 00:12:11,559
back using<font color="#E5E5E5"> some other working group in</font>

281
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the operations area okay so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

282
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:15,610
like oh this stuff you did it's

283
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,498
completely broken<font color="#E5E5E5"> so fix it so those</font>

284
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:20,019
kind of fixes the maintenance fixes the

285
00:12:17,499 --> 00:12:25,029
minor enhancements they<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen in six</font>

286
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:27,490
man for ipv6<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so and it also does</font>

287
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:29,379
like so the v6 is like a extensible

288
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,779
protocol so there's like options there's

289
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:33,999
like headers extension headers so<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

290
00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,490
kind of things can be used in any

291
00:12:33,999 --> 00:12:39,910
working group in the IDF and so six man

292
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:43,269
gets the last say in whether those are

293
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,519
approved or not so the six-man guys get

294
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:47,110
to review like what the other working

295
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:53,079
groups in the idea for doing extending

296
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:56,879
v6 yeah excellent and six ish this is

297
00:12:53,079 --> 00:13:01,929
also another<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and</font>

298
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:03,670
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like a very very simple time</font>

299
00:13:01,929 --> 00:13:08,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">slaughtered thing so there's no like fun</font>

300
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,490
there's no exotic scheduling stuff here

301
00:13:08,319 --> 00:13:11,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay everything is like on a time</font>

302
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:13,149
slaughter you just hop and everybody

303
00:13:11,379 --> 00:13:15,939
gets a time slot and they and they talk

304
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so so this is like a technology</font>

305
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:21,370
developed in I triply it's one of the 15

306
00:13:18,309 --> 00:13:23,790
dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> 4 variants and six dish does the v6</font>

307
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:26,529
on top of it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so they have light now a</font>

308
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:29,980
minimal profile for v6 to run on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of</font>

309
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:32,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">so that's what they do okay so they are</font>

310
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:37,810
like tightly bound<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one specific link</font>

311
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:39,879
layer yeah it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like I</font>

312
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,079
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if I'm like exactly right but</font>

313
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:43,709
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably the oldest group in the</font>

314
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:46,329
ITF<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it was chartered like in</font>

315
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,339
1991 so it's like 24 years old so like

316
00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:49,839
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always good in closing</font>

317
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:51,999
working groups okay so but there's like

318
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,120
when there's a lot of work to do the

319
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:56,800
working groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> just stick around and</font>

320
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,089
since dhcp is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocol for</font>

321
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,889
delivering configuration information

322
00:13:58,089 --> 00:14:01,509
there's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> like new configuration</font>

323
00:13:59,889 --> 00:14:03,939
information to give up so like this

324
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group doesn't die because</font>

325
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:07,748
there's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like people who want to</font>

326
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,870
do stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so for example right like</font>

327
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:12,339
what we discard right now is that for

328
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the transition mechanisms we talked</font>

329
00:14:12,339 --> 00:14:16,269
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> for v6 right somebody needs to</font>

330
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,319
give the configuration information that

331
00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,999
becomes dhcp okay and if you looked at

332
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:23,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">like what happened with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Snowden</font>

333
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:25,629
affair right like so peep there's like a

334
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:26,860
lot of privacy kinds stuff that's

335
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:28,209
happening because there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> gamma and</font>

336
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:31,540
snooping on people and things like that

337
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:33,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">so we look at DHC and figure out like</font>

338
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,379
okay what's leaking so when I look at a

339
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:37,750
DHCP message you sent out what can I

340
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:39,430
know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> you right so there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

341
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,620
instance of like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canadian government</font>

342
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:43,149
right like they they were snooping on

343
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:45,160
people at the airports so they put up

344
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:47,439
like access points and they look at like

345
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,969
a mac address and they could figure out

346
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,139
where you're going right like so they

347
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,939
know where you're flying from where

348
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're flying to so there's like lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

349
00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:56,860
changes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happened in the world</font>

350
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,269
and like we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> all reacting to this</font>

351
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,709
right like so this kind of pervasive

352
00:14:58,269 --> 00:15:03,279
monitoring those kind of work is

353
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:04,719
happening in all the groups and we done

354
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,699
a really good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the higher layers</font>

355
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,100
right like so like it's easier to defend

356
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:11,829
HTTP information leakage<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure we put it</font>

357
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,629
in HTTPS and like people cannot see

358
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,479
stuff right but on the lower layers

359
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:19,000
there's like a lot of stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> leaks</font>

360
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,339
us all okay so your for example if you

361
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,800
take the default ipv6 address you all

362
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:26,350
get it's based on a mac address wherever

363
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">you go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i could look at the last 64</font>

364
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,329
bits of your address to figure out who

365
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">you are like across like time across</font>

366
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:36,219
countries where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so stuff</font>

367
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:39,689
like that we we go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and keep fixing</font>

368
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:45,220
them as well so next<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lane</font>

369
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:47,860
and so we done quite a bit of mobility

370
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:49,959
work in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> IDF</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's not been I</font>

371
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,760
won't call it very successful in the

372
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,920
real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like a lot of the</font>

373
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,279
networks that you see 3gpp networks like

374
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,050
the mobile phones they don't use the

375
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,700
idea of mobility protocols so in that

376
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:04,719
way we kind of like not succeeded very

377
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:06,760
well but we still have quite a bit of

378
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,630
deployment like mainly in the Wi-Fi side

379
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,189
and like lot of this work is kind of

380
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:13,660
maintenance work so we have protocols

381
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:16,600
deployed there's like issues that we

382
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,969
find and small optimizations we can do

383
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,220
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could instead of sending</font>

384
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,810
everything to a home agent right like

385
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,550
and sending the traffic card we could

386
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:25,750
try to take a more<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct path so those</font>

387
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:28,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the kind of optimizations we're</font>

388
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:36,339
working on in this dmm working group

389
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:38,620
it's like and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> dns SD so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

390
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:42,370
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a new effort and that's</font>

391
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,170
happening so a bunch of you have max so

392
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:45,940
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at something like Bonjour</font>

393
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,579
right like it what it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> is its</font>

394
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,079
service discovery using multicast<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

395
00:16:48,579 --> 00:16:52,630
so what it does is it's trying to

396
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:54,010
discover stuff on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same link by doing</font>

397
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:56,500
a multicast message to figure out what

398
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:58,089
else is in there<font color="#E5E5E5"> except that it works</font>

399
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,610
only on your link so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're on a</font>

400
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:02,320
campus network or on an enterprise

401
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,419
network if you have a printer<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one</font>

402
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,730
hop away you're not gonna be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

403
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:08,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so what happened is like a lot</font>

404
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">of people started like a grassroots</font>

405
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:15,369
petition to extend this<font color="#E5E5E5"> across one link</font>

406
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:18,428
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so that kind of like came back to</font>

407
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:21,159
the IDF and to do like something that

408
00:17:18,429 --> 00:17:22,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">works across multiple links so what</font>

409
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,350
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is extend what we</font>

410
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:28,928
have as ITF specifications and make them

411
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:31,090
work across like bigger links how to

412
00:17:28,929 --> 00:17:34,000
make them<font color="#CCCCCC"> more scalable how to make them</font>

413
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:41,500
cross links<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS</font>

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:43,030
SD group is doing and so the DNS privacy

415
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,620
worked like I told you right it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

416
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,059
of like there's a lot of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> privacy</font>

417
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:48,570
work that's happening in the idea that's

418
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,830
direct result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pervasive</font>

419
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,168
monitoring that's happening around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

420
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,178
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so at the</font>

421
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:57,759
is like a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very key protocol so just</font>

422
00:17:55,179 --> 00:17:59,169
by looking at your DNS request I'd even

423
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,080
if your traffic is encrypted I could

424
00:17:59,169 --> 00:18:04,470
still figure out what you're looking at

425
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,489
right like so I know you're going to

426
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:08,109
some site you're not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to</font>

427
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:10,869
in some country right so there's like a

428
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:13,779
lot of stuff we take for granted in some

429
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:16,209
countries which are not available<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

430
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:18,009
other countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like so censorship</font>

431
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,399
is like very very prevalent in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

432
00:18:18,009 --> 00:18:25,389
the world and there is stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can</font>

433
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:28,779
do as protocol designers to help people

434
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:30,129
out in in regimes where they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

435
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:32,919
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of freedoms like the</font>

436
00:18:30,129 --> 00:18:35,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provides okay so this is like</font>

437
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:43,269
something specifically targeted towards

438
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:45,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">bns privacy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next light so hip is a</font>

439
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:47,830
protocol that came out a while ago it

440
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,330
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a grand unifying</font>

441
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:51,418
protocol so like how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

442
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">multihoming work how do you make</font>

443
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:58,179
mobility work and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the problems</font>

444
00:18:54,369 --> 00:19:00,730
that has identified was IP kind of mix

445
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:03,489
the locator and identifiers<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so like</font>

446
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:05,739
your IP address is both who you are and

447
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:08,109
where you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so the idea was to</font>

448
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">split out those things right and hip</font>

449
00:19:08,109 --> 00:19:10,989
gave you like a cryptographic identity

450
00:19:09,789 --> 00:19:13,840
that you could carry with you wherever

451
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:15,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go along with binding it to your</font>

452
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,519
location okay so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> was like an</font>

453
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:21,039
experiment that happened and um I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

454
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:22,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">say like it worked pretty reasonably</font>

455
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,220
well right like so but it doesn't have

456
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,200
like the kind of deployment that's

457
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:29,169
needed but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> experiment itself worked</font>

458
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,789
so what people are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is use</font>

459
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:33,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">the results of the experiments or see</font>

460
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:35,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">what worked what didn't work and they're</font>

461
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:38,199
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to upgrade it to standards okay</font>

462
00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:40,330
so this is kind of like more so this is

463
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">something you you see in the IDF a lot</font>

464
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:45,399
of times when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how things</font>

465
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:46,379
are going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in the real world we</font>

466
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:48,729
send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out as experimental</font>

467
00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:51,399
specifications okay so if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at an</font>

468
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,909
RFC there's like a status for the RFC so

469
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,830
if you see experimental it means that it

470
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:59,889
we don't really know like if it's going

471
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:02,080
to work very<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in the wild</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we</font>

472
00:19:59,889 --> 00:20:03,668
send it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an experiment and see how</font>

473
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,559
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> works out so people bring back the</font>

474
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,580
experiences and then it becomes a

475
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:08,580
standard yeah

476
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:18,610
so a whole net is like a F get dizzy

477
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,429
from in a city could you explain the

478
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:25,120
difference between a hip and risp it

479
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:27,070
looks similar for me so please right so

480
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,699
um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're in the same class of</font>

481
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:32,408
solutions right so this identifier

482
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,600
locator problem has been around and

483
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,009
there's like multiple solutions ok so

484
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,019
the hip is like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution that's been</font>

485
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:42,159
around like longest<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it came before</font>

486
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:44,259
list<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so what ITF did is like we went</font>

487
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,480
to something the ITF so I ought to have

488
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:48,580
an IDF as closely aligned so the ITF

489
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,590
does the research work so there was like

490
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,240
a research group that was chartered<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

491
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:55,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was called the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rrg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the routing</font>

492
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,590
research group and soul is was like one

493
00:20:55,179 --> 00:21:00,279
of the solutions that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was discussed</font>

494
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,049
there so all of them have the same idea

495
00:21:00,279 --> 00:21:03,639
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> how they do it is different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

496
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:05,408
hip is like a cryptographic thing Lisp

497
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:07,330
is more like a map and end cap so what

498
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:09,340
he does you map the identity into

499
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:11,199
locator and the encapsulate to send the

500
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,908
stuff over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's not a protocol</font>

501
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,090
which was actually picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> does call I</font>

502
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:19,330
LNP so ID look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at her network protocol I</font>

503
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:21,070
think so so<font color="#CCCCCC"> though so there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

504
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:25,408
multiple solutions to this problem and

505
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,408
hip is one of them Lisp is another one

506
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:32,200
so whole net is like kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font>

507
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,939
controversial working group<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so so</font>

508
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,830
when you go into this meeting like don't

509
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">be surprised that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the people are like</font>

510
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,970
very excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and this is generally</font>

511
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:42,879
true for ITF there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of working</font>

512
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,590
groups where you think people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

513
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:46,509
fighting but it's kind of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

514
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,009
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so let people are like very</font>

515
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:50,559
excited they're like very passionate

516
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:53,799
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they do so it's sometimes</font>

517
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:57,940
comes out as it looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fighting okay</font>

518
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:59,499
so but like take<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with like I don't</font>

519
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,389
know like to abstract it out a little

520
00:21:59,499 --> 00:22:02,980
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> because people strongly believe in</font>

521
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:05,320
their points of view and this is one

522
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:08,559
group where people strongly believe in

523
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,908
the point of view right so um the base

524
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:11,529
idea of this working group is like you

525
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:12,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a router in your home right like</font>

526
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:15,309
everybody like was an internet

527
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:17,259
connection probably has a router and it

528
00:22:15,309 --> 00:22:18,639
all works fine as long as it's like one

529
00:22:17,259 --> 00:22:20,049
link in the home so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably have</font>

530
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:21,040
like one flat link in the home you have

531
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:23,590
a router and everyone

532
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:25,090
connects to it so what happens if you

533
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:26,080
have further links in your home what if

534
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,240
you have a router that connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

535
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,889
another router and it's got further

536
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,350
links behind it right so how do you

537
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,200
actually do the addressing for this how

538
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:36,879
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that when like Wireless</font>

539
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,160
conditions change inside your home how

540
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,710
do you do the topology changes how do

541
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,660
you do the routing so that's what like

542
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:46,360
home that is supposed to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that's</font>

543
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:47,770
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're working on so the stuff</font>

544
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,389
that's controversial like it's kind of

545
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:51,190
getting resolved right now is that like

546
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,680
what routing protocol to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

547
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:55,600
there's this protocol called Babel it's

548
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:58,210
like more used in like mesh networks and

549
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">ad-hoc networks and is is which is like</font>

550
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,440
more like<font color="#CCCCCC"> an enterprise and Internet</font>

551
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:04,510
kind of protocol so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the two</font>

552
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,220
protocols in the run and people have

553
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,200
been arguing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ever bought it and</font>

554
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:10,750
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chairs decided to break the</font>

555
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:12,040
tie and pick Babel so that's so the

556
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:17,860
voting group is going to be a bit more

557
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:19,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">smoother in in progress</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so um this</font>

558
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,550
is like very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> important because</font>

559
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,230
you're all going to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff in</font>

560
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,149
your home<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

561
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:26,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's kind of sitting in a</font>

562
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:28,450
network somewhere you don't always see

563
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:31,210
like what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out but this is like</font>

564
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:33,250
directly gonna affect what you see in

565
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:35,740
your home what like your grandma sees in

566
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,180
her home right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and this that's why</font>

567
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make this like simple</font>

568
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,660
and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a lot of tough choices</font>

569
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:47,110
to be made here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's why you would</font>

570
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:48,760
see part of controversy here yeah so

571
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:51,040
interiors of working group that I chair

572
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:53,710
and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

573
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,960
number i love working group ok so this

574
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:58,780
there's a few purposes of this one of

575
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:00,430
them is like a forum for people to

576
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,290
discuss things so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

577
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:04,270
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are common across multiple</font>

578
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,860
working groups and there's no place to

579
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk about it so interior as a place</font>

580
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:08,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">where if you have issues</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are</font>

581
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:12,580
spanning working groups you come<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

582
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:14,170
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it ok and it also takes like</font>

583
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,300
orphan work which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's like</font>

584
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:18,040
work that needs to get done but there's

585
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,810
not enough work to create a new<font color="#E5E5E5"> working</font>

586
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">group to do that instead overhead of</font>

587
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,520
creating something doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing and</font>

588
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,020
getting up<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok so like one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> items like</font>

589
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:29,950
also end up in the interior working

590
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,660
group and another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing is like this is</font>

591
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,640
how we interact with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other areas so</font>

592
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:34,720
if if this other areas need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell us</font>

593
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,610
something or

594
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,020
other SDOs let's say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I truly wants</font>

595
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:40,389
to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us something it comes through</font>

596
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,770
interior<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so it's kind of like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

597
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,750
umbrella working group we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

598
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:44,770
like a very defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> charter there's like</font>

599
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:46,900
if you look at like anything that

600
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,250
probably has area in it it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

601
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:50,950
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a regular working group because you</font>

602
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:53,650
don't have type milestones we don't have

603
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:58,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">very restricted chatter okay so this is</font>

604
00:24:53,650 --> 00:25:03,309
one of those groups looks like so the

605
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">Elving</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group is more it is like</font>

606
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,799
not like a typical working group because

607
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:08,260
they're not like really doing much

608
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:10,600
protocol work and they're more trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

609
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,750
see and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to people who implement</font>

610
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,658
sensors<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and try to document the</font>

611
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:19,480
best practices<font color="#CCCCCC"> and how do you do</font>

612
00:25:15,659 --> 00:25:21,940
implementations of like IP on constraint

613
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,169
devices so they're trying to more figure

614
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,270
out like what's in the field and putting

615
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:27,570
it down as best practices for people to

616
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:29,770
learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so this does identify</font>

617
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,270
some protocols loss as well but they

618
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:37,780
don't fix them here they had to go

619
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:41,918
somewhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fix them so myth is</font>

620
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">another major effort really so and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

621
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,580
has never<font color="#E5E5E5"> worked on the history of the</font>

622
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,080
internet so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're like two</font>

623
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,970
interfaces on your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

624
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,199
phone right all the phones most most of

625
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,830
them have like two different interfaces

626
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never know what's going to</font>

627
00:25:53,830 --> 00:25:57,490
happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so you could get</font>

628
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:00,100
configuration information on one

629
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,169
interface and use it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other</font>

630
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:04,449
interface so for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you could</font>

631
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:08,799
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a dns server you got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over Wi-Fi</font>

632
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:10,809
and you could use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> over the LTE link</font>

633
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,168
and it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to work but there's</font>

634
00:26:10,809 --> 00:26:16,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">no separation of this information on the</font>

635
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:18,700
device it's because like we haven't

636
00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,590
specified how do you separate the

637
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:25,110
configuration information so Misch is

638
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,799
trying to define how do we handle

639
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:28,299
configuration information in a

640
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,280
consistent manner when you have multiple

641
00:26:28,299 --> 00:26:32,950
interfaces on the device so this could

642
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,178
be true for example if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a VPN on</font>

643
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:36,309
your computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> even with the one</font>

644
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:38,890
interface you could have like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> direct</font>

645
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:40,450
internet connection as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a VPN the</font>

646
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:42,340
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason it works today is like the</font>

647
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,690
VPN probably cuts off all of the

648
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,730
internet access right and that's

649
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,530
probably why things<font color="#E5E5E5"> manage to work</font>

650
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you're only using one but the</font>

651
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:50,710
idea is like we should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

652
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,810
at least architectural<font color="#CCCCCC"> e capable of</font>

653
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:57,130
handling multiple interfaces and that's

654
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:59,379
what this work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> about so net x is like</font>

655
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:01,630
a working group which is about

656
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,740
network-based mobility and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

657
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:04,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk much about this because it's</font>

658
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of winding down so like we kind of</font>

659
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,930
finish all the work like all the

660
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,250
specifications are getting out and it's

661
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:14,620
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> gonna get shot on pretty soon</font>

662
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:17,350
yeah listen so for the time stuff like I

663
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,879
want to defer to Karen<font color="#E5E5E5"> because like</font>

664
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:24,129
she's awesome she knows much more about

665
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,770
this than I do that's not a fair

666
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,300
statement so the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> Time Protocol</font>

667
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,760
working group has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been around since</font>

668
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:35,169
roughly two thousand three it was

669
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:42,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">originally chartered to publish the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp</font>

670
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:44,650
v4 specification and it ntp is one of

671
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:46,600
the probably oldest and one of the more

672
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,800
widely deployed protocols in the

673
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,250
internet most people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even realize</font>

674
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:52,720
it's there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they you're using it the</font>

675
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:58,570
current efforts that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on</font>

676
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,220
our maintenance of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp v4</font>

677
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:02,379

678
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,670

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,920
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a new version of ntp i</font>

704
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,929
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's necessarily where</font>

705
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,370
we want to go but now is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time if</font>

706
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,740
you're interested in looking at next<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

707
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:16,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nerat the next steps for ntp to get</font>

708
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in the conversation stay up</font>

709
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:21,500
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> move to tick tock aren't</font>

710
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:23,330
you so the funny thing if you notice

711
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,210
from the shreds<font color="#CCCCCC"> did his slide earlier he</font>

712
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:28,460
had sort of NGP as the ongoing work and

713
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:30,320
he had<font color="#CCCCCC"> tick tock as the closing down</font>

714
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,960
work which seems a little bit odd

715
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:35,389
because to cook was chartered to look at

716
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,870
next generation time synchronization

717
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:43,190
protocols and for those there is a

718
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:47,800
corollary standard called I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E</font>

719
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:51,590
1588 or the precise time protocol that

720
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,990
started out<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the instrumentation</font>

721
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,399
community so people like originally

722
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,650
envisioned as a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> for site</font>

723
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,600
connecting oscilloscope<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gather in a</font>

724
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,310
lab and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think of ntp it was</font>

725
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,020
originally envisioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect</font>

726
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:04,879
computers together over the global

727
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet a wide area network 20 years</font>

728
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago so each of these time</font>

729
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:13,580
synchronization protocols are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in essence</font>

730
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:14,810
doing the same kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of thing but they</font>

731
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,639
started from very different perspectives

732
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:19,700
and therefore their evolution has

733
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:24,380
resulted in solutions that are very

734
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:27,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">different in some ways so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tick-tock</font>

735
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,780
working group is currently it has

736
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:31,460
published a set of security requirements

737
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:34,820
for time synchronization protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

738
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:37,490
generic<font color="#CCCCCC"> tu voz</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PPP nntp it's looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

739
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,560
an i triple e 1588 enterprise profile

740
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:44,630
and what that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is looking at how do</font>

741
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:47,060
you operate 1588 over a wide area it's

742
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:50,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at an experimental draft on 1588</font>

743
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:54,740
over mpls<font color="#E5E5E5"> Suresh mentioned earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

744
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,909
sometimes in the IHF if we have you know

745
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,470
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be able to get</font>

746
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:59,600
interoperability we want to be able to

747
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,040
do testing but we're not really sure

748
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we have the right solution for a</font>

749
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,370
standards track documents what we do is

750
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:06,230
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there an experimental and</font>

751
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,209
then we hope that<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will experiment</font>

752
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:09,320
with it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and learn things and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then come</font>

753
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,040
back when<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little bit more mature</font>

754
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:14,710
to standardize it so that's what the

755
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:17,918
experimental draft in 1588 over mpls

756
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,240
says we're also looking at some multi<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font>

757
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">and experimental multipath</font>

758
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:25,090
synchronization techniques and finally

759
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,710
in cooperation with the attribute 1588

760
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,740
community were working on their

761
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:31,659
management aspects so time is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

762
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:36,279
bit odd in the IETF because it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

763
00:31:31,659 --> 00:31:38,679
small community and it's sort of a

764
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:40,600
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an isolated</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group that</font>

765
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:42,460
actually we try to a lot of our key

766
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,830
participants are people coming from

767
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:46,330
other communities that are not there

768
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:48,220
they're participating in the ITF

769
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:52,389
primarily for time reasons and not

770
00:31:48,220 --> 00:32:03,820
necessarily<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the broader internet</font>

771
00:31:52,390 --> 00:32:06,159
work thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> again so I'm back to like</font>

772
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:09,789
the regular interior stuff no just

773
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,350
kidding so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> so like I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

774
00:32:09,789 --> 00:32:13,270
bit about the PCP so like how many

775
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have run like a gaming server or</font>

776
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:20,408
a bittorrent client in your home<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

777
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:22,090
people out there so what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

778
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:23,860
is like you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go open up a port on</font>

779
00:32:22,090 --> 00:32:26,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">your net right because you don't get</font>

780
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:28,120
incoming connections otherwise and this

781
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:29,529
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because like you</font>

782
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,209
know the box that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to control</font>

783
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,559
was sitting in your home right<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you</font>

784
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">through outro sitting right there you</font>

785
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,379
just connect to it like<font color="#E5E5E5"> SSH a telnet or</font>

786
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:40,090
HTTP to it and you open up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the port</font>

787
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,740
except that like in a lot of places in

788
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,720
the world this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not gonna work anymore</font>

789
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,279
because you don't get an IP address any

790
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,990
more like a lot of places people get

791
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:49,179
fractional IP addresses because there's

792
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:50,590
another nap box somewhere further up and

793
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:52,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe sometimes two sometimes three</font>

794
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:53,830
there's like we could going through like

795
00:32:52,149 --> 00:32:56,799
four levels of<font color="#E5E5E5"> nat in some place in the</font>

796
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:58,029
world right and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem becomes so</font>

797
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,158
how do you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> run a service in</font>

798
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">your home right like so it the current</font>

799
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,570
way of doing stuff like doesn't work and

800
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,689
there's like other cool protocols like

801
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">upnp</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> igd and things like that which</font>

802
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:11,049
won't work either because they don't

803
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:13,750
cross a link so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we needed something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

804
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,580
will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work across like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an ass without</font>

805
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:17,940
knowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> how many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there are so like this</font>

806
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:20,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that's why we have a protocol called</font>

807
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,570
PCP<font color="#E5E5E5"> port control protocol so what you do</font>

808
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,190
is when you want like a mapping to the

809
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:25,629
outside world you sound<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a packet</font>

810
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,050
saying okay this is what I'm trying to

811
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,300
do so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to open up a</font>

812
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:33,540
for you or a set of<font color="#E5E5E5"> portal from there so</font>

813
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:35,490
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> NAT PMP that</font>

814
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,560
works on like single link before so the

815
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:39,420
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of your expanding it to go beyond</font>

816
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:40,950
one link and and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course this is all</font>

817
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,640
best effort right your provider might

818
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:46,320
tell you to go pawn San but like the

819
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,210
idea is like you you at least have a

820
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,490
capability of telling somebody upstream

821
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,140
that you want this to happen yeah that's

822
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:54,090
what PCP is about again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like kind</font>

823
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">of on the base work has been done</font>

824
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:57,060
there's like a lot of extensions stuff

825
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:01,409
that's happening but the base work is

826
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:03,120
kind of complete<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay next like so savvy</font>

827
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:06,720
is another thing that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a very very</font>

828
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting concept okay so it's kind of</font>

829
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,520
again winding down but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

830
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:13,860
bit about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so how so what has happened</font>

831
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">in v4 is that let's say you get an IP</font>

832
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:19,620
address so somebody could take your IP

833
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,300
address on<font color="#CCCCCC"> your link</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they could</font>

834
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,549
steal your address by just sending like

835
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,410
an art message saying like okay like

836
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:26,700
this IP address is now sitting in<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

837
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:29,129
of the mac address so then they can

838
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:31,350
steal all your traffic okay so what we

839
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:34,440
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is I do something to secure</font>

840
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,850
the bindings between the IP addresses

841
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:39,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the mac addresses this is like kind</font>

842
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:41,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">of unusual work that it has happened in</font>

843
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,840
idea but it's not like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

844
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:45,840
typically do like the lower layer stuff

845
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:48,150
but so that's what like the savvy stuff

846
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:49,950
focuses on so you see like a switch so

847
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:51,740
the switch sees like a binding meeting

848
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:54,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rypien and mac address when it changes</font>

849
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:55,739
like somebody can settle by policy like

850
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,450
who wins so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like one policy</font>

851
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:59,459
which says first come first serve which

852
00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:01,020
means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get an IP address you</font>

853
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,880
keep it if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> tries to steal it</font>

854
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,540
like the switch is<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reject it okay</font>

855
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,670
and there's like stuff based on dhcp so

856
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,130
you snuck on the dhcp messages and and

857
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,930
do the bindings there's stuff based on

858
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:15,030
send which is secure neighbor discovery

859
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,490
so what you do is your address is based

860
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,930
on a public<font color="#E5E5E5"> key that you're on or off so</font>

861
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:21,709
you can somebody can prove that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you own</font>

862
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:25,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the address so we can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that for</font>

863
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:26,460
finding the bindings to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

864
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,410
work has almost been completed there's

865
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,390
like one document and that's pending the

866
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:32,700
dhcp version is taking a long time to go

867
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:37,950
through but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this again will be shut down</font>

868
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:41,220
soon looks like so software and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

869
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">another group that I chair so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

870
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,009
about like transition from v6 from reef

871
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:49,840
or v6 and how to provide continuing v4

872
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:54,250
service when V for us actually getting

873
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:56,710
turned off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

874
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,010
classes<font color="#CCCCCC"> of solutions for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this okay and I</font>

875
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:01,510
ETS did something strange but kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

876
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:03,760
like process-oriented for this so

877
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,560
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a set of encapsulation</font>

878
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,450
based solutions where you take an ipv4

879
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,000
packet put it on a v6 packet and send it

880
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,649
off<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there you tunnel it and the</font>

881
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,660
second set of solutions were based on

882
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:17,430
translation which is like you translate

883
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:20,230
like packet into a v6 packet either by

884
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:22,810
stuffing it a bit of bits like 96 bits

885
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:24,310
of whatever to do the stuff and like do

886
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,560
mappings for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> toss feels and</font>

887
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:28,480
everything so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work happened in the</font>

888
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,860
transport area in a group called behave

889
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,480
so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

890
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:34,360
solutions were like closely allied like

891
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,580
so we had the translation based solution

892
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:38,050
go one place and encapsulation based

893
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,840
solution got another place even<font color="#E5E5E5"> though</font>

894
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:42,520
they are solving the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem okay</font>

895
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,380
so software<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working group that</font>

896
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:48,850
like is mainly focused<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

897
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:51,310
encapsulation great solution and so like

898
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:55,029
the base protocols have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all gone through</font>

899
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:56,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> iesg so we all have our FC numbers</font>

900
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:58,810
for everything so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like different</font>

901
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:01,569
ways of doing this and we have solutions

902
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:03,490
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of them which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not like a very</font>

903
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:05,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">good thing to do but we have covered</font>

904
00:37:03,490 --> 00:37:08,740
every aspect of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this problem space to be</font>

905
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:11,110
certain right like so and so like now

906
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:13,000
it's like mainly the surrounding work

907
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,360
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the management stuff like for</font>

908
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,310
what we did and the radius jar of the

909
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:20,500
ante authentication things all<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

910
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:22,090
things are happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> right now but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again</font>

911
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,350
we are like kind of like going towards

912
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:29,380
closure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't want to stick</font>

913
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:31,089
around for too long it's like so sunset

914
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">for so this is like kind of like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

915
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:35,320
futuristic working group to put it in

916
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,109
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> way right like so at some point we</font>

917
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to turn off before um it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

918
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,590
gonna happen very soon like we kind of

919
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:44,589
been predicting this to happen for like

920
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:47,250
a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and it's kind of clear the</font>

921
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:49,540
v4 is gonna stick around for a bit but

922
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:51,520
what has changed now is like there's

923
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:54,009
networks that are coming on that our v6

924
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,020
only so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

925
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,050
mobile networks that are cunning on v6

926
00:37:56,020 --> 00:38:02,890
only for either for lack of addressing

927
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:04,240
space or for like reducing the

928
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:06,190
management complexity so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're like</font>

929
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">to protocol stacks you're gonna have a</font>

930
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,720
more complex network and that's clear so

931
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:12,610
some people are deciding to do v6 only

932
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,100
for example like t-mobile network in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

933
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:17,260
US has like some sort of people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

934
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:19,810
recently and I EDF if you want to try

935
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:23,170
this for yourself and there's a ETF v6

936
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:25,870
only SSID and you can try this all for

937
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:28,360
yourself and see<font color="#CCCCCC"> what all breaks and as</font>

938
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:31,990
a spoiler like skype doesn't work<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

939
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,400
so that's probably we've been saying the

940
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,049
same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like five years like what</font>

941
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,060
skype hasn't fixed it so most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

942
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:40,450
stuff you know to work will continue

943
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,160
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on v6 only okay and there's some</font>

944
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,009
stuff that probably will take a lot of

945
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">time to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fixed so we need to have</font>

946
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,460
figure out a way to turn off<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

947
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,930
gracefully and sunset for is kind of

948
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,970
where the stuff happens so let's say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

949
00:38:49,930 --> 00:38:54,669
go and ask for a refund rests in a

950
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:58,060
network<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and the network doesn't</font>

951
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,770
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> before it doesn't say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything but</font>

952
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,700
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> does the computer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do it asks again</font>

953
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:06,070
and again and again forever there's no

954
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:07,509
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you a computer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to stop you</font>

955
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:10,930
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell people that I don't have</font>

956
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:13,270
before here go<font color="#CCCCCC"> away right so that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

957
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,040
kind of mechanisms like this group will

958
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,110
look at to figure out like how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

959
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:19,150
turn<font color="#CCCCCC"> off before it's not as simple as we</font>

960
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:20,710
think right like so first case we say

961
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,330
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh just not on v6 only everything</font>

962
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,440
works it doesn't write like so there's a

963
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:29,140
lot of stuff we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do and that's</font>

964
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">what sunset for a look at so and that's</font>

965
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,680
pretty much the summary of the working

966
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:41,470
groups can already talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ticked</font>

967
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:47,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">off so um any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions here they're all</font>

968
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:49,779
clear can ask questions now<font color="#CCCCCC"> or ok so</font>

969
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:51,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'll probably show you something that</font>

970
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use to do things for yourself</font>

971
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,400
you're probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna forget</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

972
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:56,440
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> told you right now but there's like a</font>

973
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,740
way to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure everything else back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so</font>

974
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:02,290
um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is like one thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to</font>

975
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,450
point out this is pretty new so there's

976
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,880
like a internet directory so what we do

977
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,819
is there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like we've</font>

978
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,760
been working in the interior

979
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:12,620
for a bit and the ad<font color="#CCCCCC"> said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick these</font>

980
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,410
people and put them into a team so what

981
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:17,660
we do is we review documents like for

982
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:19,399
either internet area documents or other

983
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,770
area documents but with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

984
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:25,100
area hat on so we look at like does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

985
00:40:21,770 --> 00:40:28,490
do something funny with IP does it do

986
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:29,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">something funny with dns dhcp so those</font>

987
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:31,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">are the kind of things we look at and we</font>

988
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,899
send comments and this is like

989
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">information we give</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the area</font>

990
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,720
directors and they follow up on it like

991
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:40,070
you to put a discuss on or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font>

992
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> authors figure out like how to fix</font>

993
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,970
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so this is like a review team</font>

994
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:47,690
and one of the goals we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to</font>

995
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:49,430
figure out like um find out people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who</font>

996
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,320
can get on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> team okay so we are</font>

997
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking for like people who are new to</font>

998
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:55,970
the idea for like<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven like and who</font>

999
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:57,920
like to read documents like provide

1000
00:40:55,970 --> 00:41:00,379
comments and things like that and try to

1001
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,230
mentor them to get more into the area

1002
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so if you are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in like</font>

1003
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:05,960
doing this kind of work like come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1004
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:08,569
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to one of us like I'll show you</font>

1005
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,240
where to look so just come<font color="#E5E5E5"> to top class</font>

1006
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:12,920
yeah and one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things we also do is</font>

1007
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,899
like tutoring right so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if</font>

1008
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:18,560
you're new in a working group you have

1009
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">some ideas come talk to somebody and we</font>

1010
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,670
help you talk to the chairs like see how

1011
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,770
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ideas presented look good</font>

1012
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:27,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your slides or look at your</font>

1013
00:41:24,770 --> 00:41:32,390
draft those kind of things we do as well

1014
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:35,480
yeah looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like and and this is like the</font>

1015
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,250
so we don't talk to all the areas

1016
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:39,320
equaling<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so there's like some areas</font>

1017
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:42,140
we talked to more some<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to</font>

1018
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:44,840
Les and I also put like a few touch

1019
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:47,299
points okay so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ops is like an area we</font>

1020
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:49,580
talked to quite a bit okay so and that's

1021
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,950
because like our protocols get deployed

1022
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:55,370
in networks and operators have feedback

1023
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:57,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so let's say for ipv6 right we did</font>

1024
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:59,270
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> and somebody says like that's</font>

1025
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,800
nuts like you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> crazy it's never gonna</font>

1026
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,230
happen and these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reasons why I</font>

1027
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,020
put this on and my network went down or

1028
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,690
like the all the phones batteries died

1029
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:12,050
in two hours stuff like that those are

1030
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:13,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things that come to v6 ops and then</font>

1031
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,280
what we do is like yeah this<font color="#CCCCCC"> the real</font>

1032
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,780
problem so we write down like

1033
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,490
operational solutions for it and then we

1034
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:21,110
go back and fix the protocols in the

1035
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:21,750
internet area so we have like quite a

1036
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:23,610
bit of in track

1037
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">shun between let's say the v6 office</font>

1038
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:29,970
working group and and the interior

1039
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:31,710
working groups yeah similarly like all

1040
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:34,439
the management stuff like happens in the

1041
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:37,740
ops area so we interact quite a bit we

1042
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,200
say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we want and like some yang</font>

1043
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:41,759
expertise for this so are we want

1044
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,359
somebody to do a mabe review of this

1045
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,130
like we always go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the op Syria and</font>

1046
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,050
and routing is also closely aligned like

1047
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:51,090
like I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for home net</font>

1048
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:53,010
so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick a routing</font>

1049
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,720
protocol we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have expertise in the</font>

1050
00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:56,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet area so we go to the routing</font>

1051
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:58,049
people and say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are our</font>

1052
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,759
requirements this what you're trying to

1053
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:01,560
do so what do you recommend for us those

1054
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:04,800
kind of things happen in the routing

1055
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:05,940
area and security kind of like interacts

1056
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,010
with everybody right like so the

1057
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,240
security people have to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sign off</font>

1058
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:11,340
on everything right<font color="#E5E5E5"> like so there's like</font>

1059
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">a security considerations section in</font>

1060
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:16,110
like every<font color="#CCCCCC"> drafter RFC and we need to</font>

1061
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:19,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">identify all the threats to this thing</font>

1062
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:21,540
and how we um Howie ameliorate the

1063
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:23,279
threats right so those kind of things

1064
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:26,790
like we interact quite a bit with<font color="#CCCCCC"> SEC</font>

1065
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,100
and similarly this this DNS SEC like

1066
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:30,330
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> security for DNS like the we</font>

1067
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,850
have like quite a bit of interaction on

1068
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:36,120
that and also access control so like how

1069
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:37,560
do you for example right<font color="#CCCCCC"> like we had</font>

1070
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:41,160
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pana which is like 80</font>

1071
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,810
to 1 X which which provides some way of

1072
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,399
authenticating and authorizing somebody

1073
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:47,580
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get on a network so those kind of</font>

1074
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:53,040
things we interact closely with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC</font>

1075
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:54,420
area looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so um this is</font>

1076
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,759
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want you to memorize I</font>

1077
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:58,080
just like you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a slight set so if</font>

1078
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:00,630
you want to start doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in ain't</font>

1079
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:04,290
area right these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some documents that</font>

1080
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:07,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think you should read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so like a</font>

1081
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:10,770
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them are like some of them are</font>

1082
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,029
all some of them on you and like new

1083
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:14,070
ones doesn't mean it's like a new

1084
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:16,230
protocol because we do quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of</font>

1085
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,930
updating of the protocols<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so for</font>

1086
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,460
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> right like the if you look at</font>

1087
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">the mid 36 protocol this is like a</font>

1088
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,100
second version of the protocol okay we

1089
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:29,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">always do revisions of our protocols</font>

1090
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:32,640
based on feedback that we get like so we

1091
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:35,710
we implement the stuff and we put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1092
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">the internet and always update</font>

1093
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:40,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">based on what we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay for example</font>

1094
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:42,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">right 2460 is the ipv6 base</font>

1095
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,440
specification but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's been updated</font>

1096
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,140
quite a bit like so there's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

1097
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,210
of issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we found and we updated</font>

1098
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,580
we wrote RFC's and the RFC's have like a

1099
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:54,310
tag updating the base specification now

1100
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:57,700
this work on going to fold all those

1101
00:44:54,310 --> 00:45:00,549
<font color="#CCCCCC">changes in to make a new base ipv6</font>

1102
00:44:57,700 --> 00:45:03,279
specification<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and that will replace</font>

1103
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:04,869
this number over there and so that's why

1104
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like this like a good starting point</font>

1105
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:10,869
but it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like work that's on</font>

1106
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:15,910
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> update our protocols okay mix</font>

1107
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:18,820
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so I don't like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer you</font>

1108
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,859
right like so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like where how you</font>

1109
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:23,109
find information about like working

1110
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:24,609
groups okay so this is thing called data

1111
00:45:23,109 --> 00:45:29,619
tracker this is like the kind of tools

1112
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:32,080
we use to handle IETF what process stuff

1113
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:34,000
and technical stuff so if you go to data

1114
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,859
tracker IETF there are like you see like

1115
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,480
a nice page there's a lot of things in

1116
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:39,130
there but if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1117
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:41,440
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a specific working</font>

1118
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,740
group you put in like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group</font>

1119
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:46,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the working group name okay so one</font>

1120
00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:48,069
of the names i showed you in this stuff

1121

1122
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,190
groups okay so you find a name of a

1123
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,599
working group you put this URL put the

1124

name of the working group you're going

1125
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,210
to see a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information about that</font>

1126
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,890
working group which I'll cover in a bit

1127

so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see all the internet</font>

1128
00:45:56,890 --> 00:46:00,970
data working groups you put hash end

1129
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,990

1132
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,899
tsv for example so you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

1133
00:46:05,619 --> 00:46:09,880
like all the working groups in the IDF

1134
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:14,560
just by I trading through like a set of

1135

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure you cannot read what's in</font>

1137
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:20,020
here but i just want to point out like

1138
00:46:17,589 --> 00:46:21,310
what kind of information is here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1139
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:22,839
if you put<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the name of working group</font>

1140
00:46:21,310 --> 00:46:25,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">i just put in six man as an example</font>

1141
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:26,680
you're gonna see like all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> graphs</font>

1142
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:28,810
that the working group is working on

1143
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,669
okay so which is the working<font color="#E5E5E5"> group class</font>

1144
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:32,349
like the what the group has taken

1145
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">ownership off it's not like a draft that</font>

1146
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just wrote ok so the working group</font>

1147
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:38,770
decides to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work on it it shows up on the</font>

1148
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:41,500
top there<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and if you scroll further</font>

1149
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:46,119
below you see all the RFC's that the

1150
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:48,040
group has published okay so um in in

1151
00:46:46,119 --> 00:46:49,520
order<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so you can see everything</font>

1152
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,830
that the group has ever done

1153
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,270
okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this also like if you look on</font>

1154
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:55,900
the top there you see like a different

1155
00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:58,190
tabs it is like document charter and

1156
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:59,450
history<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on right like so you can</font>

1157
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,040
click on each other stats<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not gonna</font>

1158
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:02,859
go through all of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1159
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:08,000
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your spare time right it's not like</font>

1160
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:09,770
rocket science<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thanks like okay so</font>

1161
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:12,590
like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Charter tab is pretty important</font>

1162
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:15,500
because the Charter tells you what the

1163
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,110
working group wants to do okay so and

1164
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:20,330
this is like one thing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

1165
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:23,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't see so how a working group gets it</font>

1166
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:25,549
is formed okay so when I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups</font>

1167
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:27,980
gets formed so the area<font color="#E5E5E5"> director sit</font>

1168
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,090
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and figure out the problem that the</font>

1169
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:31,490
working group is going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and</font>

1170
00:47:29,090 --> 00:47:34,060
they make it tractable so it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1171
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:36,169
a small defined problem so you cannot

1172
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:38,750
define a working group for world peace

1173
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,960
because it's kind of difficult to do and

1174
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:43,430
it's like not very defined right so the

1175
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:45,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">Charter tells you like so if you look</font>

1176
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,690
scroll<font color="#CCCCCC"> down a bit you're gonna see what</font>

1177
00:47:45,860 --> 00:47:50,470
the working group is supposed to do so

1178
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,610
it's like text it describes in English

1179
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:54,410
like what the working group is actually

1180
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:56,030
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do and it's got milestones</font>

1181
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:57,589
like it talks about deliverables and

1182
00:47:56,030 --> 00:48:00,320
everything it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this page okay</font>

1183
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:03,640
and and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at their you're</font>

1184

1185
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:07,220
email addresses of the chair so if you

1186
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:10,190
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to contact them you could like get</font>

1187
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:12,049
in there and this also it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1188
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,300
slides but there's also like<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortcuts</font>

1189
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:15,590

people's time or your time talking about

you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow like working group</font>

1219
00:49:16,070 --> 00:49:20,750
and you're not there physically you go

1220
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,550
into the jabber room at the time that's

1221

1223
00:49:24,109 --> 00:49:27,200
audio stream you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can listen to and</font>

1224
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,460
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a jabber where you can</font>

1225
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,410
actually type questions and get answers

1226
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:36,470
kind of thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's what for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font>

1227
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:37,970
so any questions and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really want</font>

1228
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:42,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">you to shoot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me with arrows but like I</font>

1229
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:45,790
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aren't even matsumoto</font>

1230
00:49:42,619 --> 00:49:50,840
I'm thankful<font color="#E5E5E5"> very informative talk I</font>

1231
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:53,980
found that the Israeli a classification

1232
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:57,260
of age<font color="#E5E5E5"> working group and they be gr8</font>

1233
00:49:53,980 --> 00:50:00,349
visualization of the a based on the

1234
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:03,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">working group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> phase is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very useful is</font>

1235
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:05,900
pretty body<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> newcomers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also all</font>

1236
00:50:03,859 --> 00:50:11,690
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are not familiar with yeah</font>

1237
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:14,990
happy families has a specific area so my

1238
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:18,380
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is that kind of information</font>

1239
00:50:14,990 --> 00:50:23,149
is available on somewhere in the IDF

1240
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:24,740
website and periodically updated um so

1241
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:26,720
this is like very subjective right so

1242
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:28,279
this is something I did myself so this

1243
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,098
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I'm sure people will</font>

1244
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,080
disagree on like where some specific

1245
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:34,820
working group needs to go right so I

1246
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:36,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think this is official but this is</font>

1247
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:38,390
like something I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help people</font>

1248
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:40,339
to visualize the stuff like just like

1249
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:41,868
you said so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is like</font>

1250
00:50:40,339 --> 00:50:44,630
official there's no like<font color="#E5E5E5"> sub areas</font>

1251
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:47,210
really so um but these lights are

1252
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:51,440
available so like to do look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so</font>

1253
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:55,359
but there's no real official effort to

1254
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:59,170
do this classification okay so um if

1255
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:02,299
damn it may be it may be better to

1256
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:04,910
gather such<font color="#CCCCCC"> a new Bobby talk somewhere</font>

1257
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,800
you know something in one place for new

1258
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,859
for newcomers website or something like

1259
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,080
that yeah if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can interject here this</font>

1260
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:13,670
is an excellent time to mention did you

1261
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:17,140
put the survey is the survey<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1262
00:51:13,670 --> 00:51:20,680
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay oops</font>

1263
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:22,000
so part of what the edge there is an

1264
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:24,868
edge you team and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font>

1265
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:28,470
putting together the materials to help

1266
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:30,670
provide people<font color="#E5E5E5"> better introductions and</font>

1267
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:32,828
suresh's slides will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the meeting</font>

1268
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,690
materials for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting but we're</font>

1269
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:36,579
also looking at ways to generalize that

1270
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:39,039
material and keep it more up to date and

1271
00:51:36,579 --> 00:51:40,359
I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looked at the survey</font>

1272
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:42,609
but I'm guessing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's going to</font>

1273
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:44,589
be questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the survey so</font>

1274
00:51:42,609 --> 00:51:47,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">I would strongly encourage you to put</font>

1275
00:51:44,589 --> 00:51:55,058
your suggestions there<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you</font>

1276
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:57,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">much Madison hi I'm Kent aribisala very</font>

1277
00:51:55,059 --> 00:52:01,720
new for physically attending the meeting

1278
00:51:57,789 --> 00:52:06,130
I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> some working groups that does not</font>

1279
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:08,680
plan for meeting for this IDF but I saw

1280
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:11,859
that some of them is still active in

1281
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:14,980
mailing list does that not having

1282
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:16,990
meeting meand reflect the activity of

1283
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:20,260
the working group or are there any other

1284
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:21,519
reasons not there um so there's

1285
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,130
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> conditions so one of them is</font>

1286
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,598
could be like presenting<font color="#E5E5E5"> activity right</font>

1287
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:27,039
the second thing is like they're in a

1288
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,839
face of work where they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need the</font>

1289
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:32,740
meeting done so what has<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened in the</font>

1290
00:52:28,839 --> 00:52:35,680
last few<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs is that so scheduling an</font>

1291
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:37,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">IDF is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a nightmare ok so the like when</font>

1292
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,118
we chairs like a request a meeting time

1293
00:52:37,869 --> 00:52:42,160
we specify a set of working groups we

1294
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:43,539
don't want to conflict against<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1295
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,980
it becomes very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to schedule a</font>

1296
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,359
meeting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's like everybody</font>

1297
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:48,730
doesn't want to conflict if everybody

1298
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:50,109
else right so what the area directors

1299
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:53,140
did is like they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> like if you don't</font>

1300
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:54,430
have pressing issues to meet like we

1301
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,440
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a start so</font>

1302
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,450
scheduling becomes easier because we

1303
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,430
already like six<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of meetings so we</font>

1304
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,348
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> longer so some</font>

1305
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:04,390
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> decide not to meet and the other</font>

1306
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:06,220
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like a lot of people are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

1307
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">interim meetings which is like virtual</font>

1308
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:09,459
so what people do is like they call for

1309
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">a meeting like two months before the IDF</font>

1310
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,910
and 12 months<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that idea so they</font>

1311
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:15,099
don't meet here but they are very active

1312
00:53:12,910 --> 00:53:16,569
so the right way to measure the activity

1313
00:53:15,099 --> 00:53:19,450
is on the mailing list like you already

1314
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:21,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">did that's perfect so the somebody</font>

1315
00:53:19,450 --> 00:53:23,288
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> meeting round doesn't really</font>

1316
00:53:21,099 --> 00:53:25,210
mean much so take it with a grain of

1317
00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:27,309
salt if the mailing list is still active

1318
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:29,790
the working group is<font color="#CCCCCC"> still active thank</font>

1319
00:53:27,309 --> 00:53:35,310
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you thanks</font>

1320
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:36,750
the just to interject again also<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1321
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,400
some groups in fact we're trying to do

1322
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:43,470
this more with the time related working

1323
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:47,430
groups for some people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who have a small</font>

1324
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:50,069
area<font color="#E5E5E5"> of overlap it developing remote</font>

1325
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:52,950
participation and interim meetings makes

1326
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:55,500
a lot more sense to progress the work so

1327
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:57,240
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about the IETF not about</font>

1328
00:53:55,500 --> 00:54:00,630
physically coming to the IETF to get

1329
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:02,759
work done thank you very much I can't go

1330
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:05,250

one<font color="#E5E5E5"> was routing and the one before us</font>

1339
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:23,850

1341
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:28,790
of them are done so I don't think this

1342
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:31,440
like a art area over yet but like um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

thing and so you can find the slights at

1358
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:06,300
that location but it's kind of like a

1359
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,230
chicken and egg because if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1364
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:15,120
later point but they will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of the</font>

ITF proceedings so if you at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>
