1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,709
what did you have some like ridiculous

2
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:27,759
tattoo artists who's never heard of an

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:29,980
empty so each of them says that's right

4
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,870
okay like just gets a little let's do

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,719
that for oh did you actually look in on

6
00:00:31,870 --> 00:01:14,920
three open issues for the marketers

7
00:00:34,719 --> 00:01:20,408
draft not figure out all right okay wait

8
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:38,829
how did you just get that last bit who

9
00:01:20,409 --> 00:01:41,789
done time you need to know okay um

10
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:46,570
they're live streaming this on YouTube

11
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:49,030
my question is why well because I was

12
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,408
told to so I think it was because they

13
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:54,850
were live-streaming the last one and

14
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:56,200
they just decided my attitude said no

15
00:01:54,850 --> 00:02:00,449
one was watching the last one and that

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,450
was about IMG no yeah yeah okay

17
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:22,370
we should have a very short agenda so we

18
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:24,410
started 3:20 right yeah so when we're

19
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:58,630
ready for some of the trick later some

20
00:02:24,410 --> 00:03:01,940
people all right let me get started

21
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:03,940
everyone this is the get working group

22
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,900
thanks for coming

23
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:08,060
like I said hopefully this is pretty

24
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,799
short but you never know how these

25
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,900
things go

26
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,239
this is the note well you've probably

27
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,410
seen this several times before so if

28
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,120
you're not familiar with if we take a

29
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:23,660
look and you know try to abide by it or

30
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:24,680
don't try do some administrative things

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:28,459
so the blue sheets are going around

32
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,040
please fill them out if bosses are yeah

33
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:40,180
do we have a JavaScript anyone willing

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:40,180
to volunteer thank you rich minute taker

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:54,970
any one minute taker should be really

36
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:54,970
easy open up the text editor sorry

37
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,560
minute take a minute taker anyone

38
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:22,959
I hear Shawn John Turner we are you be

39
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,959
willing to take notes thank you

40
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,360
this is the agenda you have any comments

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:37,159
on it it could change things you know

42
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:39,470
please let us know but otherwise so

43
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,870
basically since it's not clear everyone

44
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:45,080
normally does agendas by putting draft

45
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,200
file names the first two things here are

46
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,200
the two drafts in the working group we

47
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,460
will discuss them reasonably briefly the

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,500
third thing is actually not a working

49
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:57,049
group item it's a tutorial that people

50
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,760
have been putting together to help other

51
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:00,800
working groups sort of with what we've

52
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:03,440
done but the first two will actually

53
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,580
probably go reasonably quickly and

54
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,170
that'll leave plenty of time to talk

55
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:10,479
about the tutorial if people have been

56
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:13,940
reading it all right yeah so with that

57
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,600
we're gonna start there's there are no

58
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,730
slides for that the first presentation

59
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,210
which is the github configuration

60
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:26,960
document from Vaughn Alyssa we do have

61
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,700
however three issues that it would be

62
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,070
great if we could just march through

63
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,860
them and do something with them ideally

64
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:35,480
close them or do something else so to

65
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:39,830
that end I'm gonna click on the first

66
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,900
one yeah this was brought up by I forget

67
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:47,659
exactly who on the list

68
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:49,460
well I of course I filed it the title is

69
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,900
pretty self-explanatory I wonder if

70
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,979
people have a particular thought about

71
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,989
this Paul seems to think that this

72
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:57,100
should possibly be something that's in

73
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,100
the other draft

74
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:05,900
I'm happy to put this in that other

75
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
draft or accepted pull request that

76
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,960
would do the same

77
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,520
excellently this is perfectly

78
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,919
appropriate the there's a section there

79
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,969
on using continuous continuous

80
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:24,139
integration in order to produce draft

81
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,699
things adding that not only do you

82
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:28,250
produce the draft but you produce a diff

83
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:29,990
with various things would be perfectly

84
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,720
reasonable great yeah

85
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,669
so I will make I'm not gonna do here to

86
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,880
sign in but yes I will I will

87
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,190
file the issue on the other document and

88
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,520
then we can just help maybe I'll just

89
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:49,639
manifold yes it's a one-cent I think we

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:55,099
can do that oh great it is resolved this

91
00:06:49,639 --> 00:07:00,069
is one Martin knew filed but I actually

92
00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:04,280
from mark do you want to speak to it

93
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:07,610
this is Mark's one we moved marks issue

94
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:10,549
I can probably speak to it briefly a lot

95
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:13,009
of documents have a brief note at the

96
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,599
start of them that explains what it is

97
00:07:13,009 --> 00:07:20,000
that the the document is doing where to

98
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,180
discuss it where to find the repository

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:26,060
where to file issues that sort of thing

100
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:29,090
conveniently I recently added this

101
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,919
capability to the template so it will be

102
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:37,130
automatically added by anyone who's

103
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:38,568
using a modern setup so yay another one

104
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,630
that solved but we can probably make

105
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:47,029
some notes about that as well in your

106
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:51,729
document or the other one it's like the

107
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,729
last one night I really don't care yeah

108
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,789
Jeffery askin this is incredibly useful

109
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:01,698
the w3c also does it and you can look

110
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:03,560
and like bike shed for examples of how

111
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,580
to do the metadata and stuff yeah great

112
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,620
I don't think anyone's questioning the

113
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,310
video just where does this actual Texico

114
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,229
or less mark Nottingham um I really

115
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,550
don't want to like get in the way of

116
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:14,820
year I'm shutting down this working

117
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,200
group party but

118
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,700
what's the delineation between these

119
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,159
documents again because it seems like

120
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:24,360
it's really fuzzy a lot of the time it

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,390
is but so the document were that we're

122
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,690
discussing is what is the tooling that

123
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:33,960
the ietf should be doing to help working

124
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,909
groups use github and the other document

125
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,790
is how to use github especially if

126
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:40,650
you're not using tooling such as you may

127
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,209
want to add this you may want to do this

128
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,069
and that's why I had suggested this

129
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:47,310
actually goes in the other dot in

130
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,600
Martin's document my feedback would be

131
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,839
that that's a really artificial and

132
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,190
confusing delineation and and that in a

133
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,170
better world we would combine those

134
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:58,560
documents but you know you're trying to

135
00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:01,310
close that and working group the

136
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,780
documents did at one point overlap to a

137
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:05,430
much larger degree so I think we've

138
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:08,310
managed to separate them to some extent

139
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,199
along this sort of grey fuzzy line I

140
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:12,150
think it's actually could be a bit more

141
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,900
clear but I think it's a little more

142
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:19,140
crisp than that I I see the the one that

143
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm editing to be far more about advice

144
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:28,280
on how you enact processes within

145
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:31,440
working groups to deal with this that is

146
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,160
abstract of the specifics of how that's

147
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,540
that's done so I would say it is it is

148
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,640
useful to put a note in the draft

149
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,199
pointing to where the repository is but

150
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,120
I wouldn't specify the mechanics of that

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:45,900
whereas the other day the other draft is

152
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,370
very specifically hey tools team we want

153
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:51,480
to link in the data tracker that points

154
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,730
to these repositories all similar so I I

155
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,830
think it's fairly crisp when you get

156
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,770
right down to it but I do agree with

157
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,910
mark that maybe it would have been

158
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,730
better in retrospect

159
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:06,630
had we have we not had this delineation

160
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:09,120
but I don't I don't see much point in

161
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,470
trying to fix it at this stage mark are

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:15,870
you bringing something up where we don't

163
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:20,010
have complete consensus what if you're

164
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:21,150
gonna make the joke get it right I you

165
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:23,040
know I think I read the documents

166
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,780
relatively recently perhaps you can

167
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,810
improve this by just making it

168
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,560
absolutely crystal clear in the abstract

169
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,910
in the introduction who

170
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,099
the audience for the document is and

171
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,709
ideally in the title of the document who

172
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,970
the audience of the document is because

173
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,890
I didn't get that sense from reading

174
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:51,420
them yeah great suggestion you certainly

175
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:55,319
do that alright next issue all right

176
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,819
another one for mine yeah so this one

177
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:59,430
really belongs in this one right here

178
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:02,760
this definitely belongs in this document

179
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:06,930
Oh rich thank you you can you can tell

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,700
us how what's happening yeah hi rich

181
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:11,640
sauce yeah I just added the comment oh

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,490
let's see six minutes ago um we're doing

183
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,630
some work in the data tracker to

184
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,170
normalize all of the links or like

185
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,490
additional URLs field will have

186
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,079
normalized names for most of those

187
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:25,470
things so you can like sort of add it

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:27,690
programmatically so for example if you

189
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:29,279
use the scripts that I'm also developing

190
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,500
then it'll automatically put the links

191
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,330
in the data tracker to the repo it'll

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,010
you can add your github user ID in your

193
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,830
name account so someone can look it up

194
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,480
and say oh this is someone's so in

195
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:55,350
progress

196
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:57,060
right so exactly yes alright so thank

197
00:11:55,350 --> 00:12:02,900
you all right well you still have that

198
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:06,319
question or all right Martin

199
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:06,319
you are up

200
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,819
so one of the one of the kind of

201
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:23,360
long-standing issues that we had with

202
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:26,430
the the sort of more abstract document

203
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:30,990
was how how this fits into the existing

204
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:36,239
standards processes and BC p9 and is it

205
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:39,899
25 I've got two slides on this yeah 25

206
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,470
yeah I always forget that one how much

207
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:47,850
this sort of has to consider how it fits

208
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:49,589
into that broader picture mmm this is

209
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:51,810
just my proposal for these ones if

210
00:12:49,589 --> 00:12:54,120
anyone wants to disagree with me I'd be

211
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,939
happy to discuss that but I don't think

212
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,290
that this document relates to be cp9 I

213
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:00,170
went through it in a little bit of

214
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:06,689
detail and it talks primarily about the

215
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:10,529
process by which the ITF decides to turn

216
00:13:06,689 --> 00:13:14,069
internet drafts in to standards not the

217
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:17,360
process by which the internet drafts get

218
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:22,139
hammered out in the working group and so

219
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:24,660
my suggestion is that we don't deal with

220
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:27,839
basically nine at all in in this

221
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:29,670
particular document does anyone have a

222
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,649
different understanding of the purpose

223
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,979
of that document and would suggest that

224
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:39,509
we do otherwise okay I see some thumbs

225
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:40,470
up the next one we already cite vcp 25

226
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:45,540
which is the working group process

227
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:48,000
document and though BCP 25 is

228
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,860
extraordinarily high level relative to

229
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,459
the sort of thing that this document

230
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,829
that we're talking about is there are

231
00:13:53,459 --> 00:14:02,449
some aspects of this that we we already

232
00:13:55,829 --> 00:14:04,258
address very now narrowly targeted so

233
00:14:02,449 --> 00:14:07,079
most of the uses that we're talking

234
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:10,259
about here relate to the the document

235
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,508
production process I know that there are

236
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:17,399
some other aspects of BCP 25 that people

237
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:19,610
use github to assist in that being

238
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,779
primarily things like session planning

239
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,320
management of agendas and and

240
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,330
presentation materials for instance

241
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,150
and I know that a lot of working group

242
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:33,830
charters end up on github and get beaten

243
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:35,810
out on that one my proposal which I

244
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:36,530
wasn't gonna merge but then Paul did it

245
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:38,660
for me

246
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:41,600
violating one of the golden rules in

247
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:43,730
this document we'll talk about that

248
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,500
later oh you have a co-author and I'm

249
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:50,570
working group chair so I thought it was

250
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,400
okay yeah I had hope to discuss it here

251
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:56,030
before I merge that was that only

252
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:59,770
documents would be in scope and I've in

253
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,770
that pull request I explicitly said that

254
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:05,120
this is only documents though these

255
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:08,500
other things can be used now I thought

256
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,850
that Paul's tacit acceptance of that

257
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,290
indicates that I was not entirely crazy

258
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:14,000
but I'd like to make sure that people in

259
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,819
this room also think that I'm not

260
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,010
entirely crazy

261
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,690
so that'll appear of course in the next

262
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,790
draft which will be for working group

263
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:24,620
last column so I figured putting that in

264
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,300
since there had been no traffic on the

265
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:29,240
list about it was a reasonable thing

266
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,530
right yeah this is Shawn Turner um just

267
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,970
to observe that if you told me I

268
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:33,500
couldn't do it I would probably ignore

269
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:36,320
that advice and I would keep right on

270
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:39,020
doing the other the other things oh it's

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,880
super helpful should be able to do it

272
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:42,140
for meeting requests figuring out when

273
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,000
people are going to show up but all of

274
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,010
those other things yeah so I think I

275
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,960
think the primary focus on on documents

276
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,939
here is important because those are the

277
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:54,410
ones where you need the process yes

278
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:56,960
complete library having an having that

279
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,550
advice and applying that advice to the

280
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,140
save the development of the chart or a

281
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,510
revision to the Charter is it crazy

282
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,210
people are going to do that and it turns

283
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:07,550
out that most of this advice is still

284
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,620
applicable in that context but I didn't

285
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,569
really want to get too bound up in

286
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,150
dealing with that problem in fact that

287
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:16,340
the proposed text did say that and I was

288
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,329
gonna maybe put that up on screen but we

289
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,530
can deal with that and working group

290
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:26,050
last call okay next oh and the last one

291
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:29,720
I don't know who open this issue but

292
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:32,660
there was a point raised about the fact

293
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,390
that github does occasionally tend to

294
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:37,969
attract spam and and misbehavior of

295
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,189
various forms there are

296
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,139
moderation tools but they're not

297
00:16:40,189 --> 00:16:44,389
centralized in any way that would be

298
00:16:42,139 --> 00:16:47,060
available to us so for instance we

299
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:49,639
couldn't if we wanted the equivalent of

300
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,839
a posting rights action block someone

301
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:53,360
across all of the different

302
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,290
organizations that the ITF would use so

303
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,459
there's some limitations there so I have

304
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:00,980
a couple of questions here and then

305
00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,109
these are a little difficult for me to

306
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,209
deal with here because I don't know

307
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:07,099
whether this expands the scope of the

308
00:17:05,209 --> 00:17:09,949
document or not so a like a bit of

309
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:13,129
discussion about this things like could

310
00:17:09,949 --> 00:17:16,970
we do we need to have rolls around

311
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:20,990
things like dealing with someone who's

312
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:25,030
misbehaving on github we can block them

313
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:29,840
from repositories can we do that

314
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,100
unilaterally or on the basis that well

315
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,379
maybe they can just go to the mailing

316
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:37,639
list and and take the complaints there

317
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,590
or do we have to have these repositories

318
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,299
in the and and all the things associated

319
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,799
with an operate under rules that are

320
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,730
similar to the mailing lists themselves

321
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:48,980
and to what extent do we need to support

322
00:17:45,730 --> 00:18:00,010
the whatever actions that we we take in

323
00:17:48,980 --> 00:18:02,630
in that word tooling and and whatnot so

324
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:06,429
Peter action is not like a very common

325
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:11,950
process like we don't use it very much

326
00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:14,809
and so I'm curious if you're aware of

327
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,030
other communities or some place where

328
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:20,260
the kind of case that would raise a PR

329
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:24,980
action in the IETF has actually happened

330
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:28,580
like lots of works and repos not just in

331
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:30,770
not just in one so I am aware of at

332
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:34,760
least one instance of this sort of

333
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:38,510
behavior in the w3c I was involved in

334
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,360
one of those peripherally and certainly

335
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,850
had to deal with that individual and

336
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,879
they were blocked from the organisation

337
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,219
on a number of different points and it

338
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,750
was just done on an ad-hoc basis and I I

339
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,000
would probably advocate for the

340
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:58,260
hot process until such time as we

341
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,610
identify something that turns out to be

342
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,280
a systemic issue that we need to deal

343
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:04,020
with differently but github does have

344
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:07,260
pretty good support with respect to

345
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:10,920
abuse and so I found that if you do

346
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:13,379
observe someone doing bad things you can

347
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,440
just block them and it just works and I

348
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:22,410
would not advocate for doing that unless

349
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:26,130
it really was bad but it's possible okay

350
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:28,440
yeah the question then would be what

351
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:31,590
where we put anything in the document

352
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,840
about that and and I would be I'm in two

353
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:35,310
minds about that really I should on

354
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,230
Turner again so I would I would like to

355
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,520
know that in my you know three years I

356
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,750
guess of using github or something like

357
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,700
that something call me out on how long

358
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:44,130
that I find that there's a whole lot

359
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,410
less times where I felt like there was

360
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:47,700
any kind of bad behavior that raised any

361
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,740
kind of the level of the bad behavior

362
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,350
that I've seen on recent mailing lists

363
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,630
in the IETF so maybe we just let this go

364
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:56,429
because it's just not there and we're

365
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,230
trying to solve a problem that doesn't

366
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:00,360
really exist and if somebody does show

367
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,010
up and is a super tool then we can we

368
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,310
can quickly figure out what what it is

369
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:07,770
that we need to do with them so yeah I'm

370
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:10,020
comfortable with that that answer anyone

371
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:12,240
else this is Barry leave I'm comfortable

372
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,340
with that answer also I think what makes

373
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,070
sense is to yes treat github is a

374
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,689
mailing list not for the purposes of PR

375
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,270
action for the purposes of abuse

376
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,650
mitigation in general and just whatever

377
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:24,510
you can do with a mailing list you're

378
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,900
allowed to do with github and just leave

379
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,370
it at that

380
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:32,460
we need to say nothing more yeah rich

381
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:35,010
sauce I I agree I used to run the open

382
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,500
SSL repo on git and it got more than its

383
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,210
share of harasses and you know it's not

384
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,160
a big deal you just closed our PRS and

385
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:46,740
move on and let's remember we also have

386
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,810
the working group chairs mailing list so

387
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:51,030
if this comes up later it's not like we

388
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,429
need to rev the RFC that's coming out of

389
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:55,350
this working group chairs talk among

390
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:58,860
themselves and someone would say how do

391
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:01,199
I do this and things like that so I'm I

392
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:03,689
think the conclusion here would be that

393
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,310
we don't put anything in this draft on

394
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:07,200
this on this topic and we deal with

395
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:09,179
using the the existing support

396
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,830
infrastructure that we have I think

397
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:13,620
that's that's a pretty sensation because

398
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,699
based heavily on people so which is

399
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,479
based heavily on people and this is a

400
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:20,930
people problem and like Sean said this

401
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,020
is not a problem that's really been a

402
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:28,260
major problem in the past it was worse

403
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:32,160
in the case that I identified at the w3c

404
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,780
and it required a little more process

405
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,170
than I think you know just closing there

406
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,020
P HUS would suggest and I'm sure that

407
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,060
rich has had similar experiences himself

408
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:46,560
but I think we can manage that

409
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:48,480
I mean that's all ahead so you know we

410
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,100
do with the issues accordingly and looks

411
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,490
like that document is mostly ready to go

412
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:56,850
everyone please take a look at it and

413
00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:07,580
read it hopefully we can move it forward

414
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:10,800
I guess we did story last yeah fine so

415
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,439
yeah so basically I do know one question

416
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,120
sure do you as chairs want a rave before

417
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,030
we go to working group last call

418
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,120
yeah I will get your ribs very shortly

419
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:22,080
thank you all right so yeah we're

420
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,429
basically at a point now where both

421
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,050
documents are fairly stable and mature

422
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,630
ready to move forward at least the

423
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:33,379
chairs think so so we'd like to start

424
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,790
working group last call for both of them

425
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:38,490
right after this meeting ends and we get

426
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:44,310
Martin's updated version are there any

427
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:45,990
objections to that great I guess that

428
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:48,629
that would go back over to the tutorial

429
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:51,000
so another thing that we've been working

430
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:52,620
on sort of inside this is not you know a

431
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,810
working group deliverable by any means

432
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,639
it's just something that we kind of put

433
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:59,700
together to help people not familiar

434
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,740
with github or get in general and who

435
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,120
might want to start using it to better

436
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,960
contribute to working groups so it as

437
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,489
the title suggests workflow or a you

438
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,560
know tutorial for kind of getting used

439
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,400
to these new technologies what the terms

440
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:18,750
mean what the typical workflows are like

441
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,049
the link I should

442
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,260
a link but you can find it on the github

443
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:27,629
repo or page for this working group I

444
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:31,350
can send around a link to the mailing

445
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:32,669
list as well for people to read be

446
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,020
useful if the folks in this room who are

447
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:35,520
interested in sort of helping improve

448
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,429
this content go through it provide

449
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,408
feedback as the documents suggest that

450
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:42,960
you can provide feedback on the github

451
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:47,250
repository that hosts this particular

452
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,409
tutorial it went around on some other

453
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:50,970
threads over this week so I believe you

454
00:23:49,409 --> 00:23:53,309
know other people in the ITF are looking

455
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,250
at it not gotten any kind of signal as

456
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:58,559
to whether or not it's been useful but

457
00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:00,330
hopefully it's caused or hopefully

458
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,070
hasn't caused too much damage and hasn't

459
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,020
confused anyone

460
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,720
so again if there's any way we can

461
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:09,020
improve this particular content please

462
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,850
do let us know on the mailing list or

463
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:13,500
ideally on the github repo and we can

464
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,580
tweak it accordingly I think there's

465
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,980
already some issues on there to help

466
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:26,720
clarify some things yeah great so with

467
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:28,440
that the last question for the group

468
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,940
tutorial like I was saying is not

469
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,010
technically deliverable for the working

470
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,720
group but there are like various tools

471
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,520
and things that have come out of the

472
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,320
development of these documents including

473
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,730
it updates to you know the Martins

474
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,168
template tool if there's is there

475
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,530
anything else really that you know the

476
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:48,059
workgroup should spend some time on

477
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:55,260
thinking and working on together as a

478
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:56,870
group if so perhaps I don't know let us

479
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:59,490
know at the mic or on the mailing list

480
00:24:56,870 --> 00:25:03,229
there is there are suggestions for

481
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:06,720
things and tools that might be useful in

482
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,700
one of the wiki pages should have

483
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:13,810
brought the link up actually I could do

484
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:17,020
that right now on speaking to it and

485
00:25:13,810 --> 00:25:18,550
if folks feel so inclined in doing some

486
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,280
of these things or commenting on them

487
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:26,200
that would be lovely but again none of

488
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:28,360
this is required it's mostly just you

489
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,370
know suggestions for interested parties

490
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:36,340
to work on things that might help the

491
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:40,840
community so with that said unless

492
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:43,959
there's anything else sorry so current

493
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,990
thoughts for timing is Martin we'll turn

494
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:51,340
in a new draft we will start working

495
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:53,260
group last call just given us holidays

496
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,730
and bits like that we might take it

497
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,170
towards the middle of December you know

498
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,440
it doesn't have to be a tight two week

499
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:01,990
during that time if people have ideas

500
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,430
for what they would want to see in a

501
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:05,950
recharter of the working group or

502
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,450
additional work we can sort of have that

503
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:09,340
discussion as well at the same time

504
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:11,490
because that might even tie into the two

505
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:15,010
documents or one of the two documents

506
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:18,490
but barring that or barring agreement

507
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:20,650
that we should do that then post working

508
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,460
group last call we would send them on to

509
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:27,010
our glorious ad and the working group

510
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:29,380
would stay up through the deliberation

511
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,330
of the isg and then probably close down

512
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:33,550
mailing list will stay up because it has

513
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,730
a cute name it's quite attractive to

514
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,350
people who have problems related to this

515
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:41,140
mailing this could absolutely be used

516
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:42,699
for other things such as talking about

517
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,710
the tooling talking about the tutorial

518
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,900
and things like that

519
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:50,260
but the working group in my mind is

520
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:52,750
likely to shut down before the next IETF

521
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,210
meeting assuming the ISG moves these

522
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:57,390
things through at sort of the normal

523
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,390
pace

524
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,240
Melissa do you want to comment on

525
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:05,770
anything or does that mostly make sense

526
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:06,700
alright great with that we can adjourn

527
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:09,600
super-early

528
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,600
thanks everyone for coming

529
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:31,300
are you serious that's what no no I

530
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:31,300
understand

531
00:27:57,530 --> 00:28:21,530
Oh on its own front page of our of our

532
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:26,450
github repo come on but I can just we

533
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:30,230
see I think we might have actually had

534
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:33,860
it on you know what that's like are you

535
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:37,850
on the mailing list okay so let me see

536
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,629
if I can just put it up now if I did

537
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,629

538
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,139
