1
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:41,300
good morning there's still plenty of

2
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:43,780
room further up front if people feel

3
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,800
cold and want to huddle together but

4
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:53,150
it's a big room here there's even some

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,860
seats up at the tables here so we should

6
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:56,330
get going I think the blue sheets are

7
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:00,770
already out might have started

8
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:02,330
circulating so please sign those you are

9
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:06,470
here for the reliable and available

10
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:07,789
Wireless boss and if you don't know

11
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,949
there's things in between a boss in a

12
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,600
working group please go look it up but

13
00:02:09,949 --> 00:02:13,820
we're trying to figure out if there's

14
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,989
some interesting new work for the ITF to

15
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,890
do here so we're not gonna talk

16
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:23,630
necessarily about exactly how problems

17
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:26,059
will be solved but go check on that I'm

18
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,460
Eric Nord mark and I'll let Rick

19
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:30,740
introduce himself good morning everyone

20
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:33,020
I'm Rick Taylor I will apologize in

21
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,790
advance I have a cough so if there's

22
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,430
sort of consumption style coughing

23
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,600
coming from the chairs please ignore

24
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:41,180
just to follow up with what Eric said

25
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:43,400
this is a working group forming buff so

26
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:47,690
there has already been a raw buff to

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:50,090
discuss topics around this area and it

28
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:52,970
was successful and well represented so

29
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:56,900
this is now an opportunity for us as

30
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:58,580
ietf attendees to decide whether we wish

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,200
to form a working group to work on this

32
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:02,200
but we'll get into that in more detail

33
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:06,990
[Music]

34
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,510
so this is the note well that applies to

35
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,269
this meeting as well as all of the other

36
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:21,290
ITF meetings if this is new to you

37
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:23,510
please go read more about it keep in

38
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:25,940
mind I were taking minutes the meeting

39
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,299
is actually being recorded we keep track

40
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:31,459
of persons we will have some remote

41
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,440
presentations as well using meet echo

42
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,320
and I think we have people that are

43
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,060
listening in our meet echo as well so a

44
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:43,579
number of people there already

45
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:47,000
some first of all we need a minute taker

46
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,340
do I have a volunteer like Ethan should

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,650
we

48
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,330
second volunteer as well to keep dark

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,790
just in case the discussion gets heated

50
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:58,590
I've been thinking this will be using

51
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:00,540
ether pad which is a really good tool

52
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:04,560
and is easy to use so you're not

53
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,049
committing to a whole session of typing

54
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,459
[Music]

55
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:12,239
yet people can always keep an eye on

56
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:13,560
ether pattern if things look a bit if

57
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,450
they're things that they would like to

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:21,930
correct there's ways of doing that as

59
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:25,280
well so somebody somebody volunteered

60
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:29,669
orally to be jabbar scribe yes thank you

61
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,619
so we have that taken care of if yeah

62
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,799
there's mailing list the materials are

63
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:39,360
all uploaded I've done some updates as

64
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:42,660
of this morning so and we have a couple

65
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:46,229
of presentations so so this is the

66
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,510
agenda for today one touch a bit about

67
00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:50,340
use cases there's a use case document

68
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:54,240
that talks about lots more but we want

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,010
to at least go in and show there's

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,450
something that's a bit different than

71
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,750
people might have thought about before

72
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:02,400
in the space and problems take statement

73
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:05,010
the purpose here is to get people to

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,080
understand what the working group a

75
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,909
potential working group is proposing to

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,460
do and the scope of that work so any

77
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:21,720
sort of agenda bashing at this point in

78
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:24,200
time so am i sorry hinted at the purpose

79
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:26,850
of the bar is to understand the problem

80
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,940
statement as well as the scope of the

81
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,680
proposed work and not start discussing

82
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,590
necessarily the solutions often it's

83
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,570
useful to for the the people's assembled

84
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:38,969
here to understand that oh it's possible

85
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,820
to solve this we're not trying to solve

86
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,229
some unsolvable problem but then the

87
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,969
other part is sort of gauging the

88
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,530
interest of the people are here as well

89
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:50,850
as on the mailing list to do work in

90
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:52,950
this space the there's likely to be some

91
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,580
things that tie in more with radio and

92
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:58,860
channel aspect here so if there's people

93
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,930
that are sort of experts and working in

94
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,169
that field this might be interesting in

95
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,479
terms

96
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:06,299
of sort of characterizing things and

97
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,128
this actually applies even in fixed

98
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,060
wireless deployment so that's one of the

99
00:06:08,129 --> 00:06:11,069
things that are interested in

100
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,749
interesting in this space so there might

101
00:06:11,069 --> 00:06:14,819
be a sort of a slightly different

102
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:16,830
community of people that we can

103
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,479
encourage to come and join us to help

104
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:20,568
with this work that might not

105
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,430
traditionally come to the idea and

106
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,039
intent is you know to leverage existing

107
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,319
work of course I mean from other working

108
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:56,669
groups as well as other stos so that's

109
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:59,789
it for the introduction so Carlos okay

110
00:06:56,669 --> 00:07:01,799
can you hear me so i'm carlos benardos

111
00:06:59,789 --> 00:07:09,210
I'm from Jersey 3m and I'm gonna present

112
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:10,919
this draft cysteine rough ok ok ok so I

113
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,229
think it's better now so I'm going to

114
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:15,750
present this cysteine document on use

115
00:07:13,229 --> 00:07:20,039
cases that is caught for on the on the

116
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,669
guys as you see on the slide so oops the

117
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,818
typical problem with this you have

118
00:07:23,669 --> 00:07:30,240
anything it's like scrolling more than

119
00:07:25,819 --> 00:07:31,889
just okay so in the drug there are six

120
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,719
use cases the commander for the sake of

121
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:36,499
time I'll try to be very briefly as for

122
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:39,509
allowing for discussion on the actual

123
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:41,999
both so there are six use cases I'm

124
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:43,349
gonna just talk about one of them the

125
00:07:41,999 --> 00:07:45,240
waters for integer application in a

126
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:47,998
draft for itself the use cases basically

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:51,240
we describe the use case the generic

128
00:07:47,999 --> 00:07:52,889
scenario we justify a bit the need for

129
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,870
waters which is pretty obvious in most

130
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:57,120
of the cases then we're going a bit into

131
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,479
the specifics of the each of these cases

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,669
and then based on that we identify some

133
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,318
of the actual requirements for reliable

134
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:06,020
and available Wireless from each of the

135
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,939
use cases so next one please

136
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,258
so for the one person for in neutral

137
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:11,849
application a scenario this is a picture

138
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:14,880
I will not go into the witness of course

139
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:17,700
that tries to exemplify what

140
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,730
this case is about so it's about having

141
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:23,130
a factory kind of a scenario in which we

142
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:27,630
have machinery that we need to control

143
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:29,219
and this control is remotely to need a

144
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:31,590
remote connection between this control

145
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,520
and the actual machinery that is most

146
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:38,000
likely Wireless because of the different

147
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:41,220
characteristics and in addition to this

148
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,960
control traffic we may also have all

149
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,690
that type of traffic for generic

150
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,490
monitoring and diagnosis for the the

151
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:49,320
operation of the traffic and in this

152
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:51,630
kind of environment we may have multiple

153
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,100
types of wireless technologies operating

154
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:55,980
at the same time so we may have

155
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,070
simultaneous links and it origines kind

156
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:01,740
of technologies working in parallel so

157
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:04,290
we need to operate those in a way that

158
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,020
ensures that each of the types of

159
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,760
traffic gets the rare ability and the

160
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,030
actual conditions that they required to

161
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,660
operate properly and next okay now to

162
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,910
works networks thank you so gonna be did

163
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,920
more into the specifics of this unique

164
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,410
scenario so what are the specifics we

165
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,319
need to support or we have very nice

166
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,910
technologies most likely Wireless it may

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,280
be that in some of the segments of the

168
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:32,400
connectivity we have also wire but we

169
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,459
have mostly wireless technologies we

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,920
have that we need to have support for

171
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:40,410
Matic multiple links or use of

172
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,349
simultaneously multiple at their newest

173
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:45,719
wireless links in order because of the

174
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,760
specifics of each of the machinery of

175
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,670
because we need to ensure a high

176
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,860
reliability we have that these

177
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:55,110
conditions of the conditions of the the

178
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,510
links that we have may live arrival in

179
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,370
time even though we may have fixed

180
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,800
scenarios with low mobility or normally

181
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,810
arrow but because of the intrinsic radio

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,280
characteristics those links may may

183
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,219
suffer from variation that we need to

184
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,650
cope with and as I mention before we may

185
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,620
have different types of traffic at the

186
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,329
same time so for example the control

187
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:17,010
loop kind of traffic that of course

188
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,520
reliability is key in this kind of a

189
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,910
scenario

190
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:23,130
plus the no so demanded in terms of

191
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,260
reliability monetary and the as massive

192
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:28,020
traffic those are two examples that we

193
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,740
may have in this scenario so based on

194
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,689
that

195
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,700
what are the specific requirements for

196
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,110
or the main requirement for role in this

197
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,300
for this use case

198
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:39,270
well there are particularly - although

199
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,370
there are a few others that are the

200
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:42,810
first the solutions needs to be backward

201
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,280
compatible in the sense that we need to

202
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:49,800
support both this traditional less

203
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:53,370
demanding traffic like monitoring and

204
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,260
the agnostic plus the new traffic or the

205
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,120
traffic that really demands reliable and

206
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:58,800
predictable Wireless behavior like a

207
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,230
control loop traffic that I mentioned

208
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,780
before we also need to support at the

209
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:05,760
radius what as technology's operating at

210
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,939
the same time as I mentioned before so

211
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,980
those are the kind of key to new

212
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:15,000
requirements that demand solutions in

213
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:17,310
the in the royal space and I don't want

214
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,590
to spend much more time so just as a

215
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:22,770
quick summary so we have different use

216
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:25,080
cases that require wireless connectivity

217
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:27,660
what is connectivity with reliable and

218
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:30,090
available behavior we have identify

219
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:32,939
already six in the draft we are working

220
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:35,520
already in a couple more for example the

221
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,610
digital optical communications and a

222
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:41,430
smart grid and in terms of next steps in

223
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,630
case this working group is formed we

224
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,790
would like of course to continue

225
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:47,880
identifying potential use cases for ro

226
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:50,000
and also to continue working on existing

227
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,590
ones in terms of characteristics

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,210
characterizing the actual requirements

229
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:56,580
that we need for the potential ro

230
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:59,400
technologies to be developed and that's

231
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,560
basically all in terms of very short

232
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:11,520
summary of use cases so you have any

233
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:14,550
question comment this is a mock phone

234
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:16,439
featuring I just from the deployment

235
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,979
scenario the first slide picture is

236
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:22,380
shown it shows all layer 1 and layer 2

237
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:28,230
is it the scope or any layer 3 stuff

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:30,450
happens did it happen here well the the

239
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,460
scope is to actually I mean that will be

240
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:35,460
a bit solution space of it but the scope

241
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:38,910
is to support multiple technologies and

242
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:41,100
how to properly configure and use those

243
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,750
multiple cameras in order to support or

244
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,510
to provide reliability

245
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,490
and many diabetic a statistics for the

246
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:50,460
the whole operation of the of the

247
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,020
traffic I don't know if I mean it that

248
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:54,030
answers your question I don't know

249
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:57,300
exactly would you a regular but yes so

250
00:12:54,030 --> 00:13:00,089
so the working group is proposing what

251
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,530
today in these I guess black mark says

252
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:04,410
right the thing that actually provides a

253
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:07,470
layer three servers using multiple layer

254
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:10,290
two technologies okay yeah so because

255
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:13,830
all this six dish and all this is a

256
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:15,360
layer one maybe and yeah but it but it's

257
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:17,280
the boxes that interconnect that so you

258
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,800
can provide a service across this whole

259
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:22,350
network that that is reliable and

260
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,060
available using different underlying

261
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,590
technologies so that's the key thing

262
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,689
it's illustrating right it is about

263
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:29,630
layer three just like that net is about

264
00:13:27,690 --> 00:14:03,510
layer three using different layer two

265
00:13:29,630 --> 00:14:05,640
technologies underneath okay so clearly

266
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,160
one of the main discussions we need to

267
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,199
have today is to establish a scope for

268
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,780
the world that want to Intel to we tend

269
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:16,050
to do and basically what kind of problem

270
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:18,150
we we want to solve and so we we started

271
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,969
a draft and we've been working quite a

272
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:24,290
lot on that draft since the last ATF

273
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:27,180
where we had this informal meeting and

274
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,740
basically here's the content of the

275
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,310
draft for a minute so you will see that

276
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,750
the trust is not only about the exact

277
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:36,270
crime that will be one of the last

278
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,370
section section seven but it also deals

279
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:43,140
with positioning the work inside the

280
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:48,480
IETF and figuring out what's in and

281
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:51,920
what's out in particular the row problem

282
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,330
starts where the the current

283
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:56,430
understanding of writing and centralized

284
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:59,070
routing stops so basically we expect

285
00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:01,680
that the centralized routing mostly in

286
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:06,690
bed net from which we are in ur it will

287
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:10,890
beyond rotting with enough reliability

288
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:14,160
viability for wire wild applications and

289
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:18,300
pretty much the pre of functions that

290
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,740
better not defined and the routing will

291
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,569
will be programming the fording once and

292
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,250
for all and the forwarding will be a

293
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:29,940
simple application of what the routing

294
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:32,580
has decided and that's probably enough

295
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,580
for wires but for wireless we see the

296
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:37,620
need of decoupling this to a little bit

297
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,120
more and providing some local

298
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,250
intelligence for it and that's pretty

299
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,480
much what the draft tries to discuss so

300
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:44,480
we'll go into more detail about that

301
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:50,250
okay so the first thing that the draft

302
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,660
does is terminology because when we

303
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:53,520
start those discussions people wonder

304
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,990
why are we talking about the same thing

305
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,089
so it's very important to define the

306
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:59,880
terms we'll be dealing with the first

307
00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:01,650
term reliability and actually by

308
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,200
abilities like that as well both come

309
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:08,220
from automation world so it

310
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:10,890
nothing really specific to to ATF or

311
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,990
Internet do the terms that you find for

312
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:16,050
everything automation the first term

313
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:18,170
critical term is reliability is how well

314
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:22,109
a certain system will be able to perform

315
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:24,180
the expected function and in our case

316
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:26,640
the expected function can be to deliver

317
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,760
the packet if you talk about determinism

318
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,970
then it will be to deliver the packet

319
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:36,780
timely and how reliable the the network

320
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:38,490
is is how well the network can deliver

321
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:41,310
those packets whose packets

322
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:45,630
in due time so you have to establish

323
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:48,300
metrics to measure the reliability usual

324
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:50,340
metrics in the industrial world is the

325
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:53,939
mean time between photo mean mean time

326
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,550
between errors and you will find us as

327
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,070
you are Conroe that we might be

328
00:16:56,550 --> 00:17:01,140
interested in other metrics and another

329
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:04,290
critical metrics is the number of

330
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:05,430
consecutive faults if you have a control

331
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:08,970
loop which is one of the usual

332
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:10,949
applications of automation networks you

333
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:13,680
can actually totally it's it's very

334
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:16,680
acceptable to lose a packet packets get

335
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:18,360
lost but if you lose four packets in a

336
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,190
row the system will go into emergency

337
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:24,030
stop and that's one thing that is not

338
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:27,900
acceptable so the number of consecutive

339
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:30,389
errors becomes a creaky metric for your

340
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,650
reliability okay so the first phase one

341
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:33,240
one of the phase and one of the

342
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,640
interesting things in this document is

343
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,530
to actually define reliability and with

344
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,480
it define the metrics by which we'll be

345
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,740
able to assess the reliability that our

346
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,810
networks will have to ensure second

347
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,790
thing is a variability so it looks kind

348
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:49,290
of simpler in our case so the

349
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:52,950
availability is basically the amount of

350
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:56,370
time and the service is up divided by

351
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,350
the total amount of time and so like if

352
00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:01,320
you have a safety network you want 100%

353
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:06,300
wave it because some lives may be at

354
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:08,100
stake that really boils down to putting

355
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,169
together redundant systems if you talk

356
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,060
about safety that's when you start

357
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,250
having different system ensuring the

358
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:16,620
same service possibly different systems

359
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:18,299
with different implementations and

360
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,949
possibly different protocols

361
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,719
and you realize that the safety people

362
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:25,919
are really really concerned with

363
00:18:21,719 --> 00:18:27,570
diversity diverse systems diverse

364
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,269
networks

365
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,539
maybe wireless technology combined with

366
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:35,190
wired technology maybe some protocols

367
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,229
combined with other protocols and

368
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:41,580
possibly different implementations so

369
00:18:37,229 --> 00:18:43,950
diversity spans all aspects of a certain

370
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,699
system including the network and we'll

371
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:50,239
find that Wireless also includes its own

372
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,919
collection of possible diversity and

373
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,729
part of the raw game that is not present

374
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:57,359
at all

375
00:18:53,729 --> 00:18:59,399
in the wild space is how to exploit the

376
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:03,449
new diversity that the wireless enables

377
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:06,508
and finally there is this third term

378
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,589
which will be kind of critical to us we

379
00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:10,440
kind pal

380
00:19:07,589 --> 00:19:12,690
I think and still be a challenge but

381
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,239
it's it's kind of the wireless version

382
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,209
of what we know it from that net which

383
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:21,119
is pre off so pre off in that net means

384
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:23,999
packet replication elimination ordering

385
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:27,059
function it remains okay I want an

386
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:28,169
available path I want to reach our ten

387
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,570
ten nines

388
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:32,279
so Ethernet will give me five nines if I

389
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,749
have two parallel paths with Ethernet

390
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,789
and they are completely independent

391
00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:38,339
completely non congruent and blah blah

392
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:39,869
then statistically if I have five nines

393
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,749
on the Left five nines on the right I

394
00:19:39,869 --> 00:19:45,178
get ten nine okay and that's the

395
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:48,419
replication typically at the ingress and

396
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:50,070
the elimination at the egress so that

397
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:52,109
you get two single packet out and guess

398
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:54,329
what as you do this you might actually

399
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,759
put the packets out of order so that's

400
00:19:54,329 --> 00:20:00,059
why they are this ordering function

401
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,429
typically add egress and that model is

402
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:05,190
also typically quite enough for wire

403
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,989
meaning that usually you'll get two

404
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:09,089
parallel paths you'll be monitoring the

405
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:10,889
activity and ensuring the still up and

406
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:11,339
that will give you a viability and ten

407
00:20:10,889 --> 00:20:13,589
nines

408
00:20:11,339 --> 00:20:16,019
so the routing will actually be on two T

409
00:20:13,589 --> 00:20:17,039
paths set that up install a flow over

410
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:19,709
that and you'll be all set for

411
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:21,899
deterministic networking for wireless

412
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:26,429
it's going to be a little bit more

413
00:20:21,899 --> 00:20:28,468
complex because the medium itself is not

414
00:20:26,429 --> 00:20:30,269
deterministic so you cannot even climb

415
00:20:28,469 --> 00:20:31,900
oh I'm building a deterministic Network

416
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:34,180
and you will see that

417
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,400
our specs if ever you find the term

418
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:39,130
deterministic it couldn't be caught and

419
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,500
code right we try to avoid using the

420
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:45,040
term deterministic and that's why I see

421
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,990
even though we inner it from that net we

422
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,879
are not claiming we're going to bring

423
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:51,730
you a deterministic Network we are going

424
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,340
to bring you a network which is as

425
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,070
reliable and available as possible and

426
00:20:54,340 --> 00:21:01,120
actually the routing will have we will

427
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:04,540
have to sort out to build a path and a

428
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,810
collection of paths which over time

429
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:10,990
ensures the quality that you want the

430
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:12,580
prime is as you do this the path of a

431
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,500
collection of paths that the routing

432
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:19,510
will have to device for for for the

433
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:22,300
wireless will probably be oversized for

434
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:24,790
a particular moment of time meaning that

435
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,409
if you really want so many nines that

436
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:28,060
means you have probably like three four

437
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,570
five different paths that you could use

438
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,639
in power

439
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,830
some of them single hard some of them

440
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,100
multiple hubs etc some of them are

441
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:39,760
possibly different technologies if you

442
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:42,399
go and use everything all the time so if

443
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,290
you really flood this graph that the

444
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,110
routing has provided to you all the time

445
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:49,899
that means other use of energy and

446
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:51,729
values of constraint spectrum in many

447
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:53,860
applications we can not waste those

448
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,200
resources on wireless again it would not

449
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,719
be a prime you just push the packets on

450
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,420
both paths and your whole set but on

451
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,790
wireless energy and spectrum are

452
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:07,210
critically important and guess what

453
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:09,190
since the links are not so so viable you

454
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,740
really need to have a lot of redundant

455
00:22:09,190 --> 00:22:13,480
diversity as you build those paths so so

456
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,540
now you see the tension right on the one

457
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:19,210
hand the routing has to give me a very

458
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,000
diverse path of every diverse

459
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:24,430
possibilities to get from A to B but on

460
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,560
the other hand if I use all these

461
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:29,620
diversity all the time I'm wasting my

462
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:32,050
spectrum and my energy and so this this

463
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:34,330
thin pipe that exists between the PCE

464
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:36,730
and the fording which was just simple

465
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:39,100
programming for the wire now has to

466
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:42,220
become a lot more intelligence so as to

467
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,169
wisely use the resources that the

468
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,600
routing has told you you could use this

469
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:49,169
harp or this harp or this

470
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,689
up to get from A to B yes I could but at

471
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:54,000
this time for this packet should I

472
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:57,960
really use everything or should I use a

473
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,110
subset of it how can I decide so that's

474
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:04,530
going to be the prime that that row will

475
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,889
be discussing so we're talking about

476
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:10,649
what possibly a large network so I'm not

477
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:14,370
sure I can actually so we have a

478
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:16,289
potentially large network but and the

479
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:18,449
centralized routing what we usually call

480
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:22,559
a path computation element at the idea

481
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:25,559
that PC since this whole network and

482
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,700
will decide for a number of traffic

483
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:32,039
engineer paths I mean which particular

484
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,289
hubs can be used to go from A to B so we

485
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:37,379
have a for instance a small a small

486
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:40,679
graph which which is here and it's a

487
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:43,530
control loop between maybe sensor here

488
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,330
and a programmable logic controller so

489
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:46,889
it's one the first half of a control

490
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:49,080
loop between a sensor and the

491
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:51,929
programmable logic controller and we

492
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:56,010
want that all packets from the sensors

493
00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:57,600
reach the PLC with in due time and you

494
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:00,809
never lose four packets in a row

495
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:03,090
something like that so on the one hand

496
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:05,129
you realize that the view that the PC

497
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:07,939
has on the network is a very large

498
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,080
network that view cannot be

499
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:13,830
instantaneous because just talking to

500
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,750
the controller takes a lot of time also

501
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,750
it's a very large view and solving the

502
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,880
problem of many paths like this one

503
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:24,990
which may use the same constrained

504
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:27,059
resources is an np-complete problem so

505
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:29,370
solving this problem at the scale of

506
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,030
this large network with many paths like

507
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:36,418
this is a huge computation it does not

508
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:41,460
happen quickly it happens actually

509
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:43,860
rarely meaning that when finally the

510
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:46,650
computer decides oh here is a harm gonna

511
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,959
lay out all those paths you expect that

512
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:53,039
the paths that have been built are

513
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:57,299
usable for a large amount of time so the

514
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,680
computation is slow the talking with the

515
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,650
controller is slow

516
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:02,970
and what the controller builds is

517
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:07,110
expected to be there for her large

518
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:09,750
amount of time which also tells us that

519
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:14,429
the the redundancy that has to be put in

520
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:17,610
place as to me as to be capable to

521
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:19,140
handle the the short-term breakage that

522
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:20,699
happened all the time on radios because

523
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:22,950
if you look now if you narrow down to

524
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:24,900
this particular little graph that the

525
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:28,080
routing has selected between the day and

526
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,280
the B for this sensor to to PLC you

527
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,439
realize that there are number of

528
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:34,320
wireless hops and those wireless hops

529
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,020
they tend to to work most of the time

530
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,090
like 80% of an hour but at a very

531
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,800
particle of time there might be some

532
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:42,929
metallic object passing through between

533
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,700
the sender and the receiver and guess

534
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:46,980
what for half a second the link will be

535
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,900
down can you go back to the routing and

536
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:52,070
say hey I need to to recompute my words

537
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:54,510
you can't that's not the same time scale

538
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:57,590
okay so now we realized that we have a

539
00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:02,580
time scale and some particular metrics

540
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:05,580
which are what we tell this PCE and on

541
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,480
which the PC will be on this path for a

542
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:13,010
long time scale for a long time but at

543
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,000
the same time those wireless hubs we go

544
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,690
available and variable available

545
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:21,240
flapping quote-unquote for much smaller

546
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:26,070
amounts of time and we need a much

547
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:30,360
faster reaction and a much more narrow

548
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:32,939
and fine-grained understanding of this

549
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:35,669
particular small network within the

550
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,260
network but we need this information all

551
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:40,350
the time all the time and the type of

552
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,390
metric that that you will use now is no

553
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,969
more a statistical 80 percent

554
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:47,880
availability over hours but more like a

555
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:51,900
is it does it work just now so more like

556
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:54,270
on/off boolean or something like what is

557
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,950
the current speed of my file because you

558
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:59,250
know many of those files it's true for

559
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,550
that 11 it's true for 15 for now you can

560
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:05,430
you can tune the fyrite to adapt to the

561
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,110
propagation and guess what that changes

562
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:08,610
which means that the amount of traffic

563
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,550
that you can send on a particular

564
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:12,840
segment changes over time and as you

565
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,120
decide where to

566
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,370
place your reliable available flow you

567
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,178
have to account for the current speed of

568
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:23,129
those links okay so you see that in the

569
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,320
one hand you get metrics that are really

570
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:26,909
available average speed or average

571
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:28,710
availability blah blah that can be

572
00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:30,450
pushed to this PC to solve the global

573
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:32,850
problem which is a very hard problem

574
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:35,159
with many paths of a large network and

575
00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:36,480
on the other hand you need another set

576
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:40,140
of metrics which are a lot more

577
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,510
instantaneous and that really tell the

578
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,890
forwarding for this particular small

579
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:49,980
network how to use wisely

580
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,429
all this overload of resources that the

581
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:56,899
routing has said you could be using so

582
00:27:53,429 --> 00:28:01,200
so basically now if we've kind of

583
00:27:56,899 --> 00:28:05,039
introduced this new concept of a path

584
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,669
selection engine which is this overgrown

585
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,129
pipe between the PC and affording that

586
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:15,029
that is being programmed well actually

587
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:18,450
you may take decision of tuning the

588
00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:20,940
fording at a very fast pace based on

589
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,789
information that is made available

590
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:28,649
within this very small topology that we

591
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:30,510
just saw so that the core of the raw

592
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:32,250
problem will be to work on this new

593
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:37,529
element that we call a path selection

594
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:39,809
engine and as a side effect of that is

595
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:42,029
since we are talking about Wireless the

596
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:44,970
the work that the PSE will have to do

597
00:28:42,029 --> 00:28:47,429
will have to account for the the Richer

598
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:51,480
capabilities that radios have in

599
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:53,610
particular in the Pajero functions we

600
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:57,210
have intro we introduced the capability

601
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:58,949
to do retries and maybe the retries fail

602
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:01,470
and if they fail twice then you try

603
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,630
another hub a different next stop so

604
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,090
that's part of what we call a RQ retries

605
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,340
the capability at layer 3 to decide a I

606
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:11,370
can try twice on the left but then I

607
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,439
might I may go right or I can trigger

608
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,209
our application because didn't work

609
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,380
where on the left so maybe I feel better

610
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:22,350
if I try both next ups at the same time

611
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:23,730
and you can see on this table the PSC is

612
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:27,090
really different kind of beast

613
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,910
the PSC does not do right computer

614
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:33,120
the rats are there to PC as defined the

615
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:38,160
rods the PSC is in charge of in charge

616
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:40,790
of using them wisely the operation for

617
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,190
the PSC happens within this small

618
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,899
network this dismal overlay that that

619
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,580
the rotting has decided should be used

620
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,640
for this particular variable variable

621
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:52,918
flow the decision of how it's going to

622
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,679
be used could be sorted the ingress

623
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:57,299
could flag the packet and say Oh on the

624
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,710
first step is going to be replicated but

625
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:02,639
then there will be no more replication

626
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:06,540
or maybe that will be cross copy between

627
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,799
one path and I guess the worries in the

628
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:12,240
dark now what did I say let's talk about

629
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,370
different timescales we are talking

630
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,270
about different metrics we are talking

631
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:20,100
about different pace right so that's

632
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:23,010
really the key difference between this

633
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:26,510
PSC which we live somewhere on the

634
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:29,640
southbound interface and the traditional

635
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:37,890
PC programs my forwarding that we have

636
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:39,360
in that net so is it even ok so the

637
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:41,490
other question is ok you know your

638
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,860
wireless harp is not deterministic and

639
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,919
you even achieve what you claim you're

640
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,168
going to achieve

641
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,390
well we claim and we'll see more when we

642
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:53,790
discuss the technologies that there are

643
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:56,100
more and more well as technologies that

644
00:30:53,790 --> 00:31:00,030
provides provide more and more grantees

645
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,760
and the way those grantees are improved

646
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:05,970
widely is through the use of 10-digit

647
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,390
multiplex and scheduling as you schedule

648
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,850
radios you will get the usual benefits

649
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:15,540
that you expect on wires so for those of

650
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,969
you participated GSN of our debt net you

651
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,879
you know you realize that scheduling

652
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:23,880
traffic in particular scheduling all the

653
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,490
critical traffic allows us to put a lot

654
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,790
more I cross traffic on a given link

655
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:32,040
usually used to put like 10 15 percent

656
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,659
of ours cross traffic on the link after

657
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:35,700
that you start getting statistical

658
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,100
effects if you schedule on your traffic

659
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,929
and you know exactly how much is going

660
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,469
from everywhere like you do in a plane

661
00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:43,470
or you

662
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:47,039
ESN Network now you can load the network

663
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:48,210
a lot more so that's one of the good

664
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:56,820
benefits that you can find from

665
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:59,970
scheduling one critical benefit that we

666
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:01,320
have in TSN from scheduling is that we

667
00:31:59,970 --> 00:32:03,720
ensure that we never get too many

668
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:05,280
packets India outgoing queues because

669
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:07,919
pretty much all the laws that you can

670
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,539
find on an Ethernet network is collision

671
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,250
last collision laws being I have ten

672
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:13,470
packets at my outgoing queue but there

673
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,669
are five place I saw have to discard

674
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,640
packets because there's just not enough

675
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:20,700
room in my choose on wireless most of

676
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,210
the last will be in the air so we'll see

677
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,370
that scheduling also allows us to reduce

678
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:30,080
the collisions not in the outgoing queue

679
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:33,809
of the Ethernet but truly in the air and

680
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,610
finally the key advantage that TSN

681
00:32:33,809 --> 00:32:37,918
derives from scheduling is if you know

682
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,418
exactly what the packet is within each

683
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,890
period of time then you know how many

684
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:42,929
period of time it takes from the back

685
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,390
for the packet to go from A to B so at

686
00:32:42,929 --> 00:32:50,250
the end of the day TSN and that net over

687
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,650
it will give you granted latency so

688
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:54,750
those out the usual benefits that you

689
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:57,900
can derive from from scheduling in

690
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,600
wireless we arrive even more benefits

691
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:02,429
and that's kind of cool the first thing

692
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,379
is if you know and for instance we

693
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,240
mentioned 6000 if you know when you

694
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:10,220
transmit something if every transmission

695
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,010
is scheduled now you can live without

696
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,460
interframe space you can live without

697
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:17,850
back off

698
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,280
which is really empty space in your

699
00:33:17,850 --> 00:33:22,439
transmissions and that that kind of

700
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,918
coalition battery operated because you

701
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,250
don't want to be listening for the void

702
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,230
the second thing is again if your

703
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:34,650
battery operated and you have I would

704
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:36,390
say relatively rare transmissions you

705
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:37,530
don't want to be listening in case of

706
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:40,080
somebody wants to talk to you as

707
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:43,289
synchronously so you want to know in

708
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,570
advance when a is going to talk to B and

709
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:47,460
a is going to wake up at that exact time

710
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,559
and B is going to wake up at that exact

711
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:52,140
time and 90% of the time they will be

712
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,450
sleeping and that's how you extend the

713
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:57,290
battery life actually does battery power

714
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,500
devices they sleep more like modern cats

715
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:03,870
so being able to avoid anti space in the

716
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,970
air being avoid to being able to sleep

717
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:07,379
most of the time are additional

718
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:09,560
advantages that are derived by

719
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:14,130
scheduling from scheduling the network

720
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,370
now if you're used again to the way TSN

721
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:20,210
operates you'll find that the way we

722
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:23,969
provide the row properties on wireless

723
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:26,610
are different from from what you you do

724
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:29,310
on wires first thing is like I said on

725
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:32,220
why you're the only place I can have a

726
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,679
collision is my own outgoing cue so the

727
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:36,600
core of what GSN will be doing there is

728
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,370
first you schedule to make sure you

729
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,920
don't have too many packets and then if

730
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:43,020
you have a non-deterministic packet

731
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,430
being sent on this transmit cue but

732
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,840
you've got this urgent the terroristic

733
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,940
packet that you want to send in the

734
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:50,670
middle then you can snip snap the

735
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:53,280
current packet we put the half that you

736
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:56,040
didn't sign on the side send your

737
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,260
deterministic packet and resume the

738
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,350
transmission on the lower priority

739
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,150
packet and that's that's easy because

740
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,770
you hone the whole thing you're on the

741
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:07,640
silicon that's transmitting and the

742
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,750
medium is the the unidirectional

743
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:12,960
transmission of your Ethernet was the

744
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:15,180
switch in the air it's different this is

745
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,320
a shared medium there can be tons of

746
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,770
things which are happening on that

747
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,590
spectrum and the only way to kind of

748
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:26,130
avoid all forms of collisions is again

749
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:29,340
diversity if you if you if you're facing

750
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:31,500
a white noise maybe sending a spike of

751
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,360
energy on a very narrow bound channel is

752
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:38,550
the way to defeat that noise on the

753
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:40,920
other hand if if you get a very small

754
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:42,810
spectrum with a lot of energy in it then

755
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,430
using the spread pack from technology is

756
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:47,310
the way to go around it and now you

757
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:50,520
realize a if I use a single radio

758
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:52,740
technology I have less probability of

759
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,910
success and infirm capable of using two

760
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:56,129
different technologies which have

761
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:58,500
different properties on the way they use

762
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,540
the spectrum so again diversity

763
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,030
diversity diversity diversity is the key

764
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:06,299
to give us reliable the variable

765
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:11,910
transmission and

766
00:36:06,299 --> 00:36:14,369
pareo is actually the term we coined to

767
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:17,670
express all those forms of diversity

768
00:36:14,369 --> 00:36:19,469
that we only use want to use so the key

769
00:36:17,670 --> 00:36:22,949
one that does not exist in that net is a

770
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:24,959
RQ or hybrid a RQ so that's the retry I

771
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:26,670
have to use the rich hybrid means you

772
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:29,368
can do some forward or a correction with

773
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:31,650
it meaning that for instance if I if I

774
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,239
have like two three paths and I do some

775
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,479
network coding with my packet size an

776
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:38,789
ABC these four segments I can send a

777
00:36:36,479 --> 00:36:41,549
fifth segment which is the exhort the

778
00:36:38,789 --> 00:36:43,979
first four and if I do that and one of

779
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:46,499
the four is lost then I can use the

780
00:36:43,979 --> 00:36:49,558
fifth one to recompose at the end what I

781
00:36:46,499 --> 00:36:52,499
what I lost the amount of network coding

782
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:54,869
that you apply could depend on your

783
00:36:52,499 --> 00:36:57,178
appreciation of the reliability of the

784
00:36:54,869 --> 00:37:00,299
network at this particular moment of

785
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:02,279
time so you see there's there's a lot of

786
00:37:00,299 --> 00:37:07,140
intelligence that could take place in

787
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:09,989
order to ensure like the number of nines

788
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:13,650
that I want or the number of packets

789
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:15,539
loss in a row that I want to maximize to

790
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:18,119
ensure that at this precise time and

791
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:20,339
that could be dynamically tuning the

792
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,219
capabilities that are there so we are

793
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:26,058
not installing the routing but we are

794
00:37:23,219 --> 00:37:29,640
using only capabilities that are there

795
00:37:26,059 --> 00:37:31,410
very wisely to optimize the balance

796
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:33,089
between in the one hand energy and

797
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,589
spectrum and the other hand reliability

798
00:37:33,089 --> 00:37:41,279
and availability it's this balance that

799
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:43,349
we want to play with so we could have

800
00:37:41,279 --> 00:37:46,589
looked at how we interact with different

801
00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:48,089
working row clearly we narrate us from

802
00:37:46,589 --> 00:37:50,279
the many architecture will have the

803
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:51,779
central computation because you need

804
00:37:50,279 --> 00:37:53,849
this good view of the network to be on

805
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:57,269
the routing and all this is kind of the

806
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:58,439
same right maybe our small network we

807
00:37:57,269 --> 00:38:00,538
talked about we call that the track

808
00:37:58,439 --> 00:38:02,160
maybe this truck is a bit more complex

809
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:03,749
than what the date-nut control usually

810
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,118
builds but it's it's cisco that's what

811
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:09,390
it does so we completely narrate this

812
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:13,019
this model we live in this small world

813
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:15,808
that goes overgrown now between the

814
00:38:13,019 --> 00:38:18,029
writing as computed this thing and there

815
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:19,920
is a decision for this given packet in

816
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,299
our case we don't use all the

817
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,069
possibilities that the routing gives

818
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:25,440
because there are too many of them and

819
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:27,058
we have to find two now we use them and

820
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,130
for that we need to monitor the small

821
00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:31,680
network all the time all the time it's a

822
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:32,910
very fine grain so it's it's a direct

823
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,149
inheritance from that net

824
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:37,740
we also inherit from MANET and we'll

825
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,349
really hope that some some people might

826
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:42,058
from money will come here now we are not

827
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:44,819
mobile I mean there is a big tension

828
00:38:42,059 --> 00:38:46,920
between mobility and determinism because

829
00:38:44,819 --> 00:38:48,540
it's very hard to solve the problem when

830
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,089
it's fixed now if everything is mobile

831
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,369
it becomes even harder so there are

832
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,558
people who can actually think that not

833
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,900
only time but also space our dimensions

834
00:38:55,559 --> 00:39:00,240
to the PC and that can be done if you

835
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:02,520
know deterministically where the objects

836
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,279
will be like this satellite networks

837
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,799
then you can start building the turistic

838
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,460
path even over this many satellites in

839
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:15,359
the air now that's probably not the most

840
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:17,430
usual case but when the movements are

841
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,839
deterministic you can you can build a

842
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:20,609
deterministic Network when the movement

843
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:22,020
is not deterministic it's just like when

844
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:23,640
the flow is not deterministic then you

845
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,910
cannot build anything deterministic over

846
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:28,529
it so because of this tension with my

847
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,109
name we can reuse some work in

848
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:32,720
particular things like dilip looks

849
00:39:30,109 --> 00:39:35,190
fundamental and very interesting for us

850
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,230
but we have to think the leap of our

851
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:39,270
multiple Hopf not develop just between

852
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:41,819
one router and it's wireless interface

853
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:43,500
so we have to be able to collect all the

854
00:39:41,819 --> 00:39:46,829
dilip information of our multiple hops

855
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,190
and feed that back to where the PSC

856
00:39:46,829 --> 00:39:51,960
decision is being made

857
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:53,339
Sika obvious we will need data model and

858
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,930
we'll need to extend the wire data

859
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:58,049
models to express to spelling of

860
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:59,848
functions that now we're capable of ipm

861
00:39:58,049 --> 00:40:02,549
probably there will be a mix of in burn

862
00:39:59,849 --> 00:40:05,130
a lot of burned om to dynamically

863
00:40:02,549 --> 00:40:07,020
measure this very small network again

864
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,150
Phi space but very small network that's

865
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,849
why it's doable so we're not talking

866
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:15,589
about entire domain pareo function we

867
00:40:11,849 --> 00:40:20,579
are looking at enabling a few hops over

868
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:22,558
one or few technologies and bring the

869
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:24,059
reliable and available characteristics

870
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:25,770
that we after so we are talking about

871
00:40:24,059 --> 00:40:29,309
small networks here small networks

872
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:30,720
within bigger networks and beer is also

873
00:40:29,309 --> 00:40:33,660
a candidate and there is a draft that

874
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,299
beer to actually place in the back

875
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:37,740
a sorted decision of where her

876
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:41,670
replication should take place or where

877
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,538
elimination should take place etc so

878
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:47,130
what we need to do we first need to

879
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:48,750
check obviously that we have use cases

880
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,400
and technologies and like I said there

881
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:52,980
is a discussion and technology draft

882
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,950
coming next we'll see that more and more

883
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,700
radio networks are coming with

884
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:03,000
capabilities to schedule meaning that we

885
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:06,118
know that once through us completed all

886
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,000
the work we can actually capo multiple

887
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:10,440
hubs of those different technologies and

888
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,599
produce the ultimate goal which is you

889
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,700
know the number of nines that you want

890
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,030
with the last that you want within a

891
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:19,230
bounded latency we don't claim we can do

892
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,640
that on the first run dirt is working

893
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:25,140
Rob but that's that would be the

894
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,210
ultimate goal so we can work with sorted

895
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,770
or we can work with distributed

896
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,299
operation and the group will has to do

897
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:32,280
will have to define you know what it

898
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:34,710
wants to work on so without the decision

899
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,980
the PSC is on the source on the ingress

900
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:39,510
of this network and then all the the OEM

901
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,940
information has to be flooded back to

902
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:44,220
this guy or if actually there is some

903
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,470
signaling in the packet which says down

904
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,808
the path which helps down the path

905
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,788
figuring out how you make a distributed

906
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:54,270
decision of using this redundancy that

907
00:41:50,789 --> 00:41:57,420
the network has given us so we need to

908
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:59,220
tag the packets with this decision or if

909
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,980
it's allotted or helpers to make this

910
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,669
decision if it's not so swatting and on

911
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,809
the other hand we'll have to do this

912
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:12,960
BFD or om Ohio a.m. or whatever else

913
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:15,450
extension to get a picture of the

914
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,470
current state of this graph at this very

915
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:22,020
moment so these are the two things that

916
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,640
we really to provide get the visibility

917
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,950
on this very small network at a five

918
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:28,589
space and then provide the right

919
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:34,230
signaling in the packets to use that

920
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:36,029
what's what's available wisely and if I

921
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:39,089
have time I have a few experiments that

922
00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:41,279
I could share I have eight minutes so

923
00:42:39,089 --> 00:42:43,020
let me just show you a few graphs I

924
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,450
hoped I would be able to because I find

925
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:47,240
them kind of interesting so so here is

926
00:42:45,450 --> 00:42:50,540
there is a small network and these are

927
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:53,029
real world measurements right and we

928
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,740
just we just artificially created some

929
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:57,589
loss because it's those networks are

930
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,029
actually quite reliable so it's it's we

931
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:01,190
have to for some euros to get there but

932
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:05,060
so you have another path in red and a

933
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:08,599
row a path in blue and the two pictures

934
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,520
on the top show you basically the number

935
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:12,820
of transmissions that it took for a

936
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:17,509
given packet to gave to get from a to H

937
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:20,660
so on the first two we do normal irq

938
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:22,640
over top left up right over a single

939
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,379
path meanings you try to send if it

940
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,220
doesn't work you resend it doesn't work

941
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:30,109
every sound so on the vertical here it's

942
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:33,200
one time so you see that this packet the

943
00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:35,810
packets down these lines they made the

944
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,330
hole they made the whole path without a

945
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,670
retry the packets which are seen here

946
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:41,930
they made the whole path with one retry

947
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,390
doesn't say which one should you just

948
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,359
count the hops that it took for a given

949
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:49,940
packet to get there and you see that as

950
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:51,680
you go more and more packets there are

951
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,619
less and less packets which add more and

952
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,000
more retries the find since you get two

953
00:43:54,619 --> 00:43:59,950
packets here I don't see if you can see

954
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:03,170
the blue dot this packet experienced 15

955
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:05,509
transmissions the more transmissions the

956
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,540
more spectrum the Mohan Archie blah and

957
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:10,849
now does that translate into benefits if

958
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:14,029
we actually do replication at the

959
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:17,359
ingress but no retry which is this curve

960
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:19,099
here in this curve we have scheduled

961
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,650
every transmission that's why we have an

962
00:44:19,099 --> 00:44:23,119
integral a number of transmissions

963
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:24,619
always the same so there are ten

964
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,020
transmissions to cover all this thing

965
00:44:24,619 --> 00:44:29,000
with replication and elimination so that

966
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,190
was a schedule with Austin transmissions

967
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,349
and obviously all the packets that made

968
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,150
it made it was exactly ten transmission

969
00:44:33,349 --> 00:44:37,300
that's what we call bounded latency

970
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:41,150
through scheduling that's exactly that

971
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,950
now the packets which are a kind of

972
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:45,589
minus 1 of the packet which never made

973
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:47,060
it we also condemn all right so you see

974
00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:49,460
that the number of packets never made it

975
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:51,200
on this network in particular this time

976
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,540
because we placed an object in the

977
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:55,310
middle only we put away do ten I don't

978
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:57,080
remember what we did but we just

979
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,839
prevented the transmission for a small

980
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,348
time a small amount of time so basically

981
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,390
what does that

982
00:45:01,349 --> 00:45:05,460
first this tells us that if you just

983
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:07,920
have one half you don't have a viability

984
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,450
right because you lost so many packets

985
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:11,990
at this time the network was not

986
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:15,629
available you cannot build a safety

987
00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:19,919
network with that serial design that's

988
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:21,359
one thing second thing that down here so

989
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,430
second thing that this tells us is

990
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,308
compare those two curves so the red path

991
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:28,649
the blue path and the deterministic path

992
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:29,400
you realize that most of the time hot

993
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,599
potato

994
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:37,740
does better latency than determinism and

995
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:40,290
that's actually a very classical result

996
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,270
if you look at t-t-tech the old

997
00:45:40,290 --> 00:45:44,279
presentation they made forever they

998
00:45:42,270 --> 00:45:46,829
showed you this this bell curve which

999
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,680
never really ends compared to the spike

1000
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:52,170
of the deterministic traffic so when you

1001
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,348
schedule stuff to deterministically

1002
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:56,790
deliver at a certain time what is not

1003
00:45:55,349 --> 00:45:58,500
deterministic is the amount of packets

1004
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:59,910
that are that are delivered but you can

1005
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,819
literally say the packets will be

1006
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:05,069
delivered there or not and so you see

1007
00:46:02,819 --> 00:46:07,440
that actually the packets have a higher

1008
00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:09,480
latency which is not too good you also

1009
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,520
see that in terms of flow so this is the

1010
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,589
count of -1 so this is the count of loss

1011
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,210
you realize that there are more or less

1012
00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:17,750
on the red path because we did this

1013
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:21,530
interaction but in a more normal network

1014
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:23,849
sending the packet twice all over versus

1015
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:26,160
even with some replication elimination

1016
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:29,250
here versus doing the air who actually

1017
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,859
the air queue was more efficient so if

1018
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:33,990
you just cared about reliability most of

1019
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:38,400
the time you realize that a single path

1020
00:46:33,990 --> 00:46:39,930
with a RQ is actually more more a bit of

1021
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,450
latency most of the time and is more

1022
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:44,460
reliable so we are not necessarily

1023
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:46,649
talking when we build this return path

1024
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:49,980
we are not necessarily talking about

1025
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:52,099
improving the latency or improving the

1026
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:54,390
reliability we are talking about a

1027
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:57,299
viability only we are talking about

1028
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,828
safety applications and the most safe

1029
00:46:57,299 --> 00:47:00,480
you want to be the more this path you're

1030
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:03,329
gonna get and the more energy you're

1031
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,540
gonna waste because you waste 10 energy

1032
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:08,520
units per packet sure you just use 4 so

1033
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,440
you see that even in terms of energy the

1034
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,270
replication elimination game is not a

1035
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:14,850
sufficient for most packet as just

1036
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:16,500
standing about single path and retries

1037
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,200
what you really care when you be on this

1038
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,700
is safety right and you realize that

1039
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,180
you're wasting energy and you're wasting

1040
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,009
time so that three minutes that's that's

1041
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,720
when you want to do better than that

1042
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,640
and now you see the raw prompt the raw

1043
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:32,310
Prime Minister how can i what can I do

1044
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:34,650
to get this green curve to the left to

1045
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:38,070
get this blue curve down so that it

1046
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:41,010
matches pretty much something here how

1047
00:47:38,070 --> 00:47:42,780
to avoid the waste of energy and a waste

1048
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:45,090
of manual that you can see here and

1049
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:47,640
still provide the viability that you

1050
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:49,740
care about and I will not have time for

1051
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:51,629
both slides but I can at least tell you

1052
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:58,799
what we can do for energy saving just an

1053
00:47:51,630 --> 00:48:00,720
example so what we we do here is so that

1054
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,030
we have a draught that beer so feel free

1055
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,910
to to visit that draft and basically the

1056
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:07,530
bit the beer Trappe size you put some

1057
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:10,649
bits in the packet to say which of those

1058
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:12,510
segments you're going to use and when

1059
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,730
you do elimination when you to

1060
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:17,160
transmission you use reset the bit on

1061
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,410
the on the hop that that means the hope

1062
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:22,230
that you use its beauty on the other

1063
00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:25,230
hand when you do elimination you end the

1064
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:26,790
bit mass that you got if you think about

1065
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:30,090
it that leads to the fact that when the

1066
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,770
packet arrives in the end if a bit is

1067
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:36,150
not reset it means that transmission

1068
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:38,520
failed so now you can observe if you set

1069
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,900
all the bits at the ingress tarika

1070
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,580
theoretically the packet should go

1071
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,810
through all the segments and all the

1072
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,549
bits should be reset if the packet

1073
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:46,259
arrives with all be set at the ingress

1074
00:48:44,550 --> 00:48:48,450
if the packet arrives at the egress with

1075
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:52,410
some bit not set that's a map of what

1076
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:54,210
didn't work so what you do is you send

1077
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:56,250
some packets with the full bit map and

1078
00:48:54,210 --> 00:49:01,110
that's the packet that you see here

1079
00:48:56,250 --> 00:49:04,550
all those packets took 16 17 I go

1080
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:09,300
straight from here less than 12 13 oh

1081
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:11,310
you need 1100 units of energy and also

1082
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,790
units of time because they want through

1083
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:16,950
all this path but you see that most

1084
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:19,050
packet did not because once we've done

1085
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:20,850
that we have a map that we can use so we

1086
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:23,190
just set the bit of the segment's that

1087
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:26,009
we really want to use one does allows

1088
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:28,350
there is a signal back to so saying a in

1089
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:30,630
order to avoid follows in a row

1090
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:32,490
please set all the bits against which

1091
00:49:30,630 --> 00:49:36,870
increases a lot of reliability of your

1092
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:39,419
packet and by doing this feedback we can

1093
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,640
see that most of the packets take a

1094
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:43,320
minimum number of hops sometimes your

1095
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,350
hands here we went around a certain

1096
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:51,210
prime by rerouting and then back to the

1097
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:53,069
to the least energy path I have one more

1098
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:56,010
minute so I can just show you the result

1099
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:58,830
so in in dark green that's when you do

1100
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,710
for replication you realize that you

1101
00:49:58,830 --> 00:50:03,779
have a better reliability you get more

1102
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:06,180
packets through but the cost of energies

1103
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:08,190
is twice but because of the feedback

1104
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,779
loop we can avoid the losses in a row

1105
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:12,930
because you see there is never for us in

1106
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:15,450
a row so you see the game by this is

1107
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:17,430
just one method of tuning the use of the

1108
00:50:15,450 --> 00:50:20,390
network so we consume less energy and

1109
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:22,620
still we we stay within the the bonded

1110
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:26,790
latency because we are still little

1111
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:29,040
mystically scheduled and number of loss

1112
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:31,830
in the ROM that's just to illustrate

1113
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:33,720
that there are ways to achieve the row

1114
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:37,250
thing and there is no slide if you care

1115
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,250
to look at it and what I've time for it

1116
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:45,779
question you know sir hi I'm rokosz a

1117
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:48,029
question first to the chairs before

1118
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,250
diving in do you want to have

1119
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:52,710
reflections and discussion now or at the

1120
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,300
very end after the process we have time

1121
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:57,090
for discussion later so if there's some

1122
00:50:54,300 --> 00:51:00,510
verifying questions now that we could

1123
00:50:57,090 --> 00:51:02,370
take some okay well I guess I have a

1124
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:04,170
longer comment so maybe then should I

1125
00:51:02,370 --> 00:51:06,150
come back to discuss yeah that might be

1126
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:19,200
better tea if it's more open-ended do it

1127
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:26,780
during the discussion so turn - are you

1128
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:29,370
ready to promote present remotely as

1129
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:30,990
everybody saw in the blue sheets there's

1130
00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:34,880
one circling still back there somewhere

1131
00:51:30,990 --> 00:51:34,879
about and I have one here

1132
00:51:46,829 --> 00:51:52,780
Ganesh if you can hear us I think you

1133
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:56,369
have to click some sort of I wish to

1134
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:59,980
present button in your meat echo client

1135
00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:21,369
and did you do that we can't do much

1136
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:30,069
from this end yeah let's give it a let's

1137
00:52:21,369 --> 00:52:31,599
give it a minute and see we can hear you

1138
00:52:30,069 --> 00:52:34,329
unless you have to ask to enter the

1139
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:42,040
queue and then you get complete control

1140
00:52:34,329 --> 00:52:44,170
at that point your volume is very low

1141
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,790
can you turn up your microphone if

1142
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:56,020
there's somebody from me to go on this

1143
00:52:45,790 --> 00:53:02,079
can they assist him a little bit better

1144
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:03,069
can you go louder again that's that's

1145
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,710
much better thank you

1146
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:10,869
okay I may end up you now if just just

1147
00:53:08,710 --> 00:53:15,900
go ahead and shout next slide and I will

1148
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:15,900
press the button for you okay hold on

1149
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:22,480
okay yeah you should have controlled

1150
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:22,930
interesting yeah I'm not seeing my

1151
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,059
screen

1152
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,460
am i it's light so are you are you

1153
00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:29,020
presenting the first one are you showing

1154
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:33,490
the title slide now do you want the

1155
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:36,690
first slide they go okay yeah I'm not

1156
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,689
seeing I'm not seeing it sliding

1157
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:50,460
apparently you may have a slide button

1158
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:50,460
you can press okay thank you

1159
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:57,770
can still hear me loud and clear so

1160
00:53:54,590 --> 00:54:01,070
following up on Pascal's introduction I

1161
00:53:57,770 --> 00:54:05,030
am basically going to talk about how a

1162
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:07,420
two 2.11 can enable the goals that we

1163
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:12,650
have for reliable and available networks

1164
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:15,680
specifically a two 2.11 ax that's

1165
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:19,400
wrapping up now and the new project 802

1166
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:23,740
the 11 B E that's building on the

1167
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:26,620
features that 11 ax has and adds more

1168
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:30,410
features that would enable us to be a

1169
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:35,080
viable medium for pension scheme

1170
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:35,080
networking next slide please

1171
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:41,600
so the next couple slides are basically

1172
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:46,630
slides that are introducing how a 22.1

1173
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:48,710
is structured and how it can exist in

1174
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:53,380
simultaneously with other 802

1175
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:57,230
technologies like a 22.1 and

1176
00:54:53,380 --> 00:55:02,090
interoperate with but multiple media at

1177
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:04,240
the same time how go to the next slide

1178
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,240
please

1179
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:12,740
okay so this slide shows a feature of a

1180
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:15,740
two 2.11 called a two 2.11 s it's a mesh

1181
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:17,720
network that actually allows multiple a

1182
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:21,200
to 2.11 nodes to be connected to each

1183
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:23,779
other and establish pads sometimes in

1184
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:26,960
redundant paths to enable packets

1185
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:31,130
originating from 1-800 to 11 node to

1186
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:35,950
reach the destined node by traversing

1187
00:55:31,130 --> 00:55:39,860
across multiple 802 11 nodes you may

1188
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:43,040
also hear multiple uses of the term mesh

1189
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:45,440
this one a two 2.11 s which is the

1190
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:48,560
standard mesh but most implementations

1191
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,300
have diverged from the standard mesh and

1192
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,210
created their own proprietary versions

1193
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:55,190
so the term much is a little bit

1194
00:55:52,210 --> 00:55:57,310
non-standard at this point next slide

1195
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:57,310
please

1196
00:55:57,640 --> 00:56:01,359
so this

1197
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,480
slide that has been around for quite a

1198
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:07,960
while it talks about how a 22.1 and a

1199
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:13,720
211 can coexist and extend the time

1200
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:15,370
sensitive features of a 22.1 to 811 that

1201
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:17,169
doesn't come automatically there has to

1202
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:20,740
be a lot of work that s but that needs

1203
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:22,150
to be done in a two 2.11 domain some of

1204
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:24,100
them are already part of the standard so

1205
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:26,670
we can leverage them and some of them

1206
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:29,980
need to be worked on in future a to 211

1207
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:34,150
projects some probably in coordination

1208
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:36,510
with the IDF raw to ensure that the

1209
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:41,610
requirements that raw comes up with are

1210
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:41,610
supplanted with features in 802 dot 11

1211
00:56:42,090 --> 00:56:46,410
the best

1212
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:49,799
before the the challenge with wireless

1213
00:56:46,410 --> 00:56:53,459
is the the link capacity is not constant

1214
00:56:49,799 --> 00:56:57,719
and changes quite frequently because of

1215
00:56:53,459 --> 00:57:00,269
interference and noise and so the

1216
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:03,539
adjustments for reservations made

1217
00:57:00,269 --> 00:57:05,999
end-to-end to cope with these with a

1218
00:57:03,539 --> 00:57:07,920
changing capacity of the link is it's

1219
00:57:05,999 --> 00:57:10,738
probably what we should try and address

1220
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:17,180
in order to be able to provide reliable

1221
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:17,180
and available service next slide please

1222
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:23,759
so this is a map of different a 22.1

1223
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:27,089
specifications that are already out

1224
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:29,910
there and it tries to show you where a

1225
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:32,009
to 2.11 needs to do more work for

1226
00:57:29,910 --> 00:57:34,049
example time synchronization a to 2.11

1227
00:57:32,009 --> 00:57:36,900
already has a couple of protocols that

1228
00:57:34,049 --> 00:57:40,459
can work with e 2.1 s and provide time

1229
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:43,170
synchronization in the wireless network

1230
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:47,459
and the same is true of interoperating

1231
00:57:43,170 --> 00:57:49,619
with 8 or 2.1 we have a two 2.11 AAA

1232
00:57:47,459 --> 00:57:51,779
that provides the stream reservation

1233
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:54,329
protocol that ensures that you can make

1234
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:57,420
a reservation from end to end and also

1235
00:57:54,329 --> 00:58:03,209
equal to 11 a k' that provides bridging

1236
00:57:57,420 --> 00:58:04,859
feature for 802 11 networks for bounded

1237
00:58:03,209 --> 00:58:05,569
low latency we have some features in

1238
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:08,339
lemon ax

1239
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:10,739
but that they may not satisfy all

1240
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:13,160
requirements and some extends are being

1241
00:58:10,739 --> 00:58:16,289
worked on in 11 b e that provides

1242
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:18,390
bounded low latency and the same is true

1243
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:20,459
for ultra our reliability we do have

1244
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:22,890
some reliability coming out of lovin ax

1245
00:58:20,459 --> 00:58:24,419
that hat that can be improved by new

1246
00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:29,999
features that have been discussed in 11

1247
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:31,799
b e so what we try to show here is that

1248
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:34,680
we have a bunch of a to 2.1 TSN

1249
00:58:31,799 --> 00:58:36,660
standards and this already work being

1250
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:39,690
done and incorporated in the dot 11

1251
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:41,969
standard that can quote work together

1252
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:44,489
with not one and this already worked

1253
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:48,809
going on in the current projects that

1254
00:58:44,489 --> 00:58:50,339
will further enable 811 to be a good

1255
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:52,160
participant in our time-sensitive

1256
00:58:50,339 --> 00:58:55,430
network network

1257
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,430
next slide please

1258
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:02,629
this is a slide showing of what we can't

1259
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,460
do with what we have with lemony eggs at

1260
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:07,880
this point

1261
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:12,380
lemon eggs is also known as Wi-Fi six so

1262
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:15,020
in in lemon ax and all of the standards

1263
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:17,600
going forward we have this notion of a

1264
00:59:15,020 --> 00:59:20,270
scheduled operation where the AP has

1265
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:21,860
total control over the medium for all

1266
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:25,790
the stations that are associated with

1267
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:27,560
the EP and if the stations have already

1268
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:29,779
indicated the type of traffic that they

1269
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:32,180
anticipate the AP can schedule

1270
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:34,910
transmission times for each of the

1271
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:39,169
stations thereby reducing or eliminating

1272
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:42,040
any need for back off and if you can

1273
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:47,960
eliminate back off you'll eliminate all

1274
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:50,029
a dead that time in the air and maximize

1275
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:53,180
the use of the spectrum to send traffic

1276
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:55,580
that is critical in addition to that we

1277
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:57,770
also have other mechanisms QoS

1278
00:59:55,580 --> 01:00:00,440
mechanisms built three 802 11 where we

1279
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:03,860
can prioritize time-sensitive traffic

1280
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:06,050
over non time-sensitive traffic and make

1281
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:08,510
sure that any queue time sense in

1282
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:13,010
traffic gets the first chance to get out

1283
01:00:08,510 --> 01:00:15,190
of the device so we did some simulation

1284
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:18,590
based on a 2.11

1285
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:21,470
mechanisms and the chart on the right

1286
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:24,200
hand side basically shows you that you

1287
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,959
lower the latency that you want the less

1288
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:30,319
number of stations is what you can serve

1289
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,420
given a specific given a constant

1290
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,820
bandwidth so if you want some more

1291
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:39,190
stations with the same bandwidth then

1292
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:41,720
you will have to relax on the latency

1293
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:43,010
given the same number of reliability so

1294
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:45,189
here we are talking about five nines

1295
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,190
reliability

1296
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:51,080
but this is definitely achievable with

1297
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:53,810
20 megahertz bandwidth in 811 you can

1298
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:59,810
serve up to 45 stations if you use the

1299
01:00:53,810 --> 01:01:02,720
811 X protocol if you're bounded latency

1300
01:00:59,810 --> 01:01:05,900
requirement is 3 3 second 3 milliseconds

1301
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:07,580
or less if you want title latency then

1302
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:12,230
you'll have to sacrifice the number of

1303
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:14,049
stations that you can so next slide

1304
01:01:12,230 --> 01:01:17,450
please

1305
01:01:14,050 --> 01:01:19,070
so this is the a2 2.11 Vee is a new

1306
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,430
project that we are currently working on

1307
01:01:19,070 --> 01:01:26,680
in a two 2.11 and it's building on a two

1308
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:30,379
2.11 ax and trying to bring in other

1309
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:33,529
techniques to make the media more

1310
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:35,780
available and be more sensitive to

1311
01:01:33,530 --> 01:01:39,260
traffic that's time critical supposed to

1312
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:42,109
pence which is not time critical so

1313
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:44,359
first off as we do in most of the 8 or

1314
01:01:42,109 --> 01:01:45,950
11 projects there are enhancements in

1315
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:49,670
better coding techniques using most

1316
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:51,710
patients frames using wider channels and

1317
01:01:49,670 --> 01:01:53,480
thereby achieving wide ab a higher

1318
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:56,810
throughput so this is just sheer

1319
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:59,720
throughput that again we can go up to

1320
01:01:56,810 --> 01:02:02,570
gigabit per second with these

1321
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:04,910
enhancements in addition to that we are

1322
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:07,160
looking at techniques where the same

1323
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:08,509
station can operate in 2.45 and

1324
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,029
potentially six or seven gigahertz

1325
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:14,359
spectrum so that you have multiple links

1326
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:17,680
between two devices and you can liberate

1327
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:20,660
the fact that if one link becomes noisy

1328
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,720
then you can without the traffic through

1329
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,399
another link they are all able to got 11

1330
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:28,040
links they are not different

1331
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:30,920
technologies but they're same link

1332
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:32,390
operating in different same technology

1333
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:35,900
offsetting operating in different bands

1334
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:39,080
and the third one is trying to

1335
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:40,790
coordinate and see leverage multiple

1336
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:45,140
APIs that are we can radio range of

1337
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:48,680
transmitter and see how how we can

1338
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:51,080
improve reliability by using multiple a

1339
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:54,169
means to route we traffic from one

1340
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:56,950
device to another device and Pascal

1341
01:02:54,170 --> 01:02:59,960
already mentioned the use of hybrid erq

1342
01:02:56,950 --> 01:03:01,879
some mechanisms for using hybrid

1343
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:07,520
you are being talked about in lemon be

1344
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:10,610
as well and the last one is to provide a

1345
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:13,610
new mechanism where channel access to

1346
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:16,490
time I where traffic is prioritized over

1347
01:03:13,610 --> 01:03:20,270
non time away non non time-sensitive

1348
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:23,060
traffic thereby ensuring that egress of

1349
01:03:20,270 --> 01:03:25,759
time-sensitive traffic happens first if

1350
01:03:23,060 --> 01:03:27,890
it happens to be queued at the same time

1351
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,010
in non time-sensitive perfect is also

1352
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:32,299
cute in the same device so all these

1353
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:34,430
mechanisms are being debated right now

1354
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:36,940
they are not completed

1355
01:03:34,430 --> 01:03:43,419
there are various phases of being

1356
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:46,640
specified but our focus by the time we

1357
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:49,730
make progress in draw we can bring in

1358
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:53,240
more requirements from from Raw into

1359
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:57,350
this project and big make sure that a

1360
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:59,600
2.11 satisfies all the requirements to

1361
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:04,400
provide a network wireless network then

1362
01:03:59,600 --> 01:04:06,520
it's reliable and available next slide

1363
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:06,520
please

1364
01:04:07,390 --> 01:04:11,308
okay so this is

1365
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:13,919
a summary of all the all the things that

1366
01:04:11,309 --> 01:04:18,619
we talked about already mentioned that

1367
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:22,339
811 X provides a new mechanism where

1368
01:04:18,619 --> 01:04:24,950
latency and reliability can be

1369
01:04:22,339 --> 01:04:27,690
controlled and achieved

1370
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:30,299
compared to what we used to do in leaven

1371
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:36,599
in the features that were before 11a x11

1372
01:04:30,299 --> 01:04:38,790
AC 11 n and lawyer 1182 - 1180 X and 11

1373
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:40,410
B will also operate in 6 to 7 gigahertz

1374
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:43,740
band wherever it's available it's not

1375
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:45,598
you know still available yet Wow with

1376
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,299
that we have more spectrum which means

1377
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,520
we can combine multiple channels

1378
01:04:48,299 --> 01:04:54,890
together and go up to 320 megahertz

1379
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:59,329
channels that are 320 megahertz wide

1380
01:04:54,890 --> 01:04:59,328
that gives us more opportunity to send

1381
01:05:00,710 --> 01:05:05,180
smaller packets in a shorter time and

1382
01:05:05,329 --> 01:05:13,500
thereby achieve lower latency or higher

1383
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:15,299
reliability and a to 211 B is actually a

1384
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:17,280
natural progression from where we are

1385
01:05:15,299 --> 01:05:20,130
where we complete when we finished in

1386
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,380
Lebanon X and where we want to go beyond

1387
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:25,740
that and this is a good opportunity for

1388
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:31,369
us to inject features from our

1389
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:31,368
requirements from raw into a total mmm

1390
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:35,970
Thank You Ganesh if you just hold their

1391
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:42,109
second record a couple of charts -

1392
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:44,759
microphone hi Ganesh Juan Carlos here

1393
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:48,000
from sick folks just a quick question on

1394
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:51,740
so is the de Mac planning to use

1395
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:59,430
different Feist or just a 6 7 gigahertz

1396
01:05:51,740 --> 01:06:02,118
one from what I know which from what I

1397
01:05:59,430 --> 01:06:05,098
know it's not a different fire it's just

1398
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:10,349
the five given described that can also

1399
01:06:05,099 --> 01:06:12,650
work in six or seven gigahertz okay okay

1400
01:06:10,349 --> 01:06:12,650
thank you

1401
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:19,260
focus hygienist thank you for the

1402
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:23,390
summary I would just like to highlight

1403
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,590
one point every iterate what Ganesh

1404
01:06:23,390 --> 01:06:28,410
mentioned already that there is a work

1405
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:32,370
ongoing in 802 for the integration of

1406
01:06:28,410 --> 01:06:35,129
TSN and EndNote 11 and if we do a good

1407
01:06:32,370 --> 01:06:37,380
job one way to look at it that we get a

1408
01:06:35,130 --> 01:06:39,960
NATO to learn including wireless LAN and

1409
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:41,940
viola line components that is the subnet

1410
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:46,400
technology or can be used as a subnet

1411
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:46,400
for that net like a seamless fashion

1412
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:52,169
thank you thank you very much

1413
01:06:50,460 --> 01:07:15,600
Ganesh we'll move on to the next

1414
01:06:52,170 --> 01:07:18,510
presenter so actually we get a draft to

1415
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:21,089
help the ITF user discover this

1416
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:27,540
technology and other technologies so we

1417
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:29,340
have so actually we we have at least

1418
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:30,840
four technologies which already

1419
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:33,330
discussed in the draft well actually

1420
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:36,200
five g's a bit late but we so we have

1421
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:39,330
text from Dave and and Ganesh about the

1422
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:44,310
extensions of Wi-Fi from my face six

1423
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:48,090
beyond we've got 1540s eh which was used

1424
01:07:44,310 --> 01:07:52,110
the ATF for six - and we are also taxed

1425
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:53,760
on L Dax which is an avionics technology

1426
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:57,540
for air-to-air and air-to-ground

1427
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,890
deterministic transmissions and so

1428
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:00,890
basically what we want to illustrate

1429
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:04,470
here is that we are not trying to solve

1430
01:08:00,890 --> 01:08:06,330
Prime on links which don't exist but

1431
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:11,250
there are actually multiple efforts in

1432
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:16,380
multiple domains where the RO technology

1433
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:19,319
can become useful and basically what we

1434
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:21,510
have done now is allow 3 abstractions

1435
01:08:19,319 --> 01:08:23,939
which allow us to to cap all those

1436
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:27,350
things and beyond a network which is a

1437
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:27,349
composite of different technologies

1438
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,950
so we have knee LCL actually

1439
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,810
participates who development of held

1440
01:08:31,950 --> 01:08:36,330
acts if you could tell us if she world's

1441
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:38,010
about her legs yeah hello everyone this

1442
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:41,340
is a new tomorrow from the German

1443
01:08:38,010 --> 01:08:43,320
Aerospace Center so let me briefly talk

1444
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:45,840
a little bit about what's going on in

1445
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:48,029
the communication section for

1446
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:50,970
aeronautical communication so everyone

1447
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:53,399
using a plane today mainly relies on

1448
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:54,840
analog voice communication for safety

1449
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:58,290
relevant communication

1450
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:59,819
this is currently changing so there's a

1451
01:08:58,290 --> 01:09:01,560
future communication infrastructure

1452
01:08:59,819 --> 01:09:03,509
coming up for there are several

1453
01:09:01,560 --> 01:09:06,270
technologies discussed such as air omics

1454
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:08,220
for airport communications LDX for a

1455
01:09:06,270 --> 01:09:10,640
terrestrial air ground communication

1456
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:13,350
also air-to-air communication and

1457
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:15,570
satellite communication for sonic Poland

1458
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:19,830
remote regions so we have a multi-link

1459
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:24,299
system via multiple hops data needs to

1460
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:26,370
travel finally to the aircraft and so we

1461
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,920
from the German Aerospace Center husband

1462
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:31,170
have been working for 15 years now an LD

1463
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:34,050
X so the most important part to

1464
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:35,730
understand here is data travels via

1465
01:09:34,050 --> 01:09:38,700
different technologies via different

1466
01:09:35,729 --> 01:09:40,459
hops and needs to reach the end user so

1467
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:43,590
the aircraft in a certain amount of time

1468
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:46,620
reliably and this is why we think role

1469
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:49,550
is very important here for our work and

1470
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:52,979
we can contribute with that technology

1471
01:09:49,550 --> 01:09:54,990
so many thanks Niels so we have actually

1472
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:57,000
uploaded a set of slides which won't be

1473
01:09:54,990 --> 01:10:00,240
presented today that came from nails and

1474
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,920
so if you go through to the agenda and

1475
01:10:00,240 --> 01:10:03,690
the list of documents now available with

1476
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:05,340
the agenda you will find actually some

1477
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:07,290
slides and index there is also a

1478
01:10:05,340 --> 01:10:10,680
separate document which is published to

1479
01:10:07,290 --> 01:10:12,690
the row list of documents and that is

1480
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:15,300
pacific-12 duck so you have both the

1481
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:17,400
section arnold acts in the technology

1482
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:21,180
document plus a separate document in the

1483
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:26,280
attacks menu thanks you want to talk

1484
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:32,040
about the draft that's not a bit sorry

1485
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:34,700
the other jobs but it's up it's right

1486
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,700
right after this

1487
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:47,000
so it sorry any questions on this

1488
01:10:44,980 --> 01:10:48,469
since Pascal said there is some

1489
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,820
additional sites that people want to

1490
01:10:48,470 --> 01:11:01,700
find out more about the el dark side of

1491
01:10:49,820 --> 01:11:05,809
things no the chair slides no it's it's

1492
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:23,990
the next thing that's up go down drafts

1493
01:11:05,810 --> 01:11:26,390
discussion it starts with a yes okay so

1494
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:29,389
just to destroy there's quite a bit of

1495
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:31,490
work which has already started through

1496
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:32,570
the row mailing list and so we've got

1497
01:11:31,490 --> 01:11:35,059
all those documents which are already

1498
01:11:32,570 --> 01:11:36,920
available we've got so carol has

1499
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:39,560
presented the use cases there is a full

1500
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,150
draft with many use cases in there we've

1501
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:43,670
got the technology trust I just

1502
01:11:41,150 --> 01:11:45,019
discussed about and we'll publish more

1503
01:11:43,670 --> 01:11:46,610
on 5g very soon

1504
01:11:45,020 --> 01:11:48,200
I don't know maybe we'll also include

1505
01:11:46,610 --> 01:11:50,389
Bluetooth because there are interesting

1506
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:52,300
work there is interesting work for a row

1507
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:54,980
properties of a Bluetooth Low Energy

1508
01:11:52,300 --> 01:11:57,320
we've got the draft Benny else about

1509
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,940
airbags so that's all the Jarek

1510
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:01,910
information about the lower layer that

1511
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:03,710
we can use for raw then we've get the

1512
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:05,410
problem statement that I presented we've

1513
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:08,030
got a requirement document by Joe Joe's

1514
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:09,650
no time today to present it that's quite

1515
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:11,480
interesting so please go through it and

1516
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:14,000
we have a beginning requirement actually

1517
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:15,799
for the kind of OAM information that

1518
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,840
we'd like to get to be able to measure

1519
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:19,580
this particular small network that you

1520
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:23,900
are building that the routing is

1521
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:26,840
building for us no sir

1522
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:29,509
not surprisingly the work at row is

1523
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,950
expected to span to trigger some work

1524
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:33,340
another working group well the

1525
01:12:30,950 --> 01:12:35,929
specialist to solve a particle prime oh

1526
01:12:33,340 --> 01:12:39,470
we already have a draft which is

1527
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:42,680
actually in the solution space for row

1528
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:45,380
which is being pushed at row for

1529
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:50,090
enabling a complex truck using ripple

1530
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:52,700
and we also have a beer Qi draft at beer

1531
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:54,769
so the goal is yes we inherit from man a

1532
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:57,179
winner it from that net

1533
01:12:54,769 --> 01:12:59,669
we understand our prime because we have

1534
01:12:57,179 --> 01:13:02,459
allies people but decisions are not

1535
01:12:59,669 --> 01:13:04,860
necessarily to be built within Roe once

1536
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:07,019
we can express the prime then we can go

1537
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:08,459
to a particular working group and work

1538
01:13:07,019 --> 01:13:10,530
with the experts of that working group

1539
01:13:08,459 --> 01:13:12,119
to actually solve that component that

1540
01:13:10,530 --> 01:13:15,259
Road needs that's how we see the work

1541
01:13:12,119 --> 01:13:15,259
and it has already started

1542
01:13:18,829 --> 01:13:38,579
Thank You Pascal so time to get into the

1543
01:13:34,919 --> 01:13:40,829
discussion and and the Charter so let me

1544
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:42,329
talk for a few minutes so so both of us

1545
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:44,340
as chairs haven't been involved in this

1546
01:13:42,329 --> 01:13:47,398
work so we sort of came in new to this

1547
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:49,380
well starting about a month ago and we

1548
01:13:47,399 --> 01:13:51,449
said okay what this is can you explain

1549
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:53,099
it to us and as we were discussing we

1550
01:13:51,449 --> 01:13:55,348
sort of came up with well this was the

1551
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:56,820
most complex simplest picture that we

1552
01:13:55,349 --> 01:14:00,360
could come up with saying this is how

1553
01:13:56,820 --> 01:14:02,938
actually is how what Rob brings to the

1554
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:05,280
table is this notion that you have

1555
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:09,090
various paths that are computed by a PCE

1556
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:11,280
somewhere and you might get some metrics

1557
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:14,579
from some existing ways of measuring

1558
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,679
metrics of different radios and and then

1559
01:14:14,579 --> 01:14:18,659
you need to be able to select as you

1560
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,059
forward pockets where am I going to send

1561
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:22,648
things this this millisecond I as

1562
01:14:21,059 --> 01:14:25,260
opposed to next millisecond when

1563
01:14:22,649 --> 01:14:26,399
something might have changed so that was

1564
01:14:25,260 --> 01:14:28,559
our very sort of simplistic

1565
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,959
understanding of what what we're trying

1566
01:14:28,559 --> 01:14:33,119
to do here and and sort of like we

1567
01:14:30,959 --> 01:14:35,188
haven't done this past election engine

1568
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:37,679
type thing in anywhere else in the past

1569
01:14:35,189 --> 01:14:39,869
we assumed that you can compute these

1570
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,849
paths and they say stable for the time

1571
01:14:39,869 --> 01:14:43,860
scale of routing so this was what Pascal

1572
01:14:41,849 --> 01:14:45,389
was talking about earlier so that was

1573
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:47,398
sort of us as chairs trying to

1574
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:50,300
understand you know what's the big

1575
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:55,380
picture here of how this stuff fits in

1576
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:57,360
and next you know before we get into the

1577
01:14:55,380 --> 01:15:00,209
discussion I will pull up parts of the

1578
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:02,880
proposed charter so you can go read this

1579
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:05,159
stuff yourself there's three pages here

1580
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,260
of background texts giving the context

1581
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:09,199
which is what we talked about during the

1582
01:15:07,260 --> 01:15:11,449
ball today

1583
01:15:09,199 --> 01:15:14,120
and then the key thing that I would like

1584
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:17,150
to leave up here is the set of proposed

1585
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:20,030
charter work items so now the floor is

1586
01:15:17,150 --> 01:15:21,500
open for discussion whether it's about

1587
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:23,630
the work items whether it's about

1588
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:27,110
understanding the problem statement and

1589
01:15:23,630 --> 01:15:31,030
scope of the stuff so force yours

1590
01:15:27,110 --> 01:15:31,030
hi Lou Berger can you go back one slide

1591
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:37,400
that one thanks I guess you skipped over

1592
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:39,140
a bunch I jumped up when I heard you say

1593
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:42,170
we've never done this path selection

1594
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:44,090
thing so as I understand it there's a

1595
01:15:42,170 --> 01:15:49,070
couple of different aspects of the

1596
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:52,130
problem one of the things you're trying

1597
01:15:49,070 --> 01:15:53,690
to do is to do a fast forwarding

1598
01:15:52,130 --> 01:15:55,489
decision right well one problem is is a

1599
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:56,839
better informed path computation based

1600
01:15:55,489 --> 01:15:59,150
on what's happening at the RF layer

1601
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,739
that's not this one this is you want to

1602
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:04,040
do a better forwarding decision based on

1603
01:16:00,739 --> 01:16:06,349
what's happening at the RF layer we do

1604
01:16:04,040 --> 01:16:09,170
all sorts of forwarding decisions in the

1605
01:16:06,350 --> 01:16:11,120
ITF based on all sorts of information

1606
01:16:09,170 --> 01:16:12,320
from the link layer so saying we've

1607
01:16:11,120 --> 01:16:14,840
never done that before I think are a

1608
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,610
huge overstatement yeah this is the

1609
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:19,100
chairs poor understanding of the system

1610
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:21,290
so let me preface it by that again but

1611
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:30,980
yes as you say it I say oh yeah fast

1612
01:16:21,290 --> 01:16:35,210
three rods sir in that net we do pre off

1613
01:16:30,980 --> 01:16:38,509
which is we do an ale DUP version in the

1614
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:41,210
debt net definition there's allowance

1615
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:44,179
for other forms like exactly this one

1616
01:16:41,210 --> 01:16:46,880
whether it be Network coding or as

1617
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:49,219
Pascal said or something that we

1618
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:51,409
previously haven't talked about which is

1619
01:16:49,219 --> 01:16:53,540
maybe doing a fording decision based on

1620
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:56,960
the RF layer telling you which of your

1621
01:16:53,540 --> 01:16:59,719
available links are have low have higher

1622
01:16:56,960 --> 01:17:01,640
probability of delivery that that is

1623
01:16:59,719 --> 01:17:04,040
something that that's new but this type

1624
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:05,840
of thing we have a long history of do

1625
01:17:04,040 --> 01:17:08,989
anything if' and we even have working

1626
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:11,570
groups that fits in its charter okay

1627
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:13,879
yeah so we were a bit confused so at

1628
01:17:11,570 --> 01:17:17,019
least I was confused in terms of not

1629
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:19,130
having done this before sorry about that

1630
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,780
following on from that

1631
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:23,480
Rick Tyler following on from that point

1632
01:17:20,780 --> 01:17:25,730
Lou there were lots of we could we might

1633
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:29,780
the particularly concerning work in debt

1634
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:32,150
net the reality as I understand it is

1635
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:35,509
that debt net has plenty of work to do

1636
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:38,059
and isn't hugely interested in looking

1637
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:40,420
at this fairly niche case from their

1638
01:17:38,060 --> 01:17:44,780
perspective of wireless networks and

1639
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:46,490
part of this off is trying to determine

1640
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:48,259
whether there is sufficient interest to

1641
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:51,650
do this work in a working group of its

1642
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:52,880
own or whether everyone who is

1643
01:17:51,650 --> 01:17:55,309
interested here goes and sits in the

1644
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,240
back of debt net and takes and and does

1645
01:17:55,310 --> 01:18:01,460
that work in that group or many or

1646
01:17:58,240 --> 01:18:04,639
elsewhere see cap or so you can I mean

1647
01:18:01,460 --> 01:18:06,140
it is C camp so light on work and does C

1648
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:09,140
camp have the interest to do this work

1649
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:11,180
that is one of those open questions yeah

1650
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:12,590
it's it's a reasonable question in terms

1651
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:14,090
of the point about that net being

1652
01:18:12,590 --> 01:18:16,790
overloaded we're wrapping up the core

1653
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:18,530
forwarding plane documents by the way

1654
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,750
which includes the protection mechanism

1655
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,250
a pre often you know maybe we have a new

1656
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:23,360
protection mechanism that comes in that

1657
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:25,730
could be applicable to multiple

1658
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,559
technologies because there's no reason

1659
01:18:25,730 --> 01:18:29,780
why you have to limit the I'm sorry

1660
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:31,820
harro I don't remember the new acronym

1661
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:33,679
you don't necessarily have to limit that

1662
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:36,559
just to wireless networks that can see

1663
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:40,160
applicability elsewhere you know so do

1664
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:41,870
we have time well we're wrapping up and

1665
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:45,080
probably gonna do reach are during it

1666
01:18:41,870 --> 01:18:46,849
the next IETF so maybe there's time

1667
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:50,540
there is it the right place that's a

1668
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:53,450
different question and C camp has

1669
01:18:50,540 --> 01:18:56,390
historically done where we have the

1670
01:18:53,450 --> 01:18:58,490
layered network model and doing traffic

1671
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:00,800
engineering over different layers that's

1672
01:18:58,490 --> 01:19:03,830
C campus nothing in the home for that

1673
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:05,660
you do end up in in those groups having

1674
01:19:03,830 --> 01:19:07,580
a set of people that sit around board

1675
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,660
while you know that their their optical

1676
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,430
people they really don't care about

1677
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:12,400
hearing about microwaves and vice versa

1678
01:19:10,430 --> 01:19:15,290
so you have some people sitting around

1679
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:16,509
is that the right you know where's the

1680
01:19:15,290 --> 01:19:18,560
right place I don't know that's not

1681
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:22,970
really my call that's more for the

1682
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:24,500
eighties just to add to that Pascale

1683
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,570
made it abundantly clear that a lot of

1684
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:28,370
these problems do inherit from debt net

1685
01:19:26,570 --> 01:19:30,679
so there's you know we're not claiming

1686
01:19:28,370 --> 01:19:34,330
this is new and unique in that sort of

1687
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:34,330
you know there's a parental

1688
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:43,759
okay so now two aspects to this the

1689
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:48,820
first aspect is we care to receive in

1690
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:51,769
this group if we format a crowd which is

1691
01:19:48,820 --> 01:19:53,389
widely interested in specialized in

1692
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:56,510
Wireless proms to make sure that those

1693
01:19:53,389 --> 01:19:58,070
Prime's are already considered and the

1694
01:19:56,510 --> 01:20:00,169
type of discussion that have happened so

1695
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:04,009
far that net would not attract that kind

1696
01:20:00,169 --> 01:20:07,129
of crowd so if we if we kind of plan to

1697
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:09,139
do it within bed net and would want to

1698
01:20:07,129 --> 01:20:10,969
avoid boring people in the room and for

1699
01:20:09,139 --> 01:20:13,609
the population the wireless all the way

1700
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:15,169
of health then we would end up in doing

1701
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:16,849
like two sessions you know without the

1702
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:20,898
wireless session in the world session

1703
01:20:16,849 --> 01:20:22,340
and so in the end I mean we we could

1704
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:24,590
also do a single working room for the

1705
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:27,739
Hawaii effort I think that the idea of

1706
01:20:24,590 --> 01:20:29,149
splitting things into domains and areas

1707
01:20:27,739 --> 01:20:31,039
and working groups are supposed to

1708
01:20:29,149 --> 01:20:33,409
having one big workgroup meeting the

1709
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:36,349
whole week although it is due all right

1710
01:20:33,409 --> 01:20:38,570
I mean I'm not saying it's wrong is that

1711
01:20:36,349 --> 01:20:41,570
we can actually focus on one particular

1712
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:42,978
thing and and then what's great is we

1713
01:20:41,570 --> 01:20:44,869
can actually interact with the other

1714
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:47,209
working groups and andro will certainly

1715
01:20:44,869 --> 01:20:50,509
interact a lot with that net and could

1716
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:53,059
even be pushing some you know extensions

1717
01:20:50,510 --> 01:20:55,579
to some models that did met or see Campa

1718
01:20:53,059 --> 01:20:57,649
actually defining so that we are sure

1719
01:20:55,579 --> 01:20:59,090
that you know the raw requirements are

1720
01:20:57,649 --> 01:21:01,340
being served doesn't mean that

1721
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:03,229
everything has to be handled as ro but

1722
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:06,530
it means that the congregation of people

1723
01:21:03,229 --> 01:21:09,079
that would be meeting would would

1724
01:21:06,530 --> 01:21:12,709
actually have its own space to discuss

1725
01:21:09,079 --> 01:21:14,629
and and within a group of people who

1726
01:21:12,709 --> 01:21:16,760
understand each other uses some term and

1727
01:21:14,629 --> 01:21:19,309
talk about the same thing so that's just

1728
01:21:16,760 --> 01:21:21,409
to make the meetings more useful the

1729
01:21:19,309 --> 01:21:23,959
other thing is I was there from

1730
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:26,839
inception in that net and we helped

1731
01:21:23,959 --> 01:21:29,300
create it I hope and it was my goal to

1732
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:33,139
three years ago to get this sort of

1733
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:35,530
discussion within that net and I pushed

1734
01:21:33,139 --> 01:21:37,959
and pushed and been there and tried and

1735
01:21:35,530 --> 01:21:41,119
the bottom line you have seen the world

1736
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:44,030
wireless come in go away come in go away

1737
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:46,709
just like well as link does

1738
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:48,209
because that was never really the

1739
01:21:46,709 --> 01:21:49,679
interest of the people in the room I was

1740
01:21:48,209 --> 01:21:53,639
pretty much anyone interested I mean

1741
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:56,249
exaggerating but never managed to get

1742
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:57,959
focus or attention and wireless and I

1743
01:21:56,249 --> 01:21:59,369
you can understand why right now very

1744
01:21:57,959 --> 01:22:01,800
interesting problems to be solved in

1745
01:21:59,369 --> 01:22:04,018
that not in many areas and and you see

1746
01:22:01,800 --> 01:22:06,449
what the work is at this moment that

1747
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:08,039
gives you an idea of what the focus and

1748
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:10,558
what the people are who the people are

1749
01:22:08,039 --> 01:22:12,869
in it is from that's perfectly good it's

1750
01:22:10,559 --> 01:22:14,729
just that if you try to attract radio

1751
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:17,789
people in that same room and you you

1752
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:23,820
hear those discussions why I'm sure I

1753
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:27,209
mean what I'm doing here right so this

1754
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:30,049
is a discussion we've had before many

1755
01:22:27,209 --> 01:22:33,570
times in the traffic engineering world

1756
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:35,189
and in in the sea camp context where you

1757
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:38,188
have lots of different technologies

1758
01:22:35,189 --> 01:22:40,110
where we're trying to apply the the

1759
01:22:38,189 --> 01:22:41,729
Internet control plane the IETF control

1760
01:22:40,110 --> 01:22:44,159
plane to all different types of

1761
01:22:41,729 --> 01:22:46,409
switching that seem apparently have very

1762
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:48,179
little to do with each other and the

1763
01:22:46,409 --> 01:22:51,388
fundamental question is is do we want to

1764
01:22:48,179 --> 01:22:53,459
develop single sets of mechanisms that

1765
01:22:51,389 --> 01:22:56,159
are tailored to particular environments

1766
01:22:53,459 --> 01:22:58,110
or do we want to develop a common tool

1767
01:22:56,159 --> 01:23:00,839
set that can be run over multiple

1768
01:22:58,110 --> 01:23:03,749
network technologies and what we've done

1769
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:05,159
before at least in the routing area and

1770
01:23:03,749 --> 01:23:08,280
I'm particularly talking about C camp

1771
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:10,259
and T's is try to identify what's common

1772
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:12,420
across different technologies so that we

1773
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:14,119
can apply internet technologies no

1774
01:23:12,420 --> 01:23:19,010
matter what we're transmitting over

1775
01:23:14,119 --> 01:23:23,459
whether it be you know white RF

1776
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:25,889
traditional wires we want to have a more

1777
01:23:23,459 --> 01:23:27,749
commonality than not commonality and I

1778
01:23:25,889 --> 01:23:32,579
think that's the question for the ATS

1779
01:23:27,749 --> 01:23:34,769
and for the group is we want to try to

1780
01:23:32,579 --> 01:23:36,570
come up with tailored solutions for

1781
01:23:34,769 --> 01:23:38,909
wireless or do we want to come up with a

1782
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:44,299
solution that uses as much common

1783
01:23:38,909 --> 01:23:44,299
mechanisms across different technologies

1784
01:23:44,389 --> 01:23:51,749
so from a an interest standpoint in debt

1785
01:23:50,219 --> 01:23:53,869
net we've had people that have been

1786
01:23:51,749 --> 01:23:56,818
interested in in wireless from the start

1787
01:23:53,869 --> 01:23:59,398
and you example there was a

1788
01:23:56,819 --> 01:24:00,780
aircraft folks on there's it's been

1789
01:23:59,399 --> 01:24:02,999
mentioned many times and it's always

1790
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:05,639
been let's finish the core technology

1791
01:24:02,999 --> 01:24:07,769
first and then start working on the next

1792
01:24:05,639 --> 01:24:10,249
one so the core technology were pretty

1793
01:24:07,769 --> 01:24:14,939
much done we're just finished last call

1794
01:24:10,249 --> 01:24:17,969
the first layer of technology adaptation

1795
01:24:14,939 --> 01:24:20,159
so mapping debt net to TSN that's coming

1796
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:24,719
along really nicely there's opportunity

1797
01:24:20,159 --> 01:24:26,339
to bring in the next technology I think

1798
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:28,619
I'm not saying that that's the right

1799
01:24:26,339 --> 01:24:33,719
place I think that's you know for others

1800
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:35,938
it aside I understood so first thank you

1801
01:24:33,719 --> 01:24:38,219
for the problem statement draft I think

1802
01:24:35,939 --> 01:24:42,649
that was a step forward compared to

1803
01:24:38,219 --> 01:24:48,659
previous ITF it is still not clear to me

1804
01:24:42,649 --> 01:24:50,280
although so I'm trying to lay out train

1805
01:24:48,659 --> 01:24:53,068
of thoughts for that this comes from

1806
01:24:50,280 --> 01:24:55,429
from that net in the sense of what is

1807
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:58,939
the ultimate goal to provide

1808
01:24:55,429 --> 01:25:01,489
deterministic networking in in combined

1809
01:24:58,939 --> 01:25:04,469
networks of wireless and wireline

1810
01:25:01,489 --> 01:25:07,648
deployments I fully agree that we should

1811
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:09,839
do this and I have the feeling that

1812
01:25:07,649 --> 01:25:12,269
there are gaps that we have to fill in

1813
01:25:09,839 --> 01:25:15,959
so I fully agree with the ultimate goal

1814
01:25:12,269 --> 01:25:19,139
that we should figure out what to do

1815
01:25:15,959 --> 01:25:20,969
what are the gaps and fill the gaps so I

1816
01:25:19,139 --> 01:25:26,010
my understanding that's the ultimate

1817
01:25:20,969 --> 01:25:30,689
goal what we are discussing thinking it

1818
01:25:26,010 --> 01:25:34,260
further based on the layouts of the

1819
01:25:30,689 --> 01:25:36,599
problem statement it goes into the well

1820
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:38,669
that distinguishes two sub layer service

1821
01:25:36,599 --> 01:25:40,979
and forwarding sub layer and this is a

1822
01:25:38,669 --> 01:25:43,889
particular lower layer in the forwarding

1823
01:25:40,979 --> 01:25:47,549
sub layer in my understanding so the gap

1824
01:25:43,889 --> 01:25:49,199
analysis could be as we started in in

1825
01:25:47,549 --> 01:25:51,899
the core technology data pane what is

1826
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:54,539
missing in the data for running server

1827
01:25:51,899 --> 01:25:57,239
here what is really needed to be done in

1828
01:25:54,539 --> 01:26:02,129
support of various wireless technologies

1829
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:04,919
and with that top-down approach that

1830
01:26:02,129 --> 01:26:06,839
could be done in that net in the next

1831
01:26:04,919 --> 01:26:08,699
phase so Wireless has been in scope from

1832
01:26:06,839 --> 01:26:10,260
start it's been in the use cases and we

1833
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:12,659
want to solve it

1834
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:15,929
reading the problem statement draft it's

1835
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:22,980
it to me it was kind of an extensions to

1836
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:26,010
60s really so it was not a generic let's

1837
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:28,468
cover many wireless technologies that is

1838
01:26:26,010 --> 01:26:31,079
the track this directed acyclic graph

1839
01:26:28,469 --> 01:26:33,000
and so on so I my understanding it was

1840
01:26:31,079 --> 01:26:37,400
extension of 60s did not take into

1841
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:40,949
account license back to metal which has

1842
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:46,679
better scheduling and so on different

1843
01:26:40,949 --> 01:26:48,058
different different perspective and from

1844
01:26:46,679 --> 01:26:50,820
the bottom up

1845
01:26:48,059 --> 01:26:52,500
yes sure something needs to be done for

1846
01:26:50,820 --> 01:26:54,360
60s but maybe it's different for the

1847
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:59,130
different different technologies

1848
01:26:54,360 --> 01:27:01,650
furthermore the kind of api's I read as

1849
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:03,960
necessary from the problem statement are

1850
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:05,789
not really supported from the wireless

1851
01:27:03,960 --> 01:27:08,039
technologies this is where D lab can

1852
01:27:05,789 --> 01:27:12,559
help and this was it was good to see

1853
01:27:08,039 --> 01:27:14,809
that that that picture to to expose

1854
01:27:12,559 --> 01:27:18,269
necessary data but my understanding

1855
01:27:14,809 --> 01:27:22,260
neither dot eleven or or far G provides

1856
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:25,739
the api's that immediate what for the

1857
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:29,159
layout of the max of selection in indeed

1858
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:31,678
before running sub layer I don't see for

1859
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:35,730
example how from layer three we could

1860
01:27:31,679 --> 01:27:40,590
influence the hark of five G so this is

1861
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:42,150
a gray area and from what I also add

1862
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:45,869
this is the last sentence and I finish

1863
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:49,530
what I also mentioned before from 802

1864
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:51,480
LAN technologies it is happening the

1865
01:27:49,530 --> 01:27:56,880
integration is happening so we will have

1866
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:59,518
some kind of subnet and 802 subnet for

1867
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:02,340
when it comes to 5g for a GTS an

1868
01:27:59,519 --> 01:28:05,280
integration is happening so we can if

1869
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:07,800
somebody wants to use our jazz radio it

1870
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:10,980
would be possible to thinking of the.net

1871
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:13,679
architecture replace the TSN subnet with

1872
01:28:10,980 --> 01:28:15,928
the heterogeneous wireless and wireline

1873
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:19,110
weed weed weed weed with two aspects and

1874
01:28:15,929 --> 01:28:22,440
you had in our Center only the nice

1875
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:24,150
picture of your whiteboarding which you

1876
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:27,659
you sent to the list

1877
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:30,150
nice picture you took you drew something

1878
01:28:27,659 --> 01:28:33,900
on a on a wire board and sent a picture

1879
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:37,199
which actually plays through as a some

1880
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:41,400
math technology so I would do it top

1881
01:28:37,199 --> 01:28:43,678
down start from that net and figure out

1882
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:47,639
which group you see camp which groups

1883
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:49,199
would do what so can I just jump in at

1884
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:51,000
this point with a quick question to the

1885
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:52,409
room because I'm really pleased to see

1886
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,140
there are lots of people in here and

1887
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:56,820
that might be because scheduling

1888
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:59,120
happenstance or it might be the people

1889
01:28:56,820 --> 01:29:02,099
are genuinely interested in this subject

1890
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:06,390
how many people here are intending to go

1891
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:13,560
and actively join in the debt networking

1892
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:17,820
group meetings tomorrow ok so that's in

1893
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:20,460
my opinion under half of you so take

1894
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:22,139
that make of that as you wish but as we

1895
01:29:20,460 --> 01:29:24,750
talked about does this work live in debt

1896
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:30,120
net there are people here who aren't

1897
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:31,739
going to debt that I did not show that

1898
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:35,820
statistically significant in any way but

1899
01:29:31,739 --> 01:29:37,709
it is for thinking about Carol but but

1900
01:29:35,820 --> 01:29:39,120
it could be that the other half Michael

1901
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:40,949
here Richardson it could be that the

1902
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,540
other people aren't going to debt net

1903
01:29:40,949 --> 01:29:46,139
because debt Nets not working on the on

1904
01:29:42,540 --> 01:29:48,120
the topic exactly right so but but that

1905
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:50,760
that's chicken and egg problem I think

1906
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:51,840
you have there I mean I think that I'm

1907
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:54,449
not going to detonate cuz it's

1908
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:56,820
conflicted but I mean I think that

1909
01:29:54,449 --> 01:29:59,519
there's two things right one is is you

1910
01:29:56,820 --> 01:30:01,830
know do people find is it clear what

1911
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:03,390
what bra is proposing to do here in

1912
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:06,330
terms of you know the problem statement

1913
01:30:03,390 --> 01:30:08,489
the proposed work items etcetera right

1914
01:30:06,330 --> 01:30:10,320
then this is support thing about and do

1915
01:30:08,489 --> 01:30:12,750
people want to work on that etc which is

1916
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:15,630
questions we will ask shortly as you

1917
01:30:12,750 --> 01:30:17,520
know we have discussed more about this

1918
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:19,530
stuff but and then there's a separate

1919
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:21,630
question about okay where do we place

1920
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:24,389
those work items right is it a separate

1921
01:30:21,630 --> 01:30:26,310
working group where we have a separate

1922
01:30:24,390 --> 01:30:28,469
community of people potentially new

1923
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:31,949
people coming in with more radio

1924
01:30:28,469 --> 01:30:33,630
expertise or or does it get folded into

1925
01:30:31,949 --> 01:30:35,699
some existing working group and I think

1926
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:37,740
it's as Lou said I think it's up to the

1927
01:30:35,699 --> 01:30:40,080
ADEs to decide that stuff but I

1928
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:43,260
the key thing from sort of understanding

1929
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:45,600
what's being proposed is is you know the

1930
01:30:43,260 --> 01:30:47,340
clarity about this stuff right do people

1931
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:51,980
understand it is it well scoped enough

1932
01:30:47,340 --> 01:30:51,980
so anyhow continue the discussion please

1933
01:30:54,740 --> 01:31:00,420
it's to card I've been doing internet

1934
01:30:58,590 --> 01:31:04,580
protocol based airborne networking for

1935
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:08,250
about 25 years and I have noticed that

1936
01:31:04,580 --> 01:31:10,500
we as a community have left the field of

1937
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:13,890
airborne networking to the builders of

1938
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:17,490
radios who know at best how to build

1939
01:31:13,890 --> 01:31:21,060
data links not networks there have been

1940
01:31:17,490 --> 01:31:23,219
a couple of notable exceptions where the

1941
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:25,110
IETF has indeed contributed to airborne

1942
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:27,810
networking what they have been buying

1943
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:32,070
large notable exceptions airborne

1944
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:33,510
networking faces unique challenges and I

1945
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,730
realize this is not all about airborne

1946
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:40,620
networking but the LDX example was was

1947
01:31:35,730 --> 01:31:43,980
listed sometimes a niche even if it is

1948
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:46,140
small requires a home where people who

1949
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:53,009
are focused on those unique challenges

1950
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:56,010
can address them I named John from Holly

1951
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:58,410
I think good work I think in general I

1952
01:31:56,010 --> 01:32:01,410
think this is interesting especially on

1953
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:05,130
the problem space but I still would like

1954
01:32:01,410 --> 01:32:07,680
to see architecture to highlight how

1955
01:32:05,130 --> 01:32:10,710
this work actually can interact with as

1956
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:13,380
a component like that net and things

1957
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:16,230
more detailed because I can say that the

1958
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:19,140
purpose is to propose the based on

1959
01:32:16,230 --> 01:32:21,990
charter to propose some l3 abstraction

1960
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:25,920
to enables you know some you know to

1961
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:29,219
work and how to you know how to do such

1962
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:30,990
kind of interaction and benefits the r3

1963
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:34,440
end-to-end service guarantee or

1964
01:32:30,990 --> 01:32:37,139
something pata I saw some text by a but

1965
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:39,419
I haven't never seen architecture which

1966
01:32:37,140 --> 01:32:41,400
I think that maybe make it more clear

1967
01:32:39,420 --> 01:32:43,440
and without such kind of detailed

1968
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:45,870
architecture it's really difficult for

1969
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:47,969
me to you know agree on this charter or

1970
01:32:45,870 --> 01:32:50,970
to some new work in a new working group

1971
01:32:47,970 --> 01:32:51,350
or in existing work so I don't like to

1972
01:32:50,970 --> 01:32:54,100
see that

1973
01:32:51,350 --> 01:32:57,860
thank you so it's a clarifying question

1974
01:32:54,100 --> 01:33:00,260
yeah so you're saying that what has been

1975
01:32:57,860 --> 01:33:03,110
presented today you would have liked to

1976
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:05,990
see an architecture in more detail as

1977
01:33:03,110 --> 01:33:07,670
opposed to one of the future work items

1978
01:33:05,990 --> 01:33:10,670
should be writing down the architecture

1979
01:33:07,670 --> 01:33:12,710
well it's not necessary to be a new work

1980
01:33:10,670 --> 01:33:14,270
item but I would like to see some

1981
01:33:12,710 --> 01:33:17,950
architecture maybe it's better to

1982
01:33:14,270 --> 01:33:23,870
present you know or discuss on the list

1983
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:26,269
okay Lou Berger I think we could narrow

1984
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:29,260
the discussion a little bit on the

1985
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:32,840
choice for the room for the for the 80s

1986
01:33:29,260 --> 01:33:35,270
you know I would assume we're not going

1987
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:37,940
to go sort of take on the work of the

1988
01:33:35,270 --> 01:33:40,250
radio layer guys who own those thighs

1989
01:33:37,940 --> 01:33:44,169
you know we're not going to do that we

1990
01:33:40,250 --> 01:33:47,930
probably don't want to have two groups

1991
01:33:44,170 --> 01:33:50,150
doing the same thing like defining

1992
01:33:47,930 --> 01:33:51,560
protection layers for debt net you know

1993
01:33:50,150 --> 01:33:53,000
that'll probably go over to that net

1994
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:56,090
that's pretty clear there's prop maybe

1995
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:57,890
some things that deal up enhancements

1996
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:59,930
always gonna continue in MANET wouldn't

1997
01:33:57,890 --> 01:34:02,060
come into this group so you know what's

1998
01:33:59,930 --> 01:34:03,710
really left it's it's the architecture

1999
01:34:02,060 --> 01:34:05,870
it's sort of the framework it's sort of

2000
01:34:03,710 --> 01:34:07,730
understanding how to apply it to a

2001
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:09,530
different environment you know that

2002
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:11,209
that's something that a small group of

2003
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:14,210
people or a focus group of people can go

2004
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:17,540
do and you know whether you do it in the

2005
01:34:14,210 --> 01:34:19,520
a new working group or as a group within

2006
01:34:17,540 --> 01:34:20,690
a larger working group as long as it

2007
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,310
works getting done that's the most

2008
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:24,379
important thing so I think you know you

2009
01:34:22,310 --> 01:34:26,960
want you can focus it down to that

2010
01:34:24,380 --> 01:34:29,600
architecture framework solution approach

2011
01:34:26,960 --> 01:34:31,490
that that overall picture and then just

2012
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,680
decide where your number one if people

2013
01:34:31,490 --> 01:34:37,420
want to do that and personally I hope

2014
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:41,540
they do and then number two is we're so

2015
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:43,430
Rick again as as I understand it Pascal

2016
01:34:41,540 --> 01:34:45,980
and the other guys who've been working

2017
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:49,640
on this and got it as a buff at Montreal

2018
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:53,330
and now now here I see as I understand

2019
01:34:49,640 --> 01:34:57,560
it they are asking the IETF to help give

2020
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:59,480
them some structure to and some more

2021
01:34:57,560 --> 01:35:00,080
formal forum in order to have this

2022
01:34:59,480 --> 01:35:03,290
discussion

2023
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:04,999
so yeah this could all happen inside

2024
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:07,010
meetings

2025
01:35:04,999 --> 01:35:10,280
this could all happen away from the ietf

2026
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:12,589
but I get my understanding is that they

2027
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:20,419
they have come with a request for please

2028
01:35:12,589 --> 01:35:23,479
give us a home to do this Tim Costello

2029
01:35:20,419 --> 01:35:27,189
from BT the good good presentations and

2030
01:35:23,479 --> 01:35:30,649
support the work earnest my question is

2031
01:35:27,189 --> 01:35:32,569
talking about down streaming or putting

2032
01:35:30,649 --> 01:35:34,579
work into other working groups but a lot

2033
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:37,280
a lot of that was referenced the debt

2034
01:35:34,579 --> 01:35:40,339
net group but would you also consider

2035
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:42,169
work going into working groups such as

2036
01:35:40,339 --> 01:35:43,999
the quick and that to adapt the

2037
01:35:42,169 --> 01:35:51,979
protocols to make them more wireless

2038
01:35:43,999 --> 01:35:53,510
friendly I would say as the one of the

2039
01:35:51,979 --> 01:35:55,069
great difficulties you have with

2040
01:35:53,510 --> 01:35:57,349
defining working group charters is

2041
01:35:55,069 --> 01:36:01,280
ensuring that the work is achievable and

2042
01:35:57,349 --> 01:36:04,699
scopa ball and although that you idea is

2043
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:07,159
admirable I think it's so far out on the

2044
01:36:04,699 --> 01:36:10,938
periphery of of what we should attempt

2045
01:36:07,159 --> 01:36:13,188
to do but if 101 people come to the mic

2046
01:36:10,939 --> 01:36:14,599
and say we want to go do this then

2047
01:36:13,189 --> 01:36:19,519
that's an entirely valid discussion but

2048
01:36:14,599 --> 01:36:21,439
I probably don't think that's raw honest

2049
01:36:19,519 --> 01:36:23,419
workers are just a reflection on the

2050
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,639
architecture I think it would be not

2051
01:36:23,419 --> 01:36:27,739
helpful to see a new architecture coming

2052
01:36:25,639 --> 01:36:28,999
out of it my understanding is that this

2053
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:35,388
should fit into the death net

2054
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:37,849
architecture yeah and this is the fat

2055
01:36:35,389 --> 01:36:39,679
tied down from our way so I firstly I

2056
01:36:37,849 --> 01:36:42,530
agreed that architectural framework

2057
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:47,030
stuff first it's very important so could

2058
01:36:42,530 --> 01:36:49,309
you move back to the page four so yeah

2059
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:52,309
regarding the you know technology PSE

2060
01:36:49,309 --> 01:36:55,489
I'm not sure if this terminology a crate

2061
01:36:52,309 --> 01:36:57,229
or not but you know it's it's a little

2062
01:36:55,489 --> 01:37:00,558
bit that you know computing about the

2063
01:36:57,229 --> 01:37:03,229
relationship tinder PCE and you know RPS

2064
01:37:00,559 --> 01:37:05,599
year I'm not sure if PCH to be involved

2065
01:37:03,229 --> 01:37:08,629
in the law or not actually Islander you

2066
01:37:05,599 --> 01:37:11,089
know our problems presentation slides it

2067
01:37:08,629 --> 01:37:15,108
was mentioned that PCE it's out of the

2068
01:37:11,089 --> 01:37:16,999
scope of you know law so i if pc if not

2069
01:37:15,109 --> 01:37:18,219
involved i don't know how they're gonna

2070
01:37:16,999 --> 01:37:20,440
obviously

2071
01:37:18,219 --> 01:37:24,400
can get it to pass information you know

2072
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:26,799
on to be modified so our this turn you

2073
01:37:24,400 --> 01:37:30,639
know I'm comment another command its and

2074
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:32,920
are in their arm program down pretty

2075
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:36,610
prevalent statements are presentation

2076
01:37:32,920 --> 01:37:39,250
slides there's a comparison table so

2077
01:37:36,610 --> 01:37:41,469
unless I I don't think that order you

2078
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:43,500
know comparison our assumption are

2079
01:37:41,469 --> 01:37:46,900
correct for example for the time scale

2080
01:37:43,500 --> 01:37:49,239
it says that you know I for the PC it

2081
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:51,160
needs much long time to do there you

2082
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:52,750
know past competition but right now

2083
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:56,080
there are more people they are trying to

2084
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:59,050
use their you know PC your controller to

2085
01:37:56,080 --> 01:38:01,750
do the centralized the restoration so I

2086
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:05,020
think you know for the PC it should be

2087
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:07,600
also very fast yes thank you so a little

2088
01:38:05,020 --> 01:38:10,690
bit of clarification in response the

2089
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:13,390
this diagram is talking about logical

2090
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:15,429
blocks so these are functions it doesn't

2091
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:18,550
mean that they're not co-located and it

2092
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:21,190
doesn't strictly define responsibilities

2093
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:24,640
it's more of a a whiteboard rough

2094
01:38:21,190 --> 01:38:27,730
diagram to talk about there is a

2095
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,699
selection function that must occur that

2096
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:34,769
works at a different time scale to the

2097
01:38:30,699 --> 01:38:37,299
global path computation function how

2098
01:38:34,770 --> 01:38:40,600
that is actually manifested or whether

2099
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:42,400
it actually exists as a thing is

2100
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:46,739
something that could be discussed in any

2101
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:49,960
potential work that comes out of raw so

2102
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:52,509
another thing I was good at is that the

2103
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:54,880
time scale also has to take into account

2104
01:38:52,510 --> 01:38:57,100
what's the Equality of the links that

2105
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:59,620
you're running over so you can clearly

2106
01:38:57,100 --> 01:39:04,719
run a centralized compute you know path

2107
01:38:59,620 --> 01:39:06,760
computation element if you have your

2108
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,290
lots of bandwidth and and there are

2109
01:39:06,760 --> 01:39:10,270
little drops that could do things very

2110
01:39:08,290 --> 01:39:12,280
quickly right because it's just limited

2111
01:39:10,270 --> 01:39:15,430
by compute if you're running over

2112
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:19,330
somewhat unreliable wireless link at

2113
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:20,830
varying speeds over a large network that

2114
01:39:19,330 --> 01:39:22,390
might not be feasible at all you might

2115
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:24,550
only be able to calculate these things

2116
01:39:22,390 --> 01:39:27,400
every few seconds and you want to react

2117
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:31,160
to to Radio changes that happen you know

2118
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:32,450
in in in fractions of seconds so the

2119
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:34,220
are very different timescales

2120
01:39:32,450 --> 01:39:36,410
particularly when you take those Radio

2121
01:39:34,220 --> 01:39:40,880
aspects and reliability aspects into

2122
01:39:36,410 --> 01:39:44,660
account david black could we get the

2123
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:46,520
work items back up on the screen I'm

2124
01:39:44,660 --> 01:39:49,040
sorry yeah but did say being asked for

2125
01:39:46,520 --> 01:39:51,500
my said among among the things I do is

2126
01:39:49,040 --> 01:39:54,320
I'm the transferor advisor to the debt

2127
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:56,270
networking group as I look at these work

2128
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,900
items I think the first two in the last

2129
01:39:56,270 --> 01:40:03,800
two are have a real strong difference in

2130
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:06,440
terms of how they relate to debt net the

2131
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:09,260
first two a couple of informational

2132
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:11,210
documents to describe what is Wireless

2133
01:40:09,260 --> 01:40:11,900
why is it different and how is it

2134
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:13,040
different

2135
01:40:11,900 --> 01:40:14,690
how does it force you to think

2136
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,420
differently about deterministic

2137
01:40:14,690 --> 01:40:20,750
networking that's that stuff that can go

2138
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:22,910
on relatively independent however the

2139
01:40:20,750 --> 01:40:26,510
second to which is effectively an OEM

2140
01:40:22,910 --> 01:40:28,970
document and a replication really

2141
01:40:26,510 --> 01:40:31,610
redundancy control protocol are gonna

2142
01:40:28,970 --> 01:40:34,370
have real strong overlap with what debt

2143
01:40:31,610 --> 01:40:39,769
net does or could do or should be doing

2144
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:42,800
and I wonder about sort of chartering

2145
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:44,780
those to independent of what is going of

2146
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,060
what is going on detonate because we

2147
01:40:44,780 --> 01:40:49,969
sure as heck don't need two unrelated

2148
01:40:47,060 --> 01:40:51,500
protocols in those spaces one to solve

2149
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:56,060
the problem for Wired one to solve a

2150
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:58,340
problem for Wireless I guess I guess one

2151
01:40:56,060 --> 01:41:01,100
question for the room me not being a

2152
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:03,020
dotnet expert is is there's a notion of

2153
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:05,240
being able to do debt net extensions

2154
01:41:03,020 --> 01:41:07,490
that don't actually change the debt net

2155
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:10,670
architecture but fill in some pieces and

2156
01:41:07,490 --> 01:41:13,160
being able to do that in a focus group

2157
01:41:10,670 --> 01:41:15,730
that's not debt net itself right I

2158
01:41:13,160 --> 01:41:18,680
suppose it needs to be done in the group

2159
01:41:15,730 --> 01:41:20,900
into to make it easier to invite a

2160
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:24,410
different community that can focus on on

2161
01:41:20,900 --> 01:41:27,410
a device problems but did that question

2162
01:41:24,410 --> 01:41:28,730
make sense I was rambling what you know

2163
01:41:27,410 --> 01:41:30,290
we don't want to have a different

2164
01:41:28,730 --> 01:41:32,000
architecture here right we want to have

2165
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:34,250
used a definite architecture but figure

2166
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:37,880
out it if you add the missing pieces to

2167
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:40,340
support these Wireless use cases and is

2168
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:42,890
it feasible to do that open-ended

2169
01:41:40,340 --> 01:41:43,929
question without being in the.net group

2170
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:47,969
itself

2171
01:41:43,929 --> 01:41:47,969
feeding their work into that not so much

2172
01:41:48,150 --> 01:41:55,299
blue for those who don't know I'm dead

2173
01:41:52,030 --> 01:41:57,280
net co-chair with respect to the

2174
01:41:55,300 --> 01:41:58,570
architecture I think you fit right in

2175
01:41:57,280 --> 01:42:01,330
you know I don't have a problem with the

2176
01:41:58,570 --> 01:42:03,370
box ology as Rick said this was just

2177
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:10,150
concepts and I think you can directly

2178
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:11,800
apply that that box that that box goes

2179
01:42:10,150 --> 01:42:13,360
into the service layer we have one

2180
01:42:11,800 --> 01:42:15,969
solution today we've talked about other

2181
01:42:13,360 --> 01:42:18,780
solutions for providing reliability over

2182
01:42:15,969 --> 01:42:21,659
a different network technology so the

2183
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:23,349
that last piece what is that number for

2184
01:42:21,659 --> 01:42:25,210
doing a different way of doing

2185
01:42:23,350 --> 01:42:29,020
redundancy fits right into that

2186
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:30,699
architecture perfectly and personally I

2187
01:42:29,020 --> 01:42:31,960
think it fits right into the scope of

2188
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:33,159
the working group and you can go do it

2189
01:42:31,960 --> 01:42:34,989
there all you have to do is bring us a

2190
01:42:33,159 --> 01:42:38,530
brilliant proposal bring a draft we'll

2191
01:42:34,989 --> 01:42:41,559
talk about it the OEM one David was

2192
01:42:38,530 --> 01:42:44,099
right on we're in the process oh I am is

2193
01:42:41,560 --> 01:42:46,840
trailing behind we have pretty good

2194
01:42:44,100 --> 01:42:49,890
handle on what we're doing for MPLS OEM

2195
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:52,060
we don't have a good handle on IP o am

2196
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:53,949
you actually could help us solve our

2197
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:56,500
problem and by the way Dan net is not

2198
01:42:53,949 --> 01:42:59,739
wireline debt net is debt net just like

2199
01:42:56,500 --> 01:43:01,719
IP is not what you know wireless or

2200
01:42:59,739 --> 01:43:03,580
wireline it code goes over any network

2201
01:43:01,719 --> 01:43:06,040
that's what we're aiming to do with that

2202
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:08,019
net maybe we can have one OEM solution

2203
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:10,690
not one one for wireless one for Wired

2204
01:43:08,020 --> 01:43:12,580
but just one so please come I mean I I

2205
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:14,889
think we should do this work that

2206
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:16,840
particular one I don't think should be

2207
01:43:14,890 --> 01:43:19,270
separate that one let's find have one

2208
01:43:16,840 --> 01:43:23,020
answer not x okay so there's a quick

2209
01:43:19,270 --> 01:43:24,760
follow up from that wreck again we've

2210
01:43:23,020 --> 01:43:28,440
never had the intention of carving out

2211
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:30,820
our own little Empire or you know a raw

2212
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:32,259
isolated working group it's always about

2213
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:34,960
interaction with other people definitely

2214
01:43:32,260 --> 01:43:36,219
debt net because as has been repeated

2215
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,230
many times there's so many similarities

2216
01:43:36,219 --> 01:43:40,390
and there's a direct inheritance my

2217
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:42,339
question to Lou is if we turned up with

2218
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:44,770
all those drafts and I won't find the

2219
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:46,600
slide but there's about nine and said

2220
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:48,790
okay we want to work on all of these and

2221
01:43:46,600 --> 01:43:51,070
here are all these guys and I'm looking

2222
01:43:48,790 --> 01:43:53,019
at guys and girls in the room here if we

2223
01:43:51,070 --> 01:43:54,759
all turn up on mass into debt net and

2224
01:43:53,020 --> 01:43:56,380
say we want to work on this how

2225
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:57,139
disruptive is that going to be to your

2226
01:43:56,380 --> 01:43:59,780
working group

2227
01:43:57,139 --> 01:44:02,090
and that's a genuine question sure so I

2228
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:04,400
think items three and four or completely

2229
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:07,909
complementary so that's that's like a

2230
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:09,230
no-brainer one and two you know if

2231
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:11,179
there's a group that really wants to

2232
01:44:09,230 --> 01:44:13,159
talk about that in debt net well I think

2233
01:44:11,179 --> 01:44:15,199
they'll accommodate them if we want to

2234
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:16,610
have that run as a small focused working

2235
01:44:15,199 --> 01:44:18,290
group I think that's okay too

2236
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:21,230
you know I as I said earlier it's about

2237
01:44:18,290 --> 01:44:23,510
getting the work done and you know I

2238
01:44:21,230 --> 01:44:25,669
also not getting competing solutions I'm

2239
01:44:23,510 --> 01:44:27,800
a big fan of having commonality I mean

2240
01:44:25,670 --> 01:44:30,650
that's what IP is all about and sorry I

2241
01:44:27,800 --> 01:44:34,010
have that religion so you know I think

2242
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:36,379
that would be dangerous that sorry not

2243
01:44:34,010 --> 01:44:39,290
helpful to have multiple solutions in

2244
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:42,619
the same space but in terms of the focus

2245
01:44:39,290 --> 01:44:45,260
of the discussions you know do we

2246
01:44:42,619 --> 01:44:46,489
separate together we'll have to

2247
01:44:45,260 --> 01:44:47,719
coordinate either way I think there's

2248
01:44:46,489 --> 01:44:49,489
gonna be a set of us that are gonna go

2249
01:44:47,719 --> 01:44:52,070
to both meetings no matter what so you

2250
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:53,509
know the fact that Pascal was talking

2251
01:44:52,070 --> 01:44:54,739
about people not showing up and people

2252
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:55,909
having to go to multiple means we're

2253
01:44:54,739 --> 01:44:57,138
gonna do that anyway it's not a big deal

2254
01:44:55,909 --> 01:45:03,339
that's why we that's why we still have

2255
01:44:57,139 --> 01:45:05,690
meet in person by the way yeah yeah yeah

2256
01:45:03,340 --> 01:45:07,190
I've heard a lot about this like you

2257
01:45:05,690 --> 01:45:08,989
know where do we do work and you know

2258
01:45:07,190 --> 01:45:09,469
existing working group or new one and so

2259
01:45:08,989 --> 01:45:11,330
on

2260
01:45:09,469 --> 01:45:14,050
you really come to talk about that but

2261
01:45:11,330 --> 01:45:16,790
rather to suggest that there might be a

2262
01:45:14,050 --> 01:45:19,969
opportunity to change the topic slightly

2263
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:22,790
so I'm mostly interested in how much

2264
01:45:19,969 --> 01:45:25,369
sort of market demand there is for this

2265
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:27,320
kind of suggested functionality no

2266
01:45:25,369 --> 01:45:28,759
matter where that's that's being done

2267
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:30,830
and I think that would be a worthwhile

2268
01:45:28,760 --> 01:45:34,429
thing to try and get people to comment

2269
01:45:30,830 --> 01:45:36,409
on and just thought of them my personal

2270
01:45:34,429 --> 01:45:38,659
view on this is kind of like mixed a

2271
01:45:36,409 --> 01:45:41,239
little bit because clearly there seems

2272
01:45:38,659 --> 01:45:43,670
to be demand for this you know overall

2273
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:45,468
like you know low latency critical

2274
01:45:43,670 --> 01:45:47,810
communications type of functionality in

2275
01:45:45,469 --> 01:45:51,590
the world and you know factories

2276
01:45:47,810 --> 01:45:54,290
switching to new types of communication

2277
01:45:51,590 --> 01:45:56,239
tools and so forth and no evidence for

2278
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:58,880
that is like the work at I Triple E that

2279
01:45:56,239 --> 01:46:02,230
was just heard about the work at 3gpp

2280
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:05,510
and if IT and and many other places this

2281
01:46:02,230 --> 01:46:08,888
sort of layer to capability is being

2282
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:10,760
manufactured to to do that that sort of

2283
01:46:08,889 --> 01:46:13,100
service

2284
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:14,900
but I think the question is not about

2285
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:17,000
the overall market really it's about

2286
01:46:14,900 --> 01:46:19,639
like the Delta that we at ITF would

2287
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:22,370
provide and certainly we need to somehow

2288
01:46:19,640 --> 01:46:24,680
take into account you know what's

2289
01:46:22,370 --> 01:46:26,780
happening layer to but the the question

2290
01:46:24,680 --> 01:46:29,120
in my mind at least is how much like are

2291
01:46:26,780 --> 01:46:30,830
we you know happy well we have happy

2292
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:33,349
with you know what didn't was already

2293
01:46:30,830 --> 01:46:36,530
about to do are we gonna create there

2294
01:46:33,350 --> 01:46:39,170
like a big system on top and and there I

2295
01:46:36,530 --> 01:46:44,000
think leister maybe the question mark

2296
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:48,230
and if you look at way things are built

2297
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,330
then there's a you know of course the

2298
01:46:48,230 --> 01:46:53,719
question of we do things at layer 3 or

2299
01:46:50,330 --> 01:46:55,309
or layer 2 and it seems to me that the

2300
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:57,800
kinds of things that being talked about

2301
01:46:55,310 --> 01:47:01,730
here are most suitable for so the

2302
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:03,850
extreme situation of you know have a

2303
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:07,070
mesh type network of multi hope network

2304
01:47:03,850 --> 01:47:10,010
and possibly multiple standards and then

2305
01:47:07,070 --> 01:47:12,019
sort of the IP is the only way to get

2306
01:47:10,010 --> 01:47:13,550
that done but it's you know many of the

2307
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:15,620
deployments that I'm seeing are more

2308
01:47:13,550 --> 01:47:19,610
like single technology on I Triple E or

2309
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:22,250
or other types of networks and and then

2310
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:24,530
the radio could actually at that level

2311
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:26,090
do things and if you compare that sort

2312
01:47:24,530 --> 01:47:27,769
of fundamental things that you can do at

2313
01:47:26,090 --> 01:47:29,090
layer 3 like well the packet can cut

2314
01:47:27,770 --> 01:47:32,800
through and didn't get through

2315
01:47:29,090 --> 01:47:36,860
whereas in radio you have like this 64

2316
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:40,310
element antennas that you can measure

2317
01:47:36,860 --> 01:47:42,530
like every beam exactly and so so when

2318
01:47:40,310 --> 01:47:44,180
you make a selection at layer 2 you sort

2319
01:47:42,530 --> 01:47:45,739
of you know fundamentally tweaking the

2320
01:47:44,180 --> 01:47:50,120
physics you quite aware of what's going

2321
01:47:45,739 --> 01:47:52,790
on and and layer 3 in comparison maybe

2322
01:47:50,120 --> 01:47:54,440
there's a bit of a extreme comparison

2323
01:47:52,790 --> 01:47:55,670
but but it's it's like you know shooting

2324
01:47:54,440 --> 01:47:57,799
in the dark you don't really know it

2325
01:47:55,670 --> 01:48:01,250
like it's just don't off kind of thing

2326
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:04,700
and to me that speaks you know maybe

2327
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:06,770
more in favor of relatively small amount

2328
01:48:04,700 --> 01:48:08,540
of work at the ITF and you know make

2329
01:48:06,770 --> 01:48:13,760
sure that we can detect things that are

2330
01:48:08,540 --> 01:48:17,390
broken and are working and leaving the

2331
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:19,640
radio layer to do do his job because it

2332
01:48:17,390 --> 01:48:21,800
does have all the tools available

2333
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:23,969
available to it to figure out what's

2334
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:26,730
actually going on

2335
01:48:23,969 --> 01:48:30,920
Rickon quick response to that the

2336
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:33,269
discussion prior to this actual Boff was

2337
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:36,180
understanding that this is is this in

2338
01:48:33,270 --> 01:48:38,160
our ETF problem and the answer I have

2339
01:48:36,180 --> 01:48:41,640
heard from from the active participants

2340
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:44,849
is the discussion is about building

2341
01:48:41,640 --> 01:48:47,880
reliable wireless aware networks across

2342
01:48:44,850 --> 01:48:50,760
multiple wireless link technologies so

2343
01:48:47,880 --> 01:48:53,070
sure if it's an entire radio network

2344
01:48:50,760 --> 01:48:55,370
running a single link bear technology

2345
01:48:53,070 --> 01:48:58,400
that there isn't an IETF brought the

2346
01:48:55,370 --> 01:49:01,800
problem to solve there but if you're

2347
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:04,080
connecting your multiple heterogeneous

2348
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:07,110
wireless technologies together to make a

2349
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:09,210
full path and requiring some reliability

2350
01:49:07,110 --> 01:49:13,049
or availability constraints across those

2351
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:15,420
then that is a no atf problem yeah

2352
01:49:13,050 --> 01:49:17,219
absolutely understood but but I was

2353
01:49:15,420 --> 01:49:19,020
trying to move to the discussion oh you

2354
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:20,430
know how you know how much demand is

2355
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:23,960
there for that particular thing in the

2356
01:49:20,430 --> 01:49:26,280
marketplace so I can I quickly answer

2357
01:49:23,960 --> 01:49:28,710
I'm Rick Taylor I work for Airbus

2358
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:31,880
there's a there's a reason I'm sat here

2359
01:49:28,710 --> 01:49:34,739
not just because I like helping the IETF

2360
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:38,910
this is important in in the aircraft

2361
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:42,718
industry and also terrestrial Thomas

2362
01:49:38,910 --> 01:49:46,199
Corbett yeah I was just I'm supporting

2363
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:49,410
you in that my background is actually

2364
01:49:46,199 --> 01:49:51,870
upon radio networks so I'm one of the

2365
01:49:49,410 --> 01:49:54,660
guys building the radios for urban

2366
01:49:51,870 --> 01:49:57,000
networks and I think the room is maybe

2367
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:59,040
not aware of that but basically I live

2368
01:49:57,000 --> 01:50:00,719
in a parallel universe we have a whole

2369
01:49:59,040 --> 01:50:04,100
set of standardization bodies in the

2370
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:06,000
urban industry that standardized

2371
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:07,770
airborne internetworking

2372
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:09,780
and as a internetworking because we

2373
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:12,469
still use always AI protocols if anybody

2374
01:50:09,780 --> 01:50:15,199
is still aware what that actually is and

2375
01:50:12,469 --> 01:50:19,830
part of our difficulty to go into

2376
01:50:15,199 --> 01:50:22,589
multihomed diverse IP version 6 mobile

2377
01:50:19,830 --> 01:50:24,750
networks is that we have difficulty to

2378
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:26,730
find people to talk to in the IETF so

2379
01:50:24,750 --> 01:50:28,530
having a working group that gives us

2380
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:33,780
structure and people to talk to would

2381
01:50:28,530 --> 01:50:36,030
greatly help us so let's get you there's

2382
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:37,790
also a reason why I'm here and we build

2383
01:50:36,030 --> 01:50:40,400
products and we

2384
01:50:37,790 --> 01:50:44,710
filled problems with our Juice products

2385
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:46,849
and even if they are single type radios

2386
01:50:44,710 --> 01:50:48,650
actually now we aren't releasing

2387
01:50:46,850 --> 01:50:53,360
multiple 5-speed so it's already creates

2388
01:50:48,650 --> 01:50:56,240
some some new sort of trouble we have

2389
01:50:53,360 --> 01:50:57,860
this exact problem that within this

2390
01:50:56,240 --> 01:51:00,650
single technology we have to be of

2391
01:50:57,860 --> 01:51:02,750
multi-hop routing and we do that at

2392
01:51:00,650 --> 01:51:05,210
layer 3 because we found that the layer

2393
01:51:02,750 --> 01:51:07,220
3 technology applied quite well to our

2394
01:51:05,210 --> 01:51:11,360
use cases so we did not rely on layer 2

2395
01:51:07,220 --> 01:51:14,630
meshes but we do layer 3 meshes and one

2396
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:17,660
hop can do the best even if it had 64

2397
01:51:14,630 --> 01:51:19,880
antennas in wanna write to optimize that

2398
01:51:17,660 --> 01:51:22,070
transition it is the quick time track so

2399
01:51:19,880 --> 01:51:23,690
we want to ask a few questions but be

2400
01:51:22,070 --> 01:51:25,910
brief at the microphone and let's close

2401
01:51:23,690 --> 01:51:28,460
the microphone lines okay so the bottom

2402
01:51:25,910 --> 01:51:30,769
line is we need this technology in our

2403
01:51:28,460 --> 01:51:32,840
current product line and we have

2404
01:51:30,770 --> 01:51:35,780
customer requirement that are associated

2405
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:38,450
to that in real products as not have

2406
01:51:35,780 --> 01:51:40,190
Unix that smart grid so just to enable

2407
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:41,960
automation within a smart grid people

2408
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:43,099
invest a lot in those networks right now

2409
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:44,690
they use them for I am I

2410
01:51:43,100 --> 01:51:46,280
but defined that considering the

2411
01:51:44,690 --> 01:51:48,110
investment they want more services from

2412
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:50,000
this network so now they are hiding they

2413
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:51,769
want more capabilities from the network

2414
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,540
and and basically those capabilities are

2415
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:58,670
related to automation and they want to

2416
01:51:53,540 --> 01:52:01,519
grow yeahjust and it's mario here again

2417
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:03,800
so one really quick comment about

2418
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:06,350
bringing new people to the IETF why

2419
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:08,420
wireless is important to do that so the

2420
01:52:06,350 --> 01:52:10,520
difference is here you need to do good

2421
01:52:08,420 --> 01:52:12,200
channel measurements in order to

2422
01:52:10,520 --> 01:52:14,480
understand your wireless channel and

2423
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:16,220
this is becoming ever more important

2424
01:52:14,480 --> 01:52:17,959
with the advent of you these coming in

2425
01:52:16,220 --> 01:52:20,630
autonomous flying and so on so you need

2426
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:22,880
to be very exact in how the information

2427
01:52:20,630 --> 01:52:25,100
actually travels so I think bra is a

2428
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,660
very good opportunity to bring in a

2429
01:52:25,100 --> 01:52:28,580
whole new bunch of people in with

2430
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:30,110
different background to do the channel

2431
01:52:28,580 --> 01:52:35,330
measurement for instance in this working

2432
01:52:30,110 --> 01:52:38,150
group thank you my name is Uma they just

2433
01:52:35,330 --> 01:52:39,650
a comment here I see the problem laid

2434
01:52:38,150 --> 01:52:41,450
out here it's little bit different than

2435
01:52:39,650 --> 01:52:43,759
what his debt net is doing for sure it's

2436
01:52:41,450 --> 01:52:45,710
especially for the point for you guys

2437
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,150
are seeking for the time scale issue you

2438
01:52:45,710 --> 01:52:49,970
guys are seeking to put in band

2439
01:52:47,150 --> 01:52:51,049
signaling so I didn't hear which data

2440
01:52:49,970 --> 01:52:55,309
plane

2441
01:52:51,049 --> 01:52:57,379
you guys like icbt is one data plane but

2442
01:52:55,309 --> 01:53:00,079
it's not sure we are seeking to create

2443
01:52:57,379 --> 01:53:02,179
new data planes but I see this is a new

2444
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:04,099
thing in band signalling there's a one

2445
01:53:02,179 --> 01:53:06,649
in band signaling stuff that was being

2446
01:53:04,099 --> 01:53:10,429
presented in TS we working group using

2447
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:11,959
ipv6 extension headers but I see this is

2448
01:53:10,429 --> 01:53:23,139
a new thing which is not done in

2449
01:53:11,959 --> 01:53:26,239
deathmatch that's my comment so that's

2450
01:53:23,139 --> 01:53:28,159
let's try to get some hum so not about

2451
01:53:26,239 --> 01:53:30,888
we're necessarily where we placed is

2452
01:53:28,159 --> 01:53:32,358
work or maybe there's a right I know

2453
01:53:30,889 --> 01:53:35,179
there will be question about for medium

2454
01:53:32,359 --> 01:53:37,429
working group sorry but first of all you

2455
01:53:35,179 --> 01:53:39,769
know the people in the room please hum I

2456
01:53:37,429 --> 01:53:44,389
will ask yes or no will ask both of

2457
01:53:39,769 --> 01:53:46,479
these questions as one question and we

2458
01:53:44,389 --> 01:53:49,669
can split them apart if we need to but

2459
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:51,919
if you feel that the problem statement

2460
01:53:49,669 --> 01:53:54,739
has been stated is sufficiently clear

2461
01:53:51,919 --> 01:53:57,979
and and well scoped and the work items

2462
01:53:54,739 --> 01:53:59,898
are stated in that we've had up here the

2463
01:53:57,979 --> 01:54:07,129
four items if they're sufficiently clear

2464
01:53:59,899 --> 01:54:09,079
please hum if you feel that they're not

2465
01:54:07,129 --> 01:54:14,499
sufficiently clear and well scoped

2466
01:54:09,079 --> 01:54:17,629
please hum sorry here are some hums

2467
01:54:14,499 --> 01:54:19,818
clearly most of them hum for you for

2468
01:54:17,629 --> 01:54:23,989
that they are clear on scope but there

2469
01:54:19,819 --> 01:54:27,859
were was a few for the second one as

2470
01:54:23,989 --> 01:54:34,818
well though solving this problem belong

2471
01:54:27,859 --> 01:54:36,679
in the IETF please hum for solving this

2472
01:54:34,819 --> 01:54:42,469
problem not belong in the area TF but

2473
01:54:36,679 --> 01:54:46,279
somewhere else that background noise

2474
01:54:42,469 --> 01:54:50,449
from the fans or some other what as an

2475
01:54:46,279 --> 01:54:53,389
aircraft flying over is there support

2476
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:55,818
for forming a separate working group as

2477
01:54:53,389 --> 01:55:03,100
presented discussed work the items in

2478
01:54:55,819 --> 01:55:06,050
this charter please hum this is there

2479
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:12,830
not support for transforming it whatever

2480
01:55:06,050 --> 01:55:14,360
the opposite please um yeah that one

2481
01:55:12,830 --> 01:55:16,519
I sort of expected that based on the

2482
01:55:14,360 --> 01:55:21,830
discussion we had leading up to this

2483
01:55:16,520 --> 01:55:23,659
stuff so not not surprising some 50 50

2484
01:55:21,830 --> 01:55:27,260
50 approximately from the volume of a

2485
01:55:23,659 --> 01:55:29,750
Harrison but a lot of abstention that

2486
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:34,580
was quite a quiet hum on both sides that

2487
01:55:29,750 --> 01:55:38,620
time so hello it's Debra the ad can you

2488
01:55:34,580 --> 01:55:41,239
go back to that slide here okay so I

2489
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:43,489
have heard a lot of concern there were

2490
01:55:41,239 --> 01:55:46,159
four items right for the work items and

2491
01:55:43,489 --> 01:55:49,218
the first two were informational the

2492
01:55:46,159 --> 01:55:51,379
third and fourth were warm protocol

2493
01:55:49,219 --> 01:55:55,219
which questionable if it we should be

2494
01:55:51,380 --> 01:55:58,580
dead net or what so if it was only those

2495
01:55:55,219 --> 01:55:59,600
first two items let's take the poll you

2496
01:55:58,580 --> 01:56:02,210
know put because we have a lot of

2497
01:55:59,600 --> 01:56:04,639
working groups that are done with a very

2498
01:56:02,210 --> 01:56:07,429
limited scope great to do something very

2499
01:56:04,639 --> 01:56:09,320
fast and then merge back into other

2500
01:56:07,429 --> 01:56:12,739
working groups so if it was only the

2501
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:15,830
first two items those informational key

2502
01:56:12,739 --> 01:56:20,870
just do the poll again yep definitely

2503
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:22,940
done so those first two items is to

2504
01:56:20,870 --> 01:56:25,130
support for forming a working group with

2505
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:31,820
with those two work items in the Charter

2506
01:56:25,130 --> 01:56:37,699
please hum is there any opposition to

2507
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:40,099
doing that please hum that one was yes

2508
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:43,419
quite different right so it was not

2509
01:56:40,100 --> 01:56:46,429
completely quiet on the second one what

2510
01:56:43,420 --> 01:56:49,760
no I said it was not completely quiet

2511
01:56:46,429 --> 01:56:53,600
under the on the opposed one but it was

2512
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:56,600
not volume things I would say it was

2513
01:56:53,600 --> 01:57:02,870
like 8020 90/10 type thing as opposed to

2514
01:56:56,600 --> 01:57:06,860
5050 so and then you know who in this

2515
01:57:02,870 --> 01:57:10,219
room are planning if if we charted that

2516
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:11,690
yes just a quick comment because I was

2517
01:57:10,219 --> 01:57:14,300
the one who was humming against on the

2518
01:57:11,690 --> 01:57:16,519
latest one and that the reason for that

2519
01:57:14,300 --> 01:57:19,400
was not sufficiently interesting

2520
01:57:16,520 --> 01:57:20,030
if you only do the two things then you

2521
01:57:19,400 --> 01:57:22,219
know why bother

2522
01:57:20,030 --> 01:57:24,590
yeah there's a separate question which

2523
01:57:22,220 --> 01:57:26,270
I'm gonna ask Deborah about which is I

2524
01:57:24,590 --> 01:57:27,860
thought the IEC didn't want to charter

2525
01:57:26,270 --> 01:57:29,570
things that only do like informational

2526
01:57:27,860 --> 01:57:34,219
documents but but we'll do that

2527
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:35,480
afterwards and there was the gentleman

2528
01:57:34,220 --> 01:57:37,760
who explained that the prong does not

2529
01:57:35,480 --> 01:57:40,009
exist because the PC is fast enough and

2530
01:57:37,760 --> 01:57:41,870
yes at some point I mean for many did

2531
01:57:40,010 --> 01:57:43,760
that deployments I mean we can leave

2532
01:57:41,870 --> 01:57:46,790
with just a PC and the network without a

2533
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,950
PSC the PSC is really the piece that is

2534
01:57:46,790 --> 01:57:50,450
an extension to that net another grown

2535
01:57:48,950 --> 01:57:51,860
piece of the architecture that does not

2536
01:57:50,450 --> 01:57:53,599
even show on the architecture has

2537
01:57:51,860 --> 01:57:55,309
written today because in many wire

2538
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:57,560
deployment doesn't is not needy at all

2539
01:57:55,310 --> 01:58:00,200
and so the do you have a way of

2540
01:57:57,560 --> 01:58:04,280
presenting this work is to say a what if

2541
01:58:00,200 --> 01:58:06,500
that net delegates this work to role and

2542
01:58:04,280 --> 01:58:08,710
does not try to do the competing

2543
01:58:06,500 --> 01:58:12,470
solution just since it's a very

2544
01:58:08,710 --> 01:58:15,170
particular side effect of that net which

2545
01:58:12,470 --> 01:58:17,630
only appears in a particular types of

2546
01:58:15,170 --> 01:58:19,010
use cases some people big not easy at

2547
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:20,540
all but this is not finished asking the

2548
01:58:19,010 --> 01:58:24,320
questions we have about two minutes left

2549
01:58:20,540 --> 01:58:27,340
so it was interesting forming it as long

2550
01:58:24,320 --> 01:58:31,190
as does not compete with that because we

2551
01:58:27,340 --> 01:58:33,380
have heard the concerns about definitely

2552
01:58:31,190 --> 01:58:36,169
not having two separate separate

2553
01:58:33,380 --> 01:58:39,110
standards for the stuff so by the way we

2554
01:58:36,170 --> 01:58:44,210
have from Java 3 plus like yes

2555
01:58:39,110 --> 01:58:48,339
performing again okay so our questions

2556
01:58:44,210 --> 01:58:51,140
if if we start working on this stuff

2557
01:58:48,340 --> 01:58:53,210
these drafts whether it happens in a

2558
01:58:51,140 --> 01:58:56,540
separate working group or in in an

2559
01:58:53,210 --> 01:58:59,060
existing working group like raw are you

2560
01:58:56,540 --> 01:59:02,390
gonna contribute as in writing or

2561
01:58:59,060 --> 01:59:05,870
helping editing whatever drafts in this

2562
01:59:02,390 --> 01:59:08,240
space problem statements protocol specs

2563
01:59:05,870 --> 01:59:09,980
whatever can I please see a show of

2564
01:59:08,240 --> 01:59:15,050
hands of people in the room that would

2565
01:59:09,980 --> 01:59:20,780
actually do that so I see about one two

2566
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:27,610
three four five six seven eight nine

2567
01:59:20,780 --> 01:59:27,610
nine and a half nine point seven

2568
01:59:27,909 --> 01:59:35,808
how many from Jabba so we're about ten I

2569
01:59:35,449 --> 01:59:40,098
can't

2570
01:59:35,809 --> 01:59:41,420
twelve approximately and can we please

2571
01:59:40,099 --> 01:59:43,880
get a show of hands that people are

2572
01:59:41,420 --> 01:59:49,309
willing to review work being coming out

2573
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:53,449
of this stuff so that's a lot larger I'm

2574
01:59:49,309 --> 01:59:55,460
guessing about thirty or so okay

2575
01:59:53,449 --> 01:59:58,969
Deborah did you have anything else you

2576
01:59:55,460 --> 02:00:06,289
wanted to cover okay thank you very much

2577
01:59:58,969 --> 02:00:08,420
for coming and participating blue sheets

2578
02:00:06,289 --> 02:00:09,889
and there is a rule mailing list if you

2579
02:00:08,420 --> 02:00:13,329
want to continue to the discussion

2580
02:00:09,889 --> 02:00:13,329
absolutely use the list

2581
02:00:13,659 --> 02:00:17,388
thank you very much coming off the blue

2582
02:00:15,590 --> 02:00:19,940
sheets back whoever's currently got them

2583
02:00:17,389 --> 02:00:23,079
on their seat next to them and sign it

2584
02:00:19,940 --> 02:00:23,079
if you didn't on your way out the door
