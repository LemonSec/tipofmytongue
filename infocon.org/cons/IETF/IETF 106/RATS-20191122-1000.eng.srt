1
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,378
all right it's ten o'clock it's time to

2
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,259
get started so

3
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,150
morning everyone welcome to the last day

4
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:23,970
not quite the last session for the week

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,269
you are in the remote at the stations

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,009
procedures working group if this is not

7
00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:33,690
what you're expecting to hear you may be

8
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,800
in the wrong room by now good morning

9
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:36,360
everyone women do tell you in case

10
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,669
you're confused why I'm here I'm neither

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:43,860
Nancy nor Ned who are remotes on just up

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:46,260
here as the ad helping cap so Kathleen

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:50,129
and then who are the co-chairs our

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:52,320
remote so continuing on everybody should

15
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:55,349
be familiar with the note well so let's

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,989
proceed on I want to thank Peter you for

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,360
taking awesome notes he will be one of

18
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,529
our note takers you may not see his

19
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:04,589
notes on etherpad

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,549
so Frank if you could put some of the

21
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:07,289
notes on etherpad

22
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,320
I think it would be great encourage

23
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,100
others to also observe and augment as

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,339
you see on the ether pad as well and

25
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:18,119
Akira

26
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,869
are you okay being Jabbar scribe okay

27
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,319
great thanks so with those logistics out

28
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:29,689
of the way I just want to do a quick

29
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,920
plug I don't see Hannes here no okay

30
00:01:29,689 --> 00:01:36,048
that's why he asked me to do the plug

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:39,420
okay so since there are

32
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:42,149
interdependencies between teep soot and

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:46,200
rats we thought it would be good to

34
00:01:42,149 --> 00:01:49,950
begin some joint hackathons so there is

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:53,549
a plan to do just that in Berlin in the

36
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:56,039
February time frame the slides should be

37
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,399
there you can upload them but mainly for

38
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:05,310
more information you can go to the s io

39
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:09,330
t hackathon github IO so with that said

40
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:13,050
let's do a quick agenda bash since we

41
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,599
have a lot to discuss today so if you

42
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:18,000
might have noticed if you were tracking

43
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,399
the agenda through the week we've

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,180
modified this so that we can focus on

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,610
work that we should look forward in

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,220
getting adoption so that we can actually

47
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,160
formally track the issue

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,040
and have a working document on to work

49
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,010
against so with that what we're going to

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,470
do is begin with the security

51
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:45,329
considerations for remote integrity

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:47,250
verification draft guy is remote then

53
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:51,420
we're gonna have deep site sealer on

54
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:54,750
behalf of the new Zion slash editorial

55
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:57,570
team for the architecture draft go

56
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,780
through that so given that this is new

57
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:04,049
work that team has met I know quite a

58
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:07,260
few of you joined during the week so

59
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:10,470
we've allocated 45 minutes for that then

60
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:14,970
we want to discuss and get to some

61
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,990
questions visa vie the draft titled

62
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,260
the basic module so I want that

63
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,360
discussion to be scoped more on getting

64
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,760
us guidance as to what we want to do

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,370
with the document what the group wants

66
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,440
to do visa Vee

67
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:38,180
adopting game as a data model and then

68
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,760
Wang will be substituting for Frank to

69
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:44,690
present the pub/sub model so even though

70
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,519
Frank is here he's lost his voice so

71
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:52,340
Frank has asked for his co-author to

72
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,170
present so I'd like to have the

73
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:59,250
discussion for adoption throughout but

74
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,530
I've left some time at the end to do

75
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,959
conclusions or to do further questions

76
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,269
if needed at the end and hopefully

77
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:10,530
hopefully we might have a couple minutes

78
00:04:06,269 --> 00:04:12,989
at the end so with that any orders of

79
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:18,890
business that I might have missed going

80
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:23,940
once twice okay let's move on so yeah

81
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:29,669
guy if you can beyond we are going to

82
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:32,490
bring up your slides yes I see my first

83
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:36,260
slide thank you very much perfect

84
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,670
Nancy thank you for

85
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,659
guy just yelled next slide when you're

86
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:46,360
ready yes okay and thank you for being

87
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,580
there in person I know it's a long way

88
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:53,000
so what I wanted to do with this session

89
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:55,849
is to try and get fairly quickly through

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,930
the changes that we made to the Riv

91
00:04:55,850 --> 00:05:05,410
draft in the in the since the last

92
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:08,150
meeting in which we have added the

93
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:11,900
conditional security considerations

94
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:15,620
section of the document what I wanted to

95
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:19,219
do with that was to outline what some of

96
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:23,780
the kind of considerations are in RIF

97
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:27,650
from a point of view of a of a TPM guy

98
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:29,510
as opposed to all of the other kinds of

99
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:33,500
considerations that should go into this

100
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:35,599
from the IETF point of view so I'll go

101
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:39,170
through this fairly rapidly the first

102
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,320
couple of slides are review then there

103
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:47,450
are a number of five slides four slides

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:55,580
which address specific attacks and the

105
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:57,920
relevant mitigations and i think jessica

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,580
is on the line as well so if there are

107
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:06,500
questions either one of us I hope can

108
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:09,740
respond so the first slide first slide

109
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:12,230
is simply the yes next thank you the

110
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,400
first slide is simply the introduction

111
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:19,190
to the work again based on the TCG

112
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,760
document originally but it's evolved at

113
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:25,390
you know quite a bit by this point next

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,390
slide please

115
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,640
the problem statement as before we're

116
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:38,590
simply trying to determine what software

117
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:41,870
it is that's running on a remote device

118
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:43,460
and of course that includes remote

119
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:45,860
devices which have already been hacked

120
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,138
so they may not be totally truthful in

121
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:54,659
their response the point

122
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:56,530
Riv is not so much exactly how the

123
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,740
measurements are collected but rather

124
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:03,698
how the workflow works that is how the

125
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:08,819
results are conveyed requested and

126
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:11,349
conveyed and verified through the loop

127
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:15,909
there were questions about the scope of

128
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:20,020
Rev and I think what you know we have

129
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:22,719
not tried to put this in in you know

130
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:26,469
standards compliant text but basically

131
00:07:22,719 --> 00:07:30,009
at the moment the scope of Rev is things

132
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:35,379
as in IOT things not you know embedded

133
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:40,029
systems that have a TPM that use yang

134
00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:43,240
and that don't sleep the TPM part of

135
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:48,279
course is kind of critical to this work

136
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,219
the other pieces are more convenience to

137
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,710
get the entire workflow done without

138
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:56,529
getting too bogged down in in the many

139
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,930
different ways it could be applied the

140
00:07:56,529 --> 00:08:00,689
obvious next step for work like this

141
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:06,539
would be to extend it to other domains

142
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:09,729
for example industrial IOT would find

143
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,949
would have similar problems but wouldn't

144
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:15,128
find yang very attractive I think and

145
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:19,810
consequently would want to use some

146
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:21,729
other transport protocol and and without

147
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:22,629
being an industrial IOT expert I

148
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,539
remember what it is

149
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,699
so we we'd have to find the right expert

150
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:31,240
to help extend it

151
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:33,550
similarly sleep sleep modes can be

152
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:36,669
handled with the TPM but it's a little

153
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:41,109
complicated so I postponed that until we

154
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:43,799
have a good reason to want to do it next

155
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,800
slide please

156
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:52,839
the information flows again this is

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:57,510
unchanged the the verifier and relying

158
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,279
party issue a request to the tester and

159
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:02,890
expect of response

160
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:03,970
I know rib does make a distinction

161
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:09,220
between verify

162
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:11,290
relying party in this in in rib unlike

163
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,930
rats in Riv we have not made that

164
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:17,800
distinction that doesn't say it couldn't

165
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:21,099
be made and if rats does specify an

166
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:24,699
interface between the two that's fine

167
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,370
I I don't there's no there's no inherent

168
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:28,870
reason why I don't want them

169
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,790
distinguished it's just that the focus

170
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:33,310
of this work is is the stuff that

171
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,060
crosses the red line on this on this

172
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:40,029
slide between the the combination of

173
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:46,859
verifier and ruling party and the a

174
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:46,860
testing device next please

175
00:09:46,949 --> 00:09:55,569
okay so this is the start of the new

176
00:09:50,019 --> 00:09:59,850
material for this this work in security

177
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:03,670
considerations i've we've we factored in

178
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:05,910
key mitigations for key compromise

179
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:08,800
counterfeit devices man-in-the-middle

180
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,309
attacks and replay attacks and let's go

181
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:18,430
through what each one of those would be

182
00:10:11,309 --> 00:10:23,589
next key compromise again I'll I don't

183
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:27,579
mean this as a general statement of all

184
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:30,660
kinds of mitigations but rather the ones

185
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:34,628
that are unique to systems that have

186
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:39,430
that have TPMS and that we'd like to not

187
00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:43,930
break in the process of merging this

188
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:46,750
stuff into the rats world so Riv depends

189
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:50,439
on on keys which are generated inside

190
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:58,149
the TPM for both identity and at a

191
00:10:50,439 --> 00:11:03,430
station and a tenet of TPM methodology

192
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:05,860
is Oh interesting

193
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:08,620
where did say oh I see there's like chat

194
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:10,300
in the bottom right corner and and and

195
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:14,670
see that must be on your machine

196
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:17,099
it's on the chrome I don't yeah okay

197
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:19,740
anyways

198
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,990
one of the tenets of TPM design is that

199
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,500
keys which are generated inside the TPM

200
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:28,500
cannot be exported so this is not this

201
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,370
is not a rule of unless you have the

202
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:35,310
right privileges they cannot be a secret

203
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:39,090
keys cannot be exported unless you can

204
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:42,750
find a bug or or mount a physical attack

205
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:48,390
a very challenging physical attack so

206
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:50,610
for most purposes we'd say secrets

207
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:53,760
cannot secret keys cannot be exported

208
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,800
from the TPM and that is the the

209
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,620
fundamental premise in how we defend

210
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:02,550
against against compromised of course

211
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:05,220
the whoever puts the keys there and puts

212
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:06,930
the certificates there needs to be sure

213
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,000
that they are careful about what they

214
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:15,680
sign but the the keys themselves that

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:22,320
prove identity in annotation are

216
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:26,390
challenging to steal or compromised or

217
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,390
extract in any way next please

218
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:34,349
defence against counterfeit devices if

219
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,660
you're going to attest something you'd

220
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:39,480
like to know that you're attesting the

221
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,990
thing you think you are testing in the

222
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:46,250
case of riff that has been accommodated

223
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:49,290
simply by expecting that the

224
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,500
manufacturer will install device

225
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:55,410
credentials when they before they leave

226
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,410
the factory so if a manufacturer

227
00:12:55,410 --> 00:13:02,579
provisions an initial device ID using a

228
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:06,240
doe 2.1 AR then that provides the serial

229
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:09,120
number and a certificate which is signed

230
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,760
by the manufacturer when you retrieve

231
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,480
that information the user the verifying

232
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,370
the verify or the relying party

233
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,230
presumably the the the person who owns

234
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,800
the machine knows the serial number

235
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:30,210
because everybody's systems track serial

236
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,900
numbers already so if you know this

237
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,240
Ariel

238
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,920
and you know the manufacturers and you

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,510
can verify that the device you are

240
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,180
testing is in fact the one that you

241
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,930
purchased and put in the location where

242
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,930
you expect it

243
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:51,240
we have asked for pre provisioning of

244
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,420
the device ID and the attestation keys

245
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,270
in this case pre provisioning them to

246
00:13:54,420 --> 00:14:04,860
allow for secure zero touch provisioning

247
00:13:57,270 --> 00:14:08,220
as in RFC 85 72 that is not fundamental

248
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:13,580
to RIF but as far as getting this to

249
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:16,230
work for let's say ordinary enterprises

250
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,360
we're trying to make it as close to an

251
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,080
out-of-the-box experience as possible

252
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:24,180
that is you know this aerial number you

253
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:26,370
provision the serial number in your own

254
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,189
management system and beyond that the

255
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:34,250
rest of it just plug the box and it'll

256
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:34,250
figure it out itself next please

257
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,940
the men in the middle attack attacks

258
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:49,550
there are of course many but there are a

259
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:52,020
couple that are particular one of the

260
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:57,449
there are a couple of issues to deal

261
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:59,760
with here the identity of course depends

262
00:14:57,450 --> 00:15:04,290
the identity of the box depends on the

263
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:08,370
device ID which has a key which we keep

264
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:14,160
inside the TPM but the attestation

265
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:16,020
evidence which shows which you know what

266
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:18,329
the what software is running on the box

267
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,970
that attestation evidence also is

268
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:29,220
collected inside the TPM and signed

269
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:36,000
inside the TPM so we use a separate key

270
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:38,520
for attestation and identity and this is

271
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,170
probably not completely obvious why we

272
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,819
would do such an annoying thing but the

273
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,858
purpose of the device ID

274
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:50,939
he is to prove identity of the device

275
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:54,779
and to sign whatever it's given to prove

276
00:15:50,939 --> 00:16:00,319
that it has that key what we do not want

277
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:03,809
is for the attestation evidence to be

278
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:07,259
signed by a key that can sign anything

279
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:13,079
else and this is to prevent the case

280
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:17,279
where a a system which has been

281
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:18,959
compromised could make up a quote or

282
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,479
showing a particular software

283
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,579
configuration get the TPM to sign it and

284
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:26,699
send that back so as long as attestation

285
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:30,929
is done using a separate key then that

286
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:34,378
cannot happen that block say a thing

287
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:40,369
which was has been called the ISO can

288
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:46,649
attack RFC 681 three which in which a

289
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:49,979
faulty device compromised device proxies

290
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:53,609
to a good device to get attestation

291
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:56,129
results and then sends those back as its

292
00:16:53,609 --> 00:17:00,019
own if you're not careful about which

293
00:16:56,129 --> 00:17:05,269
key is which then the verifier could be

294
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:08,638
duped into accepting the bogus results

295
00:17:05,269 --> 00:17:11,128
that were effectively created by a

296
00:17:08,638 --> 00:17:17,188
man-in-the-middle that is the device

297
00:17:11,128 --> 00:17:19,529
that is has been compromised so that is

298
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:23,009
what leads us to ask for separate device

299
00:17:19,529 --> 00:17:25,709
ID and edited station keys to ensure

300
00:17:23,009 --> 00:17:29,990
that those keys come from the same TPM

301
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:32,190
we have asked that the attestation

302
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,620
certificate should contain the same

303
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:39,419
identity information as the dev ID so

304
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,340
that means the same serial number and

305
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:43,350
the same manufacturer's signature on

306
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,049
those two certificates and at that point

307
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:48,539
on the receiving end in the verifier you

308
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:50,908
can look at the two certificates see

309
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:52,980
that they are signed by the manufacturer

310
00:17:50,909 --> 00:17:54,570
you trust and they contain the serial

311
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,549
number that you think is the Box you're

312
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,120
talking to and at that point you know

313
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:00,129
you've got the

314
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:03,039
attestation results from the right thing

315
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:08,770
and not not a NASA can attack wrong

316
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:14,860
thing next please this picture just

317
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:17,529
illustrates that that the the lower part

318
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:21,250
of the picture that the device identity

319
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:24,580
simply signs a nonce with a key which is

320
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:27,010
inside the TPM and returns the signed

321
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,460
nonce to prove that it holds the

322
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,700
identity key along with the identity

323
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:36,130
certificate the upper part of the

324
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:40,740
picture is the attestation information

325
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:43,419
the evidence and that is obtained by

326
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:46,600
receiving measurements from outside the

327
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:50,440
TPM storing them inside the TPM creating

328
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:52,178
the response the quote which includes an

329
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,250
odds and signing it with it with the

330
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:56,370
attestation key that's inside the TPM

331
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:01,000
that can be used for nothing except

332
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,520
signing that quote and as long as the

333
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,320
two certificates have the same identity

334
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:10,990
information in them then you can tell

335
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:13,120
that they are from the same place in TPM

336
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,500
lore there are a number of ways of doing

337
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,489
this

338
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,289
some of which are privacy preserving and

339
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:25,570
some of which are kind of complicated

340
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:29,620
and we've tried to sidestep all of that

341
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:31,210
by this simple mechanism of provisioning

342
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:33,939
the keys in advance in a way that you

343
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:35,770
can tell what they if you trust the CA

344
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:41,909
you can tell they come from the same

345
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:41,908
place next please

346
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,399
finally the defense against replay

347
00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:53,559
attacks I think this is extremely

348
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:55,178
conventional anything that wishes to

349
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:58,539
prove identity of course the way you do

350
00:19:55,179 --> 00:20:01,690
it is by signing up by sending a nonce

351
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:04,450
and making sure that nonce is signed by

352
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:06,880
the secret key that corresponds to the

353
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:11,559
prize the public key that you know so

354
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,409
that proves freshness the address

355
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:17,980
Asian evidence is handled more or less

356
00:20:14,409 --> 00:20:22,539
the same way that the when the TPM is

357
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:26,860
used to sign construct and sign the

358
00:20:22,539 --> 00:20:28,870
quote it includes a nonce which comes

359
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,709
from the verifier so the evidence coming

360
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:36,449
back from the TPM for a decision

361
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:42,490
includes the nonce which came from the

362
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:50,440
verifier again proving that the result

363
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:53,649
is fresh is his current there's an

364
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:56,049
alternate approach called to do that

365
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:59,860
Hank has worked on that doesn't require

366
00:20:56,049 --> 00:21:04,809
as many back-and-forth exchanges but

367
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:09,209
that currently is not part of Grif could

368
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:09,210
be but not at the moment

369
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:17,559
so I think the the replay defense is

370
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:24,309
pretty conventional so next slide please

371
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:27,460
just to finish up what we the point I

372
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:32,009
guess I'd like to make is that the rules

373
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:34,360
imposed by the design of the TPM provide

374
00:21:32,009 --> 00:21:37,059
evidence of identity and software

375
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,479
integrity both of which are quite

376
00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:44,918
difficult to forge and don't depend on

377
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:49,720
the good health of the device being

378
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:52,929
attested that is the the device can be

379
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:55,389
hacked any way you like and if it

380
00:21:52,929 --> 00:21:58,269
responds to the request for a decision

381
00:21:55,389 --> 00:22:01,479
at all then you can be sure that it came

382
00:21:58,269 --> 00:22:03,759
from the TPM and has not been messed

383
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,799
with by the tampered device or anything

384
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:11,549
else in the chain the result of this the

385
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:17,408
the implication of this this statement

386
00:22:11,549 --> 00:22:21,549
is that the TPM data structures really

387
00:22:17,409 --> 00:22:23,619
have to be transmitted unmodified and

388
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:25,420
that has been a that has been

389
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:29,620
accommodated in the yang

390
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:33,460
model as it is but we we need to

391
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:38,139
preserve that property as we go forward

392
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:40,290
with this and with that I think I have

393
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:43,390
covered the points I wanted to cover

394
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,360
Nancy if there are questions of course

395
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,730
I'm quiet yes so I'm going to allow two

396
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,070
minutes of questions because I want to

397
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:56,100
give ourselves if I can two minutes to

398
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:59,050
ask the question about the draft so

399
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,719
let's do two minutes of questions about

400
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:03,970
the draft but the question that I want

401
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,690
to pose to the group and actually first

402
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:12,240
to the authors is the intent for the

403
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:14,980
draft with respect to rats go ahead my

404
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,930
own opinion about that to the Clarion

405
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:19,500
Michael Richardson I have a clarifying

406
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,970
question fergie

407
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,990
do you think it would be useful for us

408
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:26,350
to have another name

409
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:28,600
that's not I dev ID or el dev ID for the

410
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:30,280
dev ID which is in the TPM which is not

411
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,320
the same certificate as the other things

412
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,629
even though the TPM may have the idea of

413
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,439
ID now dev ID things in it for other

414
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:37,600
purposes

415
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,640
it sounds like we need a new term for

416
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:44,429
that or and I wondered if there is one

417
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:48,970
and given that it is signed by the

418
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:51,130
manufacturer of the TPM or the device

419
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:54,220
I'm not really clear on that but it has

420
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:56,110
to have the same info on it I would like

421
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:57,970
to have some additional as a user of an

422
00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:00,899
eye dev ID in my protocol I would like

423
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:04,270
to have some understanding of the

424
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:07,300
certificate path relationship with the

425
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:09,760
thing that's doing that part and it

426
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:14,919
almost sounds to me like my eye dev ID

427
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:18,370
should actually be a sub-sub samosa

428
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:22,090
Mertzon subservience certificate from

429
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:24,040
the one that's using attestation if that

430
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:29,320
actually might simplify things for the

431
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:34,830
manufacturers processes Michael thank

432
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:38,050
you so I this is this is an area where

433
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,220
on that first and that early slide where

434
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:42,850
we

435
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:51,190
the scope or the word thing is is the

436
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:55,750
escape hatch here by scoping this to

437
00:24:51,190 --> 00:25:00,900
embedded devices that means that there's

438
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:05,950
a relatively clear manufacturer and that

439
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:07,930
the the manufacturer has some control

440
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:10,750
over how the software works on the thing

441
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:14,890
is well I shouldn't mean to say this is

442
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:21,130
fundamental but as a way to think about

443
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:23,050
it for a router we build the router when

444
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:27,330
we manufacture the router we solder down

445
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:31,120
the TPM and before we ship the router we

446
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:34,000
configure an IDE EV certificate in it

447
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:38,500
and sign it with a key that's traceable

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,350
to the since I work for juniper to the

449
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:47,560
juniper root you know to the root root

450
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:50,260
certificate of the manufacturer the iak

451
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:53,889
the the attestation key I would see as a

452
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:58,420
peer to that that is signed using the

453
00:25:53,890 --> 00:26:03,640
same the same chain back to the the

454
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:09,660
manufacturers root key which is which

455
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:12,070
would be published and well-known okay

456
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:15,340
we're kind of running out of time here

457
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:17,050
guys so sorry Lawrence Lawrence is in

458
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,500
the queue and you will be the last one

459
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:22,149
but it has to be really quick okay

460
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,920
Lawrence Lin blade so in your first

461
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,480
bullet on the conclusion there I've

462
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,490
believed that you're talking about

463
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,640
identity and sark software integrity at

464
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:32,290
boot it only does all that all of us

465
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,250
that you've discussed about integrity

466
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:41,139
anti tampering and identity is all at

467
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:44,400
boot you know one second after boot if

468
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,930
there was if there was tampering or

469
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,270
something was modified with the software

470
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:50,980
somehow bug was found none of that would

471
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,990
be detected this this primarily is

472
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:58,330
focused on boot not on run time attack

473
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:03,280
check later is that correct yeah there's

474
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:07,960
a gray area when so for bios and loader

475
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:10,899
that's that's completely true for OS

476
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:13,660
level attestation it gets a bit grayer

477
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:18,309
because I mean we we are assuming this

478
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:20,260
is based on something like ima and ima

479
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:20,740
continues to run through the life of the

480
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,580
product

481
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:27,240
but the life of the boot but once the

482
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:30,699
thing I think your point is once

483
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:34,900
something has been launched it measures

484
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:37,900
at launch and after that it's you know

485
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:41,940
uh the riff is out of the out of the

486
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:50,860
picture so it's not intended to provide

487
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:52,870
runtime verification it ensures it tells

488
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,770
you what it was that launched it doesn't

489
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:58,629
tell you what it is it's running

490
00:27:55,770 --> 00:28:00,970
continuously does that answer your

491
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:04,120
question yeah Laurence is shaking assent

492
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:07,300
yes okay thank you okay

493
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,000
so with that what I wanted to ask you

494
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,270
and just as she's on to me to go as well

495
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,790
as the authors of this draft is the

496
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:19,620
intent that you would like to see this

497
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:27,250
draft adopted as a working group item or

498
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:28,989
something else Nancy so I will defer to

499
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:33,250
judgment of people who know better but

500
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:36,010
it seems like this could turn into an

501
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:39,400
informational RFC right that it's not

502
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:43,120
intended to be normative but at the same

503
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:47,679
time it does seem useful to have a use

504
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:51,639
case that works all the way through the

505
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,620
whole flow and so we can tell whether

506
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:57,940
all of the parts are there and they and

507
00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:01,540
they all work together okay so I guess

508
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,470
the question is and I will pose it to

509
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:09,070
the group

510
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:13,120
um I'm sorry now so since we're talking

511
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:15,189
about this topic so it seems like what

512
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:18,008
I'm hearing you say and what I've heard

513
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:21,240
from some of the feedback is that there

514
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:24,279
is value in what you're describing

515
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,830
potentially as a use case or potentially

516
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,190
as an influence to what may be in the

517
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:35,620
architecture so what I'd like to hear

518
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:40,570
from the group is your opinions on the

519
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:43,959
content either being in this draft and

520
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:48,600
going informational so the three options

521
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:53,169
are going informational with this draft

522
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:55,418
incorporating the content into either a

523
00:29:53,169 --> 00:30:04,289
use case or part of the architecture or

524
00:29:55,419 --> 00:30:07,809
both or the third is nothing at all so

525
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:10,360
well no I said I was leaving that 15

526
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:13,899
minutes as a buffer at the end but given

527
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:16,570
that we're in this context yeah yeah so

528
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:17,949
so if I could just inject kind of one

529
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,960
more thing before we start talking just

530
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:21,669
as a reminder based on how thing how we

531
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,970
wrote up some things in the chartering

532
00:30:21,669 --> 00:30:27,100
use cases we're gonna specify the use

533
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:28,899
cases to document and achieve consensus

534
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,000
but we do not expect to publish them per

535
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:33,699
se just to remind everyone that's what

536
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,799
grows you set out so I'm gonna set four

537
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,070
minutes for this discussion and then we

538
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,860
move forward da Michael Michael

539
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:45,070
Richardson so having read the document

540
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:47,110
um and and felt that yes it was very

541
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:49,629
useful input into the architecture in

542
00:30:47,110 --> 00:30:51,789
the use case pieces what I assumed that

543
00:30:49,629 --> 00:30:53,469
was going to happen to the document was

544
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:56,379
the document was going to net then

545
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,470
proceed onwards to stake some claims and

546
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:03,490
write some normative language and become

547
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:08,019
a standards track profile of the thing

548
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:10,899
of the architecture okay so that if I

549
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:12,850
wanted to buy a product that had Riv in

550
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:14,678
it I would specify this standards track

551
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,120
document which would then refer to the

552
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:17,800
architecture and the N

553
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,899
eat if that was appropriate or whatever

554
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:22,750
that's what I assumed that this was

555
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,670
going this document is going to that yes

556
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:26,560
it only describes a use case right now

557
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:28,450
is because they don't have a we haven't

558
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:31,060
told them how to describe this the

559
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,410
solution based on the architecture but

560
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:35,770
that that would come late that would

561
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,780
come afterwards there and that the part

562
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:41,980
that's there now motivates the rest of

563
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:43,750
the piece of the implementation right

564
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,540
sorry the parts that's there the piece

565
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:48,460
of the document that we have now was you

566
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,230
know saying this is what our problems

567
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:52,180
problem that we want we don't know how

568
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,100
to solve it yet but so please build an

569
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,570
architecture so that we can solve it and

570
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,070
once you've told us that we'll explain

571
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:58,870
how we're using the architecture to

572
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,520
solve it that's what my understanding of

573
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:06,969
the doctrine was but maybe that doesn't

574
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:08,680
match other people's Taylor I agree that

575
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:10,570
all four of those mean the three that

576
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:13,150
Roman mentioned and the one that Michael

577
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:14,500
mentioned our options I don't have

578
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,970
enough information to choose between

579
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,000
those yet

580
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,440
I have comments in the document but I

581
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,910
don't have enough information and so I

582
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,530
think Michaels comment was similar that

583
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,910
he doesn't know whether they intend is

584
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:26,470
to be standards track or not depending

585
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,430
on what the working group wants to do

586
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:31,480
what the authors want to do with this

587
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:33,310
document I will say that I think that

588
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:34,300
the title of the slides was actually

589
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:36,970
work there than the title of the

590
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:39,700
document and so what is the scope right

591
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:41,500
is the scope going to include claims is

592
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:43,870
it just the informational stuff which is

593
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,180
what guy was talking about if you stick

594
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,620
with what guy said meaning it does not

595
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:50,530
include any normative content that

596
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,750
Michael was talking about then probably

597
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,760
somewhere between option two or three

598
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:55,960
I'm fine with either of those I don't

599
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:58,510
remember what option number one was

600
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,070
other one was adopt the document as

601
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,890
working goodbye to me oh I hope that was

602
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:05,080
what number two was no number one was

603
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,940
adopted as oh sorry okay I don't 1 or 3

604
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,530
I don't have a preference between those

605
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,520
two as long as the scope was right I

606
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,899
don't have enough information to

607
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,580
actually have an opinion between those

608
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:14,320
and I would say Michaels option is

609
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:17,139
actually a third one which is one three

610
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,879
or four but not to to I think it should

611
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,770
be so the architecture document should

612
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,360
be very generic and this has a bunch of

613
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,400
specific things in there there are

614
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,229
pieces of this that actually do do

615
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,910
reflect and are already in the

616
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:29,380
two-sample architecture documents and

617
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,240
Hank is nodding

618
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,650
I don't think more details at the level

619
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,540
of this one goes in the architecture

620
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:41,080
documents yeah hold on Kathleen is on

621
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:44,980
there hi um

622
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:47,050
so just to clarify if this is adopted as

623
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,210
informational I just want to make sure I

624
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:51,580
heard what Roman said correctly it

625
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:53,230
wouldn't get published anyway and are we

626
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:56,679
looking at the architecture in use case

627
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,240
is not getting published sorry I was

628
00:33:56,680 --> 00:34:00,610
reacting to we were talking about this

629
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,000
as a potential use case document and I

630
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:06,159
was just rereading the Charter here and

631
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,350
reminding us that the way we wrote the

632
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:11,770
Charter is that the use cases do not get

633
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:13,870
publishes okay all right no I I think

634
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,870
this goes a little bit more into detail

635
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:19,589
than the use cases so without any hats I

636
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:21,909
do support it being adopted

637
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:24,520
informational or getting merged somehow

638
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,550
but I think I also agree with Dave that

639
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:30,009
it doesn't quite fit this specificity of

640
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:35,440
it into the architecture document but

641
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:37,570
it's good work yeah I think I have to

642
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,270
agree that the community shouldn't lose

643
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:43,750
the content and and Micah I think both

644
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:46,360
are very good this is option 4 we have

645
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:50,100
the option to create profiles that are

646
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:50,100
information implementation specific

647
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,399
refinements of the architecture that

648
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:56,949
help you to actually implement all the

649
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,040
parts for a specific domain this concept

650
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:02,259
is called the profile of the article a

651
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:05,070
better term of this it is literally

652
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,380
using the building blocks to define a

653
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:10,180
complete solution for your domain of

654
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:13,150
application and that is very helpful

655
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:16,960
roof is a explicit domain of application

656
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:21,370
for the pets and therefore it could be

657
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:24,610
used as a first try out to create such a

658
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:28,299
solution document again profile being a

659
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:29,740
working title of the architecture ok so

660
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,320
I think we're done with this discussion

661
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:36,100
since I said four minutes we're new into

662
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,910
five so what I'm hearing from the

663
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:43,240
working group is that more clarity on

664
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:47,799
the intent of the document from the

665
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:51,399
authors is needed so guy in just maybe

666
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:55,450
we can take it offline but I still

667
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:59,140
encourage feedback on the document from

668
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:03,098
the group but recommendation and

669
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,560
guidance guy in and Jess's that help the

670
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:08,800
group get more clarity onto the intent

671
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,820
moving forward with the draft okay okay

672
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,420
thank you

673
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:16,570
I do have comments from Dave which I

674
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:19,150
will incorporate I didn't didn't have

675
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:23,050
any time for this but we'll we will

676
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:24,760
respond to that okay thank you so okay

677
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:33,640
with that we can move on to the

678
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:36,130
architecture yeah so um for those who

679
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:41,859
may not have been monitoring the mail

680
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:44,290
list closely we up until anyway for a

681
00:36:41,859 --> 00:36:46,240
few weeks we have had a lot of

682
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:49,589
discussion on the mailing list because

683
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:54,819
there are now two different drafts that

684
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:58,540
speak to a rat architecture it appeared

685
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:00,099
from the chairs view that we were not

686
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,910
going to reach consensus so from that

687
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:06,630
standpoint as chairs we defined an

688
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:10,210
editorial slash design team to come up

689
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:14,349
with an architecture draft with a new

690
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:18,910
architecture draft that can be used for

691
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:21,070
the frets so in the design team we have

692
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,580
Dave Thaler

693
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:28,510
hey Burke Holtz Michael Richardson and

694
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:32,109
then Smith so they have met and they I

695
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:35,109
think to three side meeting at Street

696
00:37:32,109 --> 00:37:38,500
this week and so I asked them to report

697
00:37:35,109 --> 00:37:41,589
out on the progress and path forward and

698
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:46,510
so Dave I guess you're the short straw

699
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:50,020
and is presenting the results okay Thank

700
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:52,570
You Nancy yeah so we met once during the

701
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:56,650
hackathon and we met on Tuesday morning

702
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:58,599
and then again on Thursday morning

703
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,339
so Thursday morning we actually went

704
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:02,890
over these slides I don't think that

705
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:04,480
they've changed other than the editors

706
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,920
are that the people in the design team

707
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,170
that sent me Corrections I think are all

708
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,339
in here and so let's go ahead and start

709
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:13,599
where you got to go into full screen

710
00:38:09,339 --> 00:38:13,900
mode and see sometimes you have to do it

711
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,619
twice

712
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:20,289
all right yeah okay so the first

713
00:38:17,619 --> 00:38:24,690
question was actually posed in the list

714
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:27,190
but I think it was your guns months ago

715
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,599
so the first question is is the

716
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:30,339
architecture document intended to be

717
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,480
informational or standards track because

718
00:38:30,339 --> 00:38:33,759
they're actually across different

719
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,819
working groups or exist precedents both

720
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,930
ways and so we asked the chairs and at

721
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,700
least one of the chairs said

722
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:42,009
informational please because the dot

723
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,839
that charter doesn't actually say and so

724
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,400
this is a question for the working group

725
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,109
if there's any objections to that list

726
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,609
no but otherwise the editors you're in

727
00:38:47,109 --> 00:38:50,230
agreement and so that is what we're

728
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:55,779
working with right now unless we're told

729
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:57,430
otherwise okay after we got past that

730
00:38:55,779 --> 00:39:00,309
which was in the sunday meeting then the

731
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:01,808
next question was well and this is kind

732
00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:04,089
of a question that Jurgen raised which

733
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:05,770
is I see 2119 language in a document

734
00:39:04,089 --> 00:39:07,569
that I thought might be informational is

735
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,670
that appropriate and so we actually had

736
00:39:07,569 --> 00:39:10,869
this discussion that says well who

737
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:13,240
actually want to use normative language

738
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:15,309
in this architecture document given us

739
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,020
informational or not because again

740
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:18,760
there's multiple precedents both ways

741
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,309
across different architecture documents

742
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,680
of the groups okay and so in that

743
00:39:21,309 --> 00:39:26,920
discussion when talking about 2119

744
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,720
language you know must should may one of

745
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,670
the questions is if you use it then who

746
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,919
is your audience of these mustards mays

747
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:35,319
that are meant for implementers or are

748
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,910
they meant for say admins that deploy it

749
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:38,650
or are they meant for spec writers okay

750
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:40,480
and so usually you pick one or perhaps

751
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,029
more that's a little bit more

752
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,529
complicated of those and so after a

753
00:39:43,029 --> 00:39:47,740
bunch of discussion our straw man

754
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:49,390
proposal which happens to match the same

755
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:52,078
discussion we have we had an equivalent

756
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:54,848
discussion in the teep working group on

757
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,190
Wednesday on the tea parka texture with

758
00:39:54,849 --> 00:39:59,289
exactly the same questions and the tea

759
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,970
parka texture discussion had the same

760
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:04,210
conclusion that we talked about in the

761
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:07,240
straw man proposal here which is the

762
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:10,619
that we believe as editors that the the

763
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,308
normative language is best in standard

764
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:16,289
or PCP documents and so if you pick

765
00:40:14,309 --> 00:40:19,589
informational that is most convenient to

766
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:22,019
not use normative language and so non

767
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:24,150
normative advice can be done without

768
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,890
2119 language right we can save the same

769
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,240
things and just not use the must should

770
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,339
make language what can you say the same

771
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:32,160
things in just normal English okay and

772
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:33,538
so this is what we propose as the answer

773
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,890
to your against question unless there's

774
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:40,529
any objections we're just going to do

775
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:41,940
this okay all right this is the process

776
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:44,180
that we're planning to follow for

777
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,549
creating the new architecture document

778
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:49,470
based on the two previous ones and any

779
00:40:47,549 --> 00:40:52,829
contributions we receive from you know

780
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:55,249
lisps or poor requests or whatever we

781
00:40:52,829 --> 00:40:58,890
have already created a github repository

782
00:40:55,249 --> 00:41:00,959
Thank You Nancy and Hank did the first

783
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:03,720
straw man check in at the first skeleton

784
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,789
check in it so the process is as follows

785
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,049
and if you're a tea person who happens

786
00:41:05,789 --> 00:41:08,430
to be in the room this is the same

787
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:11,009
process that we've been following in tea

788
00:41:08,430 --> 00:41:12,509
for two years or something okay

789
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:15,269
different working groups work

790
00:41:12,509 --> 00:41:17,309
differently in github given the overlap

791
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:20,488
between tea and rats we're proposing use

792
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:23,309
the same process that we're using in the

793
00:41:20,489 --> 00:41:25,680
teep working group which is anyone can

794
00:41:23,309 --> 00:41:26,970
file issues in github okay if you want

795
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,200
to make sure we don't lose it you can

796
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,578
post it to the list but if you want to

797
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,618
make sure we don't lose it it's helpful

798
00:41:29,579 --> 00:41:33,569
to file a github issue otherwise the

799
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:34,410
authors or editors can file those for

800
00:41:33,569 --> 00:41:37,470
you

801
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:39,239
which can also happen so it's not an

802
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:40,348
obligation that you can't submit

803
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:41,700
feedback without following an issue no

804
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:43,410
no we're just gonna use that as the

805
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:44,939
tracking mechanism if you sent it and we

806
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,078
think there's an issue then sure I'll go

807
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:49,380
ahead and file the issue for you if you

808
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,989
don't so the word caution there's is it

809
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:53,130
may take longer yes this is true but at

810
00:41:51,989 --> 00:41:54,779
least we don't miss anything so yeah

811
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,319
that's why feel free gave us feedback if

812
00:41:54,779 --> 00:42:00,869
you don't like this process but this is

813
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:02,880
so for poor requests the authors or

814
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:04,799
anybody else anybody in this room or

815
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,339
listening or reading the minutes is

816
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:10,410
welcome to file pull requests which then

817
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:12,869
allows people to review it and comment

818
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:14,460
on specific lines far more easily than

819
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:15,839
tracking stuff and email where it's

820
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:17,930
harder to figure stuff out and track

821
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,239
things so it's a great tracking process

822
00:42:17,930 --> 00:42:22,919
the authors think those four people will

823
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,860
review the pull requests and merge if

824
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,990
the author's agree

825
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,030
but the github issues will be closed by

826
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,439
chair is once they verify that yep they

827
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:31,600
think the that the editor is did the

828
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,250
right thing or at least followed the

829
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,920
right direction and of course new issues

830
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,290
can always be filed after that right but

831
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:40,720
so authors poor authors merge and chairs

832
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,220
close and so in future rats meetings

833
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,970
will just reference issues by github

834
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:51,609
numbers where they exist to make things

835
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:52,990
easier track okay if you have comments

836
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,570
feel free otherwise I'm just gonna go on

837
00:42:52,990 --> 00:43:05,020
unless there's objections yeah all right

838
00:42:55,570 --> 00:43:08,190
clarifying questions welcome Hank you're

839
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:10,750
tall mrs. Elliott the question is simply

840
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:13,410
relating to consensus and working group

841
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:16,840
consensus which is where is that

842
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:18,490
represented in this process I'm going to

843
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:20,620
give you the teep answer and the hopes

844
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,029
that that it would be representative of

845
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:24,130
what the chairs would say for rats

846
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,050
the teep answer is it happens here at

847
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,730
the chairs close github issue step and

848
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:29,230
of course the check on that is

849
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,540
eventually as a working group last call

850
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:33,400
that would be after that that new issues

851
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,870
can come up and so consensus happens

852
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,400
when working group last call says if

853
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,480
there's consensus on the document okay

854
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:39,010
so you're not gonna try and gain

855
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:40,930
consensus on individual issues on

856
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:44,530
individual issues that is the job and

857
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:46,180
the t p-- working group here is it's the

858
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:49,180
text that I'm worried about yes as

859
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:51,549
authors review memory there's just a

860
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:55,029
design team proposal right okay and so

861
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:56,560
the the chairs can say do they believe

862
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:58,450
it's consensus they could choose to keep

863
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,250
an issue open for multiple IETF meetings

864
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,649
and whatever they want that's up to the

865
00:44:00,250 --> 00:44:04,270
chairs okay and so the authors would

866
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:05,800
just merge and leave it to the chairs

867
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:12,550
they're showing consensus Michael

868
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:14,470
Michael so I'm not gonna walk the boat

869
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:18,910
on what you're doing because I'm willing

870
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:22,180
to give it a go the my experience is

871
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:25,750
that github is awesome for the design

872
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:28,899
team discussion because we can share the

873
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:31,450
share of screen in our in our group

874
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,120
discuss it and we can actually bash the

875
00:44:31,450 --> 00:44:37,210
text in front of her eyes and agree on

876
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:39,040
that thing I find it's less you

877
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,570
Foles great when when there's a end

878
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,120
users people not in the design team

879
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:44,920
opened the issues to record them I find

880
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,529
it's less good for actually getting

881
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:50,860
their consensus agreement from there and

882
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:55,180
so I would say to to Elliott that my

883
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:58,300
approach would always be to email back

884
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,129
on the list to say we believe that we've

885
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:04,750
solved your problem in the following way

886
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:07,270
here's the DIF okay and creating the

887
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:10,630
thread that allows them to agree or

888
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:13,330
disagree without necessarily going back

889
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:18,790
to github because I find that we lose we

890
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:20,500
we lose the the drive by opinions that

891
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,300
would otherwise not have bother to look

892
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,980
and didn't realize we weren't solving

893
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:26,020
something so the clarification and the

894
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:29,740
reality sorry I strongly agree with

895
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:32,140
Michael that actually is the reality

896
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:33,939
only it is we go through especially in

897
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,400
the face-to-face meetings we go through

898
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:39,160
even if the chairs have closed them we

899
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:44,380
go through the issues as we go through

900
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:47,259
the revision updates Elliott's not on

901
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:49,150
the mic but I think that the part of

902
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,520
Michael's main point if I got it right

903
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,740
which I agree with right is that for

904
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:56,050
back and forth discussion on the list to

905
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,419
get consensus on text that's better done

906
00:45:56,050 --> 00:46:00,130
across email rather than as a bunch of

907
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,690
comments inside the github issues it's

908
00:46:00,130 --> 00:46:04,060
okay either way but Michaels saying is

909
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,230
actually better yeah I asked normal list

910
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,000
discussion and that's the part that I

911
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:08,860
said I actually agree with that and so

912
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,870
thank you for summarizing that way yeah

913
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:12,390
lawrence l'm glad we can take this later

914
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:15,790
if you want but I was going to ask about

915
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:17,529
the pace of publishing drafts and and

916
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:19,330
what the decision points there if

917
00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:20,980
there's anything in that we haven't had

918
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:23,529
a discussion among editors and so if you

919
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:24,790
have a request we are listening just

920
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,990
between the four of us we didn't

921
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,300
actually ask that question as to how

922
00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:30,009
often how often do we want to publish

923
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,720
another submit an internet draft versus

924
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:33,220
working off at the github copy great

925
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,990
question I don't have an answer

926
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,250
personally I would concur with the

927
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:40,359
chairs and go along with what other

928
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,920
people want so all right and since that

929
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,180
was a question that a request to follow

930
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,290
a process I want to keep going you get

931
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:46,549
two technical points here so we have

932
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:50,150
time to get to technical stuff yeah

933
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:53,150
all right so discussion of use cases

934
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:56,230
okay both of the individual submissions

935
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:59,630
around architecture do cover use cases

936
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,640
with text that has adapted from micro

937
00:46:59,630 --> 00:47:04,040
Richardson's use cases document that was

938
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:06,109
not intended for RFC so both versions

939
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:07,820
actually do pull in some things in his

940
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:10,610
document there's actually two categories

941
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:12,580
of things without using a term for those

942
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:14,840
things there are solution agnostic

943
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:16,160
scenarios and again I'm making up terms

944
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,840
here and there are things that are

945
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,190
solutions specific mechanisms you can

946
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,690
see examples and things there that are

947
00:47:19,190 --> 00:47:21,860
solutions specific that it walks through

948
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:24,230
they're actually two different sections

949
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,790
and so the question is should the

950
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:28,040
architecture document include either

951
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:30,740
those two categories right and so the

952
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,690
precedents from both of the individual

953
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:34,250
submissions are as that category one is

954
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:36,290
included in the architecture document

955
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,170
category two is not included in the

956
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:41,210
architecture document okay and so this

957
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,620
is a question because by default we will

958
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:43,700
follow the same thing since all the

959
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:45,529
editors were kind of used to that

960
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:47,960
neither document unless the working

961
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:50,000
group wants a different answer and that

962
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,920
gives if you don't want category one in

963
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,710
the architecture document at all let us

964
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:56,960
know Nancy did suggest moving the use

965
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:58,730
cases to an appendix in both of the

966
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,740
contributions there in the main body

967
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:03,620
towards the top were open to that

968
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:06,439
discussion as well again by default will

969
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:07,910
default to what the editors did in the

970
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,110
source documents but if the working

971
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,220
group has direction this is not a

972
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,890
technical issue right so we should

973
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:14,450
time-boxed any comments and this one but

974
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:16,700
yeah easy time watching hi this is Hank

975
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,129
I just wanted to highlight that Nevada I

976
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,080
wanted to have use cases early on next

977
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,650
to the terminology and not in the

978
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,670
appendices

979
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:28,550
in order to catch the readers eye so

980
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:31,720
that is easy for a new leader for the

981
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:34,010
document to identify itself with the

982
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:38,450
architectural document with same goes

983
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:41,030
with the message roll on diagrams we

984
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:44,270
have in order to create is feeding okay

985
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:47,360
if I can find myself in here again this

986
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:49,550
is just one information at all I comment

987
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,620
about the structures document and we can

988
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:53,510
of course sure put them in the appendix

989
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:55,880
but there's related to or both

990
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,600
approaches so those are our three

991
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:57,890
options

992
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,279
keep it where it is in the body move the

993
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:01,919
appendix or have them not me

994
00:48:59,279 --> 00:49:04,079
draft currently they are in the body I

995
00:49:01,919 --> 00:49:05,609
don't know if we want even asked the

996
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:06,959
question right now or just say if you

997
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:09,929
have opinions please send it to the list

998
00:49:06,959 --> 00:49:12,689
I would just moving on let's actually

999
00:49:09,929 --> 00:49:15,869
get to the technical topics here okay

1000
00:49:12,689 --> 00:49:17,308
in attestation you have entities that

1001
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:19,249
need to trust other entities and that

1002
00:49:17,309 --> 00:49:21,299
means you have to have some way of

1003
00:49:19,249 --> 00:49:22,549
provisioning that initial trust

1004
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:26,579
relationship okay

1005
00:49:22,549 --> 00:49:28,709
currently the establishment of the trust

1006
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:30,749
relationship is not a cessation itself

1007
00:49:28,709 --> 00:49:34,828
and so the solutions for establishing

1008
00:49:30,749 --> 00:49:36,448
that are currently treated as being out

1009
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:39,299
of scope of threats working group to the

1010
00:49:36,449 --> 00:49:41,369
solutions but the existence of trust

1011
00:49:39,299 --> 00:49:43,499
establishment and the relationship to

1012
00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:44,909
attestation how you provision it is in

1013
00:49:43,499 --> 00:49:46,348
scope you have to describe the intent

1014
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,939
thing in the architecture and so the

1015
00:49:46,349 --> 00:49:49,979
current belief is that we should talk

1016
00:49:47,939 --> 00:49:51,269
about it in the architecture but not

1017
00:49:49,979 --> 00:49:52,859
going to solution details there's no

1018
00:49:51,269 --> 00:49:54,328
solution documents goes out of scope for

1019
00:49:52,859 --> 00:49:55,589
the working group well we at least have

1020
00:49:54,329 --> 00:49:57,150
to describe the relationship and the

1021
00:49:55,589 --> 00:49:59,939
expectations around what would be there

1022
00:49:57,150 --> 00:50:02,849
okay and so here's examples of things

1023
00:49:59,939 --> 00:50:05,279
that's in the trust model section and

1024
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:07,650
the failure architecture as to who

1025
00:50:05,279 --> 00:50:08,909
trusts whom and this is the style of

1026
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:11,819
stuff that would be in the architecture

1027
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:13,559
document when we combine stuff so you

1028
00:50:11,819 --> 00:50:16,619
can see so-and-so trust so-and-so and

1029
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,269
who let's see there's a term here on

1030
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:20,159
other slides and stuff we've been using

1031
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:21,629
the term a searcher but a bunch of

1032
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,789
people who are claiming that a searcher

1033
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,900
was confusing I was one of them but a

1034
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:26,969
bunch of people on the list said that

1035
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:29,369
and so among the authors we are not when

1036
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:34,189
they use the term endorser for the

1037
00:50:29,369 --> 00:50:36,029
entity that sends endorsements okay a

1038
00:50:34,189 --> 00:50:38,428
potentially other things besides

1039
00:50:36,029 --> 00:50:40,079
endorsements yeah yeah the in other

1040
00:50:38,429 --> 00:50:41,699
words this is just a rename of this term

1041
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,799
to that term because a searcher was

1042
00:50:41,699 --> 00:50:45,900
found to be confusing between things

1043
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,569
that generate assertions could be other

1044
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,650
those rules and this is and so on and so

1045
00:50:48,569 --> 00:50:51,779
that's just a highlight that we're

1046
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:54,419
planning to change that and so the

1047
00:50:51,779 --> 00:50:56,519
endorser formally the ax tester right is

1048
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:58,589
often a manufacturer that imprints key

1049
00:50:56,519 --> 00:51:00,149
material into the tester but it could

1050
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:02,038
also be some other entity that

1051
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,779
prohibitions key material later on if

1052
00:51:02,039 --> 00:51:05,459
there's a way to do that and for example

1053
00:51:03,779 --> 00:51:07,650
some documents you determine for this

1054
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:09,419
okay so I'm saying this is a style of

1055
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:13,640
discussion that would be in the in the

1056
00:51:09,419 --> 00:51:17,819
combined document okay there's a catch

1057
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:19,049
hi I am the jabber scribe because

1058
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:20,609
apparently there isn't one in the room

1059
00:51:19,049 --> 00:51:26,520
so I don't know if you're taking jabber

1060
00:51:20,609 --> 00:51:31,529
spread comments like that Kira I curious

1061
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:35,509
in the back there's been a bunch and

1062
00:51:31,529 --> 00:51:37,680
they haven't been done before though I

1063
00:51:35,510 --> 00:51:41,130
always like to relay Kathleen go ahead

1064
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,328
yeah Thomas harjo no and I'm sorry if I

1065
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:44,839
mispronounced your name

1066
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:46,799
yes needs to state trust relationship

1067
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:49,650
for example business and legal

1068
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:54,960
relationship without stating solutions

1069
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:57,230
yeah that is the proposal okay all right

1070
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:02,369
so I'm gonna keep going then thank you

1071
00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:03,869
all right next topic this is all right

1072
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:06,329
so there was a bunch of previous

1073
00:52:03,869 --> 00:52:07,980
discussion around background check and

1074
00:52:06,329 --> 00:52:10,170
passport models and of course we should

1075
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,480
keep in mind that models are just models

1076
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:14,880
there's no intent that models is like

1077
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,859
prescriptive or by way of limitation

1078
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,109
there are useful way to describe things

1079
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:20,400
so that when we're talking about things

1080
00:52:19,109 --> 00:52:22,109
we have some reference things just like

1081
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,279
the the interaction model discussion

1082
00:52:22,109 --> 00:52:25,470
right you don't have to do it that way

1083
00:52:23,279 --> 00:52:26,730
because a reference guide and so bottom

1084
00:52:25,470 --> 00:52:28,439
point models are intended to be

1085
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,789
representative not necessarily complete

1086
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:32,579
or illuminating please keep that in mind

1087
00:52:29,789 --> 00:52:34,849
okay so there was a discussion that the

1088
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:38,369
Riv document triggered that was about

1089
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:39,930
verifier initiated attestation and

1090
00:52:38,369 --> 00:52:42,420
exactly how that fits into the

1091
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:45,419
background into the models and whether

1092
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:47,250
we need to do model and so on and so one

1093
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:49,740
of the discussions at the hackathon we

1094
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,260
said well would it be useful to describe

1095
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:53,578
what the use cases are and maybe you'd

1096
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,440
have a different term than use cases

1097
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:58,579
what the motivations are for having

1098
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,069
verify our initiative things and so

1099
00:52:58,579 --> 00:53:03,660
here's two examples that came up in that

1100
00:53:02,069 --> 00:53:06,509
meeting or in the hackathon discussion

1101
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,730
of the tea Pratt's table and so example

1102
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:11,160
number one and this is summarizing but

1103
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,930
abstracting what's in the RIF document

1104
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,058
right so the first one is as an example

1105
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:16,680
the network notices some anomalous

1106
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,210
traffic that comes from a device and

1107
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,759
says whom something suspicious here

1108
00:53:18,210 --> 00:53:22,470
maybe I should find out what its access

1109
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,299
station or posture status is right now

1110
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,569
and so it proactively goes out to query

1111
00:53:24,299 --> 00:53:29,320
that thing to say hey you still

1112
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:30,610
Elfi or did something happen an example

1113
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,550
of another case that that may have

1114
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:35,530
happened is yeah so the health may have

1115
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:37,150
changed since it was less attested maybe

1116
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:38,890
it rebooted or what something got

1117
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:41,200
installed or whatever so this is

1118
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:42,310
agnostic as to whether it's TPM based or

1119
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,980
anything else it's saying I gotta reach

1120
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:46,450
out and say hey did something change

1121
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:49,390
what's your current status something was

1122
00:53:46,450 --> 00:53:51,399
odd second example is the network hasn't

1123
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,930
noticed anything that's odd but it wants

1124
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,090
to go off and do that anyway maybe does

1125
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:57,490
it periodically or maybe the networks

1126
00:53:55,090 --> 00:54:00,490
definition of what's healthy has changed

1127
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:01,899
you know so if you're using reference

1128
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,459
values maybe you're said if reference

1129
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:05,050
values changed and now you need to go

1130
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,460
and wreak worry Andry compare that kind

1131
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:08,820
of thing okay and so those are two

1132
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:10,900
examples of where you might want to do

1133
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,760
attestation that was initiated by

1134
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:13,840
somebody other than you test her she got

1135
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:18,190
to reach out to the administer so that's

1136
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:20,560
the case here in my document the o1

1137
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:23,950
version added this picture which was

1138
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,680
derived off of a picture in roof and so

1139
00:54:23,950 --> 00:54:28,689
in this example right the tester talks

1140
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:30,549
to a relying party which talks to a

1141
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:32,140
verifier which then needs to go and get

1142
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:34,270
the evidence via some other mechanism

1143
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:35,770
and Garett some result this is just one

1144
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:38,380
of many variations again this is not

1145
00:54:35,770 --> 00:54:43,750
prescriptive your variation may vary

1146
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:47,230
from this picture okay so the point is

1147
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,910
that the well first of all there's this

1148
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,500
notion of Auto band conveyance or in

1149
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,680
band conveyance or pick your favorite

1150
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,820
term right so in band conveyance means

1151
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:56,890
attestation is communicated across

1152
00:54:54,820 --> 00:54:59,080
whatever other protocol between the ax

1153
00:54:56,890 --> 00:55:01,569
tester and the relying party is already

1154
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:04,900
using right so for a tester is trying to

1155
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:07,180
use HTTP or OPC UA or co-op or whatever

1156
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:09,250
it is in ban means you're doing at SAS

1157
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:10,960
station across the same protocol whether

1158
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,620
you're passing evidence or attestation

1159
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:13,300
results

1160
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:15,490
maybe re right you just passing claims

1161
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:18,280
across some existing message that would

1162
00:55:15,490 --> 00:55:20,259
be in band okay out of bands means

1163
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:21,790
you're using some other protocol than

1164
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,800
the one that you're naturally using to

1165
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:25,420
access the relying party okay so the

1166
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:27,910
next two slides show four different

1167
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:29,830
categories of solutions with example

1168
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:31,930
diagrams again before I go on the next

1169
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:33,400
slides right the diagrams are not

1170
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,410
synonymous with the categories each

1171
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:36,610
diagram is an example of something in

1172
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:38,930
the category everybody got that

1173
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:41,150
okay so the definition is the

1174
00:55:38,930 --> 00:55:42,740
retexe not the diagram don't beat me up

1175
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:46,490
on the diagrams here examples of

1176
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:48,500
categories okay okay great yes you not a

1177
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:50,540
thank you okay now I can actually show

1178
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:51,530
the diagrams focus on the text so the

1179
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,319
diagrams are in case you don't

1180
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:56,480
understand the text okay here we go

1181
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:58,880
first example is the verifier queries

1182
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,290
the ax tester over IP right so net comp

1183
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:01,730
is an example of this right so the

1184
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,800
verifier sends off the message to a

1185
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:06,079
tester and comes back and of course this

1186
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,430
is at some point in time you know other

1187
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:09,260
things are happening too but the main

1188
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:10,790
focus is the exchange over here right

1189
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,349
the verifier reaches out and touches the

1190
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:14,058
ax tester okay and as well go through

1191
00:56:12,349 --> 00:56:16,579
these you'll see none of these

1192
00:56:14,059 --> 00:56:18,440
categories are perfect right every

1193
00:56:16,579 --> 00:56:19,760
category has some disadvantage which is

1194
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:22,309
going to motivate a there's is no

1195
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,410
one-size-fits-all okay so the first one

1196
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:26,150
that the example is well it doesn't work

1197
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,040
if there's like a firewall or something

1198
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,300
inside here that the verifier can't just

1199
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:31,099
reach out and touch the attest right

1200
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:33,380
this assumes that you're actually have a

1201
00:56:31,099 --> 00:56:35,690
server piece that's actually reachable

1202
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:37,220
on the ax tester okay but if you do that

1203
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:40,430
then of course yes this category works

1204
00:56:37,220 --> 00:56:42,230
fine second category is where the

1205
00:56:40,430 --> 00:56:44,210
verifier can reach out and touch the ax

1206
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,799
tester underneath IP so maybe there's

1207
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,270
some eat messages or something as this

1208
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:48,770
is just showing you got some long yeah

1209
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:50,990
low-level channel but it's sending the

1210
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:52,460
same type of messages across okay and of

1211
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,140
course this doesn't work on all link

1212
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,849
layers it only works on link layers that

1213
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:58,808
use that particular you know below IP

1214
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:02,900
mechanism right that second category

1215
00:56:58,809 --> 00:57:04,970
here's the third category which says the

1216
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:06,530
relying party just gives like a referral

1217
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:08,180
or a notification that says hey please

1218
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:09,290
reach out in contact verify your X

1219
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,940
you're not going to get any farther

1220
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:13,308
until you pass the information to him

1221
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,780
okay and so in this case well this

1222
00:57:13,309 --> 00:57:16,369
doesn't necessarily work with all these

1223
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,990
protocols because this depends on you be

1224
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:19,609
able to pass this referral which may be

1225
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:21,618
an extra message that didn't exist or

1226
00:57:19,609 --> 00:57:23,119
something right

1227
00:57:21,619 --> 00:57:24,260
so this is like your referral or a pass

1228
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,490
I don't have an example there I don't

1229
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:31,849
know if there is one but it is a

1230
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:33,430
possible category not shown on this

1231
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:38,510
diagram they should have those extras

1232
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:40,520
have these def Jerris here

1233
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,829
that's not intentional that arrow there

1234
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:44,869
should be over there too okay and that's

1235
00:57:42,829 --> 00:57:46,970
an answer to where didn't realize come

1236
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:48,260
back yeah so it could be for example and

1237
00:57:46,970 --> 00:57:51,109
ever these diagrams are examples it

1238
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:52,520
should be one two three four or it could

1239
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:54,259
be one message

1240
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,750
two three four there's lots of different

1241
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:58,100
variations of this right but yes sorry

1242
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:59,990
my bad that little arrow should be

1243
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:02,390
between their two all right and the

1244
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:04,040
fourth category is the attest er keeps

1245
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:06,109
some persistent connection open with the

1246
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,759
verifier over IP such as you know a

1247
00:58:06,110 --> 00:58:09,500
WebSocket or pick your favorite protocol

1248
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,300
which is a connect on the outbound

1249
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,800
direction that happens say at boot time

1250
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,840
or whatever and then some later time

1251
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:17,510
whether it's immediately or much later

1252
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,860
on there's some query or subscribe or

1253
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:21,350
whatever it is such that later there's

1254
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,940
an evidence err okay and so there's

1255
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:24,589
maybe a time delay between what

1256
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,810
certainly a time delay between 1 and 3

1257
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:30,040
and whether to happens a time of 1 or 2

1258
00:58:26,810 --> 00:58:34,009
eopns time of 3 may vary by solution

1259
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:35,720
okay so like WebSockets write the query

1260
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:37,220
may happen in much later time but for

1261
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,689
something like pub/sub the query may

1262
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:43,189
happen immediately on connect and the

1263
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:45,020
pub happens way later okay Dave yes just

1264
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:47,630
clarifying questions so this would be at

1265
00:58:45,020 --> 00:58:49,280
was Elliott by the zeliha so this would

1266
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:51,170
be in the case where you know it's

1267
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,300
happening in the application protocol

1268
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:56,570
and in bandwidth in the application in

1269
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,100
the band is always the line this

1270
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:59,330
horizontal at the bottom this is the in

1271
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:02,089
band stuff is at the bottom here

1272
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:03,830
anything that's this vertical lines over

1273
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:05,180
here that sorry the diagonal lines is

1274
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,590
all the auto band stuff so this is some

1275
00:59:05,180 --> 00:59:10,100
other protocol besides the normal

1276
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:11,750
resource access protocol though so boom

1277
00:59:10,100 --> 00:59:14,750
all four of these are in the outer band

1278
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:16,190
okay section okay none of these are the

1279
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:17,750
regular in band ones is what's shown in

1280
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,340
the classic slides for a background

1281
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:21,260
check and passport model beause the in

1282
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,790
band ones these are other variations of

1283
00:59:21,260 --> 00:59:26,030
the auto band variations we have more of

1284
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:27,290
a triangle type relationship which the

1285
00:59:26,030 --> 00:59:28,820
RHIB document does have one of these

1286
00:59:27,290 --> 00:59:30,380
triangle relationships and there's many

1287
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,790
different variations across different

1288
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,530
solutions you could construct that's

1289
00:59:31,790 --> 00:59:35,540
fits in this category so that would be

1290
00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:37,130
useful to have this tile style of

1291
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,360
discussion in an architecture document

1292
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,610
taking into account whatever feedback

1293
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:44,390
have for us whatever feedback people

1294
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:46,610
have for us okay buddy okay all right I

1295
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:58,279
want to keep going in all right next

1296
00:59:46,610 --> 01:00:01,030
topic you have a question can can you

1297
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:01,030
get ring a minor

1298
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:14,709
I'm from Thomas can a pistol don't find

1299
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:25,630
evidence at local stores to be pulled in

1300
01:00:14,710 --> 01:00:27,890
later by verifier yes yes yes Ida band

1301
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:29,780
that would be another very a I said all

1302
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:31,970
these are just examples of categories

1303
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:35,200
that would be another example in one or

1304
01:00:31,970 --> 01:00:38,270
more of these categories yes Michael

1305
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:41,180
David liquors to me as you're discussing

1306
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:44,240
the in band and out of band mechanisms

1307
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:46,250
it occurred to me that whether or not to

1308
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:48,229
ask whether or not there we need we want

1309
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:51,110
to distinguish between cooperative and

1310
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:53,840
uncooperative in band solutions ones

1311
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:56,090
where essentially we we can and the

1312
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,760
protocol owners wish to extend their

1313
01:00:56,090 --> 01:01:02,240
protocol to add communications for

1314
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:05,000
attestation and ones where we have to do

1315
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,680
things like stuff via hide the

1316
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:09,800
attestation and in you know a

1317
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:11,290
certificate extension that the protocol

1318
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,720
doesn't really know it's carrying and

1319
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:16,730
sort of it's uncooperative right but the

1320
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,410
two ends are gonna probably pull it out

1321
01:01:16,730 --> 01:01:19,670
and do something it's like a I don't

1322
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,049
know what the right word is hiding

1323
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:24,260
hiding

1324
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:26,450
it's an encapsulation but it's a you

1325
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:28,910
know we're it's a hack it really okay

1326
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:33,259
and so I wonder whether that is a

1327
01:01:28,910 --> 01:01:35,390
worthwhile attribute to a use case to

1328
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:37,310
say well we're having to work around an

1329
01:01:35,390 --> 01:01:39,770
existing protocol and that's why we

1330
01:01:37,310 --> 01:01:43,910
might do something weird I don't know if

1331
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:45,230
that's worth a comment or a category I

1332
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:48,170
don't know just throwing that out there

1333
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:49,700
no thank you yes I understand the

1334
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:51,320
distinction that yes the distinction is

1335
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:53,000
important I don't know yet whether it

1336
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:55,160
belongs the architecture so far what I'm

1337
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,320
hearing from you makes me lean towards

1338
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,180
yes but I have to think more and see if

1339
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:01,010
there's any reason for no because yes I

1340
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:04,040
understand the distinction and it's been

1341
01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:06,260
useful for protocol discussion say in

1342
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:07,310
the Microsoft document series to have we

1343
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:10,940
actually have terms for the difference

1344
01:02:07,310 --> 01:02:12,140
that you had there so if other people

1345
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:14,450
have an opinion on that then we know but

1346
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:15,319
yes great point well Michael you're part

1347
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:21,169
of the editorial

1348
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:24,830
I know so yeah anybody editor has been

1349
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:27,500
opinion let the editors know okay moving

1350
01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:29,270
on to the next topic relationship among

1351
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,430
formats again many of this discussion

1352
01:02:29,270 --> 01:02:32,930
has already happened but this is our

1353
01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:34,430
attempt to say we believe the

1354
01:02:32,930 --> 01:02:36,470
architecture document needs to have a

1355
01:02:34,430 --> 01:02:38,120
discussion this is the style of

1356
01:02:36,470 --> 01:02:39,830
discussion that we think is high-level

1357
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:41,839
enough to belong in the architecture

1358
01:02:39,830 --> 01:02:43,190
document are we on the right track right

1359
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:45,440
that's the intent of me showing this is

1360
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:46,790
to not really tell you hopefully things

1361
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:48,770
that you don't necessarily already know

1362
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:50,360
but to say this is what we believe

1363
01:02:48,770 --> 01:02:53,900
belongs in the architecture document is

1364
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:56,000
this style of information okay evidence

1365
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:59,060
attestation results and endorsements are

1366
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,560
three types of conceptual messages they

1367
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:03,620
can all have different claims formats

1368
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,700
and so I'm just gonna show I'm not going

1369
01:03:03,620 --> 01:03:06,170
to show the endorsements in the slide

1370
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,000
because it wouldn't fit and so between a

1371
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:09,320
testers and verifiers there can be many

1372
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:12,520
different formats and this is only

1373
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:15,500
showing ones that are either standard or

1374
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:18,140
at least potential standards from

1375
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,970
different organizations right now and on

1376
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:21,770
the right between here fires relying

1377
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:24,049
parties same thing and again there's dot

1378
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:25,880
dots because there exists many

1379
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:28,280
proprietary formats that are not in here

1380
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:29,990
right now so for example Intel's SGX

1381
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,060
format is not a standard and would go in

1382
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:35,330
this table so that's an example of a

1383
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:36,740
proprietary format and so the point is

1384
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:40,009
there's many of these there's many of

1385
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:41,450
these the ones on the left for any

1386
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,860
particular path may be different than

1387
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,450
the ones on the right if this was what

1388
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,740
was in Lawrence's presentation in the

1389
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:46,790
first Rats meeting where we talked about

1390
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:51,319
this

1391
01:03:46,790 --> 01:03:53,180
in the e presentation okay this

1392
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,530
continues on from the previous slide and

1393
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,839
so saying if we're going to use

1394
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,130
attestation with existing protocols

1395
01:03:56,840 --> 01:04:00,920
right because the things on the left in

1396
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:03,830
some cases evidence might be in banned

1397
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:06,680
in some variations and other variations

1398
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:09,560
attestation results might be in banned

1399
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,810
so evidence is in band in the background

1400
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:13,670
check model attestation results is in

1401
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:16,040
bound in the classic passport model and

1402
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:19,040
so all those are possible and so it says

1403
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:22,009
if you are using in band like in an

1404
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:24,160
existing protocol then this affects how

1405
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:26,690
we explain things as well as some

1406
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,109
constraints on things that solutions

1407
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:32,130
have to take into account if

1408
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:33,630
doing in band okay so for example since

1409
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,520
you need to be conveyed inside an

1410
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:37,470
existing protocol this is what Michael

1411
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,509
was just talking about you convey it in

1412
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:41,520
a way that that protocol is aware of

1413
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:43,440
like you're extending the protocol are

1414
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:45,420
you conveying it in a way that the

1415
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:46,830
existing protocol is unaware of and so

1416
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,570
you're kind of using that protocol as a

1417
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:50,040
transport alright those are the two

1418
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:53,850
terms I mentioned that we use is we use

1419
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:55,140
extension versus transport you can pick

1420
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:56,490
better terms those the terms that we're

1421
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:59,069
using right now inside Microsoft for

1422
01:04:56,490 --> 01:05:01,049
those two concepts and so some existing

1423
01:04:59,070 --> 01:05:03,600
protocols constrain the set of formats

1424
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:05,490
and so if you're going to use it as a

1425
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,799
transporter encapsulation so as an

1426
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:09,810
example of one that constrains OPC away

1427
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:11,940
only supports you got to make it look

1428
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:14,790
like an x.509 or encapsulated inside of

1429
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:15,960
an x.509 or two passes okay and though

1430
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:18,029
so what that means is that any

1431
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:19,740
particular solution fits into one of

1432
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:22,620
three categories at least I couldn't

1433
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:24,899
think of a fourth so the first one is to

1434
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:26,790
say whatever the native protocol uses

1435
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:29,460
right you use that format for claims

1436
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:31,470
okay so if it passes x.509 you it is

1437
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:33,300
x.509 extensions if you're using HTTP

1438
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:35,520
you can put it in a bearer token you can

1439
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:39,000
use a JWT or a CW T or whatever because

1440
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:41,100
that's native right second category is I

1441
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:42,510
could take the clings in whatever format

1442
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:44,730
I want and then encapsulate them the

1443
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:47,130
other format all right so I could add an

1444
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:49,560
x.509 extension that has a CW t or a

1445
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:51,300
cadet a CW t claim and as a JWT or I

1446
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:54,000
could add a JW cleaky clean that has a

1447
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:56,760
TPM thing or whatever it is so that's

1448
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,890
the encapsulation mechanism this one is

1449
01:05:56,760 --> 01:06:00,630
we're problematic for constrained nodes

1450
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:01,680
because you need multiple parsers right

1451
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:03,480
and so people have talked about I want

1452
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:04,799
to do this all with only one parser and

1453
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,740
my constrain no not have multiple

1454
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:09,480
parsers so and so that again for example

1455
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:10,529
that's why people like C bar is if in

1456
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,090
the constrained node you're already

1457
01:06:10,530 --> 01:06:13,230
using C board then I don't have to do

1458
01:06:12,090 --> 01:06:15,810
encapsulation I don't have to have an

1459
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:19,140
asn.1 parser or something else too

1460
01:06:15,810 --> 01:06:20,670
the third category is to do out-of-band

1461
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:23,940
right which is used some other protocol

1462
01:06:20,670 --> 01:06:25,740
to acquire the claims okay and so this

1463
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,630
just requires multiple protocols more

1464
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:28,859
messages and latency or typical amount

1465
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:31,170
of bands maybe you can find ways to

1466
01:06:28,860 --> 01:06:32,310
optimize that and so out-of-band ones

1467
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:34,230
might be more problematic for

1468
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:36,420
constrained networks or notes okay and

1469
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:38,520
so the point is any particular solutions

1470
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:40,480
you just say which category it's in and

1471
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:42,970
what the what the domain

1472
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,320
clickability is or its assumptions but

1473
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:46,118
generally as far as I know those

1474
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,850
solutions tend to fit into one of those

1475
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:50,830
three categories the fact that we have

1476
01:06:48,850 --> 01:06:54,009
multiple formats especially like

1477
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:56,200
multiple native formats is why this

1478
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,760
motivates and we think that having the

1479
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:59,319
architecture document explain the

1480
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:02,020
motivation for an information model is

1481
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:05,590
important and so the fact that you have

1482
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:07,600
to for in-band ones there's a desire to

1483
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:09,520
use native formats for things is why you

1484
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,900
have arguments for all these things on

1485
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:13,390
the left or on the right depending on

1486
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,830
which model it is and so that's why

1487
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,150
having the information is useful and

1488
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:18,580
that's the type of argument we can make

1489
01:07:16,150 --> 01:07:20,080
any in the architecture document that

1490
01:07:18,580 --> 01:07:21,819
then it justifies why it would then

1491
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:25,029
informatively reference information I'll

1492
01:07:21,820 --> 01:07:28,210
locking it um this is thank token

1493
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:30,310
preferring from the Jabbar multi-vitamin

1494
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:32,230
highlights that this is this working

1495
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:36,000
group is intended to be recharter if our

1496
01:07:32,230 --> 01:07:40,390
phase two and this in this second phase

1497
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:44,020
yeah okay now I trust the hardware now

1498
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:46,480
let me check your similar software and

1499
01:07:44,020 --> 01:07:49,030
then do the attestation so there's this

1500
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:52,000
this this role of the endorser that is a

1501
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:54,160
little bit of background now we only

1502
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,609
talked about it then very prominently

1503
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:59,170
use the same invent all band thing is as

1504
01:07:57,609 --> 01:08:01,720
we are describing here and we should be

1505
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:04,450
able to reuse all this concept in the

1506
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:13,779
second phase and then Auto not true make

1507
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:15,970
them let's run again thank you yeah

1508
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:18,040
Lauren stone but I don't know how far

1509
01:08:15,970 --> 01:08:20,080
you want to go into the details of this

1510
01:08:18,040 --> 01:08:23,410
discussion you mean now we're in the

1511
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:24,939
document yeah now I think okay I'm gonna

1512
01:08:23,410 --> 01:08:30,729
do the time check you have six minutes

1513
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:33,250
left okay then I'd like to go on okay

1514
01:08:30,729 --> 01:08:34,568
all right so if you have detailed stuff

1515
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:36,970
send it to the list or follow up

1516
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:38,920
afterwards if you have something

1517
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:41,339
extremely high-level and less than 15

1518
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,210
seconds feel free so I'll come it just

1519
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:45,700
you know I think this needs to be

1520
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:46,839
addressed but it assumes that there's a

1521
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,370
lot of things that need to be thought

1522
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:51,219
through here and like you don't mention

1523
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:53,229
signing formats which is a gating thing

1524
01:08:51,219 --> 01:08:53,889
here what what the harbor can sign and

1525
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,568
stuff like that

1526
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:58,480
so it's a question of how much detail

1527
01:08:55,569 --> 01:09:00,549
needs to be in the architecture so again

1528
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:02,500
just to reiterate the process we're

1529
01:09:00,549 --> 01:09:05,290
going through all this there is a github

1530
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:11,020
repo so Lawrence for any of these you

1531
01:09:05,290 --> 01:09:12,790
can issue file an issue yeah yeah I

1532
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,040
don't think it's even an issue of the

1533
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:17,408
architecture it's an issue of what

1534
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:18,908
drafts and what documents and what

1535
01:09:17,408 --> 01:09:23,290
formats we're going to decide what we're

1536
01:09:18,908 --> 01:09:26,049
going to do this presentation that's a

1537
01:09:23,290 --> 01:09:29,290
charter discussion all right next topic

1538
01:09:26,049 --> 01:09:31,389
is about claims profiles which we have

1539
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:33,130
talked about the need for but there's

1540
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:34,690
nothing that actually specifies any

1541
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:36,429
requirements the existence of it in a

1542
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:39,669
document and so we said the architecture

1543
01:09:36,429 --> 01:09:42,609
document should explain the concept of a

1544
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:44,500
claims profile and any architectural

1545
01:09:42,609 --> 01:09:47,109
expectations around the creation of

1546
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,790
claims profiles okay and so the point is

1547
01:09:47,109 --> 01:09:50,409
there's many different use cases or

1548
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:52,179
relying parties different relying

1549
01:09:50,408 --> 01:09:54,969
parties expect different things and

1550
01:09:52,179 --> 01:09:57,219
different claims so for example in teep

1551
01:09:54,969 --> 01:09:59,139
the tam is a relying party that has very

1552
01:09:57,219 --> 01:10:01,179
specific claims that are necessary or

1553
01:09:59,139 --> 01:10:04,690
expected by the Tam so therefore it

1554
01:10:01,179 --> 01:10:07,420
needs a claims profile and so a claims

1555
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:10,388
profile there's a short sentence on the

1556
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:13,570
slide here proposing a strawman

1557
01:10:10,389 --> 01:10:16,210
definition and a process that we have

1558
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:18,099
talked about in a previous IETF I think

1559
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:19,360
last time we said that claims profile

1560
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:21,820
should be done by the group that owns

1561
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:23,290
the use case well that's this group or T

1562
01:10:21,820 --> 01:10:25,330
or some other working group because

1563
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:27,250
there's different use cases and there's

1564
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:28,719
various precedents in terms of how DHCP

1565
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:31,030
options and yank modules and stuff is

1566
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:32,860
done so we could do a claims profile in

1567
01:10:31,030 --> 01:10:34,119
here but other groups over time will do

1568
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:36,219
your own claims for false as our

1569
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:37,929
expectation and so we would say

1570
01:10:36,219 --> 01:10:39,520
something like this New York detector

1571
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:40,270
document unless there's a more natural

1572
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,040
place to put it

1573
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:43,869
certainly existence the claims profiles

1574
01:10:42,040 --> 01:10:47,699
the process may or may not belong in

1575
01:10:43,869 --> 01:10:49,900
here I don't know yet okay okay a

1576
01:10:47,699 --> 01:10:53,349
testing multiple components this is a

1577
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:55,570
topic that also came up last IETF where

1578
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:57,219
were in Montreal and so we believe that

1579
01:10:55,570 --> 01:10:59,500
the architecture document needs to have

1580
01:10:57,219 --> 01:11:01,600
a discussion about testing multiple

1581
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,860
components and how different I'm going

1582
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,090
to use the word claim sets because I

1583
01:11:02,860 --> 01:11:07,269
don't know a better term for the sake of

1584
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,690
this discussion a particular piece of

1585
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:10,210
evidence

1586
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:12,549
or as a station results or whatever may

1587
01:11:10,210 --> 01:11:15,130
have claims from multiple components in

1588
01:11:12,550 --> 01:11:17,140
the same device there are concepts a

1589
01:11:15,130 --> 01:11:18,370
testing and attested environments that

1590
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,330
have been discussed a lot that I'm not

1591
01:11:18,370 --> 01:11:21,550
going to repeat now because I think

1592
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:23,650
we're familiar with those terms but

1593
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:26,050
these can be chained or layered it's so

1594
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:28,150
for example in a dice certificate chain

1595
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:30,880
right the hardware attest the firmware

1596
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:33,280
which then attest the OS which then

1597
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:36,640
attest the app so if this is in a te for

1598
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:39,009
example this might be you know trustzone

1599
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,260
and I put in trusted firmware and opti

1600
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:42,490
and some trusted application and so what

1601
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:46,120
you have is a search chain where each

1602
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:48,250
entity is the attested environment for

1603
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,720
the previous leg and the attesting

1604
01:11:48,250 --> 01:11:51,490
environment for the next leg and so you

1605
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:54,900
get this chain of stuff each with its

1606
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:56,820
own set of claims another example is

1607
01:11:54,900 --> 01:12:01,509
where so this is a linear relationship

1608
01:11:56,820 --> 01:12:03,070
example then there are one-to-many

1609
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:05,050
relationships and here's a bunch of

1610
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:08,980
examples here of a case we have a single

1611
01:12:05,050 --> 01:12:10,270
environment that a tests multiple what's

1612
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:13,750
the term that we used on Wednesday so

1613
01:12:10,270 --> 01:12:15,310
sub mods or something as an example and

1614
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:17,200
so there's a bunch of examples here so

1615
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:18,910
this notion that you have a root and

1616
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:21,550
various links between things as opposed

1617
01:12:18,910 --> 01:12:23,860
to just a test Jenny environment and a

1618
01:12:21,550 --> 01:12:25,570
test did environment okay can be more

1619
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:28,080
complex relationships and so in general

1620
01:12:25,570 --> 01:12:30,940
you have this tree of components each

1621
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:33,040
entry in the tree of components and the

1622
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:35,980
evidence or attestation results can have

1623
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:45,330
its own claim set with its own you know

1624
01:12:35,980 --> 01:12:45,330
information in it from Thomas also neat

1625
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:50,920
[Music]

1626
01:12:47,910 --> 01:12:57,160
very far to ask for only subset of

1627
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:59,770
claims not really under study okay sorry

1628
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,570
tickets also need to allow verifier to

1629
01:12:59,770 --> 01:13:03,910
ask for only the substance of the claims

1630
01:13:01,570 --> 01:13:05,200
ah ok good point let's make sure that

1631
01:13:03,910 --> 01:13:06,639
pairs in a minute so I don't have to

1632
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,720
listen to a recording or at least

1633
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,470
between the editor is one of us will

1634
01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:17,400
remember that okay thank you alright so

1635
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:19,990
the next steps is we have github merges

1636
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:21,000
work-in-progress and so our next steps

1637
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,530
are to try to take the

1638
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,970
information we received so far and

1639
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,170
submit a new draft and the hopes of the

1640
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:27,090
cherries will approve it as a working

1641
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:28,950
group document and that's why my title

1642
01:13:27,090 --> 01:13:33,870
slide had the proposed new file name

1643
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:35,340
which is draft IETF rats architecture do

1644
01:13:33,870 --> 01:13:40,110
you have a timeline for when you might

1645
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:42,780
have an address I'm looking at the other

1646
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:45,830
editors no not yet but we'd like one yes

1647
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:50,900
soon okay

1648
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:53,640
at some point nothing for Thanksgiving

1649
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:54,889
Thanksgiving was in October so what's

1650
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:00,830
the problem

1651
01:13:54,890 --> 01:14:05,010
so so I think we need a week to regroup

1652
01:14:00,830 --> 01:14:11,070
have an edit and start a frequent

1653
01:14:05,010 --> 01:14:13,830
editorial design meaning so next week is

1654
01:14:11,070 --> 01:14:16,950
Thanksgiving right okay so that's

1655
01:14:13,830 --> 01:14:19,170
already done so I would say that we what

1656
01:14:16,950 --> 01:14:23,309
I imagine is that we would post

1657
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:25,140
absolutely a new Rev you know a week or

1658
01:14:23,310 --> 01:14:28,680
two middle of December

1659
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:32,330
okay and then probably post a new

1660
01:14:28,680 --> 01:14:35,670
document every month or so okay

1661
01:14:32,330 --> 01:14:39,750
because integers are cheap that sounds

1662
01:14:35,670 --> 01:14:43,220
like a good stir okay that's assuming

1663
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:43,220
that we get adequate participation

1664
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:52,830
okay great job okay so thank you Dave

1665
01:14:51,450 --> 01:14:56,250
thank you

1666
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:58,019
architecture editorial team we'll look

1667
01:14:56,250 --> 01:15:00,570
forward to reading them you draft and

1668
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:16,020
with that let's move on to the yay

1669
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:20,090
module hi

1670
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:22,830
Hank had a room hello group this is an

1671
01:15:20,090 --> 01:15:25,040
update about the feedback from the

1672
01:15:22,830 --> 01:15:27,510
listen what we do adage about its

1673
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,820
respect to the yang module

1674
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:34,820
I am the presenter for a lot of people

1675
01:15:29,820 --> 01:15:39,380
the list as large as you can see so

1676
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:43,980
there was some need for clarification

1677
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:46,650
how why and in which form we are using

1678
01:15:43,980 --> 01:15:49,950
the yang module in the other yang in

1679
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:52,230
general in the concepts and the scope of

1680
01:15:49,950 --> 01:15:57,420
rats the remote authorization procedures

1681
01:15:52,230 --> 01:16:00,540
here to give a click overview yang

1682
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:03,480
modules and generals are written data

1683
01:16:00,540 --> 01:16:06,840
models as a specific language to write

1684
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:09,870
them these data models describe data

1685
01:16:06,840 --> 01:16:13,560
arrests but they also come with a

1686
01:16:09,870 --> 01:16:15,660
certain set up the api's for conveyance

1687
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:17,300
in this case we use them for remote

1688
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:21,230
attestation

1689
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:25,260
this module we have here uses a specific

1690
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:28,860
secure element this the TPM the TPM is

1691
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:31,800
has a very very defined interface that

1692
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,580
is by this so popular and that is why is

1693
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:35,100
often used

1694
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:38,100
please let me highlight that a TPM is

1695
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:41,970
not always a physical TPM and it can be

1696
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:44,760
a so-called F TPM which is a basically a

1697
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:46,560
TPM running and a te or some other

1698
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,420
shielded execution environment it is to

1699
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:51,090
really complete and its basic all the

1700
01:16:48,420 --> 01:16:54,150
firmware TPM also there can be virtual

1701
01:16:51,090 --> 01:16:56,940
TPMS those run in hypervisor Tom's and

1702
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:59,009
are accessible for VMs for example so

1703
01:16:56,940 --> 01:17:02,070
they are all using the same interface

1704
01:16:59,010 --> 01:17:04,380
they can all then have the source for

1705
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:06,509
the data store as as a yang module this

1706
01:17:04,380 --> 01:17:08,790
is important backgrounds here it would

1707
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:11,310
we would like to be a little bit more

1708
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:13,710
agnostic about this and not using only

1709
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:17,670
this interface but it is super common as

1710
01:17:13,710 --> 01:17:19,590
even other stos tend to use the TPM

1711
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,020
interface because this is there and it

1712
01:17:19,590 --> 01:17:25,530
maps to the needs so if we have another

1713
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:28,590
fully complete interface to another es e

1714
01:17:25,530 --> 01:17:30,509
or hyper security model you

1715
01:17:28,590 --> 01:17:33,300
could make this a little bit more

1716
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:35,880
Hardware agnostic but please again let

1717
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:38,280
me remind you the Hardware agnostic miss

1718
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:42,330
is already gone it is abstracted by the

1719
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:44,280
interface to the TPM the yin-yang module

1720
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:46,739
always comes with an English description

1721
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:48,509
so every is like a tree and it is trees

1722
01:17:46,739 --> 01:17:50,400
are statements the yankles all these

1723
01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:53,159
elements statements every statements

1724
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:55,259
requires you it's mandatory to have a

1725
01:17:53,159 --> 01:17:57,570
semantic description of the statement

1726
01:17:55,260 --> 01:17:59,880
otherwise you cannot host it as a

1727
01:17:57,570 --> 01:18:02,940
coherent yang while you and the data

1728
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:04,920
tracker as a union yang sign because

1729
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:08,790
written says no this is not good you

1730
01:18:04,920 --> 01:18:11,219
forgot description text and finally I

1731
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:12,900
was already talking about api's there

1732
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:14,820
are a lot of encodings here

1733
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:17,190
they're called encodings in yang some

1734
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:19,170
people call them civilizations for the

1735
01:18:17,190 --> 01:18:21,690
protocols that are already used they are

1736
01:18:19,170 --> 01:18:24,570
using all the same operations same api's

1737
01:18:21,690 --> 01:18:28,199
abstractedly but they can the conveyance

1738
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:29,670
civilization is xml Jason LC bore the

1739
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:32,250
corresponding protocols are called

1740
01:18:29,670 --> 01:18:37,040
Netcom fresco and cork on at the moment

1741
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:40,469
so there was one big item about

1742
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:43,400
conveyance of the various formats that

1743
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:46,409
we create here and the most prominent

1744
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:51,989
said invent opened agnostic forma that

1745
01:18:46,409 --> 01:18:55,348
we have is eat it is a CWT with a could

1746
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:58,138
be a very big set of our claim sets to

1747
01:18:55,349 --> 01:19:00,960
express both at station evidence and

1748
01:18:58,139 --> 01:19:04,340
potential other profiles later on as

1749
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:08,250
they was highlighting and architecture

1750
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:10,500
slide before so we propose as it was

1751
01:19:08,250 --> 01:19:13,949
requested on the list to have a very

1752
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:17,940
simple and opaque conveyance mr. metha

1753
01:19:13,949 --> 01:19:20,159
method in our yang module for eats that

1754
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:22,710
is relatively easy the only thing to

1755
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:25,679
proof is a pointing your Supra freshness

1756
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:28,590
so we have an RPC tiny X in front of

1757
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:32,280
this tree representation represents an

1758
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:34,980
RPC this RPC would input a nonce

1759
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:37,349
that will be reused in the creation of a

1760
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:40,379
each so we assume the eat is always

1761
01:19:37,349 --> 01:19:41,010
created recently and freshness is proven

1762
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:42,870
by

1763
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:45,989
the inclusion of the nuns this

1764
01:19:42,870 --> 01:19:50,220
cryptograph resigned into Z this is a

1765
01:19:45,989 --> 01:19:53,099
rather simple PC so to speak but yang

1766
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:55,800
wise speaking I was speaking to - yang

1767
01:19:53,100 --> 01:19:58,110
doctors and they are there if this is an

1768
01:19:55,800 --> 01:20:00,000
additional thing to other all semantics

1769
01:19:58,110 --> 01:20:03,120
you always have the other RPGs this is

1770
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,220
okay this is a convenience our PC to

1771
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:07,530
convey the same information in a very

1772
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:09,570
common data of civilization that you

1773
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:13,910
have in your working groups provision

1774
01:20:09,570 --> 01:20:13,910
space and now Michael goes to the phone

1775
01:20:15,860 --> 01:20:23,370
michael chesson so sir those with vision

1776
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,750
problems that says our PC not RFC so

1777
01:20:23,370 --> 01:20:32,040
it's not a separate document is a

1778
01:20:24,750 --> 01:20:35,220
separate call I have you know that not a

1779
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:35,940
typo no okay I was like huh oh yeah

1780
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,470
another document

1781
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:41,940
I'm all for another document okay that

1782
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:46,230
may realize that wasn't what you

1783
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:48,480
proposed so given that it is another RPC

1784
01:20:46,230 --> 01:20:50,370
and and want to make sure that people in

1785
01:20:48,480 --> 01:20:54,089
the room understand that that yang

1786
01:20:50,370 --> 01:20:57,239
describes mostly RPC type things but

1787
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:59,220
some of us hang on but some of some of

1788
01:20:57,239 --> 01:21:01,620
us are more familiar with using it to

1789
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:03,210
describe data at rest but that's not how

1790
01:21:01,620 --> 01:21:06,120
it was originally envisioned and and

1791
01:21:03,210 --> 01:21:09,060
this is in this is an RPC mechanism not

1792
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:11,010
a data at rest mechanism okay I'm just

1793
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:12,360
an important point to make for Peter

1794
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:15,989
that may have come to hang in different

1795
01:21:12,360 --> 01:21:19,589
ways so my question is does the the

1796
01:21:15,989 --> 01:21:23,370
resulting challenge-response which is

1797
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:26,190
the eat thing does it depend or contain

1798
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:29,580
any of the values which we would have

1799
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:33,330
found through any of the other data

1800
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:35,400
model interfaces to the TPM is there any

1801
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:38,430
relationship to what's here to what's in

1802
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:40,410
the rest of the piece of the dark not

1803
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:43,220
yet at the moment a each can only

1804
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:48,180
conclude what it is the each raft

1805
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:51,090
defines so if you're in a catch-all

1806
01:21:48,180 --> 01:21:54,020
exhibit TPM structure claim for example

1807
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:58,110
which I would not recommend in this page

1808
01:21:54,020 --> 01:22:00,210
Rosario then yes but per definition and

1809
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:04,170
each can only contain what is defined

1810
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:06,090
for each there enough that's that's that

1811
01:22:04,170 --> 01:22:07,740
doesn't answer my question because as

1812
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:10,820
far as I know and from reading your

1813
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:14,010
document the rest of that the yang model

1814
01:22:10,820 --> 01:22:15,960
TPMS have things like enough time not

1815
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:18,360
value which we haven't eat claimed for

1816
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:21,060
yeah I write there's more comparison of

1817
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:23,820
a few acclaim this is assertions that

1818
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:26,250
actually as a semantic identity of

1819
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:28,200
things that are involved both worlds so

1820
01:22:26,250 --> 01:22:29,820
would they be there would they be there

1821
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:32,730
in that in that thing that's what I'm

1822
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,910
trying to uh no it will not be the

1823
01:22:32,730 --> 01:22:39,089
consensus the tendency on the list was

1824
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:40,950
not to do this information model mapping

1825
01:22:39,090 --> 01:22:43,170
because it would be complicated and

1826
01:22:40,950 --> 01:22:45,900
would require an information model that

1827
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:48,600
is not only in one document but would be

1828
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,639
a global one because this semantic

1829
01:22:48,600 --> 01:22:53,070
overlap we are describing here is just

1830
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,650
one sitting in this module now and would

1831
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:57,750
span across a lot of things we can do

1832
01:22:55,650 --> 01:22:59,700
this this is up to the group to decide I

1833
01:22:57,750 --> 01:23:01,320
personally am very agnostic to this I

1834
01:22:59,700 --> 01:23:03,420
would really like to see this mapping

1835
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:06,240
because it makes interoperability very

1836
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:08,450
very very easier but it has to be

1837
01:23:06,240 --> 01:23:08,450
feasible

1838
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:18,930
Smart's so this looks pretty good to me

1839
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:21,420
if you had a device that does each style

1840
01:23:18,930 --> 01:23:23,850
at a station and not TPM style it seems

1841
01:23:21,420 --> 01:23:26,010
like this would be what you need if you

1842
01:23:23,850 --> 01:23:26,970
wanted to talk to it with yang so this

1843
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:28,980
looks pretty good to me

1844
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:31,170
the only addition I could see there is

1845
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:33,570
on the input side is being able to

1846
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:37,410
select which claims you want in the

1847
01:23:33,570 --> 01:23:39,179
eight yeah we can have something exists

1848
01:23:37,410 --> 01:23:41,910
in the the yang what do you could find

1849
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:44,610
an issue when this is adopted because

1850
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:46,500
maybe this is close to adoption I think

1851
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:49,410
and then we can run that in but I can

1852
01:23:46,500 --> 01:23:52,890
refer that topic to the novel side yeah

1853
01:23:49,410 --> 01:23:55,139
so thanks a l'heure on that topic which

1854
01:23:52,890 --> 01:23:56,760
is not why I got up here I probably

1855
01:23:55,140 --> 01:23:58,290
would want to see slightly more

1856
01:23:56,760 --> 01:24:02,990
alignment on the information model stuff

1857
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:04,980
so I'm not sure we're not talking yeah I

1858
01:24:02,990 --> 01:24:06,389
don't to call it information low I'd

1859
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,870
like to see more overlapping claims like

1860
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:09,700
Michael is asking

1861
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:11,380
when I got up here to ask unless you

1862
01:24:09,700 --> 01:24:15,010
have another slide on it is how does the

1863
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:17,530
color know which RPC to call how does

1864
01:24:15,010 --> 01:24:18,910
the caller know which are pieces the

1865
01:24:17,530 --> 01:24:21,849
network management station or whatever

1866
01:24:18,910 --> 01:24:24,730
that's that the network no speaking

1867
01:24:21,850 --> 01:24:26,800
module unions are distributed the

1868
01:24:24,730 --> 01:24:29,709
network client has it and then you can

1869
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:31,420
create a corresponding request my

1870
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:33,250
question you've got two different pieces

1871
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:35,290
in the same gang module you have the

1872
01:24:33,250 --> 01:24:37,150
energy attestation token request and

1873
01:24:35,290 --> 01:24:41,950
whatever the one that's the TPM data

1874
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:45,309
this already five are pcs in there this

1875
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:48,160
is 1/6 again dude you have to make a

1876
01:24:45,310 --> 01:24:49,750
decision what is the expectation for the

1877
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,430
courier is he supposed to know I

1878
01:24:49,750 --> 01:24:53,560
preached making the call as he supposed

1879
01:24:51,430 --> 01:24:55,000
to know whether there is a TPM or an

1880
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:56,410
Eaton he has to make the right call

1881
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,750
how do you know which one of those two

1882
01:24:56,410 --> 01:24:59,769
is in the other end it's my question ok

1883
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,730
the document doesn't talk about it

1884
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:04,120
because this one isn't in there yet

1885
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:06,879
right it is correct it is with every IP

1886
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:09,160
API and it has multiple functions how do

1887
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,770
you know which function of an API to

1888
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:13,389
call for your specific purpose right for

1889
01:25:11,770 --> 01:25:15,190
this instance of that device how do I

1890
01:25:13,390 --> 01:25:16,690
know whether it's the kind of has a TPM

1891
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:18,280
that kind of hasn't eat which way how do

1892
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:19,960
I know how to call it oh this would be

1893
01:25:18,280 --> 01:25:22,690
this information which information scope

1894
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:25,330
is in there will be in the RFC's or the

1895
01:25:22,690 --> 01:25:27,339
internet draft then the doctor highlight

1896
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:29,140
the scope just for the convenience of

1897
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:31,840
the reader and refer to the respective

1898
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:32,950
documents my question that I don't get

1899
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:35,410
your question please rephrase the

1900
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:37,300
question then how does it know how does

1901
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:38,410
the color of the RPC know how does the

1902
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:40,600
color of the yank has the network

1903
01:25:38,410 --> 01:25:42,610
management station know whether to ask

1904
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:44,110
the device for TPM information or to ask

1905
01:25:42,610 --> 01:25:45,730
the device for each information how does

1906
01:25:44,110 --> 01:25:47,500
it make that decision I think there's a

1907
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:49,750
circular question because if you

1908
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:52,810
implement this you may have to admit

1909
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:54,850
implementation choices so if you are a

1910
01:25:52,810 --> 01:25:56,500
conveyance

1911
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:58,090
if you want to have a conveyance we eat

1912
01:25:56,500 --> 01:26:01,150
you know that as an implementer or a

1913
01:25:58,090 --> 01:26:05,470
management station shredders online she

1914
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:09,879
may be ok can you hear me

1915
01:26:05,470 --> 01:26:13,000
yes I want to answer Dave's question I

1916
01:26:09,880 --> 01:26:15,550
think it makes sense to there are two

1917
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:17,290
ways to do it one they can use other

1918
01:26:15,550 --> 01:26:19,330
models like the platform our inventory

1919
01:26:17,290 --> 01:26:20,800
model to figure out whether the device

1920
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:23,230
supports TPM based artist

1921
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25,300
or eat smith's at the station and call

1922
01:26:23,230 --> 01:26:29,440
the pc accordingly which is complex or

1923
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:30,849
keep the eats and TPM based our pcs in

1924
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:34,150
two separate models so that the

1925
01:26:30,849 --> 01:26:36,460
advertising device which says support

1926
01:26:34,150 --> 01:26:38,348
for a specific model itself will be

1927
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:43,449
sufficient to determine which RPC to

1928
01:26:38,349 --> 01:26:49,900
call you could add a feature statements

1929
01:26:43,449 --> 01:26:51,460
of the the yang module please add the

1930
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,750
entries into the document but thank you

1931
01:26:51,460 --> 01:26:57,130
for understanding answering my question

1932
01:26:52,750 --> 01:26:58,690
yeah that didn't get that so yeah

1933
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,309
there's a feature option and yang

1934
01:26:58,690 --> 01:27:01,659
statements that can tell you which are

1935
01:27:00,309 --> 01:27:04,770
the features provided by the young

1936
01:27:01,659 --> 01:27:12,280
module you can select by that thank you

1937
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:14,020
oh yeah having said that so from the

1938
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:18,579
list but probably derived from the list

1939
01:27:14,020 --> 01:27:20,710
is that one of the things that were came

1940
01:27:18,579 --> 01:27:23,469
up with the call for adoption is that

1941
01:27:20,710 --> 01:27:26,290
how is this inclusion of the switchers

1942
01:27:23,469 --> 01:27:28,179
actually going to work and this question

1943
01:27:26,290 --> 01:27:30,519
basically is yours how is it going to

1944
01:27:28,179 --> 01:27:32,380
work now with another RPC how do we know

1945
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:35,770
what can we request actually from device

1946
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:37,960
what is there so this is not about the

1947
01:27:35,770 --> 01:27:42,190
concept it is more about how does yang

1948
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:44,110
function in this concept and the other

1949
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:53,219
side the remaining my mic voice is going

1950
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:54,780
away this is right so the remaining so

1951
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:58,090
[Music]

1952
01:27:54,780 --> 01:28:01,449
on the lists are on the on the detail

1953
01:27:58,090 --> 01:28:03,909
side and on the feature section so it's

1954
01:28:01,449 --> 01:28:09,489
really going away and and we were using

1955
01:28:03,909 --> 01:28:12,848
the political process as we provided

1956
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:19,718
them for TV on let's architecture

1957
01:28:12,849 --> 01:28:23,530
already thank you I'll stall for a

1958
01:28:19,719 --> 01:28:25,960
second we enjoy spent my comment is

1959
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:28,059
actually a comment for a rib in other

1960
01:28:25,960 --> 01:28:29,530
words I believe there's some ones not

1961
01:28:28,059 --> 01:28:31,119
answered in your document and I believe

1962
01:28:29,530 --> 01:28:33,860
it's okay to not answer in your document

1963
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:36,320
which is how do you know the

1964
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:37,699
dress of the device to query okay I

1965
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:39,320
don't believe that's responsive we have

1966
01:28:37,699 --> 01:28:40,790
your document but it is the response

1967
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:42,440
from the other one to say how this fits

1968
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:44,150
into a workflow which is their stuff

1969
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:44,780
that happens that you get the larger

1970
01:28:44,150 --> 01:28:47,299
context

1971
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:48,469
so hey rib document people please take

1972
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:50,090
this into account and answer the

1973
01:28:48,469 --> 01:28:51,949
question there because I don't believe

1974
01:28:50,090 --> 01:29:01,730
that this document is the place to

1975
01:28:51,949 --> 01:29:13,419
answer my question taking good care of

1976
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:17,780
me no equipped I would come to the

1977
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:19,429
basically last point here we had a

1978
01:29:17,780 --> 01:29:22,400
discussion about is the title

1979
01:29:19,429 --> 01:29:26,119
appropriate because again it's very

1980
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:29,330
illustrative at the beginning the lot of

1981
01:29:26,119 --> 01:29:32,389
this using the TPM interface now as we

1982
01:29:29,330 --> 01:29:35,690
are introducing the each conveyance

1983
01:29:32,389 --> 01:29:38,810
mechanism also the Contra comment on the

1984
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:41,269
list was maybe the name should stay so

1985
01:29:38,810 --> 01:29:44,480
actually we are talking about content

1986
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:46,760
adoption here how we added the title of

1987
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,320
the draft it can be decided by the

1988
01:29:46,760 --> 01:29:50,330
workgroup at anytime before working

1989
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,989
group last call so I think this is a no

1990
01:29:50,330 --> 01:29:56,389
issue and we'll just see how the

1991
01:29:52,989 --> 01:29:58,669
document develops and go from there so

1992
01:29:56,389 --> 01:30:09,070
this is my last point on this slide I

1993
01:29:58,670 --> 01:30:12,739
think yeah the adoption question

1994
01:30:09,070 --> 01:30:14,989
my question is a scoping question

1995
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:16,459
because it sounds like you believe that

1996
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:18,349
you're going to add the each stuff into

1997
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:20,210
there right we talked about how there is

1998
01:30:18,350 --> 01:30:22,070
potentially a bunch of other formats is

1999
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:23,630
your intent to keep adding new formats

2000
01:30:22,070 --> 01:30:25,190
over time or to keep the scope

2001
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:28,130
constrained with fixed set today is my

2002
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:32,119
question I'm at my assumption is that

2003
01:30:28,130 --> 01:30:35,780
there will be no there will be a zoo of

2004
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:39,739
other let's call them representations or

2005
01:30:35,780 --> 01:30:43,040
encoding we want to push the opaque our

2006
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:45,379
PC could be easily enumerated identities

2007
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:45,870
it can be vendor specific we can add

2008
01:30:45,380 --> 01:30:48,480
that

2009
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:51,180
and then we are done with eat and yang

2010
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:52,889
here and and we have identities for

2011
01:30:51,180 --> 01:30:54,750
other formats that can be

2012
01:30:52,890 --> 01:30:56,550
vendor-specific augments to this draft

2013
01:30:54,750 --> 01:30:58,860
and we are literally extensible then

2014
01:30:56,550 --> 01:31:00,480
there is a standard yang method this is

2015
01:30:58,860 --> 01:31:03,150
frosty we have netted yet because the

2016
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,370
obviously is kinda new but yes we would

2017
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:08,070
stop at the scope here but allow for

2018
01:31:05,370 --> 01:31:10,950
very specific or custom augments okay so

2019
01:31:08,070 --> 01:31:12,509
sounds like you're saying you feedback I

2020
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:14,040
think the answer is you believe that we

2021
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:15,300
can stop at a fixed set as long as

2022
01:31:14,040 --> 01:31:16,650
there's an extensive mechanism for the

2023
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:18,960
vendor specific stuff and so we would

2024
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:20,219
have all the standard ones in here in

2025
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,350
which case we might actually consider

2026
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:23,880
adding an x.509 you know dice chain

2027
01:31:22,350 --> 01:31:25,740
right based one because that's not

2028
01:31:23,880 --> 01:31:27,240
vendor extensible and then maybe stop at

2029
01:31:25,740 --> 01:31:34,920
the four or something that was on my

2030
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:35,820
slide my question was the scoop for this

2031
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:39,120
one because he was asking about the

2032
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:40,620
title yeah and you can keep the title as

2033
01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:42,630
it is right now with your answer that

2034
01:31:40,620 --> 01:31:44,280
says if it's all the standard ones plus

2035
01:31:42,630 --> 01:31:46,500
and extensibility mechanism and I think

2036
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:48,179
your titles fine and bringing guys into

2037
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:52,230
the linux here is was a very good

2038
01:31:48,180 --> 01:31:54,060
example of another well I'm glad I did

2039
01:31:52,230 --> 01:31:58,080
the first call for adoption cuz it's

2040
01:31:54,060 --> 01:31:59,970
burned well over 150 emails only of

2041
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:02,820
which a handful besides the author's

2042
01:31:59,970 --> 01:32:08,700
actually said I approved the call for

2043
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:11,370
adoption so so from all of the feedback

2044
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:14,070
and now the discussions and the

2045
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:17,610
proposals that Hank and the authors have

2046
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:22,769
made I think it is appropriate to leave

2047
01:32:17,610 --> 01:32:26,610
it as the base yang module so with that

2048
01:32:22,770 --> 01:32:29,730
I didn't hear any well not here I didn't

2049
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:36,540
read any strong objections to the draft

2050
01:32:29,730 --> 01:32:38,780
itself a Michael Steele correctly okay

2051
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:38,780
go ahead

2052
01:32:41,699 --> 01:32:46,199
does the word I'm going to leave it as

2053
01:32:43,709 --> 01:32:51,690
the bass yang module mean that there's

2054
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:54,089
not an eight part in it no no I'm saying

2055
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:58,400
we're gonna leave the title as is oh

2056
01:32:54,090 --> 01:33:02,489
okay we're gonna add the other stuff

2057
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:05,280
okay right because the original call for

2058
01:33:02,489 --> 01:33:08,579
adoption was based on the first set of

2059
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:11,579
feedback which was this draft is two PM

2060
01:33:08,579 --> 01:33:12,209
specific so perhaps it should just be

2061
01:33:11,579 --> 01:33:16,139
titled

2062
01:33:12,209 --> 01:33:20,249
as the yang module specific per tip so

2063
01:33:16,139 --> 01:33:25,409
with that if we leave the title and

2064
01:33:20,249 --> 01:33:27,119
knowing that what Hank has proposed with

2065
01:33:25,409 --> 01:33:30,539
the addition of how you can incorporate

2066
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:32,459
it as an encoding and we know that

2067
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:36,268
there's more work that needs to be done

2068
01:33:32,459 --> 01:33:39,809
much like what we said with eat is does

2069
01:33:36,269 --> 01:33:42,239
the group have any objection to adopting

2070
01:33:39,809 --> 01:33:45,479
the current draft as a working group

2071
01:33:42,239 --> 01:33:48,449
draft and then we can actually allow

2072
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:51,329
people to put issues that we can track

2073
01:33:48,449 --> 01:33:55,518
and formally discuss so the Stickley

2074
01:33:51,329 --> 01:34:09,150
object again to adopting the draft

2075
01:33:55,519 --> 01:34:10,769
please hum if you are for adoption you

2076
01:34:09,150 --> 01:34:15,030
were asking for

2077
01:34:10,769 --> 01:34:17,459
objection first yeah okay so let me let

2078
01:34:15,030 --> 01:34:19,590
me rephrase it sorry what I meant to say

2079
01:34:17,459 --> 01:34:23,989
was I didn't hear I didn't read any

2080
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:28,590
objections so a question to be hugged is

2081
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:31,499
do you approve for the working group to

2082
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:33,959
adopt this draft as a working group item

2083
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:40,969
please hum if you're in favor of

2084
01:34:33,959 --> 01:34:49,070
adoption do we have an

2085
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:50,990
responses on the Java Akira okay so for

2086
01:34:49,070 --> 01:34:53,150
the note takers can you please note that

2087
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:55,639
there are many cameras on the jabber as

2088
01:34:53,150 --> 01:34:58,759
well okay

2089
01:34:55,640 --> 01:35:01,250
please hum if you do not want the

2090
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:11,060
working group to adopt this draft please

2091
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:14,900
hum now so I didn't hear anything okay

2092
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:18,710
anything on the jabber nope

2093
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:20,650
okay so I think we have clear indication

2094
01:35:18,710 --> 01:35:23,900
that we will confirm that on the list

2095
01:35:20,650 --> 01:35:26,900
okay so finally we can start tracking

2096
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:29,210
the issues all right thank you

2097
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:37,280
yeah I think you're for taking somewhat

2098
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:58,550
care for you sir this is your one okay

2099
01:35:37,280 --> 01:36:01,880
so way young hi everyone my name is Wei

2100
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:05,960
pan from Huawei this is a new draft from

2101
01:36:01,880 --> 01:36:10,280
Franken me and we want to bring the

2102
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:14,830
Netcom pops up and the mechanism to the

2103
01:36:10,280 --> 01:36:17,840
rats to use it to extend as an

2104
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:21,830
interaction procedure in the action

2105
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:24,650
model so for the interaction model we

2106
01:36:21,830 --> 01:36:26,809
now usually have the classic mode on the

2107
01:36:24,650 --> 01:36:30,080
challenge in a response mode it means

2108
01:36:26,810 --> 01:36:32,390
that the world of I will first send a

2109
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:36,050
request to the a tester and the band

2110
01:36:32,390 --> 01:36:40,880
that has to respond with the evidence to

2111
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:44,990
the verifier but it's it's kind of on

2112
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:48,560
demand remote attestation so it may not

2113
01:36:44,990 --> 01:36:53,209
be suitable for a very large network so

2114
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:56,869
we push we bring the young pops up

2115
01:36:53,209 --> 01:37:00,530
and push mechanism here to see the other

2116
01:36:56,869 --> 01:37:03,650
model is a published in a subscription

2117
01:37:00,530 --> 01:37:09,050
push model and the first the verifier

2118
01:37:03,650 --> 01:37:14,449
key just a subscriber to many devices to

2119
01:37:09,050 --> 01:37:16,639
say that it wants to know the to do the

2120
01:37:14,449 --> 01:37:20,239
remote attestation with these devices

2121
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:24,340
and then the devices can periodically or

2122
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:27,799
unchanged to respond to sender there

2123
01:37:24,340 --> 01:37:31,639
clams evidence to the verifier so it's

2124
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:34,729
more suitable for a large or a medium or

2125
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:35,869
large network and it's our unchanged

2126
01:37:34,729 --> 01:37:38,659
remote attestation

2127
01:37:35,869 --> 01:37:40,999
so the inherit benefits of yum pops up

2128
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:43,388
and the push mechanism is also suitable

2129
01:37:40,999 --> 01:37:48,159
here the flexibility efficiency

2130
01:37:43,389 --> 01:37:48,159
scalability and the filtering capability

2131
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:55,539
the key points of our are now in our now

2132
01:37:52,760 --> 01:38:00,439
Draft are three parts first is a

2133
01:37:55,539 --> 01:38:04,280
subscription we defined that we now

2134
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:07,010
define you will subscribe the integrity

2135
01:38:04,280 --> 01:38:08,959
evidence and you can use the configure

2136
01:38:07,010 --> 01:38:11,420
configure subscription or dynamic

2137
01:38:08,959 --> 01:38:17,449
subscription and you can define the

2138
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:21,469
selection future filters next is a is a

2139
01:38:17,449 --> 01:38:26,509
periodic push the device a pastor can

2140
01:38:21,469 --> 01:38:30,079
periodically push his evidence trying

2141
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:31,579
times to the verifier it more suitable

2142
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:34,670
for the general and a non critical

2143
01:38:31,579 --> 01:38:37,329
information collection we think the

2144
01:38:34,670 --> 01:38:40,159
third is the unchained push or in

2145
01:38:37,329 --> 01:38:42,558
ventricle push it's more suitable for

2146
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:45,070
monitor to monitor the critic or

2147
01:38:42,559 --> 01:38:49,670
integrity evidence when change happens

2148
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:53,749
for example like the new line cards are

2149
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:57,130
plugging and like some switchover

2150
01:38:53,749 --> 01:38:57,130
i'm kind of thing like that

2151
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:04,730
the next day is about the subscription

2152
01:39:00,890 --> 01:39:06,770
parameter is handling the the remote

2153
01:39:04,730 --> 01:39:09,139
attestation subscription parameters

2154
01:39:06,770 --> 01:39:11,870
parameters are appearing Abel the

2155
01:39:09,140 --> 01:39:14,180
dynamic negotiation with the tester

2156
01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:17,450
about what information the verified need

2157
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:20,120
and how to construct them together it's

2158
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:23,570
already native from the challenging

2159
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:25,430
parameters and generally we think the

2160
01:39:23,570 --> 01:39:28,519
most of the parameter is carried in a

2161
01:39:25,430 --> 01:39:30,800
subscription message won't change during

2162
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:32,630
the Renata's testing procedure for

2163
01:39:30,800 --> 01:39:38,020
example like the hash signature

2164
01:39:32,630 --> 01:39:42,170
algorithm you want used and the TDM them

2165
01:39:38,020 --> 01:39:45,590
and the most difficult part is about to

2166
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:48,500
announce now is for freshness validation

2167
01:39:45,590 --> 01:39:55,580
and it will be a little complicated in

2168
01:39:48,500 --> 01:39:58,880
this situation for now we the nas is to

2169
01:39:55,580 --> 01:40:00,860
ensure that we need to ensure that and

2170
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,920
announce carried in every notification

2171
01:40:00,860 --> 01:40:07,190
message is different - - for the

2172
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:08,870
security purpose and the post a tester

2173
01:40:07,190 --> 01:40:11,419
and that the verifying can know the

2174
01:40:08,870 --> 01:40:14,030
correct values in advance we have some

2175
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:17,060
possible solutions for example the time

2176
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:19,309
stamp or counter and the same Orangina

2177
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:22,520
seed in a run in same random function at

2178
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:25,160
both sides also we consider the rat

2179
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:27,910
student mechanism but it's not very

2180
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:31,430
complementary or complete here it's just

2181
01:40:27,910 --> 01:40:36,260
we thought in the preeminent preliminary

2182
01:40:31,430 --> 01:40:38,570
stage next are two examples which is

2183
01:40:36,260 --> 01:40:41,840
first a the configure subscription with

2184
01:40:38,570 --> 01:40:43,759
unchanging update trigger and next a is

2185
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:50,810
a dynamic subscription with periodic

2186
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:53,840
update trigger about next steps we know

2187
01:40:50,810 --> 01:40:56,540
that as the solutions may not - very

2188
01:40:53,840 --> 01:41:00,230
complete and may not quite suitable for

2189
01:40:56,540 --> 01:41:04,610
every cases but we want to keep on

2190
01:41:00,230 --> 01:41:06,650
updates to complete it and we want to

2191
01:41:04,610 --> 01:41:09,349
get feedbacks from the group are

2192
01:41:06,650 --> 01:41:12,170
interesting are you think it's a good

2193
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:17,060
direction to we to solve

2194
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:19,910
the problems are valuable work think

2195
01:41:17,060 --> 01:41:22,070
they were on your points about freshness

2196
01:41:19,910 --> 01:41:24,889
I only stood understood half of that you

2197
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:26,330
talked about a counter and orangey and I

2198
01:41:24,890 --> 01:41:29,110
didn't understand how those provided

2199
01:41:26,330 --> 01:41:32,090
freshness I get the timestamp point

2200
01:41:29,110 --> 01:41:33,799
which I understand which recorder

2201
01:41:32,090 --> 01:41:35,540
synchronize clocks and so on but I

2202
01:41:33,800 --> 01:41:37,490
didn't understand counters don't give

2203
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:38,750
you freshness unless they're using some

2204
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:42,769
mechanism that's not explained in the

2205
01:41:38,750 --> 01:41:45,200
slide Oh actually we mean we we mean

2206
01:41:42,770 --> 01:41:47,900
like the sequence number like the

2207
01:41:45,200 --> 01:41:49,429
counter you send a message and it's just

2208
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:52,969
a message sequence number you have no

2209
01:41:49,430 --> 01:41:54,200
guarantee of freshness that yeah you

2210
01:41:52,970 --> 01:41:55,730
don't know if that sequence number

2211
01:41:54,200 --> 01:41:57,110
always use three days ago or something

2212
01:41:55,730 --> 01:41:59,480
that doesn't actually give you freshness

2213
01:41:57,110 --> 01:42:02,630
is my point okay okay but the timestamp

2214
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:07,400
would and so if you're only using

2215
01:42:02,630 --> 01:42:09,440
mechanisms that in meaning protocol

2216
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:11,299
mechanisms that yang already has and

2217
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:13,160
you're saying oh yeah Yong has this

2218
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:15,230
pub/sub model it has a way to do that

2219
01:42:13,160 --> 01:42:16,940
and here's how to apply it to that then

2220
01:42:15,230 --> 01:42:18,500
I might ask is this a sort of thing that

2221
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:20,419
could be combined into the basic yang

2222
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:22,280
module document because used to saying

2223
01:42:20,420 --> 01:42:23,810
the data model is the same it's saying

2224
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:25,219
here's a way to do some other yang

2225
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:26,810
features in the following way and it

2226
01:42:25,220 --> 01:42:29,870
could just be a section in that document

2227
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:33,260
is what I'm trying to figure out because

2228
01:42:29,870 --> 01:42:35,420
the use of pub/sub sounds fine

2229
01:42:33,260 --> 01:42:36,860
especially if yang just sports that

2230
01:42:35,420 --> 01:42:38,480
right and saying here's what it means

2231
01:42:36,860 --> 01:42:40,130
and here's how you do the freshness

2232
01:42:38,480 --> 01:42:41,450
point which might require synchronized

2233
01:42:40,130 --> 01:42:44,240
clocks and you had unless you have some

2234
01:42:41,450 --> 01:42:45,500
other are pcs to get the nonce or

2235
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,969
something like that getting in the way I

2236
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:52,040
could have envisioned doing that and I'm

2237
01:42:46,970 --> 01:42:55,730
looking at Hank right yeah thank you

2238
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:59,150
yeah that's a levy of three-year push

2239
01:42:55,730 --> 01:43:01,400
drafts are basically intended to be put

2240
01:42:59,150 --> 01:43:03,769
into what the data some modules that

2241
01:43:01,400 --> 01:43:07,160
have the we are doing a subscription to

2242
01:43:03,770 --> 01:43:09,650
a data store I think and this data so

2243
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:11,570
subscription we already up we have the

2244
01:43:09,650 --> 01:43:14,480
three that's correct we can apply that

2245
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:17,599
there will be a lot of imports and some

2246
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:20,360
specific identities that potala a to the

2247
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:22,700
rats comb but this is basic the standard

2248
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:23,659
Verkhoyansk yes so this is intended to

2249
01:43:22,700 --> 01:43:29,210
do exactly

2250
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:31,219
proposed right so thank you for Hank for

2251
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:34,340
answering so based on that answer I

2252
01:43:31,219 --> 01:43:35,989
would say I think this is interesting I

2253
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:38,270
think it would be interesting if the

2254
01:43:35,989 --> 01:43:40,129
author's would both think that makes

2255
01:43:38,270 --> 01:43:41,449
sense for the concepts of pub side being

2256
01:43:40,130 --> 01:43:44,690
pulled into the same document we just

2257
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:47,419
talked about adopting now for the

2258
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:50,509
freshness issue I think that means you

2259
01:43:47,420 --> 01:43:52,820
even need to assume like a two-time

2260
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:57,230
Sam's or have an RPC mechanism to say it

2261
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:58,639
as a way to pass the Mount Ayr that

2262
01:43:57,230 --> 01:44:00,500
could be added unless it's already in

2263
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:03,949
there yang has some other way to do that

2264
01:44:00,500 --> 01:44:05,780
which I don't know so I'm creating a

2265
01:44:03,949 --> 01:44:09,530
yang module for today is super easy

2266
01:44:05,780 --> 01:44:12,170
first of all so I think subscriptions

2267
01:44:09,530 --> 01:44:13,820
are yeah this was after the last

2268
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:15,500
discussions of the last half-year

2269
01:44:13,820 --> 01:44:18,469
true that was not my greatest priority

2270
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:20,150
but we will keep up that again and I

2271
01:44:18,469 --> 01:44:22,159
think it's a hybrid here you can

2272
01:44:20,150 --> 01:44:24,980
initiate the subscription stage with a

2273
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:27,259
single month and go from there because

2274
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:29,928
of the subscription state establishment

2275
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:32,060
is the yang push is is a handshake and

2276
01:44:29,929 --> 01:44:35,030
then from there you can start with

2277
01:44:32,060 --> 01:44:37,120
probably the time stamp based telemetry

2278
01:44:35,030 --> 01:44:49,670
that is our assumption at the moment

2279
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:52,519
come back here if you have when using

2280
01:44:49,670 --> 01:44:54,320
time stamps or even relative time stamps

2281
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:57,230
like time since the subscription or

2282
01:44:54,320 --> 01:45:00,259
whatever as long as you have a way to

2283
01:44:57,230 --> 01:45:02,178
solve clock drift because you don't want

2284
01:45:00,260 --> 01:45:04,389
to have attestation fail simply because

2285
01:45:02,179 --> 01:45:05,570
you have two things that drift over time

2286
01:45:04,389 --> 01:45:08,630
okay

2287
01:45:05,570 --> 01:45:12,320
of course we're doing about the pub okay

2288
01:45:08,630 --> 01:45:13,699
so this is inherent in the pub sub

2289
01:45:12,320 --> 01:45:15,590
saying how do you get the nonce and

2290
01:45:13,699 --> 01:45:17,690
freshness in the pub sub one this is the

2291
01:45:15,590 --> 01:45:19,280
topic on this to say you can put in the

2292
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:20,239
same one in the same document which

2293
01:45:19,280 --> 01:45:21,830
would be my preference you might have

2294
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:23,269
heard so far but that means there's

2295
01:45:21,830 --> 01:45:25,969
needs this discussion of freshness

2296
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:27,170
because the query response mechanism

2297
01:45:25,969 --> 01:45:28,820
doesn't even a sort of gets it for free

2298
01:45:27,170 --> 01:45:30,350
and this would be adding a new

2299
01:45:28,820 --> 01:45:32,179
constraint that's not there in the base

2300
01:45:30,350 --> 01:45:36,210
document and so that's why we means to

2301
01:45:32,179 --> 01:45:38,790
discuss this right Michael I think

2302
01:45:36,210 --> 01:45:43,410
that the nonce issue is in fact the

2303
01:45:38,790 --> 01:45:45,060
issue for the pub/sub okay and so you

2304
01:45:43,410 --> 01:45:47,639
know document should that's essentially

2305
01:45:45,060 --> 01:45:49,770
what does I'm I don't have a specific

2306
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:53,280
solution but the the the the method

2307
01:45:49,770 --> 01:45:55,350
mechanism I was imagining is that the

2308
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:58,110
I'm going to say the observer the the

2309
01:45:55,350 --> 01:46:00,060
thing collecting the data or the things

2310
01:45:58,110 --> 01:46:03,089
collecting the data that's may be an

2311
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:07,050
interesting variation as well arm would

2312
01:46:03,090 --> 01:46:09,660
announce a new challenge to every all

2313
01:46:07,050 --> 01:46:12,600
the nodes and that would be mixed in

2314
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:15,360
with something else that's unique to the

2315
01:46:12,600 --> 01:46:18,690
node and that would become the knots

2316
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:21,570
okay and the unique to the node is

2317
01:46:18,690 --> 01:46:24,210
essentially becomes a you know a one to

2318
01:46:21,570 --> 01:46:26,940
one secret and I don't know how to do

2319
01:46:24,210 --> 01:46:28,950
that exactly yet but what I'm saying is

2320
01:46:26,940 --> 01:46:30,809
that that that's the thing I'm imagining

2321
01:46:28,950 --> 01:46:33,120
somehow is there and maybe we don't

2322
01:46:30,810 --> 01:46:36,239
actually need to mix too many things but

2323
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:40,019
that the that the the challenge would be

2324
01:46:36,239 --> 01:46:41,910
somehow broadcast on a frequent enough

2325
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:43,739
basis that you now it has something

2326
01:46:41,910 --> 01:46:46,680
which is a little bit essentially like

2327
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:48,989
having a secure time it just doesn't

2328
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:52,590
increment it's it's the result of some

2329
01:46:48,989 --> 01:46:54,450
other yeah so so I don't know the exact

2330
01:46:52,590 --> 01:46:57,630
answer to that but I think that that's

2331
01:46:54,450 --> 01:47:00,719
the space that a document once adopted

2332
01:46:57,630 --> 01:47:03,540
by the working group has to kind of shop

2333
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,790
around for some solution like that okay

2334
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:08,700
we have to agree that we want to solve I

2335
01:47:05,790 --> 01:47:10,230
think that we agree that we I think we

2336
01:47:08,700 --> 01:47:12,480
have to agree that we want to solve the

2337
01:47:10,230 --> 01:47:14,639
problem by adopting the document at

2338
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:16,620
which point we can deal with the

2339
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:18,719
technical problem of of this and I think

2340
01:47:16,620 --> 01:47:20,160
that is the the technical problem that

2341
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,770
makes pub/sub different than anything

2342
01:47:20,160 --> 01:47:24,599
else so thank you for that Michael

2343
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:27,000
because that gets me to the next

2344
01:47:24,600 --> 01:47:35,100
question how many people have actually

2345
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:37,860
read the draft okay I yeah I think we

2346
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:43,260
need more readers and more feet more

2347
01:47:37,860 --> 01:47:47,660
reviewers and feedback so I would

2348
01:47:43,260 --> 01:47:49,590
encourage people to read this and then

2349
01:47:47,660 --> 01:47:51,900
provide feedback

2350
01:47:49,590 --> 01:47:53,450
the two questions that I'm hearing or

2351
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:57,929
the two options that I'm hearing

2352
01:47:53,450 --> 01:48:00,240
basically three is do we add raw do we

2353
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:03,690
adopt the draft listing out whatever

2354
01:48:00,240 --> 01:48:06,150
issues do we believe that the draft

2355
01:48:03,690 --> 01:48:10,080
should be incorporated into the yang

2356
01:48:06,150 --> 01:48:10,799
module draft or do we not address this

2357
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:13,860
at all

2358
01:48:10,800 --> 01:48:18,210
so as you're providing feedback please

2359
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:20,790
do that over the mail list and we'll get

2360
01:48:18,210 --> 01:48:24,780
more feedback in okay and an idea and

2361
01:48:20,790 --> 01:48:29,220
guidance okay all right okay so with

2362
01:48:24,780 --> 01:48:31,380
that look at that we actually have 10

2363
01:48:29,220 --> 01:48:33,390
minutes because as I said earlier I was

2364
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:34,050
going to fold my 15 minutes for call for

2365
01:48:33,390 --> 01:48:37,650
adoption

2366
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:39,570
so this is great we we have a little bit

2367
01:48:37,650 --> 01:48:43,379
of guidance to provide to the authors of

2368
01:48:39,570 --> 01:48:48,599
the Rif draft we now have the base yang

2369
01:48:43,380 --> 01:48:52,590
module draft so I will create the github

2370
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:56,880
repo so for those authors you can rename

2371
01:48:52,590 --> 01:49:02,190
it put it in there okay okay so orders

2372
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:03,870
of business it's much better Michael

2373
01:49:02,190 --> 01:49:08,400
it's much better if they transfer their

2374
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:09,960
existing github sorry okay and just and

2375
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:11,040
because if you create it then it's all

2376
01:49:09,960 --> 01:49:12,900
confusing because that lets some people

2377
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:15,540
the issues that's the only way that lets

2378
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:17,820
them keep the issues is creating or

2379
01:49:15,540 --> 01:49:20,010
giving them access to the rats

2380
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:23,549
organization they're gonna do a transfer

2381
01:49:20,010 --> 01:49:24,630
and you're going to say I accept I think

2382
01:49:23,550 --> 01:49:26,880
they have to be members of the

2383
01:49:24,630 --> 01:49:32,310
organization they have to transfer to

2384
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:37,050
your organization and then you already

2385
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:39,810
has access so they're okay so but thank

2386
01:49:37,050 --> 01:49:41,720
you for that clarification Michael so it

2387
01:49:39,810 --> 01:49:44,550
will become part of the the rats

2388
01:49:41,720 --> 01:49:47,490
organization into github so orders of

2389
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:50,430
business we have good momentum we now

2390
01:49:47,490 --> 01:49:54,510
have a lot of a lot three drafts that we

2391
01:49:50,430 --> 01:49:57,600
can start working on potential - - and

2392
01:49:54,510 --> 01:50:00,760
the architecture and yang that's three

2393
01:49:57,600 --> 01:50:07,150
right I think I can count three

2394
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:10,260
yeah okay so the I'm going to advocate

2395
01:50:07,150 --> 01:50:15,670
for a minimum of one virtual interim is

2396
01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:24,430
there interest to have to I see a lot of

2397
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:27,250
nods so I will know yeah so what I'll do

2398
01:50:24,430 --> 01:50:30,700
is is um confer with my co-chairs and

2399
01:50:27,250 --> 01:50:34,390
we'll put out doodle polls for the two

2400
01:50:30,700 --> 01:50:36,340
virtual interns I'm presuming that the

2401
01:50:34,390 --> 01:50:38,170
first one should likely start in January

2402
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:41,530
although Dave you have a question or

2403
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:44,560
comment Dave failure as a teacher yes

2404
01:50:41,530 --> 01:50:47,440
the working group was discussing having

2405
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,989
a virtual interim co-located with the

2406
01:50:47,440 --> 01:50:51,759
hackathon that Nancy had the slide up

2407
01:50:49,989 --> 01:50:54,370
early in the session which would be at

2408
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:56,020
the beginning of February which would be

2409
01:50:54,370 --> 01:50:58,540
a hackathon that would be joint keep

2410
01:50:56,020 --> 01:50:59,950
rats and suit and one of the reasons he

2411
01:50:58,540 --> 01:51:02,380
was looking at that is because it was

2412
01:50:59,950 --> 01:51:04,420
the hope that soot and rats people would

2413
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:06,520
be readily available to participate in

2414
01:51:04,420 --> 01:51:08,830
that and so you might consider having a

2415
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,239
rats virtual interim at the same time

2416
01:51:08,830 --> 01:51:12,190
either in any of the afterwards or

2417
01:51:10,239 --> 01:51:13,809
before or whatever so I would think that

2418
01:51:12,190 --> 01:51:15,460
would be a great oh yeah the first one

2419
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:17,230
or the second one so um

2420
01:51:15,460 --> 01:51:18,550
no comment there no preference on those

2421
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:24,250
but I'm saying that is a good day to

2422
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:25,720
head one well what he did so this is

2423
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:27,520
actually the second hackathon of this

2424
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:30,850
style okay there was one was like a suit

2425
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:32,770
in my and keep combined one before and

2426
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:35,620
so there was a day or more of hackathon

2427
01:51:32,770 --> 01:51:37,810
and there was one hour of it which was a

2428
01:51:35,620 --> 01:51:40,769
virtual meeting which was both physical

2429
01:51:37,810 --> 01:51:43,690
presence and lots of remote attendees

2430
01:51:40,770 --> 01:51:47,440
the suggestion may be that we have a

2431
01:51:43,690 --> 01:51:51,160
joint virtual interim with suit and peep

2432
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:53,349
but but well I'm just saying we could do

2433
01:51:51,160 --> 01:51:55,450
it in addition to depending on you know

2434
01:51:53,350 --> 01:51:59,560
what shakes out with the requirements

2435
01:51:55,450 --> 01:52:00,760
and questions with deep and did you have

2436
01:51:59,560 --> 01:52:03,450
a comment I was just gonna have a

2437
01:52:00,760 --> 01:52:05,680
process reminder I heard both virtual

2438
01:52:03,450 --> 01:52:07,059
interim and that I heard interim and

2439
01:52:05,680 --> 01:52:10,710
just a reminder the lead time on

2440
01:52:07,060 --> 01:52:10,710
notification on an in person

2441
01:52:14,199 --> 01:52:23,629
yeah so I think it's four weeks versus

2442
01:52:16,789 --> 01:52:26,030
two weeks not yet because a lot of it

2443
01:52:23,630 --> 01:52:31,550
will depend on due to poll results and

2444
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:33,320
chair availability Lawrence I guess I

2445
01:52:31,550 --> 01:52:35,840
I'm not sure what the procedure is but

2446
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:40,070
if you're going to make it after the

2447
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:41,900
19th I'd like to know sooner than later

2448
01:52:40,070 --> 01:52:43,669
if it's for the I mean I'm planning to

2449
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:46,429
attend but if it's before the 17th no

2450
01:52:43,669 --> 01:52:48,709
problem it's after the 19th I don't know

2451
01:52:46,429 --> 01:52:50,659
I will try to put out the doodle poll in

2452
01:52:48,709 --> 01:52:53,679
the next week or two so that we know

2453
01:52:50,659 --> 01:52:57,320
dates okay but I need to confer

2454
01:52:53,679 --> 01:53:01,729
availability of co-chairs as well okay

2455
01:52:57,320 --> 01:53:06,159
so that was the last order of business

2456
01:53:01,729 --> 01:53:08,419
that I had any other any other business

2457
01:53:06,159 --> 01:53:13,119
going once going twice

2458
01:53:08,419 --> 01:53:16,669
