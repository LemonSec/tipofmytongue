[Music]

3
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:53,770
we're about to start it's true hello

4
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:55,750
everybody this is IDR we're getting

5
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,949
started so please find your seats or

6
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:02,220
find the door or you know stand up and

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:05,080
back at the peanut gallery or whatever

8
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:07,840
su is going to put a note well on the

9
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,750
screen any moment so that you can have

10
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,560
seen it but

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:16,590
I bet some people in here have seen it

12
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,750
but I think yeah here we go

13
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,180
it is our note well it is the ietf

14
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,330
policy you did agree to this thing when

15
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:27,940
you registered to come to the IETF if

16
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:31,600
you don't know what it says you probably

17
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:37,200
should acquaint yourself with it enough

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:39,579
said we're gonna try to cut the whole

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,970
comments from the chairs thing well

20
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:46,870
short because we would rather spend our

21
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,359
limited time on other stuff especially

22
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:53,260
because sue has been doing a bang-up job

23
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,480
of sending out periodic status updates

24
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,170
so it would be kind of redundant to

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,090
spend our time here and now sending out

26
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,250
status updates but I realized I should

27
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:06,270
walk around and get these blue sheets

28
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,880
moving please sign into the blue sheet

29
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:13,420
and whenever they get to the back of the

30
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:15,400
room please someone bring them forward

31
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:18,070
and so they don't get lost it's always a

32
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:22,750
pain to have to find the blue sheets at

33
00:03:18,070 --> 00:04:11,738
the end of the meeting do you want to so

34
00:03:22,750 --> 00:04:15,810
here so this is sort of the last minute

35
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:15,810
thing that I put together because

36
00:04:16,228 --> 00:04:20,070
essentially I noticed that

37
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,270
you know I guess I didn't just notice

38
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,150
but we have a lot of flowspec related

39
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,570
drafts they continue to come in every

40
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:37,799
meeting I think we've talked about this

41
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:41,040
before but as a reminder if you go and

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,790
look at flowspec flowspec does its thing

43
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:47,670
using NLRA the NLRA contains flowspec

44
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,630
components flowspec components are

45
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,900
structured as type value pairs they are

46
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:59,760
not structured as type length values

47
00:04:54,900 --> 00:05:03,120
just type value what does that mean that

48
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,920
means you can't write a generic flowspec

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,540
parser you know unlike unknown path

50
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,480
attributes that we can just skip over

51
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:17,180
and keep going and everything's good you

52
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:23,100
get an unknown flow spec component and

53
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:26,910
game over this isn't really good for

54
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:29,130
flowspec extensibility there's an

55
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:33,210
exception which is if you're defining

56
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:35,640
flowspec over a new a few Safi that's

57
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,039
fine because you've got a demultiplexer

58
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,039
up you know that you do know how to find

59
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:44,660
that either you know you either you

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,010
exchange that fe Safi in your MP bgp

61
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:49,770
capability in which case you'll will

62
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:51,450
know how to parse the components or you

63
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:54,599
don't in which case you won't get the

64
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,670
component so that's fine but you just

65
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,680
get one shot you know once you've

66
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:00,810
defined your your new a fe Safi with

67
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,530
your new components in it that's it

68
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:09,740
forget about extending it later some

69
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:14,340
years ago we had a flow spec v2 proposal

70
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:16,260
that among other things represented

71
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,489
components as type length values so

72
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:23,070
obviously they wouldn't have this

73
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:26,930
problem but instead we have not worked

74
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:30,510
on that actively because we have taken

75
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:32,969
you know did the quick thing of doing

76
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:39,029
the bist document first

77
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:41,729
with all quick things it wasn't quick so

78
00:06:39,029 --> 00:06:43,889
the thing that I would like to put out

79
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:47,219
for you know potentially a couple

80
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:48,779
minutes of discussion right now and I

81
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:56,459
will also follow this up to the list of

82
00:06:48,779 --> 00:07:00,179
course is just it seems to me as as the

83
00:06:56,459 --> 00:07:04,110
co-chair that it doesn't really make

84
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:06,869
sense for us to advance documents that

85
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,249
define component types that can be

86
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:10,110
expected to make

87
00:07:08,249 --> 00:07:12,779
peirong sessions fall over if you

88
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:16,349
actually transmit them across the

89
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:19,049
session so that kind of implies that

90
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:21,989
either we stop extending flowspec or we

91
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:24,929
get back to work on some kind of follow

92
00:07:21,989 --> 00:07:27,929
on whether it's you know resuscitating

93
00:07:24,929 --> 00:07:31,529
the v2 draft or doing something else is

94
00:07:27,929 --> 00:07:33,119
up for discussion we have a few minutes

95
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:35,009
for discussion if anyone wants to make a

96
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:42,269
comment otherwise we can talk on the on

97
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:45,419
the list later chaired much Akamai makes

98
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:49,919
sense to me that we should fix the TLV

99
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:53,519
oversight what which method doesn't

100
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,109
matter to me Jeff has spent a lot of

101
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,499
time in the last year actually working

102
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:59,849
on flowspec code and some of the reason

103
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:03,119
why you have the some of this stuff 255

104
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:05,519
something like this number one piece F

105
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:06,989
actually picked up our format and was

106
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,059
going to stick it in their protocol they

107
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:10,589
received this morning they did the same

108
00:08:09,059 --> 00:08:12,569
thing except for their components

109
00:08:10,589 --> 00:08:14,519
actually include link fields so they do

110
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:16,349
not suffer from this problem so we have

111
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:18,959
at least one existence proof of change

112
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:21,869
the format makes it happy thing number

113
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:24,749
two we should gate these new things I

114
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:27,569
believe and something that has a TLV I

115
00:08:24,749 --> 00:08:30,209
think that if low spec v2 makes sense

116
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:36,000
I think the scoping of the faux spec fee

117
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:39,120
to proposal may need to rediscover feet

118
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,318
in place make it TLV flowspec v2 also

119
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,448
try to advance it in terms of like

120
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:44,010
firewall rule ordering have to decide if

121
00:08:42,448 --> 00:08:47,399
we still want that

122
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:52,170
thank you thank you go fishing skiing

123
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:54,720
Verizon Media Yahoo edge cast absolutely

124
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:57,680
agree with Mike absolutely agree with

125
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,930
what both Jeff and Jared have said we

126
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,550
the current mechanism of we really

127
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:06,089
cannot extend folks but because it will

128
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:08,250
make routers fall over and govt is just

129
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:12,350
an oversight and let's bite the bullet

130
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,350
and fix it thank you

131
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,459
let seems like consensus in the room so

132
00:09:15,269 --> 00:09:19,699
anyway we'll we'll discuss it further on

133
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:22,439
the list but I think that will be the

134
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:24,359
you know even though I'm standing up

135
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,740
here I'm I do have a chairs hat on right

136
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,339
now I I think that's going to be the

137
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:31,170
position of the chairs going forward is

138
00:09:28,339 --> 00:09:35,040
you know you can you can discuss your

139
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,479
your extension draft but I think that we

140
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,540
are going to want to prioritize the

141
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,639
groups time on getting the the TLV thing

142
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:48,540
done so that we can actually roll out

143
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:50,370
those extension drafts so as the author

144
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,639
of the previous one I really don't care

145
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:59,310
just as long as we fix the TLB problems

146
00:09:53,639 --> 00:10:04,170
so open proposals are are okay on this

147
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:06,719
we have an a flow spec in working group

148
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:11,219
last call the chairs wanted to make sure

149
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:13,199
we knew what we if we had any sense for

150
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,810
the room again we'll send more of this

151
00:10:13,199 --> 00:10:19,459
out to the mail list but seems like it

152
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:21,959
would be a whole lot better to fix it so

153
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:29,339
speaking of flow specs are we ready for

154
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:33,800
Donald yep and he's using a different a

155
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:37,920
piece a FISA which is why we wanted to I

156
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,319
think I've got it it should be dance mmm

157
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:45,389
okay hi

158
00:10:40,319 --> 00:10:47,490
so after that oh that's not quite right

159
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,279
so I'm gonna talk about two drafts in

160
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,839
only 10 minutes hopefully with some time

161
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:57,089
for discussion so I'll be moving along

162
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:59,249
here pretty quickly layer 2 VPN and the

163
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:03,989
tunnels so

164
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:05,929
the l2 VPN flowspec draft has a number

165
00:11:03,989 --> 00:11:09,679
of changes from version 11 particularly

166
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:13,139
clarifying that it applies to efi 25

167
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,509
Safi 134 included some stuff about

168
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:17,149
validation so you can tell it if

169
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:20,699
flowspec is coming from a source

170
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:22,529
authorized to send that it has a very

171
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:24,358
minor extension for the drop eligible

172
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:28,529
indicator bit which is a bit in VLAN

173
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:30,509
tags as I can be checked and so it

174
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:35,249
basically defines new component types

175
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:37,259
for l2 and those now have TBD values

176
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:38,910
rather than fixed numbers which used to

177
00:11:37,259 --> 00:11:40,559
be in the previous version and there of

178
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:43,049
course there are various editorial cages

179
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,160
so I'd like to resolve questions at the

180
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:46,679
end because I want to make sure I get

181
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,959
through the expository text on the

182
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:54,299
drafts but the question arose on the

183
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:58,319
mailing list with expert on whether this

184
00:11:54,299 --> 00:12:01,470
can use Saffy 134 so a fee 25 is defined

185
00:11:58,319 --> 00:12:04,858
as the a fee for l2 VPN and Savi 34

186
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:08,339
currently in the IANA registry says VPN

187
00:12:04,859 --> 00:12:11,039
v4 dissemination of photo spec rules the

188
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:14,399
ipv6 draft is going to expand that to be

189
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:16,259
l3 but ie then this staff proposes a

190
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,819
change change it to VPN dissemination

191
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:22,499
because you can tell from the a fee

192
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:26,969
whether it's VPN ipv4 or ipv6 or lastly

193
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:29,009
in this case level layer 2 so why do you

194
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,199
need to use a new different Safi from

195
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:34,739
134 because the a fee tells you what's

196
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:37,949
going on and you also might be able want

197
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:40,649
to apply what's in this draft to non VPN

198
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:44,099
cases and there's a convenient a fee for

199
00:12:40,649 --> 00:12:46,379
that you can use fe6 and Safie 133 an

200
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,419
ambiguously from the definition of that

201
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,489
affiant a fee would clearly make what

202
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:53,429
case it was appliable too obvious to

203
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:54,749
anybody getting that so that's the

204
00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:56,939
question people can think about it while

205
00:12:54,749 --> 00:13:00,539
I go over the other draft is there a

206
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:02,368
good reason to have another Safi which i

207
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:07,289
think is a burns one for no particularly

208
00:13:02,369 --> 00:13:09,509
good reason for this ultra VPM so the

209
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,870
other draft the file name is unchanged

210
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:13,700
and has n vo 3 but

211
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:15,620
the revision to the draft I've that's

212
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:18,440
been made from zero version zero six

213
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,200
digital seven makes it really not nvo

214
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,150
three specific the oh six focused there

215
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,920
it didn't really say anything about sad

216
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:27,829
it wasn't really clear what's a feat was

217
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,839
being used or anything it's a matter too

218
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:31,490
good a draft in that regard was I had

219
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,890
lots of other good stuff in it it only

220
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,990
supported VX land and envy GRE and it

221
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:38,660
worked by having a delimiter component

222
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,250
which marked boundary so it sort of was

223
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,839
like adding a component which is we

224
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:44,090
found least currently doesn't work at

225
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,730
all and may not be the probably the best

226
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:49,310
way to do it in this case anyway so the

227
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:51,050
new draft of the sex 7 changes this

228
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:53,569
quite a bit it's really a general

229
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,540
tunneling or encapsulation kind of flow

230
00:13:53,570 --> 00:14:00,140
spec it proposes to use a new Safi

231
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,930
you've just TPD and it has in it details

232
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:07,069
about the ex lam not just vehicle and

233
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:11,510
env GRE but also l2tp v3 IP @ IP jerry

234
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:13,970
etc and has a new NLRA structure which

235
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:17,150
can contain one or optionally also a

236
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,890
second flow spec so what applies to the

237
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,650
outer header and that applies to the

238
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,620
nested inner header which you would need

239
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:26,030
frequently but not always so this is

240
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,940
what things look like this shows the

241
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:31,819
overall attribute at the higher level is

242
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:34,310
the multi-protocol BGP attribute where

243
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:37,580
it is a naffy Safi next hop information

244
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:41,630
then there's the ml or I and it begins

245
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:43,370
in this draft with a tunnel type so the

246
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,290
hole type actually acts sort of as an

247
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:48,110
additional thing if you don't understand

248
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:50,689
the tunnel type you can skip over the

249
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:53,330
hole the hole attribute so we you could

250
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:56,420
add things for specific tunneling

251
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,740
headers later even with the same a few

252
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,760
Safi as long as they had a different

253
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,230
tunnel type okay then there's some flags

254
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,020
regarding discriminator and a second

255
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:07,580
flow spec flag and some reserved Flags

256
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:09,470
routing discriminator field and then the

257
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:12,050
then there's the outer flow spec which

258
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,860
is always there that's the next to the

259
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:17,209
last box here and that essentially

260
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:19,000
parsed or whatever based on the a fee

261
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:22,070
that's at the top of the attribute and

262
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,080
if the second flowspec flag is on then

263
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:25,970
there is another a fee and the inner

264
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,209
flow spec net inner a fee applies to the

265
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:27,980
inner

266
00:15:26,209 --> 00:15:29,449
let's back of course so there's also

267
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,100
this Rodney discriminator bit so if this

268
00:15:29,449 --> 00:15:34,519
is the VPN case you need a routing

269
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:36,769
discriminator to tell what VPN vrf the

270
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:39,499
stuff is in that you're trying to look

271
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:41,300
for and right it might not be so that's

272
00:15:39,499 --> 00:15:43,040
an optional thing this way that you only

273
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,649
meet once a fee rather than two

274
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,079
different Saffy's for the VPN an on VPN

275
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:50,959
case you could do with two Saffy's but

276
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,069
it seems cheaper to use a bit which

277
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,349
determines whether the routing

278
00:15:52,069 --> 00:15:56,329
discriminator is present so this just

279
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:01,300
blows up the NLRA gives more detail

280
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:01,300
shows the link fields and so forth

281
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:07,879
this draft also has more components that

282
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,100
defines because of the other kinds of

283
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:12,350
tunneling it covers previously only was

284
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,480
fee excellent NB GRE and only had added

285
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:17,209
the tunneling header components for

286
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,769
those it extends the flow spec ordering

287
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,018
rules so you can tell what precedence is

288
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,819
if you have a tunneling and a non

289
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:24,949
tunneling flowspec that both match or

290
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:27,378
something like that includes validations

291
00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:29,449
based on entirely on the outer flow spec

292
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:33,199
so whether the source of the flow spec

293
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:36,109
is authoritative so here's two examples

294
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:37,670
the first one is IP and IP so you could

295
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:39,079
have in this case you would almost

296
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,179
always have an outer and inner flows

297
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:44,349
back because it's not worthwhile doing

298
00:16:41,179 --> 00:16:47,119
really for IP to simple IP and IP

299
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:49,249
intersect which can match the the inner

300
00:16:47,119 --> 00:16:51,740
IP address and the outer one matches the

301
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:54,889
outer one and in case of l2 VPN there

302
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:57,049
might be Mac stuff there which case you

303
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:00,679
need to use a appropriate a fee and you

304
00:16:57,049 --> 00:17:04,490
can have l2 stuff as well

305
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:06,918
this is VX lamb so this is a little more

306
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,720
complex but over at the right side it

307
00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:11,419
shows what would be covered by the outer

308
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,709
flow spec they let us say the flow spec

309
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:14,209
that's always present that applies to

310
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,890
the outer header and what would be out

311
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:16,939
of the inner flow spec so but he can

312
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,480
either one of them can contain

313
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:22,399
components that match on VX LAN content

314
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,880
fields and in both cases there be a

315
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:28,129
difference the tunnelling flow specs a

316
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:31,429
fee would be there so you could you

317
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:33,740
would only get to code that knows how to

318
00:17:31,429 --> 00:17:37,179
parse this additional field and you also

319
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:37,179
would have to have match the tunnel type

320
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,480
so I don't know I

321
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,650
go over these different fields but I'm

322
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:49,670
not sure there's too much here that's

323
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:51,590
obscure or anything so for once that's

324
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:53,630
always what particular would like to

325
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,370
have some indication whether the working

326
00:17:53,630 --> 00:17:59,510
group thinks we actually need to use a

327
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:03,800
brand new Safi for the l2 VPM or whether

328
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:06,580
we can use a fee 25 just l2 VPN and

329
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:09,159
Safie 134 for flowspec

330
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:10,970
and i'm hoping to get to early

331
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,980
allocation of the code points for that

332
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:15,860
but he needed to resolve that question

333
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:18,110
to a more Reb of the draft for the N via

334
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,060
3 full spec which I could change the

335
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,320
name or something if people like don't

336
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:24,470
like that file name because it's no

337
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:26,480
longer fully specific to n vo 3 I'd like

338
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,890
people to look at the latest version of

339
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,680
the draft and provide feedback I do

340
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,080
think it needs another pass to polish

341
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,930
things and improve it and the goal is to

342
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,280
get Kol points they're also on a goal

343
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:41,150
the code points of course is to get

344
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,399
implementations and see what we don't we

345
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:48,710
do that and so I want to underline that

346
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:52,400
the the the purpose right here is to see

347
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:54,500
if this is ready for lis allocation of

348
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,200
code points so they can try out some of

349
00:18:54,500 --> 00:19:01,100
the ideas and make sure they're ready

350
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:08,000
for having an implementation we are

351
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:10,310
looking for feedback at that point jeff

352
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,470
has so one of the reasons that a

353
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,780
different efi Safiye pairing is a good

354
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:18,890
idea no matter what is your changing

355
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:20,840
flowspec precedence rules so the problem

356
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:21,890
would be like let's say that you just

357
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,760
stuck this into what are the existing

358
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:27,290
efi Saffy's as just a new component type

359
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,970
you want the evaluation to be a

360
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:31,100
different order than what's actually in

361
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,200
there and that's the whole point of an

362
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:36,050
athlete Safi the route selection is

363
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,640
consistent across the entire domain so

364
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,040
if you want to actually break that rule

365
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,930
by changing and so your full spec rule

366
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:44,060
adds slightly different comparison steps

367
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:46,610
you discover that the prior slide well

368
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:49,040
this is okay so that in the end vo 3

369
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:52,580
what everyoe 3 unquote flowspec

370
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:53,120
rule yeah it does extend the precedence

371
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,840
rule

372
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,570
for multiple matches but that uses a new

373
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,730
safiya TBD and that's my point there's

374
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,860
one to have it happy for that got yeah

375
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:07,370
but yeah my question really is for the

376
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:12,439
for the l2 VPN one where I think we can

377
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:14,449
us use 134 25 134 for a fee Safi and it

378
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,250
has been asserted by at least one person

379
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:18,410
that that's terrible and we have to have

380
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,660
a noose a fee there I don't I think

381
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:23,420
that's unambiguous and it's well define

382
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,540
so well I knew Safi Ford the tunnel

383
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:28,520
aspec I completely agree with you and

384
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,870
the only reason that wait is sort of for

385
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,850
the reason that we were talking about if

386
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,129
you stuck this into the existing a fee a

387
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:35,629
fee type stuff regardless whether the

388
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:37,040
evaluation is correct a lot of

389
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,510
implementations say I don't know what

390
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,440
this component is and drop the peering

391
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,730
session so your gated behind the v2 work

392
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,340
or you go with a different Africa's

393
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:48,830
having yeah well I would claim that it

394
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:51,560
wouldn't it needs to will need to have

395
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,750
specified the anafi with this noose a

396
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,139
fee for the tunneled one and if it did

397
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:59,540
that then it would understand that there

398
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:00,590
was a tunneling type there and if it

399
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,760
accepted the tunneling type but

400
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,780
understand the components associated

401
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:09,590
with that tunneling type hello working

402
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:12,139
group member John Scudder in my opinion

403
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:16,850
you're perfectly fine we're using the

404
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:18,740
existing Safi as you say both a fee and

405
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:21,379
Safie provide context so sincere you

406
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,900
know contextualizing it with the ABI as

407
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:26,170
well great don't burn the extra code

408
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,840
point fine sounds good to me

409
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,610
okay okay one of the things that again

410
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,720
because John presented at first

411
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:40,070
hopefully you're thinking about is

412
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:45,530
should this go in a in a B to fixing the

413
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:47,659
type length order my suggestion is to

414
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:50,080
give him code points even if we make it

415
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,490
to v2 decisions so that we can get

416
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:59,360
experimentation going as soon as

417
00:21:52,490 --> 00:22:02,930
possible and so just to add I think that

418
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:05,209
in the case of this pair of drafts in

419
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:06,890
fact I had a bullet on my my one slide

420
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,950
that but I think covered your dress

421
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:13,240
which said that if you're defining

422
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:17,180
flowspec over a new a piece a fee pair

423
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,350
you're okay because it's it's fully

424
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,300
defined and I think that's the point

425
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,159
Jeff was making it the mic to you so I

426
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,889
don't see there any impediment you know

427
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,630
on that basis to you know moving forward

428
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:28,820
with these two drafts right it's

429
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:30,890
actually the pairwise of the Fe and the

430
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,240
Safi together that is the important

431
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,470
piece the you know you could reuse the

432
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,330
same magic number in Safiye

433
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:38,300
if the fe is different the code is

434
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,820
different so that's okay one other thing

435
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:44,540
I'd point out is that looking at the

436
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:46,610
Safi registry 241 up to like 254 is

437
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,590
reserved for private use you could just

438
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:51,110
grab that and start playing with it okay

439
00:22:48,590 --> 00:23:34,820
for temporarily Cumbria's yeah but don't

440
00:22:51,110 --> 00:23:37,419
be shipping it I don't ship anything I'm

441
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:41,179
going to talk about the BGP yang model

442
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:45,620
to begin with if we have a new author

443
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:48,800
edition and Jeff has a agreed to join it

444
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:53,360
and be an author on the draft and for

445
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,790
thanks for his contributions I'm not

446
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,699
going to go through the status you can

447
00:23:55,790 --> 00:24:00,970
go through it look at it the tips are of

448
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:04,580
course there if you have any questions

449
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:08,090
feel free to post on the mailing list so

450
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,790
I'm going to talk about five issues that

451
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:13,360
we are tracking they're being tracked

452
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,240
and github at that particular location

453
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,770
feel free to comment on any of the

454
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,720
issues there if you

455
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,918
or on the mailing list either one is

456
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:27,890
fine I'm gonna go through each one of

457
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,289
them and if I don't hear any objections

458
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,360
and by also posting on the mailing list

459
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,190
if I don't hear any objections I'm going

460
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:37,189
to zoom it's okay to proceed and

461
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:39,820
implement them all right so the first is

462
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:43,700
should Confederation be a peer type

463
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:45,850
currently we have three internal

464
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:49,190
external and Confederation which was

465
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:51,168
probably not the correct way to do it so

466
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:53,270
the new two new additions are the

467
00:24:51,169 --> 00:25:02,049
Confederation internal and Confederation

468
00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:05,720
external it's any comments okay none so

469
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:14,860
noted we'll take you to the mailing list

470
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:14,860
also Jeff so I think the question is

471
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,940
would you differentiate Jeff as the

472
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:25,370
question from Randy Bushwood to

473
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:27,470
differentiate it yes so the motivation

474
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,299
is hearing sessions are internal and

475
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,809
external and are you appearing with your

476
00:25:29,299 --> 00:25:35,120
Confederation yes or no from upstate you

477
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:37,010
know we've always shown its internal or

478
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,389
external and we need the show if it's

479
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:45,559
Confederation because the rules differ

480
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:48,320
but they're orthogonal so you could have

481
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:52,730
internal Confederation external

482
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,678
Confederation you've got four right so

483
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:56,870
our two choices for modelling this was

484
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,279
to have no enum for internal external

485
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:00,799
and then have a boolean that's

486
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:02,090
Confederate which is sort of what you

487
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,929
have but when you're trying to reflect

488
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:08,480
the actual state of the session for what

489
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:10,669
each EP rule you do you basically have

490
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,659
to say which of these four things it is

491
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,830
is the cross product so we're not saying

492
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:17,360
it's no the best one we were the other

493
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,889
you know that I said there is a second

494
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,850
option in there please take a look at

495
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,700
the model and see which one you think

496
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:26,510
makes sense

497
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,580
mmm differently one question to you

498
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:30,860
we're talking here about operational

499
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,029
state or configuration state this is

500
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,859
strictly for

501
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:41,739
operational state maybe that was not

502
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:41,739
clear okay thank you okay

503
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,239
the second issue that we are tracking is

504
00:26:44,299 --> 00:26:49,989
the list of s bad segments so s path

505
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:53,090
will always be maintained as a four byte

506
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:55,129
if riders started that are not four byte

507
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:57,439
capable route update should consist of

508
00:26:55,129 --> 00:27:08,019
either year strands value the magic

509
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:14,659
number is two by comments questions I

510
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:17,570
see really good we got for Church

511
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:20,179
telecom I think this is my standard

512
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:25,580
comment and remark for something like

513
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:27,950
fifteen years are we expecting that the

514
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:36,289
young modeling is going to happen on

515
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:37,999
Reuters that do not have 4-byte asn that

516
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,099
was my say AC Linda I don't think you're

517
00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:42,499
gonna find somebody implementing the

518
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:46,399
yang model that doesn't support for by a

519
00:27:42,499 --> 00:27:49,159
SS I mean what it's it's it's it's would

520
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:50,899
be there how many implementations are

521
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,609
there of this yang model I mean I know

522
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:55,399
there's a few open camp 8 but this yang

523
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:57,349
model so I would interpret both of those

524
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:59,238
comments as supporting choice number one

525
00:27:57,349 --> 00:28:01,129
allows people to keep their comments

526
00:27:59,239 --> 00:28:02,899
brief just because we have a lot of

527
00:28:01,129 --> 00:28:04,248
material to cover yeah just a

528
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:06,678
clarification comments they for bite

529
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:08,869
capable in this case is not the this is

530
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:14,809
you at 32 data structure this is

531
00:28:08,869 --> 00:28:16,459
supporting our C 48 93 for 4 by TSS okay

532
00:28:14,809 --> 00:28:20,089
the third issue that we're tracking is

533
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,989
the a spat Lent container ill ill

534
00:28:20,089 --> 00:28:28,039
contain the calculated s padlet four

535
00:28:23,989 --> 00:28:29,839
routes per 42 seven rules and this is

536
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:32,089
mainly for the user to see the number

537
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:39,158
that serves as input to the BGP route

538
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:40,720
selection are in odd state yes

539
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:44,230
okay

540
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,510
comments support for authentication so

541
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:49,720
currently we are tracking supporting

542
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:55,690
authentication either over IPSec TCP md5

543
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:57,970
and TCP AO with the idea that we'll

544
00:28:55,690 --> 00:29:00,429
probably try to achieve this using IDF

545
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:05,400
keychain model that they see and others

546
00:29:00,429 --> 00:29:05,400
have locked on AC is this work for you

547
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:25,600
we're looking to use the cheat keychain

548
00:29:09,549 --> 00:29:27,490
model a selenium ha I believe we have

549
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,090
everything you need if you look at the

550
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:33,179
algorithms and the key role or know the

551
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,620
key rollers is there ok

552
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:37,990
here's an example how you would do

553
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:40,750
hitless key role over the implementation

554
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:43,390
just have to support it even we've been

555
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,330
doing it in the co not not the egg model

556
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,370
but the CLI version for ages it's just

557
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,590
that not all protocols support key

558
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:55,049
change with the key rollover

559
00:29:50,590 --> 00:30:01,270
Randy Bush is the key role over 40 808

560
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:07,990
sorry is the key role over 40 808 well

561
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:09,340
I'm in trouble with care I'd have to get

562
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:11,230
back to you on that I don't know what

563
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:16,270
for it I don't know the details of 40

564
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:19,539
808 I was asking you know says it

565
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:29,320
supports key you over 40

566
00:30:19,539 --> 00:30:30,190
RFC 48 oh yeah it's real simple so if I

567
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,320
was Randy

568
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:35,350
Mahesh does not know the details this is

569
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,570
us reusing existing models so if the

570
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:40,510
exam a ttle that is being defined by a

571
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:42,070
C's yang module supports it then we'll

572
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:46,390
support it by inheritance that's the

573
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:48,320
idea okay yeah if that was the question

574
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:52,679
[Music]

575
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:56,399
yeah Stephanie kievsky are gathering CP

576
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:59,280
md5 do we need to support it if we want

577
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,820
people to move to display oh oh great

578
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,100
Jeff

579
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,720
yes so you want to make sure that this

580
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,490
can support existing routers and

581
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,780
existing deployments even if this is not

582
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:11,580
something that we would recommend is

583
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:14,360
security a solanum cisco systems

584
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:17,220
so for IPSec as far as I know there's no

585
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:22,799
native IP set for TCP you'd have to

586
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:24,929
define a an IPSec tunnel that uses that

587
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:26,580
as the top as the selector so this is

588
00:31:24,929 --> 00:31:30,110
orthogonal to this model

589
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,110
you wouldn't include IPSec in this model

590
00:31:30,169 --> 00:31:37,080
so tier point AC our implementation

591
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,510
juniper and at least couple of your

592
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,360
flavors over at Cisco have direct

593
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,850
integration into the BGP

594
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,379
configuration for IPSec aesthetics

595
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:47,908
associations that's what's being done

596
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,440
here is to allow the keying of the

597
00:31:47,909 --> 00:31:55,080
session to be tied into the BGP

598
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:58,289
configuration I I don't know if the

599
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,449
existing keychain model supports every

600
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:03,539
algorithm because the keychain model

601
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,480
supports both key and algorithm agility

602
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:08,280
for the rollover ok so I don't know if

603
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,159
we have every algorithm that you might

604
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,559
want to use the question AC is not

605
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,730
whether you have every algorithm but can

606
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:20,309
we express what you're doing in most of

607
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:23,809
the current vendors if this time if you

608
00:32:20,309 --> 00:32:29,250
think that's to be true then we'll go on

609
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:31,918
we looked at both TCP al and TCP md5

610
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:34,799
while we were doing the key chain mod

611
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:38,159
right can I suggest that you know a few

612
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,080
of you that have all the details in your

613
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,880
brand sit down together sometime this

614
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,918
week and just thrash it out and make

615
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,990
sure it all works right so that the meta

616
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,520
here is that we don't want to invent

617
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:50,280
this ourselves this is something that I

618
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:51,539
ATF is trying them standardize and if

619
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:54,299
they don't have a standardized we want

620
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:57,030
them to help standardize talk among

621
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:00,810
yourselves ok

622
00:32:57,030 --> 00:33:02,550
quick North capital R cos the the King

623
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:05,010
mechanism that is described here that

624
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:08,460
sees his trough supports us as he said

625
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:09,990
for md5 nao for IPSec you probably want

626
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:14,160
to look at something which was discussed

627
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:16,350
in carp working group that's close but

628
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:23,850
you need a king mechanism or a key

629
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:25,740
material to be exchanged okay and final

630
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:28,070
issue is features and attributes that

631
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:33,360
like references there's a list of them

632
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:34,980
our su in particular to see this is this

633
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,290
is where the chair I take off my

634
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:41,090
co-author hat and put on the chair had

635
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:44,520
this is essentially in order to get to

636
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:48,949
be effective within the yang committee

637
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:54,030
we need to actually define these so

638
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:57,210
we'll need to put together a description

639
00:33:54,030 --> 00:34:00,290
there are two option in a chair model

640
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:02,940
separate draft or this draft my

641
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,149
suggestion is to make that clear and and

642
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:10,409
easy for everybody to debate on we put

643
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:12,600
it in a separate draft if you're from a

644
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:15,240
vendor and you implement some of these

645
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,639
features I'm interested in talking to

646
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,560
getting a small cadre of people to push

647
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,299
this quickly very quick very quickly a

648
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,699
sealant of what we did for the IGP

649
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,190
models is we put a lot line and we said

650
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:30,540
no more features in them and then these

651
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,760
features are going to have to come in in

652
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,730
augmentations okay put this particular

653
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:38,790
model one of the thing was we wanted the

654
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,889
common features that this has the

655
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:42,480
inheritance from some of the open config

656
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,210
work where we have the common features

657
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,949
these are as far as we've been although

658
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:48,929
yeah these are old as the hills yeah

659
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:50,969
okay so this is part of the base alright

660
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:53,070
this is part of the base model we

661
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:57,000
believe they're widely implemented but

662
00:34:53,070 --> 00:35:00,570
they're like references I have a

663
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,050
question now for the model how to arise

664
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:06,810
to implemented for multi public instance

665
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:10,590
not for we are all behind for I mean

666
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:13,529
that if I have money for PDP incidence

667
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,730
both wrong we came before or other

668
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:22,020
adjust by then I have some way of

669
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:25,770
instance it's also wrong P P for P to ze

670
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:29,240
but L 1 for example 1 we have 1 I want

671
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:31,770
to use the PDP instance the one to

672
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:33,890
advertise beginning for roles and the

673
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:37,230
reacted to I have a for another

674
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:40,890
excellent point but not the focus of

675
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:44,160
this particular model this particular

676
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:46,379
model is just the base if did I

677
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:49,140
misunderstand he's coming and Jeff go

678
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,230
ahead and answer one other thing I don't

679
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:59,990
think you said your name can you please

680
00:35:51,230 --> 00:36:08,780
give your name for the minutes standard

681
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:08,779
male Meli's aha he is hypo yang yeah

682
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:16,799
okay go ahead and we the partial

683
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:19,080
discussion that we had was the nmda

684
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,300
battle for the Rick instancing gives him

685
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,680
a portion of what he is looking for we

686
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,910
need to close the loop and the last

687
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,359
piece of the component that he was

688
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,529
discussing

689
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,290
I think I remember the thread in

690
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:30,810
question okay so just to completely

691
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:32,850
complete on this slide so these are

692
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:35,970
individually will be surrounded by

693
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:38,220
individual feature statements so that

694
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:41,279
make them optional to implement just

695
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:45,029
wanted to make that so a question about

696
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,030
anything so you're saying you're going

697
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:50,510
to document what these features how

698
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:55,680
these features operate somewhere else

699
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:59,280
question Mahesh gave us a pre look at

700
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,040
what the anchors might say that that

701
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,900
these would need to have some

702
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,960
documentation they can point you yes and

703
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,240
I love references and I'd love to see

704
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,490
what this actually means the question is

705
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,540
again the intent is to have a draft a

706
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:19,649
separate draft one or more standards

707
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:22,020
track draft the documents these features

708
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,460
in in this case that we're all I'm

709
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:28,780
treating it in my chair hat

710
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:31,119
as a case where you have a document and

711
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:33,760
for clarity's sake you break the

712
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,520
document into multiple documents no

713
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,470
that's that's fine so the observations

714
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,990
that ever make is that we know how long

715
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,779
the process can take for each one of

716
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:51,750
these documents and if it's not one if

717
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:54,310
it's multiple one six right maybe

718
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:55,570
consider if there are features that you

719
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:57,099
can define in there

720
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:59,050
I don't know advertising active routes

721
00:37:57,099 --> 00:38:00,190
that sounds like a true sentence thing

722
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:03,280
that you where you can describe what

723
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,630
that is maybe that is something you

724
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,859
could just put in the draft right this

725
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,720
it's not normative or anywhere else

726
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,660
maybe something you want to do you want

727
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,430
to put there just surely the current

728
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,368
discussion among the authors is a

729
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:25,299
separate draft of arrow if you have more

730
00:38:15,369 --> 00:38:28,900
input please let us know a Celinda m--

731
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,150
so maybe not for some of these it seems

732
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,800
like you could just put them in the

733
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:36,190
description in the egg model and that'd

734
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,560
be enough I'm not saying that applies to

735
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:40,300
every one of them but like always

736
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,420
compare met that seems like that would

737
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,000
be a paragraph like this and you could

738
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,710
completely describe okay in interest of

739
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,210
time I'd like to cut off further

740
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,619
discussion even though I have some

741
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,890
comments I would like to make about it -

742
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:56,339
I'm not going to make them so we can

743
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:58,540
continue later

744
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:18,120
thank you very much working group for

745
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:25,009
active discussion here trying to do

746
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:28,830
hey Percy hi everyone today I'm watching

747
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:32,190
okay-y much hang on the future way today

748
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:39,330
I'm going to talk about the PGP for ite

749
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:47,340
allocation so basically we have adoption

750
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:49,529
call from April then we we have a number

751
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:52,980
of comments I think the major one is

752
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:59,280
that some people don't like using PGP LS

753
00:39:52,980 --> 00:40:00,660
for SIDS and also suggested that using a

754
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,670
new epistatic

755
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:09,089
and then the other are commands so in

756
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:11,640
this draft I we addressed all the

757
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:15,840
comments so it's basically the first one

758
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,509
the first of the important one so some

759
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:22,920
people don't like this kind of extension

760
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:25,980
to PGP lr s for s ID so we just get a

761
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,450
raved get rid of that one and then we

762
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:34,260
use the suggestions so we use ur new at

763
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:37,649
the NS a v4 s ID as suggested and then

764
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:41,430
for those are other comments for example

765
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:44,130
people says why you use a BGP why not it

766
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:47,009
is a young and then those are stuff so

767
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:49,790
we give more detailed explanations for

768
00:40:47,010 --> 00:40:52,170
those why and why not in the draft and

769
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,150
also some people mentioned that we're

770
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:56,340
missing something we straw if we want to

771
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,840
withdraw these SIDS and we need to put

772
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,080
something so we also addressed of the

773
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:05,640
one in addition to that we ad the cap

774
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:09,420
with the negotiations so any other

775
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:15,000
comments regarding for this new version

776
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:17,030
I encourage discussion on the list as

777
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,030
well

778
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:22,290
it's sense if it

779
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:24,030
we made a Lunt option call and they've

780
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,970
tried to address it it would be helpful

781
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:30,540
if if there's something you think still

782
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:31,830
broken or still needs to be worked on ok

783
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:42,480
thank you we'll go on to

784
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:44,759
next okay thank you yeah I also go

785
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:51,500
quickly yes go ahead

786
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:56,810
so another why is a fruit spec or as rv6

787
00:41:51,500 --> 00:42:00,740
so basically with very small extensions

788
00:41:56,810 --> 00:42:05,640
so for existing flow spec is for

789
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:12,359
traditional IPS so we eat we extend that

790
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:20,730
much infield to the I si D is in the s

791
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:24,240
rh so just two component type so in last

792
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:29,810
version we've already talked about it

793
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:35,910
these two new types so one type is for

794
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:39,259
margin conditions to a whole si D so

795
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:45,359
another type is for matching conditions

796
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:49,430
so focus on the some part of that IDs

797
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:53,880
such as a locator and the function or

798
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:56,399
arguments so basically we the fact that

799
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,090
the format of this one this is similar

800
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,390
to the existing rules back so each one

801
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:07,200
will contain at least of all OP and

802
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:08,910
values so these at least will define the

803
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,069
match conditions so has this much

804
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,770
condition are satisfied so action will

805
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:18,690
happen so both axes are at same as the

806
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:20,880
existing one so the format of for the

807
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:25,560
opportunity for in this version is that

808
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:30,630
we just give more detail specific format

809
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:34,860
or the second component type which is a

810
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:39,120
week we would like to focus on some part

811
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:43,470
of SIDS such a locator function and

812
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,319
arguments so any comments for this one

813
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:51,209
so

814
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:57,430
we recently improved the v6 flowspec

815
00:43:51,210 --> 00:44:04,240
by releasing it and making it and this

816
00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:06,759
thing had co-author on the v6 have you

817
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,750
taken a look at it I realize we just

818
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,990
made the deadline so maybe you didn't it

819
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:16,510
might if you haven't if you I forgot to

820
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:22,350
mention that yesterday that if you're

821
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:22,350
looking for the v6 if you're only SR v6

822
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,580
that that may not be as germane but if

823
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:36,339
you're if you're looking at regular v6

824
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:39,009
and you need to harmonize so I it does

825
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:41,380
the SR v6 need to be harmonized with the

826
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,870
regular v6 oh yeah a little bit

827
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:47,160
different because radius ripple of

828
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:50,049
physics is also focus on those kind of

829
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,370
traditional IPS means yes for this one

830
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:59,110
we extend this kind of a match domain

831
00:44:53,370 --> 00:45:01,600
inside those are SRH it's a word we're

832
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,520
two different app apples and oranges

833
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,120
that's what I had initially thought but

834
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:11,050
as you were presenting I I wanted to

835
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:17,080
listen is there any other comments how

836
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:25,030
is the sr6 work coming are we progressed

837
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:26,650
enough to look at flow specs easy later

838
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:29,230
I just have a comment on all these flow

839
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:33,160
specs and the idea of getting a flow

840
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:35,110
spec for every end cap is the ID is

841
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,730
there a framework for what you're gonna

842
00:45:35,110 --> 00:45:39,670
do if this is it seems like you're doing

843
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:41,290
open flow with flowspec right is our is

844
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,430
there some document that describes the

845
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:44,950
requirement and what you're doing of

846
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:48,310
this or is it just just because if

847
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:52,750
there's an MP and that end cap exists

848
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:56,020
we'll do a flowspec um okay see John's

849
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:57,940
first slide our first thing is we think

850
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:00,520
we oughta as chairs

851
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:05,500
again chair hat on we have to go back

852
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:07,990
and fix the basics of TLV then as to the

853
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:11,230
rest that would be an appropriate time

854
00:46:07,990 --> 00:46:14,560
to say what if you think we should

855
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:20,079
narrow our scope at the original

856
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:22,390
definition of flowspec there was a very

857
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:25,810
targeted audience and a very targeted

858
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:29,500
focus the addition requests have

859
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:34,900
indicated that the same denial of

860
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:38,230
service attack work is concerned we

861
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:42,490
haven't done when I presented the

862
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:45,910
original v2 I had called for a thought

863
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:47,740
your exact question of harmonization the

864
00:46:45,910 --> 00:46:52,660
working group asked to put it off till

865
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:55,089
we got the Bissau so your comment is

866
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,828
germane and I think the working group

867
00:46:55,089 --> 00:47:03,849
should reconsider all these things the

868
00:46:59,829 --> 00:47:08,230
reason I asked about the SR v6 this is a

869
00:47:03,849 --> 00:47:11,800
new type of caring planter that seems to

870
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:14,710
take the v6 control plane I don't know

871
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:17,619
enough personally as to the deployment

872
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:18,970
so that was a question I guess yeah ac

873
00:47:17,619 --> 00:47:21,579
Lindemann it seems it seems like the

874
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:23,919
header document is at least done I don't

875
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:24,970
know about you know locator it seems

876
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,130
like there's only there's only a couple

877
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:30,279
ways you could do it so so we have some

878
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:35,800
time to discuss the v2 and to talk about

879
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:37,540
this limitations go ahead and make your

880
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,700
comments please keep them brief if you

881
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:41,170
can line is closed after you guys

882
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:44,980
because when though still has one more

883
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:49,480
thing to go through care was up first go

884
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,920
ahead Capitol artists I think I think we

885
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,050
should hold this work till we have the

886
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:55,780
flow spec v2 hashed out and you could

887
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:57,700
then use this as a capability or new TLB

888
00:47:55,780 --> 00:48:00,099
and carried having once a fee would be a

889
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:02,560
much better choice from an

890
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:05,920
implementation perspective then to get a

891
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:08,009
Sofia explosion within flows back yeah

892
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,180
that's good feedback

893
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:11,310
jeffires as far as the applicability

894
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,810
goes the

895
00:48:11,310 --> 00:48:15,450
motivation that all these different

896
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:17,460
authors have for trying to drill into

897
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:20,850
the contents of various tunneled packets

898
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:22,890
his flowspec is being used for two big

899
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,569
cases right now the first one for

900
00:48:22,890 --> 00:48:26,790
dealing with standard DDoS type things

901
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:28,980
at various number gauges which may be

902
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:31,500
under some types of tunnels as an

903
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:33,600
example you know if for example if I

904
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:35,820
would pick a topic near and you're like

905
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:38,009
Linda's heart fit so that's the UN type

906
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:40,410
of implementation you may need to be

907
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,850
able to do a flowspec filter targeting a

908
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:44,129
specific port for a specific

909
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:45,930
encapsulation and still do all the

910
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:48,720
firewall type things that flow spec is

911
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:51,410
good for so that's one motivation the

912
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,720
second motivation and I suspect from

913
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:56,310
some of the people in the participants

914
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,140
is that they're using the flowspec

915
00:48:56,310 --> 00:49:14,640
filters to be able to be used for

916
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:19,200
traffic engineering purposes this one

917
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:23,400
Mia is about a extension to BGP for SR

918
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:28,250
pass ingress protection so right now we

919
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:32,190
already have SR policy draft is invoking

920
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:36,750
is walking walking with document so as

921
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:39,900
our policy well sender s are passed to

922
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:44,550
the ingress node of data pass and

923
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:47,340
English not West set up that pass but

924
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:50,310
when that humid in Lhasa fails so in

925
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,750
order to prove in order to provide

926
00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:55,710
protection for the failure of that

927
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:59,910
English node so we needed to also send

928
00:49:55,710 --> 00:50:02,850
up another by car pass through a

929
00:49:59,910 --> 00:50:04,890
backpack Harper English note so the path

930
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:06,920
back a path will be from that back by

931
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:10,850
coupling with note to the equals note

932
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:16,860
unity so that we may have some kind of

933
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:18,779
informations will for protections so

934
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:20,160
basically in the previous version we

935
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,380
already talked about these kind of

936
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,790
extensions so the extension is the first

937
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,130
small and then we just made

938
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,990
stop at least this opportunity contains

939
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,590
the information for the protections and

940
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:35,140
then in this version we just make made a

941
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:38,320
little bit change a damn war description

942
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:42,129
as a subsidiary which described the

943
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:46,900
traffic that a backup as well

944
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:50,440
well we'll transport so this is the

945
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:59,170
sapaterre of the details yeah that's all

946
00:50:50,440 --> 00:51:02,740
any comments so on all of this a couple

947
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:06,850
of times i've queried these bring chairs

948
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:11,379
on some of the policy i also ask if

949
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:14,319
you're working toward using this spring

950
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:18,100
policy that you at least give me a heads

951
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:27,210
up operationally what what this is being

952
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:35,710
used for on the are pd acceptance as a

953
00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:38,290
draft i also call for operator input hi

954
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:42,600
andrew here from liquid telecom we are

955
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:47,880
using s or policy a fair amount of it

956
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:51,910
primarily for steering traffic around

957
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,620
places that how do I put this certain

958
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:56,710
customers do not want to root over

959
00:51:53,620 --> 00:52:00,880
certain locations of a certain hardware

960
00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:03,610
etc etc and so we give them the option

961
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,490
to steer around far away patch that is

962
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:11,680
all done with s or policy injection and

963
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:14,680
it's a big deal for us looking at this I

964
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:17,319
I will admit that I have not read the

965
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:19,480
drafts this proposal before this meeting

966
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:24,280
my bad

967
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:25,990
but my question here would be if I'm

968
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:29,650
going to send a backup off at the moment

969
00:52:25,990 --> 00:52:31,959
over the SR stuff why am I not just

970
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:34,000
going to send two separate paths using

971
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:37,120
two separate communities to dictate

972
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:38,380
which route or accepts them and send it

973
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,020
like that

974
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:43,570
rather than complexified my policy

975
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:46,240
saying to the Ruta create another part

976
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:48,310
when I can simply inject the two paths

977
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,169
do all the calculations on the back end

978
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:52,420
and then set the communities to

979
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,940
determine which route or accepts to me

980
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,820
that seems like a lot simpler option and

981
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:59,890
it leaves the control in my controller

982
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:03,250
to calculate all of those paths that

983
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:06,220
would be my comment on this I would

984
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:09,190
appreciate if that type of comment also

985
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:13,180
went toward the spring chairs with the

986
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:14,980
reference to this there there you know

987
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:20,669
some of this is refreshment and that's

988
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,670
very good feedback and questions okay

989
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:33,100
alright so I think we're up to Europe

990
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:35,440
and we're we're almost running on time I

991
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:38,440
will ask people's indulgence to say just

992
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:41,740
a few extra minutes so that he can have

993
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:44,860
his is full ten minutes but we're we're

994
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:46,509
darn close to being on time anyway so if

995
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:56,240
almost on time you mean I have to go

996
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:59,420
slow or fast perfect do I have a clicker

997
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,419
[Music]

998
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:10,330
job Snyder's entity I want to provide a

999
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:15,820
small update on some work that was

1000
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:20,650
presented in ITF 104 in the Gros working

1001
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:22,780
group and my hope is that this work and

1002
00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:25,660
transition to the ID our working group

1003
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:27,220
which is why I'm here but some of you

1004
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:31,779
have already seen parts of this

1005
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:35,470
presentation the topic at hand is bgp

1006
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:37,840
maximum prefix limits HB maximum prefix

1007
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:41,290
limits are a very popular mechanism in

1008
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:45,550
the operator world to dampen the

1009
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:48,880
negative effects of mostly full table

1010
00:54:45,550 --> 00:54:50,410
route leaks so it's a very crude

1011
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:53,289
mechanism or it

1012
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:57,038
helps against very common occurrence

1013
00:54:53,289 --> 00:55:01,960
that we see in internet in the internet

1014
00:54:57,039 --> 00:55:06,039
routing system if you look at the core

1015
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:08,530
BGP specification there is which

1016
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:11,170
introduced BGP maximum prefix limits

1017
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:15,280
there is no notion of whether those

1018
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:20,010
prefix limits are applied pre import

1019
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:26,650
policy or post import policy and I've

1020
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:29,530
created an image where on the x axis we

1021
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:32,380
see a progression over time and the y

1022
00:55:29,530 --> 00:55:34,119
axis is the amount of prefixes that one

1023
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:38,549
network is sending to the other network

1024
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:40,690
and when a leak occurs the amount of

1025
00:55:38,549 --> 00:55:43,900
routes advertised to the adjacent

1026
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:47,380
network goes up until it hits a certain

1027
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:49,780
threshold where the common operational

1028
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:52,599
procedure is to configure the device so

1029
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:55,630
that it tears down the BGP session and

1030
00:55:52,599 --> 00:56:00,160
from that moment on even though maybe

1031
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:02,950
bgp session is destructed both networks

1032
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,788
are in a safer state than they would be

1033
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:12,460
if the leak persists now this is what

1034
00:56:06,789 --> 00:56:15,039
happens pre policy well can occur if a

1035
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:21,039
maximum prefix limit is applied post

1036
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:23,740
policy is that between an e BGP prefix

1037
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:26,109
based filter that derive from say IR

1038
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:28,959
data or or in case

1039
00:56:26,109 --> 00:56:35,308
RPI based HP origin validation is

1040
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:40,420
applied that so many parts are rejected

1041
00:56:35,309 --> 00:56:43,750
in the policy that the amount of routes

1042
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:47,170
that make it through the policy does not

1043
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:49,089
exceed the trash hold in which case even

1044
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,240
though you have a full routing League

1045
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:56,828
full table route leak if you have high

1046
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:58,509
quality filters the a part of the leak

1047
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:00,609
still makes it through and the session

1048
00:56:58,510 --> 00:57:04,240
does not tear down because the

1049
00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:08,109
thresholds are not reached

1050
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:11,500
this is discovery we've made in the real

1051
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:14,348
worlds where at some point we in NTT

1052
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,450
realized hey we were contributing to a

1053
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:19,930
route leak that lasted for multiple

1054
00:57:16,450 --> 00:57:24,098
hours how come why do we even observe

1055
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:27,160
this behavior there are benefits to both

1056
00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:30,309
pre policy maximum prefix limits and

1057
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:34,118
post policy maximum prefix limits the

1058
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:38,250
pre policy limit feature is very

1059
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:41,589
effective against full table route leaks

1060
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:45,279
and it is also very effective to protect

1061
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:47,799
against memory exhaustion in case a BGP

1062
00:57:45,279 --> 00:57:50,890
implementation is operating with a fully

1063
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:54,369
populated adjacent grip in the

1064
00:57:50,890 --> 00:57:58,029
advantages of a post policy limit could

1065
00:57:54,369 --> 00:58:01,539
be to protect against rip or fit

1066
00:57:58,029 --> 00:58:05,289
exhaustion or to enforce contractual

1067
00:58:01,539 --> 00:58:08,619
agreements between parties an example of

1068
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:12,940
this could be that as part of a layer 3

1069
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:19,089
VPN service only X amount of routes are

1070
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:22,539
allowed in into that that VPN the

1071
00:58:19,089 --> 00:58:25,900
illustration here is that that both use

1072
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:29,490
cases exist in a world and I think

1073
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:34,599
they're there they're valid use cases

1074
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:36,700
now if we go take a look at what is

1075
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,900
available to operators these days

1076
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:41,890
it appears there's a wealth myriad of

1077
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:44,500
interpretations of the particular

1078
00:58:41,890 --> 00:58:48,670
sections of the core BGP spec on how to

1079
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:53,230
do maximum prefix limits specifically on

1080
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:57,460
iOS XR + XE the concept of pre policy

1081
00:58:53,230 --> 00:59:03,720
limits does not exist at all

1082
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:07,599
and then on other platforms for instance

1083
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:10,930
OpenBSD is open Beach PD the post policy

1084
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:14,710
variance does not exist and I believe

1085
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:17,129
that the is this inconsistency between

1086
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:21,839
HP implementations

1087
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:24,720
a result of the lack of mentioning that

1088
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:29,119
pre policy and post policy limits could

1089
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:32,720
exist in the original BGP specification

1090
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:35,930
my hope is that by specifying that both

1091
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:39,089
exists and how they should how they

1092
00:59:35,930 --> 00:59:41,910
should behave that we can encourage

1093
00:59:39,089 --> 00:59:44,308
vendors to consider implementing both

1094
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:46,558
types of limits and I believe this will

1095
00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:51,299
have positive impact on operational

1096
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:56,160
community a second aspect of the draft

1097
00:59:51,299 --> 01:00:02,690
we would like to work on is the notion

1098
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:06,779
of outbound maximum prefix limits very

1099
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:11,220
very crude character stationed a

1100
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:13,490
character that's a difficult word from

1101
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:17,160
the concept of entities perspective

1102
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:20,220
being a simple internet transit provider

1103
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:22,859
the general case is that we will either

1104
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:26,640
announce a full routing table to appear

1105
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:31,220
or a subset of that full routing table

1106
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:35,400
say half of the full routing table and

1107
01:00:31,220 --> 01:00:37,740
in the instance where to the piers where

1108
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:41,309
we only intend to announce our customer

1109
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:45,348
routes which is half if we would exceed

1110
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:48,990
a threshold of say 400 500,000 routes

1111
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:51,329
whatever is happening is wrong and we

1112
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:54,808
would be better off if we self-destruct

1113
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:59,039
our sessions on that particular ebgp

1114
01:00:54,809 --> 01:01:03,390
neighbor so this the concept of maximum

1115
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:07,319
of outbound maximum prefix limits serves

1116
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:09,420
to to facilitate situations where maybe

1117
01:01:07,319 --> 01:01:12,029
the peer did not configure any limits

1118
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:14,490
but we have expectations of what we

1119
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:18,529
expect to announce to the specific

1120
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:22,490
adjacent network and that we can opt to

1121
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:24,990
shoot ourselves in the head should we

1122
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:28,540
shoot certain high-water marks be

1123
01:01:24,990 --> 01:01:32,500
reached now

1124
01:01:28,540 --> 01:01:35,470
only birth as an implementation supports

1125
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:40,990
this today and I if a battle of open

1126
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:42,879
Beach PD to to consider for testing I am

1127
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:46,060
aware that there are a number of

1128
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,700
complexities related to this feature we

1129
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,009
should this be adopted as a working

1130
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:53,890
group we will need to identify those

1131
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:56,890
complexities and see if we can resolve

1132
01:01:53,890 --> 01:01:59,200
them so this I'm not passing this off as

1133
01:01:56,890 --> 01:02:03,279
a trivial feature but I think it is

1134
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:11,680
worth attempting to specify this so

1135
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:14,650
compared to ITF 104 I've come to an

1136
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:17,680
important insight in that grow meeting

1137
01:02:14,650 --> 01:02:24,970
back then and there I advocated that's

1138
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:29,250
only a cease notification should be

1139
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:31,390
applied if maximum prefix limits are met

1140
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,849
reasoning from the perspective of

1141
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:36,910
internet routing we're tearing down the

1142
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:38,920
session is a more desirable state of

1143
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:43,569
being compared to keeping the session up

1144
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:47,800
but stopping stop accepting new

1145
01:02:43,570 --> 01:02:51,760
advertisements however upon rereading

1146
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:54,760
the core BGP specification it became

1147
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:58,150
clear to me that already today in the

1148
01:02:54,760 --> 01:03:00,970
course back we have two options of

1149
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:03,490
dealing with hitting the maximum prefix

1150
01:03:00,970 --> 01:03:07,209
limits one is keep the session of block

1151
01:03:03,490 --> 01:03:09,040
new extra announcements I want us to go

1152
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:12,400
through the motions of tearing out the

1153
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:16,690
session so we will need to rework the

1154
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:19,390
draft to provide compatibility with what

1155
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:21,640
already exists even though as an

1156
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:25,420
internet operator it is not my favorite

1157
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:29,348
option I do not wish to alter that part

1158
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:36,030
I want to my goal is to to revise and

1159
01:03:29,349 --> 01:03:36,030
clarify and not take things away

1160
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:43,520
sue has been very kind in providing a

1161
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:47,630
extensive review of our first step at

1162
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,340
this draft and she also provided the

1163
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:52,340
primary notes fish and who moved the

1164
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:55,640
word from grow to idea as she was able

1165
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:58,550
to articulate with some patience to us

1166
01:03:55,640 --> 01:04:06,290
that these things can only materialize

1167
01:03:58,550 --> 01:04:08,810
if we do this as a update to for 2001 in

1168
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:12,220
doing so I've come to realize that there

1169
01:04:08,810 --> 01:04:15,140
is a fair bit of spaghetti to untangle

1170
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:18,109
because the concept of maximum prefix

1171
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:24,129
limits is mentioned in numerous sections

1172
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:28,880
and well it is a very exciting puzzle

1173
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:33,820
and and yeah III we we would benefit

1174
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:36,410
from from help in how to not only

1175
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:38,360
articulate what we want to accomplish

1176
01:04:36,410 --> 01:04:40,279
because I think a natural language the

1177
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:43,040
notion of pre policy versus post policy

1178
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:45,290
is fairly easy to explain from from one

1179
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:48,710
person to another but we should also be

1180
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:53,000
very careful in not making the current

1181
01:04:48,710 --> 01:04:56,470
text that we want to update worse and

1182
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,730
and foremost in this effort is to drive

1183
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:01,370
consistency across multiple BGP

1184
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:03,410
implementations and provides users of

1185
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:06,440
BGP implementations with a reference

1186
01:05:03,410 --> 01:05:11,990
which they can maybe consider in their

1187
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:14,390
RF piece so the next step is to go

1188
01:05:11,990 --> 01:05:17,180
through another round of cleanup to see

1189
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:19,879
if we can improve the language and undo

1190
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:22,299
some of the spaghetti and then I would

1191
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,610
like to move forward with asking for

1192
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:30,860
working group adoption and work on this

1193
01:05:25,610 --> 01:05:32,570
jointly thank you I would like to say

1194
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:34,640
let's not have questions at the mic

1195
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:36,740
because we're at two minutes over our

1196
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:38,330
three minutes over so now we're five

1197
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:40,250
minutes over and I don't you know I've

1198
01:05:38,330 --> 01:05:42,740
seen people filtering out so I think

1199
01:05:40,250 --> 01:05:46,010
it's you know sort of let's respect the

1200
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:48,080
group's time if you have points to make

1201
01:05:46,010 --> 01:05:49,070
by all means please make them on the

1202
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:52,520
list or

1203
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:53,500
you know where to find job thank you

1204
01:05:52,520 --> 01:05:56,840
again thank you
