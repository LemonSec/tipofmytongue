we've got an extra it is a very it's a

3
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:43,380
ridiculous room and door we are not

4
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,379
projecting anything

6
00:01:18,670 --> 00:02:00,880
issues yes that looks promising it's

7
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,880

you're ready good all right let's get

9
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,179
rolling blue sheets around about if you

10
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:25,340
are here for Jenn dispatch you are in

11
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:28,220
the right place

12
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:31,459
we have been taking notes in are you

13
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:33,380
taking notes in etherpad if anybody

14
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,540
would like to join Ben and etherpad that

15
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:39,950
I'm sure he would be thrilled to have

16
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:44,149
the help Murray is back there doing

17
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,530
jabber scribing and and relaying if

18
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:47,930
anyone wants to join Murray in the

19
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:52,269
jabber room I'm sure he would appreciate

20
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:55,040
it and blue sheets are going around and

21
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:57,050
if you are in the back and actually plan

22
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,660
to talk come to the front and if not

23
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:03,950
well fine just play in the back all

24
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:08,000
right all of the appropriate information

25
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:10,390
is up on the screen and oh and look at

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,549
that we have magic button and everything

27
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,768
it's early in the week but everybody in

28
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:19,360
here I expect should know how to note

29
00:03:15,769 --> 00:03:24,230
well the note well please do make sure

30
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,550
that minutes you understand that minutes

31
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,519
are being taken the meeting is being

32
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,720
recorded and your presence is logged on

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,760
the blue sheets

34
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:33,260
if you have any issues with intellectual

35
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,600
property and any of the things that are

36
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,980
being discussed today you probably want

37
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:48,320
to read up on the rules and check with a

38
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:51,649
lawyer yeah do we have any agenda

39
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:54,310
bashing to do any additions or

40
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,810
subtractions I know Martin said he was

41
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:59,210
running around doing one thing and so we

42
00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:02,240
may need to shuffle him to the end of

43
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:12,680
the agenda but anything else need to be

44
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:16,910
changed so the only thing I think we

45
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,880
wanted to say up front is you know this

46
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:23,300
is generally like most other dispatch

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:24,950
groups or trying to figure out what to

48
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:28,130
do with the documents that are being

49
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,260
presented whether they need to go to a

50
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:35,150
buff and what we're or whether they need

51
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:38,360
to go away or whether they need to just

52
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,880
have an ad sponsor them or what have you

53
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:42,650
so we're trying to get enough

54
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,930
information out of the proposals to

55
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,849
understand which one of those things it

56
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,760
is we're not trying to argue the

57
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,590
proposals in here and then we're going

58
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,320
to at the end make a recommendation to

59
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:58,820
Alisa or whoever else might be involved

60
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:04,580
about what to do there anything else you

61
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:08,590
wanted so Joel why don't you flow it up

62
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,590
and give us your dog and/or pony show

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,510
hello I'm Joel Halpern this is a very

64
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:27,580
short draft and in fact I did not make

65
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:29,740
any slides for it as it seemed pointless

66
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:33,940
the slides would be longer than the

67
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:36,040
draft so the history is very simp the

68
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:37,870
relevant piece of history our history as

69
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,810
a whole is not simple but the relevant

70
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:45,790
pieces of history are very simple RFC

71
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:49,810
2026 says you can put that the that the

72
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:51,700
RFC editor can publish informational and

73
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,370
experimental drafts which I do not have

74
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:58,870
IETF consents rough consensus I'm

75
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,670
paraphrasing which when 2026 was written

76
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:03,520
was absolutely necessary because there

77
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:06,220
were no streams so that covered IEP

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,380
documents it covered RTF documents it

79
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:11,230
covered the things that John Postell

80
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:14,770
published which are now independence

81
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:16,810
dream documents the iesg has for

82
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:21,190
understandable reasons interpreted this

83
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:24,390
to say the isg can publish informational

84
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:30,640
and experimental RFC's in the ITF stream

85
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:34,539
without having ITF rough consensus they

86
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:37,330
have done this and recently proposed to

87
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,770
do so ago ad proposed to do so again

88
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:43,719
which is what caused me to go huh

89
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,180
because that just makes the ITF stream

90
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,970
is the ITF stream it should be ITF rough

91
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:53,080
consensus documents so the now so this

92
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:56,910
are this one says simple update 2026 to

93
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:59,080
say the is T will must not publish

94
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,810
informational or experimental documents

95
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,849
in the IETF stream without IETF rough

96
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,160
consensus and then it goes through and

97
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:08,710
discusses the few corner cases we could

98
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,190
think of it does note in the very bottom

99
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:13,659
that if this doesn't happen the IB

100
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,460
should probably look at the boilerplate

101
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:17,740
cuz the IAB owns the boilerplates

102
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,560
because the boilerplate difference it

103
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,840
turns out if you do take this path is

104
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,390
simply that the non consensus document

105
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,080
is missing the sentence that says there

106
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:30,659
was consensus

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,609
not exactly clear but I consider that a

108
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:37,050
minor issue because the right fix is

109
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:38,430
dead simple right there on the screen so

110
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,880
what I'd like is feedback from other

111
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,880
people

112
00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:46,400
hi this is Barry liebe I'm the ad

113
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,900
whoo-hoo Joel just mentioned I didn't

114
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:53,669
suggest that we would that we should do

115
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,888
it I suggested that it was possible to

116
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,340
do it and I support this document I

117
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:03,389
think it is generally the policy right

118
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:06,330
now that we do this and I think making

119
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:11,370
it cast a bit casting it in stone is

120
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:13,530
better Thank You Philip Johan Baker yeah

121
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:16,740
I very much support this having been the

122
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,679
victim of it there was an occasion where

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,620
at an early stage of what I believed to

124
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,050
be an independent draft I was told in no

125
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,550
certain terms that my input was not

126
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:34,169
wanted and I had no right to raise it

127
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:37,380
and that then became a draft and it is

128
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,799
now an RFC with ITF and standards track

129
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,770
on it and I was really really pissed as

130
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:47,250
everybody knows and I tried to appeal it

131
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:49,140
and was not able to appeal it either so

132
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:51,839
I think that we should shut the door on

133
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,860
this because it is a oh it is not only

134
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,410
open for abuse it has been abused China

135
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,029
I think you're next John Peterson I

136
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,319
think this is a great idea and we should

137
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:06,660
figure out a way to advance this

138
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,180
document our consensus can I can I make

139
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,329
the suggestion from up here that part of

140
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,120
the question was what method should be

141
00:09:12,329 --> 00:09:17,579
we be using to do that not just that

142
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:21,420
it's a good idea and thank you for I got

143
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:22,680
the irony of it unsurprisingly because I

144
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,270
quoted as a troll Thank You Joel for

145
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,829
doing the work I'm in favor of this I as

146
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,939
I read the Jim dispatch process they

147
00:09:28,829 --> 00:09:31,500
probably appropriate thing is to ask for

148
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,300
this to be sponsored by the row of an ad

149
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,589
because this is like so trivial I can't

150
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:38,250
imagine what other process we would use

151
00:09:34,589 --> 00:09:39,529
for it takes anything other than ad

152
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,329
sponsorship something

153
00:09:39,529 --> 00:09:45,920
confused dead it's not Hardy speaking I

154
00:09:43,329 --> 00:09:47,329
am broadly in favor of this I do believe

155
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,029
that the document may need a slight

156
00:09:47,329 --> 00:09:52,519
revision to make it clear that what's

157
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,050
the ITF has consensus about is or rough

158
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,540
consensus about is to publish not

159
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,550
necessarily the content because you may

160
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,800
be publishing something as experimental

161
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:02,689
in particular with the results of the

162
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,878
experiment which you clearly have

163
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:07,579
determined failed and therefore we don't

164
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,410
have consensus around the protocol we

165
00:10:07,579 --> 00:10:11,300
have consensus to publish the results of

166
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:13,490
the experiment so I think there's a

167
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,920
little bit of extra wording or a happy

168
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,819
to have wording suggestion but other

169
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,620
than that I think it's generally

170
00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,719
speaking a good idea and I agree with

171
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:24,769
ekor that this is probably something

172
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,259
that ad sponsorship with a four week ITF

173
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:36,670
last Call list discussion would be

174
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:36,670
appropriate thank you John Europe

175
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:48,248
Joan you're up high I think I think the

176
00:10:44,859 --> 00:10:52,209
principle here is correct my guess is

177
00:10:48,249 --> 00:10:53,919
that this is the wrong way you do it and

178
00:10:52,209 --> 00:11:00,339
then it would be better to do this on

179
00:10:53,919 --> 00:11:02,049
the basis of saying that talking about

180
00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,959
the streams and talking about what's

181
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:12,419
necessary for each stream even if that's

182
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:16,559
the idea does X and others things to Y

183
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:19,509
rather than integrating other ones

184
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:22,358
stating this simply in terms of what the

185
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:25,839
IETF the stream us but the IETF must

186
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:34,539
juice just feels wrong to me but I think

187
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:38,709
it's it was correct thank you yeah well

188
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:40,949
I think that that goes to after ad

189
00:11:38,709 --> 00:11:44,679
sponsorship John is saying he's got

190
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:50,889
suggested alternate text is how I read

191
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:54,539
his comment and but yeah alternate text

192
00:11:50,889 --> 00:12:04,329
it's it's an alternate approach but yes

193
00:11:54,539 --> 00:12:06,730
okay anything else so my read of what

194
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:09,819
was said was we're pushing to ad

195
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,779
sponsorship Elissa do you want more

196
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,779
guidance than that

197
00:12:13,749 --> 00:12:20,739
Elissa Cooper it would be useful to

198
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:24,639
understand these alternative things that

199
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:25,929
people have just spoken about so getting

200
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,689
a little bit of that feedback on the

201
00:12:25,929 --> 00:12:29,919
agenda specialist would be good and my

202
00:12:28,689 --> 00:12:33,849
other question is whether people think

203
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:36,519
there's any specific subsets of the

204
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:41,009
community that should become aware of

205
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,009
this before it goes to ITF last call

206
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,550
perhaps the other stream managers I mean

207
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:57,480
I can take care of that but just

208
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:57,479
thinking out loud just so they know I

209
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:04,600
I'm happy to take a task to do that as

210
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:07,510
Jen Dispatch chair but whatever you

211
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:14,430
think is appropriate there I can do that

212
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:14,430
Thank You Alyssa thanks Joel

213
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,379
is Martin here yet Martin are you here

214
00:13:25,169 --> 00:13:36,160
okay

215
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:42,729
oh then I'll do ostrich oink's switching

216
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:47,829
microphones so I'm speaking as the

217
00:13:42,729 --> 00:13:49,629
designated moderator of the discussion

218
00:13:47,829 --> 00:13:52,118
that we had we had a virtual meeting

219
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:56,169
about the eligibility discuss stuff and

220
00:13:52,119 --> 00:14:01,389
so I'm gonna give you the highlights so

221
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:04,720
next we're basically talking about two

222
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:08,859
events here draft Munusamy recall Rev

223
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,129
was published this is for those who may

224
00:14:08,859 --> 00:14:13,989
not have read about changing the

225
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:17,109
eligibility requirements to be on a

226
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:18,789
recall petition so not the recall

227
00:14:17,109 --> 00:14:20,799
committee not the NomCom but the recall

228
00:14:18,789 --> 00:14:25,809
petition the requests to recall an ad

229
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:28,329
and the idea was to provide some

230
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:30,549
enfranchisement for remote participants

231
00:14:28,329 --> 00:14:32,529
Moute that's the biggest change is that

232
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:36,728
remote participants would be able to

233
00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:38,559
sign a recall petition you know the

234
00:14:36,729 --> 00:14:40,059
other thing it does is it changes it

235
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:42,809
reduces the number of people on a

236
00:14:40,059 --> 00:14:46,569
petition in order to start a recall and

237
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:49,029
this is about equity for remote

238
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:51,248
participants more than anything else and

239
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,239
it's seen as a small step that could be

240
00:14:51,249 --> 00:14:56,919
done and rather than go and going into

241
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:59,379
the big thing immediately could lead to

242
00:14:56,919 --> 00:15:00,909
other changes so the eligibility discus

243
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,789
list was set up there was some

244
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:09,729
discussion about that and then ekor had

245
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:11,829
proposed the his document which was more

246
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:14,739
about addressing efficacy rather than

247
00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:16,929
equity which is to say the point of the

248
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:19,739
second document is look the recall

249
00:15:16,929 --> 00:15:22,449
process does not work in general and

250
00:15:19,739 --> 00:15:26,649
maybe the better way to approach this is

251
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:30,279
to have a new recall process in which

252
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:31,459
the members of the iesg IAB what have

253
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:33,920
you can

254
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:38,649
a petition within themselves to recall

255
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:46,009
each other I'm sorry

256
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:48,679
in place of and a comment from Barry yes

257
00:15:46,009 --> 00:15:51,639
clarifying the first the first document

258
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:56,300
also includes allowing

259
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:58,369
ISTAR people to sign on it yes that is

260
00:15:56,300 --> 00:16:00,618
correct that is different from what

261
00:15:58,369 --> 00:16:02,779
occurs proposing but right it's an echo

262
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:04,970
did you want to clarify yeah I mean I

263
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:06,649
think you know let's let's not get too

264
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,290
carried away and like that details I

265
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,480
make and I proposed first as me and my

266
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,529
st. John's um but yes sorry about that's

267
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,999
not good to carry with it here's our

268
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:15,379
what we did proposed but I don't think

269
00:16:13,999 --> 00:16:17,209
it actually did replace I think it

270
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:19,160
augmented I think we're just like I

271
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:21,109
think in our version we didn't you could

272
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,969
still do the ordinary hall procedure we

273
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,559
just think it's useless

274
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,809
okay I mean like obviously if the

275
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:28,029
community was like do whatever whatever

276
00:16:26,809 --> 00:16:30,529
we call but whatever we called it

277
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:33,139
expulsion and take away we call I

278
00:16:30,529 --> 00:16:37,670
wouldn't objected that so and but I

279
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:39,350
think one important point is that the

280
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,939
position of that document is that the

281
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:44,170
current procedure isn't working and so

282
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:50,089
let's try something that might work and

283
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:52,040
to say that the draft Munusamy

284
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:54,559
might be just moving around deckchairs

285
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,410
so we had this virtual meeting and next

286
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,929
slide so let me give you the high-level

287
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:04,398
takeaways that I had as chairing this

288
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:07,069
meeting first of all on the drafter

289
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:08,928
score LA one of the concerns that was

290
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:10,849
raised was that this introduces the

291
00:17:08,929 --> 00:17:12,770
possibility that it makes those bodies

292
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:15,708
self-selecting which was kind of the

293
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,209
point of making the NAM come in the

294
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:18,529
first place was to not have self

295
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,789
selecting bodies so maybe that was

296
00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:24,679
problematic there was a general idea and

297
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,890
did you want to interrupt mark or I can

298
00:17:24,679 --> 00:17:29,450
just put a question mark Nottingham um I

299
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,659
haven't been following this terribly

300
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,309
closely and I'm sorry for that

301
00:17:31,659 --> 00:17:36,620
you-you-you're I've heard it a couple of

302
00:17:34,309 --> 00:17:38,779
times that the current process isn't

303
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,309
working and I don't know what that means

304
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:42,799
because it hasn't been used in a long

305
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,510
time that was kind of the point

306
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,420
so in basically kicking people out it's

307
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,940
not good enough for

308
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:50,760
wouldn't know that it that it that even

309
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,920
the times that it has been attempted it

310
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:56,160
never gets far enough because it's too

311
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,580
difficult unmanageable that people

312
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,060
people at least the the proposal the

313
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,790
premise of the drafter score low was

314
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:07,500
that part of the reason it's not used is

315
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:09,629
because it can't be used not just

316
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,370
because we're happy with everybody who's

317
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,660
just not working there are values and

318
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:15,929
better than that I'd like to pull on

319
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:19,040
those easy yeah yeah yeah yeah I guess

320
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:21,060
the way I would phrase it is that

321
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,290
they're in a number of situations in

322
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,909
which people were like very dissatisfied

323
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,580
with certain area directors and they

324
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:29,040
opted to just wait for the Waveland come

325
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:30,389
said we're role and that that may be the

326
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,990
right outcome but then having a recall

327
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:35,100
processes in particular helped --fill um

328
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:37,020
sure but again there's values embedded

329
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,850
in that I mean the fact that a few

330
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,320
people in this community are unsatisfied

331
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:42,270
with certain things that happen is

332
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,409
utterly unsurprising to me and I'd be

333
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,080
concerned if we were in a state that

334
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:49,680
wasn't like that so I I what are you

335
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:52,020
optimizing for yes and and I I think and

336
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,820
this discussion was had was the open

337
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,590
question of whether that was

338
00:18:53,820 --> 00:19:00,179
representative of there was not enough

339
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:03,330
desire for a recall and therefore the

340
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,910
process worked or yes there really was

341
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:08,220
what we think was enough desire for

342
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,230
recall but the process wasn't manageable

343
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,700
and we have to figure that out but at

344
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:16,470
least the idea of the second draft was

345
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,880
on the premise that we're not getting

346
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:20,970
there because the process is too heavy

347
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,250
and here's an alternative that was that

348
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,770
was the premise whether or not it's true

349
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,910
yeah I I do kind of wonder spun do I

350
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,160
think maybe I'll just we'll hold off on

351
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,150
that because I do have I want to respond

352
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,900
to you but I think I'll just hold off we

353
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:35,490
can discuss it privately I may be wrong

354
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,500
but I think residues a little more I

355
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:42,150
think I think you might find pretty more

356
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:44,130
persuasive yeah yeah and Eckhart did you

357
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,980
want to say yeah I guess I'm not sure I

358
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,660
exactly agree with the second bullet you

359
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,650
have up there I think there were certain

360
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,480
people thought this was worth addressing

361
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,890
and some who did not I didn't remember

362
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,280
there being consensus call so I don't

363
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,750
think we well I and again my

364
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,340
interpretation listening there were

365
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,730
certainly people who did not think it

366
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,199
was worth

367
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:07,260
dressing my gut and and you know it can

368
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,930
be disagreed with was that the the

369
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,640
general tenor was that yes this was

370
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,170
something that was interesting to

371
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,070
address and that some people thought it

372
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,680
was not but the general movement was at

373
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,000
least from my take that direction I was

374
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,480
the one taking notes I was the one

375
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,240
listening for that you can always choose

376
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:33,120
to say I was wrong about that Lesley

377
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:35,360
then Patrick Patrick Patrick McManus I'm

378
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:39,780
I guess given the invitation to say

379
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:41,520
you're wrong about this I'll support the

380
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:44,790
year wrong here

381
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,400
and I think it was a hard call to to

382
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:49,680
summarize and that may actually be my

383
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,120
top level bit was that I didn't think

384
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,920
there was a lot of consensus I thought

385
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,840
there were you know around a dozen

386
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,340
different people and probably like eight

387
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:57,870
different schools of thought going on

388
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,429
and and that was difficult and there

389
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,530
certainly wasn't a lot of agreement

390
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:03,000
across wise the other important

391
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:05,040
discussion I think we had that I think

392
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,080
you know I would add your list of top

393
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,030
level takeaways is we had a discussion

394
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,470
about sort of the cultural impacts of

395
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:11,720
what recall means both to the

396
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:14,040
individuals and to the organization

397
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:17,220
which I thought was you know really

398
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,990
sensitive and well done and one of the

399
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:20,790
conclusions I kind of made was that as a

400
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:23,790
reason you see recall it's not happening

401
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,170
is because they have a high cost with

402
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:27,180
them along a number of different

403
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:29,940
dimensions and so the fact that it's not

404
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:33,170
being used might not mean it's a problem

405
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:37,230
it might actually mean it's a choice

406
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:39,270
fair enough at Wesley yeah I think

407
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,220
Leslie I don't think he had enterprises

408
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,360
I think that that I'm sort of following

409
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,260
on a bit from that part of the

410
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:49,649
challenges or maybe a better activity

411
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,240
would be to try to categorize in cases

412
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,100
where people have sort of there has been

413
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,250
some recall energy trying to categorize

414
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,810
what was the issue and how is it

415
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,030
resolved

416
00:21:57,810 --> 00:22:04,200
was it really a failure of the recall

417
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:05,879
process that we have or was was it that

418
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:09,840
was the only mechanism in order to try

419
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,090
to find redress for a perceived ill but

420
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,409
with that said I would say that whatever

421
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,500
we do going forward

422
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:20,040
think that a change to such a process

423
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:23,250
that allows ISTAR folks to be involved

424
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,010
in starting a recall isn't it's kind of

425
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,760
an important step and an independent of

426
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,920
the previous thought because sometimes

427
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:34,500
there are cases where it is folk within

428
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,170
the IV end or is G and/or IAO see you

429
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,970
who see the issues and they're not

430
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:43,830
visible to the community so they need to

431
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:46,800
be able to act right and and I want to

432
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:49,919
say from my perspective sort of

433
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:52,080
listening to the conversation and I

434
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:53,280
don't want to just to go back to Patrick

435
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,409
for a second I don't want to diminish

436
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,590
that point that I thought was really

437
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:01,200
important that just going through a

438
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:03,659
recall has certain impacts and certain

439
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,670
really negative impacts depending on the

440
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:11,520
purpose of the recall and and how it's

441
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:14,070
used all of those issues whether it's

442
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,280
successful whether it's useable whether

443
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:22,530
it has negative impacts could in fact be

444
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:27,180
separate from what the recall set up is

445
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:29,970
and what it looks like so if it if we

446
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:33,690
want a petition to allow people from

447
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:36,570
istar remote participants whatever it is

448
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:39,450
it may be okay to leave the rest of the

449
00:23:36,570 --> 00:23:41,070
status quo as is that it's still really

450
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,070
hard to get furred to get people the

451
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:48,270
gumption to get up and do that kind of

452
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:51,050
recall thing and it's why I sort of

453
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:54,270
separated out equity as an issue I

454
00:23:51,050 --> 00:23:57,180
didn't hear anyone say it's not a good

455
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,690
idea for it to involve remote

456
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:02,550
participants what I heard was it doesn't

457
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,780
necessarily improve things to make it

458
00:24:02,550 --> 00:24:09,570
easier to use so and and I know those

459
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:12,060
sound like weird well if it's not usable

460
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:15,060
why even bother going through it but the

461
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:17,429
idea being that equity might still be a

462
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:23,520
useful thing to have in the in the

463
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:27,240
process Phil yeah I did at one point go

464
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:30,090
through with lawyers working out

465
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:34,860
how to use the recall and the appeals

466
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:37,730
piece on a certain topic of great moment

467
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:40,229
at the time and the conclusion was that

468
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:43,140
basically the recoil mechanism is

469
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:46,650
unworkable because it takes longer than

470
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:49,170
the tenure of the office holder for

471
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:54,059
start it would probably blow up the

472
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:56,610
organization just trying and if you were

473
00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,600
going to do it I think that you would at

474
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:03,840
least want to have people attend ITF

475
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:07,020
meetings in person first to sort the

476
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,959
thing out directly and if you weren't

477
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:15,030
making that sort of input I just don't

478
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:17,340
see what the you know I I think the text

479
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,309
I think of all the things about the

480
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:21,959
virtual participation this is probably

481
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:25,620
the very last thing that I would want to

482
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:27,660
involve them in because I think that the

483
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:32,909
type you know there are certain people

484
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:36,090
who would use that capability there will

485
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,100
be the worst people for using it and I

486
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:39,959
think that goes to that last bullet item

487
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:42,689
about people expressed a lot of concern

488
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:45,360
about denial of service attacks by using

489
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:48,240
the recall mechanism I think the

490
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,459
response to that that was most salient

491
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:54,660
was remember that this is only the

492
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:56,550
petition so even and given the mechanism

493
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:59,280
that was described in the document which

494
00:25:56,550 --> 00:26:00,690
is you had to be registered remotely for

495
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:03,120
three out of the last five meetings it

496
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,750
would take you at least a year to be

497
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,159
able to get enough sockpuppets to start

498
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,980
just the petition which could then be

499
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:12,600
dismissed by a recall committee so but

500
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,320
yes it was definitely a concern that was

501
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,678
raised elisa then Ted and then John will

502
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,110
be after that ELISA Cooper so on the

503
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:25,440
call I'm just speaking as an individual

504
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:30,559
with a particular perspective on the

505
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:32,910
call it was musing a little bit about

506
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,309
the extent to which there's some like

507
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:37,290
shame involved in this process and how

508
00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,750
some people who are you know in a

509
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:40,290
position where they are not performing

510
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,500
the role

511
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:45,629
that they signed up for can be in

512
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:50,280
jeopardy of feeling this kind of shame

513
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:52,080
and you know how how does the recall

514
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,450
process or refinements to it like

515
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,520
potentially exacerbate that and I've

516
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,930
been thinking since in the time since

517
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,220
then about like why why my brain led me

518
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:04,140
in that direction in the first place and

519
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,090
I think you know a big reason for that

520
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,070
is because in the last year and

521
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:11,280
especially in the last several months

522
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:12,720
the ia and myself in particular have

523
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:16,590
been working a lot and thinking a lot

524
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,200
about conduct in the IETF and

525
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:24,720
encouraging a more positive and friendly

526
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:28,080
atmosphere and I feel like that is a

527
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,060
very pressing need that you know that

528
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,540
attention and that work is very pressing

529
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:38,750
in the community and it would be great

530
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:42,180
to to take some of the energy that's

531
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:44,880
involved here in this and and directed

532
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,130
at that these might not necessarily be

533
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,430
at cross-purposes but you know thinking

534
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:51,690
through ways that we can support people

535
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:54,930
who are in leadership positions who may

536
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,030
be falling down or you know ways that

537
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,950
that people can sort of gracefully move

538
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:00,600
out of out of the process as opposed to

539
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,490
this which is quite public and

540
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:05,280
adversarial and and all of these things

541
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:07,890
I feel like work in that direction would

542
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,360
be more aligned with the overall sense

543
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,160
that at least the is she has heard from

544
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,080
the community that we want to be

545
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:15,420
building you know a more kind of

546
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:19,020
compassionate place that that is more

547
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,790
welcoming to people so it's just like a

548
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,950
little bit of a tension that I see in

549
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:25,139
that like if people are you know want to

550
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,180
do something like can we put it into a

551
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,370
more positive direction as opposed to

552
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,260
this which by which by its nature is

553
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:34,350
kind of a pretty negative and divisive

554
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,000
direction and one of the things and I

555
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,850
think it's a good point one of the

556
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,160
things that I think I saw it was mostly

557
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:43,740
in the jabber chat but I think it was

558
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:49,260
brought up was that I think what people

559
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:50,940
have in mind by the kinds of recalls

560
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,879
that were involved were not simply

561
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,710
people who were failing to do

562
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,480
who are unable to do work or falling

563
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,460
down in the job as you described it but

564
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,630
people who are doing some sort of active

565
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:06,840
harm the people who were being abusive

566
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,400
or and these I think are incidents that

567
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,459
have not been recent I think these are

568
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:12,870
older incidents but I think that's the

569
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:15,510
kind of thing that people had in mind

570
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:17,639
when they said well look you know the

571
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:19,860
having to come up with 20 signatures and

572
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,530
do all of this and not being able to get

573
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:25,139
input from ISTAR not being able to get

574
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:27,928
input from remote participants was very

575
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:31,970
much about active malevolence rather

576
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:34,980
than just inability to do the job for

577
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:38,400
whatever that's worth

578
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,289
Ted and then John and then we have a

579
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:42,030
jabber intro oh yeah feel free to

580
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:44,940
interrupt with the jabber input they're

581
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,980
very brief it's Michael to him who says

582
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:49,559
he's a virtual participant here he was

583
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,750
sick he got the flu couldn't fly to

584
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:55,530
Singapore and is very grateful for the

585
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:59,940
ability to participate virtually Thank

586
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:01,110
You Ted Ted Hardy speaking I I wanted to

587
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,280
return to the question of how you would

588
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:08,668
dispatch this thank you and I think it's

589
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,158
very clear from the conversation up to

590
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:14,010
now that ad sponsorship pretty much

591
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:17,340
offers a pool but the level of consensus

592
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:20,940
that seems to be emerging does not seem

593
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:24,120
to support an immediate rush to a

594
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:29,270
particular solution here and I believe

595
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:31,350
that leaves us with a ball for

596
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,429
dispatching to an existing working group

597
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:36,000
and I don't think there is such an

598
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:38,039
existing and as I was thinking about the

599
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,190
potential of what such a birds of a

600
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:43,408
feather session would look like Phil got

601
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:45,270
up and and talked about remote

602
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:47,700
participation and I tend to agree with

603
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:50,190
one of his comments which is if we're

604
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,280
going to have a buff about equity for

605
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:57,020
remote participation starting with the

606
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:59,879
positive aspects like serving a noncom

607
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:04,530
might be a more productive place to

608
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:07,770
start than this but what I was going to

609
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:11,010
suggest is if we do

610
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,049
want to move forward with this and did

611
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:15,240
hold such above one of the primary

612
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:18,210
purposes of that Boff would probably be

613
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:25,820
to figure out how to scope the equity

614
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:33,390
question in a way that supports the

615
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:36,840
remote participants rather than focusing

616
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:40,380
very narrowly on this so I would prefer

617
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,678
to see up off but AB off more broadly

618
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:48,390
scoped in the ways that Phil and

619
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,179
Alyssa's comments hinted might be better

620
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:53,190
for the organization in the long term

621
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:55,110
yeah and and I think this goes to that

622
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,450
question in the third bullet and I think

623
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:00,418
there was quite a bit and and what I

624
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:03,360
heard was that was the real point of

625
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:05,279
contention was start small about remote

626
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:11,570
participation in this particular way or

627
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:17,100
go broader so yeah thank you John sorry

628
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:22,320
almost missed you thanks for almost

629
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:24,080
missing me three things quickly the the

630
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,939
other thing which came up on the call

631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,820
relative this fear about Gauss attacks

632
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,580
is that once upon a time what it took to

633
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,899
initiate a recall was from for anyone

634
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:38,309
any single person without any

635
00:32:35,899 --> 00:32:43,199
qualifications or any previous anything

636
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:45,990
ah to to simply notify the the eyesight

637
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,320
president and CEO and and that was the

638
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,059
equivalent of the petition process

639
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,928
unless somebody's prepared or the ATM

640
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:57,870
has become much more evil and much of

641
00:32:54,929 --> 00:33:00,870
that as many more destructive trolls

642
00:32:57,870 --> 00:33:02,820
over time that we had back then the

643
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:06,270
statistical experience is the dissent

644
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,610
just didn't happen so perhaps again I'm

645
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:11,970
Bynum paraphrase over set of the call

646
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:14,580
that that can start his world over bro

647
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:20,070
overboard and that's one of these is not

648
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,909
in your summary two other things one is

649
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:22,470
what which

650
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:28,440
is the one I agreed about supporting

651
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:33,480
people better somebody who is trying to

652
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:37,020
initiate this would be nuts not to try

653
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:38,790
it formal supporting mechanisms first if

654
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:44,100
only because of how long and painful

655
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:46,950
this process is and again this goes back

656
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,669
to what the IEM has become a preacher or

657
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:52,830
evil over the years rather than getting

658
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:55,620
gradually better which I think we

659
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:58,020
certainly are and finally with the grant

660
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,800
the bluff question I'd remind people

661
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:04,560
that when this draft was first posted

662
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,540
the discussion was about a ball and then

663
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:09,029
it was discussing about a virtual boffin

664
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:10,800
doing the virtual Barsoom and four

665
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:15,810
wonders another that dragged out for a

666
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:19,260
very long time and and finally turned

667
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:22,020
into this virtual meeting which is

668
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,760
crying except they were now going back

669
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,520
to saying you need a BA Fellini debuff

670
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,590
in Vancouver well that's the intentional

671
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:30,509
or not the effect is just keep dragging

672
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:33,210
this out and dragging this out and

673
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:38,159
dragging this out and finally with guard

674
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:40,560
the scoping question one thing we should

675
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,280
probably decide however we said they

676
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,399
handle this

677
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,919
and maybe another verse a virtual Bluff

678
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,569
is the right way to do it is whether the

679
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,969
question about complete performance with

680
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:52,320
recall procedure are part of that scope

681
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:54,859
or not but are part of some others

682
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,740
called thank you

683
00:34:54,860 --> 00:35:00,210
thanks Jenna hi my name is Mike coy I

684
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:03,209
just wanted to amplify one of John's

685
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:05,670
points we have to let the mic a little

686
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,440
more very good thank you I just wanted

687
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:10,080
to employ one of John's points to point

688
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,060
out that as he mentions large numbers of

689
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:14,340
bad actors are relatively easy to come

690
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,430
by these days but I think it's worth

691
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:20,910
noting that the cost of participating in

692
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:23,819
this event remotely is zero dollars and

693
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:26,670
so there is effectively no impediment to

694
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,680
breguet ting this process at the moment

695
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,120
if we choose to do that differently then

696
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,580
there are ways to avoid that but at the

697
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,720
moment I believe we should consider that

698
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:42,090
as a viable part of the

699
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:45,669
model Barry this is Barry liebe I

700
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:48,900
started off well I I do agree with Ted

701
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:51,340
that addressing the broader issue of

702
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,660
non-common eligibility and other things

703
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:58,330
to enfranchise remote participants is is

704
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,819
more important than addressing this

705
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:03,580
small piece but I have been convinced

706
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:07,750
that it is worth addressing this small

707
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:11,560
piece as a way to get there I think the

708
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:15,580
irony of having a boffin Vancouver that

709
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:18,040
is for remote participants kind of goes

710
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:20,259
without saying and I think we're at a

711
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:23,890
point where we could charter a working

712
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:27,580
group directly without worst another

713
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:30,069
virtual meeting to discuss it we have a

714
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,170
mailing list and we should use that to

715
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:35,260
start hammering out a charter I agree

716
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:37,270
that this is way beyond ad sponsorship

717
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:39,460
and a working group is necessary but I

718
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,740
think the next step should be a working

719
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,660
group not above at this point and and

720
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,629
partly for what John's saying that it's

721
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:50,348
already been pushed out farther and

722
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:54,550
farther so the scoping should be done in

723
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:56,290
a working group Charter Accra yeah well

724
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:57,580
I mean obviously anybody can Bruce a

725
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,259
charter and flooded but the reason this

726
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,680
is getting pushed out is not actually

727
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,390
consistent to do it and so hence like

728
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,069
the discussion continues because there's

729
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,259
discussion but because it like it's not

730
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,790
like universal support for it so you

731
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,200
know why not to feel free to float the

732
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,910
Charter and then we can I guess we can

733
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,740
the last call on the ITF list but like

734
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:22,810
you know that's not gonna change the

735
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:26,080
fundamental level of support Stephen so

736
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:29,349
at the risk of another current I star

737
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:32,529
member saying don't just focus on Rico I

738
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:33,490
think to me it makes much more sense if

739
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,650
there's gonna be a working group or a

740
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:40,180
virtual buffle whatever for that to have

741
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,070
broader scope on the equity issue I I

742
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:44,348
agree with Alyssa about that you know

743
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,800
expanding energy on making it better for

744
00:37:44,349 --> 00:37:47,900
people who mostly participate remotely

745
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,170
see

746
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:55,430
much more worthwhile to me sure as part

747
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:57,619
of that address recalls but I'm not

748
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:04,788
convinced Asbury is that the recall the

749
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:06,470
starting point is the best place one of

750
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:10,150
the things that came up during the

751
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:14,419
virtual meeting that I want to reiterate

752
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:16,430
I asked the question whether folks

753
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,859
thought this would doing this would

754
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:20,058
cause active damage rather than they

755
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:21,348
didn't want to do it

756
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:26,599
there was some indication that people

757
00:38:21,349 --> 00:38:29,240
thought it would and you know I wanted I

758
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,069
would want to hear that fleshed out one

759
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,979
of the things that I think is important

760
00:38:31,069 --> 00:38:36,020
is people saying we don't want to do

761
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:37,640
this is not sufficient to say there is

762
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,980
not consensus to do it

763
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:43,970
people need to be saying there is going

764
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:47,720
to be damage by doing this and and if

765
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,450
the work can be done and people think

766
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,669
that it is worth doing without some

767
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:57,379
counter reason if there is a sufficient

768
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:02,029
constituency it should go forward that

769
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:04,069
that that's just your opinion man as in

770
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:06,470
know as in your says it I appreciate

771
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,329
that is like the the top of a document

772
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:11,598
you wrote but that document is do not

773
00:39:08,329 --> 00:39:12,890
itself have like any normative force so

774
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,730
there's no consensus of an

775
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,558
interpretation of consensus I understand

776
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:22,099
what you're saying but there is no

777
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:24,680
support in 2026 for in order to charter

778
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:26,630
a working group there needs to be no

779
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:28,009
objection to it that's a different

780
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:29,470
statement for that's a different

781
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:32,470
statement from the one you just met I

782
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,470
understand

783
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:41,210
Ted Ted Hardy for what it's worth I also

784
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:43,220
agree that the way you stated that just

785
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:45,410
a moment ago was problematic for any

786
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:48,230
process document we're not looking at

787
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:51,288
something where the the harm being

788
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:53,660
described is is something where we can

789
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:55,549
you know point to packets on the wire or

790
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:58,759
some or similar what we're talking about

791
00:39:55,549 --> 00:40:01,370
here is equity and determining the

792
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,130
equity balance among

793
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:06,589
individuals between the potential harm

794
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:08,660
to them of going through a recall

795
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:12,740
process or the potential lack of equity

796
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:16,250
or being unable to respond to situations

797
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:18,229
which require recall is not something

798
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,690
that's going to be easy to point to in

799
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:22,670
the way that we can say your congestion

800
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:26,630
control is going to damage the Internet

801
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:28,190
especially for us let's be frank other

802
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:31,010
people might be able to do a better job

803
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:34,700
of making that balance of equity than

804
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:36,770
this particular community but I got up

805
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:40,819
to say something else and that is quite

806
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:44,600
simply I think the harm here is that if

807
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:47,450
you start the discussion of equity here

808
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:52,009
it starts with a negative bias because

809
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:54,500
it's around the question of who gets the

810
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:56,960
right to accuse not decide the results

811
00:40:54,500 --> 00:41:00,440
of the accusation but who gets the right

812
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,650
to accuse rather than around the

813
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:07,460
question of how do we empower people to

814
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:10,430
participate and I believe the Hartman's

815
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,040
starting from that rather than how do we

816
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:15,830
empower people to participate is the

817
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,620
results will be narrow and unhelpful to

818
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:22,910
the larger question and they may harm

819
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:27,049
that larger question depending on the

820
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:30,109
result so if you're looking for somebody

821
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:33,380
to stand at the microphone and say this

822
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:36,860
scope is wrong you need up off to get a

823
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:40,310
better scope Here I am I appreciate it

824
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:42,740
and I believe that's what I've been

825
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:47,860
hearing I'm gonna cut the line here

826
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:50,689
because we are a bit yeah Cullen Jenks

827
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,820
the that I would just like to highlight

828
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,440
that the one of the concerns that comes

829
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,090
up on this it has been you know

830
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:58,040
effectiveness Hawk Parker those types of

831
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,290
things and we have seen that really

832
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,850
happen there was cases in WebRTC where

833
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:05,060
there was very clear evidence that

834
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:07,660
remote participants in a disingenuous

835
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:10,549
and fake people and fake things

836
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:12,410
manipulate the consensus process so I I

837
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:14,090
think that that's one of the things that

838
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,690
people want want to see something like

839
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,260
now

840
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:16,550
that's sad

841
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,470
I don't care about the recall process

842
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:20,000
something works but I would love to see

843
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,770
us having a better definition of

844
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,020
membership in this organization than our

845
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:27,710
current Nam Kham edible definition it's

846
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:30,080
awful right so I would be happy to see

847
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:33,109
us work on that for a more general set

848
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:35,359
of purposes than just this stuff um but

849
00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:37,700
the difficulty is is we're not hearing

850
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:39,859
concrete proposals for what it would be

851
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,839
that are gathering a lot of consensus

852
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:43,910
right that's the problem it's not that

853
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:46,520
it's not that people don't wish we had

854
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:49,850
one it's that the proposals look like

855
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,400
they have very a lot of problems um and

856
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:53,990
this term equity is this is just a

857
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:57,950
slight little slide yet I can't put my

858
00:42:53,990 --> 00:43:00,709
finger on why the term equity to refer

859
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:02,390
to the disenfranchised ation of the

860
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,040
remote people really grates me in the

861
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:05,779
same way that third-world countries

862
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:09,380
great to me but it does great me I wish

863
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:11,600
we had a better term interesting um

864
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:15,470
actually let me ask a question before

865
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:18,350
you disappear so the first part of what

866
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:20,990
you said do I understand you to say you

867
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:25,880
think that some sort of buff some sort

868
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:29,779
of consensus building in order to figure

869
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,670
out what needs to be done to get better

870
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:33,950
participation enfranchisement pick your

871
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:36,050
other term other than equity is what we

872
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,419
need to do next I think it would be

873
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:40,250
great to have a betterment of definition

874
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,660
of what it means to be a member of this

875
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,330
can have you become a member of this

876
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,460
community than writing a certain size

877
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:49,069
check three times set if off right that

878
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:51,320
that seems like an insane definition but

879
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:53,150
I can't think of a better one right then

880
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,980
and so you know coming up with one

881
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:57,050
that's good and look we don't generally

882
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:58,670
have bossun technical objects things

883
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,530
unless somebody has some proposals that

884
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:02,180
look like they probably work right like

885
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,890
if somebody says I'd like AB off on

886
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,270
perpetual motion machines we'll probably

887
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:06,859
be like well you know when you bring us

888
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,500
a viable proposal we'll discuss it but

889
00:44:06,859 --> 00:44:10,910
not before so yeah I'd be glad to see

890
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:12,650
something like that happen and I would

891
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:16,009
encourage it to be for the broader thing

892
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:17,570
than just the narrow recall because I

893
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,770
view the recall is not terribly

894
00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,400
important but I have no objection of

895
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:24,800
being these recalled right thanks Mike

896
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,480
Hagen here okay so for what it's worth I

897
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,100
think that what we're actually talking

898
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,670
about here is the accessibility of the

899
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:31,160
organization

900
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,769
right the ability to reduce barriers to

901
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:36,799
participation and the ability of new

902
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:38,299
people to become involved in the ITF I

903
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:40,490
think that that is a noble goal

904
00:44:38,299 --> 00:44:42,440
particularly for remote people remote

905
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,660
participants of all stripes but I do

906
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,849
think that that is a different

907
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,288
conversation or it's a broader

908
00:44:46,849 --> 00:44:50,200
conversation but more importantly I

909
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:53,510
think that starting that conversation

910
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,649
experimentally is important finding new

911
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:55,910
ways to make new parts of the

912
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,010
organization more accessible is a

913
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,319
valuable goal I think that's starting

914
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:02,720
that process with what amounts to a

915
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:04,519
discipline starting it in what amounts

916
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,379
to a disciplinary part of the

917
00:45:04,519 --> 00:45:09,890
organization or a disciplinary process

918
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:11,539
is a much riskier way to with much more

919
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:14,390
potential negative side-effects which

920
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:16,490
whose consequences will include if it

921
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:20,598
goes badly on unwillingness to explore

922
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:22,910
that further as an org then you would if

923
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:25,849
you had exploring virtually on any other

924
00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:29,210
part of the ITF process so this is I

925
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:31,910
mean this is a noble goal to get to but

926
00:45:29,210 --> 00:45:33,529
in order to drive accessibility and to

927
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:36,769
drive participation in the organization

928
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:38,900
there are much safer and much more sort

929
00:45:36,769 --> 00:45:41,750
of net positive ways of driving that

930
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,240
inclusivity than this or any

931
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:47,950
disciplinary or administrative recall

932
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:52,308
process Patrick you get the last word

933
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:55,009
Thanks so I want to address the concept

934
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:56,869
of active harm because you asked about

935
00:45:55,009 --> 00:45:58,220
it and so I think gather anything about

936
00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:01,190
this in two different ways with with

937
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:02,209
this proposal one is the cultural side

938
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:05,839
effects that we've been talking about

939
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:07,519
and I won't continue to to identify

940
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,210
those but I think that's a big issue I

941
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,578
think is also a tactical side when I

942
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:15,950
talk with people about you know

943
00:46:13,579 --> 00:46:17,599
malfeasance that they they believe would

944
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:19,808
you know make someone eligible for the

945
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
recall process if you will instead of

946
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:24,890
eligible assign for the recall process

947
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,339
there is a lot of disagreement amongst

948
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:29,960
what really qualifies there and this

949
00:46:28,339 --> 00:46:31,099
came through makalah as well and for

950
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,930
some people this is you know

951
00:46:31,099 --> 00:46:34,460
misrepresenting the organization or

952
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:38,419
something near very very high like that

953
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:39,529
and for some other people it's a really

954
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,250
disagreement with how they're doing

955
00:46:39,529 --> 00:46:42,060
their jobs

956
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:44,220
you know sometimes actually

957
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:46,740
come is actually looking to create that

958
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,779
dynamic and it seems a little strange to

959
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:51,180
you know within the organization itself

960
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,980
to balance concerns right and so there

961
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:54,149
will be disagreements about how people

962
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:56,280
choose to do their jobs and there's a

963
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:59,550
lot of discretion given to ISTAR but how

964
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:01,440
individuals will go about those jobs and

965
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,960
that is something we are selecting them

966
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:06,780
for for both good and for bad and to put

967
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,850
a lot of emphasis on you know recall as

968
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:10,890
it intersects with disagreements about

969
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:13,049
how that happens I think is perhaps a

970
00:47:10,890 --> 00:47:16,020
tactical mistake for us to do at this

971
00:47:13,050 --> 00:47:18,900
point from a very just dispatch equine

972
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:22,020
kind of question with respect to you

973
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:23,370
know these these to recall proposals you

974
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:26,190
know I I think these should probably

975
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:28,339
stop here but we might you know still

976
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:34,170
one honor take the larger question of

977
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:38,100
remote eligibility and I think that last

978
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:39,600
bit is exactly what I was thinking that

979
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:42,540
the recommendation of this room is

980
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,339
sounding like it's leaning toward if

981
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,850
you're gonna take on something like this

982
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:48,780
take on the question of remote

983
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:51,000
participation

984
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,220
maybe membership although that word has

985
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:56,040
all sorts of implications but but

986
00:47:53,220 --> 00:48:00,330
enfranchisement what have you and Bob

987
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:05,009
that and maybe to be less ironic

988
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:06,420
virtually Buffett but that's so far what

989
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:09,240
I'm hearing is the recommendation of the

990
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:15,660
room does anybody want to disagree with

991
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:20,009
that comes up all right I see thumbs up

992
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:25,500
in a couple of places all right Martin I

993
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:27,990
believe you are next victim John real

994
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:30,780
quick Oh John did you want to make a

995
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:35,850
comment yeah I just want to do Express

996
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:37,350
this agreement I I think this gets back

997
00:48:35,850 --> 00:48:41,580
to some things before setting the call

998
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:44,100
about how to parse this out and and

999
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:45,840
there is whether you call it an equity

1000
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,950
issue or something else I'd rather call

1001
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:54,000
it something else there is a a real

1002
00:48:49,950 --> 00:48:55,290
issue with remote participants being

1003
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:58,320
protect them cell

1004
00:48:55,290 --> 00:49:00,960
against harmful behavior that is

1005
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:04,590
differentially applied to remote

1006
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,590
participants and that's a significant

1007
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:10,140
issue regardless of how often we predict

1008
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:11,910
it will come up or not come up and that

1009
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:13,200
was the motivation for trying to do this

1010
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:15,149
as a first step

1011
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:25,830
so just to record the disagreement

1012
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:29,880
thanks thanks Joe have a draft it's a

1013
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:31,500
bit of a trial balloon simply because

1014
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:38,310
it's a little smaller than the last

1015
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:39,990
topic and this this is I think an

1016
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:45,240
important question for this process to

1017
00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:47,640
address which is look at that so this is

1018
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:51,509
the proposal it's about one page

1019
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:54,440
it essentially proposes updating BCP 9

1020
00:49:51,510 --> 00:49:57,750
which is you know the the

1021
00:49:54,440 --> 00:50:00,110
all-encompassing process that governs

1022
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:03,150
pretty much everything that we do here

1023
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:08,490
with a very small change essentially

1024
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:11,940
just removes the paragraph because this

1025
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:19,259
notion that drafts expire I think

1026
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:20,160
expired a long time ago itself but I

1027
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,590
think that there's a bigger question

1028
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:27,810
here which is that how how do we run

1029
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:29,640
small things like this I don't know the

1030
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,060
answer to that we talked about having

1031
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:35,190
buffs but how would you make a change

1032
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,210
like this this is almost a nonsensical

1033
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:41,010
change and I would like to discuss it in

1034
00:50:39,210 --> 00:50:42,420
the time that we have available but I'm

1035
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:45,660
more interested in discussing this

1036
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:48,750
question right here who publishes this

1037
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:52,290
document what is the constituency for a

1038
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:56,270
document like this how do we decide what

1039
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,270
consensus is for something like this

1040
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:05,040
[Music]

1041
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:08,280
mostly so you posited that it's a small

1042
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:09,119
change so your question about how do we

1043
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,029
make the changes

1044
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,220
you think it's a small change I think

1045
00:51:12,029 --> 00:51:15,539
it's a small change

1046
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:19,230
would you like to contest that point

1047
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:21,749
well I do actually but but I think

1048
00:51:19,230 --> 00:51:23,069
that's kind of the point that they had

1049
00:51:21,749 --> 00:51:25,019
to answer this question I think the

1050
00:51:23,069 --> 00:51:30,240
first order of business is to make sure

1051
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:32,609
that there is a broader support for the

1052
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,499
notion of scope of change I mean in

1053
00:51:32,609 --> 00:51:36,598
general I greet I think the expiration

1054
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:38,038
date probably makes little sense but I

1055
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:39,210
do think that it makes sense in the

1056
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:42,690
context of understanding whether

1057
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:46,230
something is current or not right but

1058
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:48,240
that's a whether it's so it it is a

1059
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,650
small change it leads to a larger

1060
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:53,519
discussion of water all the ways in

1061
00:51:49,650 --> 00:51:54,749
which we use this tiny little detail we

1062
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:56,308
started having some of that discussion

1063
00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:57,689
on the list I think that that started

1064
00:51:56,309 --> 00:52:00,749
going somewhere fairly constructive

1065
00:51:57,690 --> 00:52:02,970
right so but to back out of having the

1066
00:52:00,749 --> 00:52:06,839
constructive discussion right and focus

1067
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:08,129
on your question here I think the part

1068
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:09,990
of the answer to the question not

1069
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:11,849
eyetality the answer to the question is

1070
00:52:09,990 --> 00:52:13,890
you have to have a public discussion

1071
00:52:11,849 --> 00:52:15,660
whether it's on a mailing list even de

1072
00:52:13,890 --> 00:52:17,759
kated whether it's other gen dispatch

1073
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:20,489
can launch these things or whatever

1074
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:23,670
right but whatever whatever the process

1075
00:52:20,489 --> 00:52:26,400
is there has to be general agreement

1076
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:28,739
about the size of change is being

1077
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:32,489
undertaken before you have an answer to

1078
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:34,769
the whole question I think it was that

1079
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:37,650
connect stand right then Adam then Ted

1080
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:41,249
I'm sober physically I have an answer to

1081
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,930
your question I think which is we should

1082
00:52:41,249 --> 00:52:44,220
form a working group which would how

1083
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,808
people can present small things like

1084
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:50,419
this and then the working group it's

1085
00:52:45,809 --> 00:52:52,920
just that the ad sponsor them and and so

1086
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:54,660
fortunately I have a time machine I went

1087
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:56,430
back and did that in response to reading

1088
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:59,460
this deck and so how does working group

1089
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:00,419
you were here and on so if people in

1090
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,099
this room are generally positive about

1091
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:03,960
it then the ad should sponsor it I am

1092
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:06,440
positive about it and I think baby

1093
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:06,440
should sponsor

1094
00:53:10,349 --> 00:53:14,459
Ted Hardy and if acre has a time machine

1095
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:20,339
I'd like to borrow it and fix some other

1096
00:53:14,459 --> 00:53:24,538
things quantum leap project in five four

1097
00:53:20,339 --> 00:53:28,380
three two one I wanted to make a point

1098
00:53:24,539 --> 00:53:32,279
here that other streams use the internet

1099
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:35,759
draft series and in particular the ISC

1100
00:53:32,279 --> 00:53:39,719
and the IRT F both use it and may have

1101
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:43,499
different opinions on what this means so

1102
00:53:39,719 --> 00:53:45,809
I would suggest first that you make a

1103
00:53:43,499 --> 00:53:48,718
meta discussion of whether this has to

1104
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:50,519
apply to all streams or not if it

1105
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:53,759
doesn't have to apply to all streams and

1106
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:56,939
I don't see a reason why it would then

1107
00:53:53,759 --> 00:54:00,419
you can make the decision for what the

1108
00:53:56,939 --> 00:54:02,428
expiration time should be on a

1109
00:54:00,419 --> 00:54:04,410
particular stream by a statement from

1110
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:06,299
the people who control that stream so

1111
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:10,979
the ITF can say what the IETF is gonna

1112
00:54:06,299 --> 00:54:12,779
do and that's fine and the leadership so

1113
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:15,239
this that works this is specifically an

1114
00:54:12,779 --> 00:54:18,269
ITF proposal okay and so if if the

1115
00:54:15,239 --> 00:54:21,419
proposal is only for internet drafts

1116
00:54:18,269 --> 00:54:23,008
which are part of the ITF stream now you

1117
00:54:21,419 --> 00:54:25,429
have to be able to identify which

1118
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:28,890
internet drafts are for which stream

1119
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:32,429
this is not necessarily clear from all

1120
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:34,799
such drafts to begin with but we we can

1121
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:37,979
work that but I think at this point it

1122
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:39,869
becomes a question for the stream

1123
00:54:37,979 --> 00:54:42,149
managers of that stream and their

1124
00:54:39,869 --> 00:54:45,419
community to decide so it doesn't need

1125
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:47,519
to be something that the IAB or that the

1126
00:54:45,419 --> 00:54:51,598
other streams have to deal with because

1127
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:53,399
their own documents and the series that

1128
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:56,249
emerges from internet drafts are

1129
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:58,439
unaffected so to get to your point at

1130
00:54:56,249 --> 00:55:01,169
that at that point I think that means

1131
00:54:58,439 --> 00:55:03,959
that the dispatch of this handily is

1132
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:05,879
limited to all of the things which it

1133
00:55:03,959 --> 00:55:08,549
can dispatch to directly because they're

1134
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:10,109
all within the IETF it can be ad

1135
00:55:08,549 --> 00:55:11,849
sponsorship or a working group within

1136
00:55:10,109 --> 00:55:14,848
the ITF you don't Han have to hand it to

1137
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:18,269
a different body um just to put myself

1138
00:55:14,849 --> 00:55:20,400
in momentarily your dutiful working

1139
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:23,470
group chairs here actually did a quick

1140
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:27,099
review because we saw this on the agenda

1141
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:29,919
and there's more in 20 26 and 24 18 than

1142
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:34,410
you probably think needs to be fixed to

1143
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:37,030
accomplish this task and at first glance

1144
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:41,920
there's a several sections where it

1145
00:55:37,030 --> 00:55:45,160
appears so just to put that out there

1146
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:49,599
that it's at least interesting maybe not

1147
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:51,220
as hard as it might be but yeah I'm not

1148
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,170
I'm not looking to apply a patch to

1149
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:55,209
those documents I'm looking to say that

1150
00:55:53,170 --> 00:55:57,940
the expiration is removed rather than

1151
00:55:55,210 --> 00:56:00,280
the patch I think that that's what we're

1152
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:01,510
talking about I completely missed 2026

1153
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,910
when I looked at it because I look for

1154
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:06,490
all of the wrong search terms when I

1155
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:09,399
first went so you would say that they

1156
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:13,348
still expire but the expiration is

1157
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:13,349
removed from the header of the draft

1158
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,060
number wise you can come

1159
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:20,950
steph/andrea on the substance of the

1160
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:26,470
draft rather on the procedures how to

1161
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:34,410
implement it or not I've recently set in

1162
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:34,410
deposition in a patent case where the

1163
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:45,339
plaintiff you know with a straight face

1164
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:47,259
made the argument that internet expired

1165
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:51,190
internet drafts cannot be used as

1166
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:55,300
priority arguments and I'm not joking

1167
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:59,380
I'm really not joking yeah keep keep

1168
00:56:55,300 --> 00:57:03,310
that in mind this is and from from that

1169
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:05,710
viewpoint which is a business viewpoint

1170
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:10,299
agreed but from that viewpoint it's a

1171
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:14,349
very good idea thank you David's can now

1172
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:16,540
see Google allow me to start by saying

1173
00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:20,140
your choice of fonts is bad and you

1174
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:26,759
should feel bad what about the colors

1175
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:31,560
the more seriously I support this change

1176
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:34,570
for two reasons the the first one is yes

1177
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:36,480
for the reasons you cited trash rooms

1178
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:37,920
expire and there

1179
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,820
we keep finding more reasons why this is

1180
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:47,130
good and the other one is for the meta

1181
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:49,109
discussion of if we have some process

1182
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:52,800
questions in the ITF that we don't

1183
00:57:49,109 --> 00:57:56,369
really know how to fix I think this one

1184
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,010
is small and simple enough that it's a

1185
00:57:56,369 --> 00:58:01,650
good way to prototype how do we go about

1186
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:03,390
fixing such things and that's a good

1187
00:58:01,650 --> 00:58:07,350
thing to do regardless of what the topic

1188
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:09,720
is so just to note for everybody there

1189
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:13,470
are six people in the queue and four

1190
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,689
minutes left so focusing on the

1191
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:17,520
dispatching question would probably be

1192
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:19,820
most helpful but we will go over a

1193
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,290
little if need be

1194
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:26,460
ELISA Cooper this is not gonna help you

1195
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:28,830
with that sorry so I just wanted to

1196
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:31,410
raise a few related ideas that have come

1197
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:35,640
up in conversations about this in the

1198
00:58:31,410 --> 00:58:37,710
last several years so you know people

1199
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:39,180
mentioned concern about the liveness of

1200
00:58:37,710 --> 00:58:42,420
the draft and this being an indication

1201
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:44,759
of it being alive or or dead or current

1202
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,109
or whatever it turns out that there's

1203
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:48,690
ways to indicate that that aren't

1204
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:50,880
related to a date like saying current or

1205
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:52,200
active or dead which you can actually

1206
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,510
mark in the data tracker but not in the

1207
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,970
draft themselves so there might be other

1208
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:59,760
bits of metadata that are actually like

1209
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:01,919
more semantically expressive than than

1210
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:05,700
the expiration date and achieve some of

1211
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:07,380
the same and there's also been

1212
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:09,569
conversation about the fact that the

1213
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,869
expiration date is felt by some to be a

1214
00:59:09,570 --> 00:59:16,230
forcing function to to renew the draft

1215
00:59:12,869 --> 00:59:18,780
and one might consider either for the

1216
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:20,400
kind of active versus versus dead

1217
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:22,859
question or for the forcing function

1218
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:25,230
that if authors find that helpful then

1219
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:28,500
it can be up to them whether this

1220
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:30,450
appears or not in their own drafts so it

1221
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,359
need not be uniform for all drafts in

1222
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:36,750
their repository about this question

1223
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:38,430
here I do think that any of the normal

1224
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:39,990
options would work I don't think we need

1225
00:59:38,430 --> 00:59:42,419
some special process other than either

1226
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:44,009
80 sponsorship or spinning up a working

1227
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,200
group I'm not going to advise you about

1228
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,480
which one of those might be appropriate

1229
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,669
or not but I think you know especially

1230
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:55,329
if it involves updates

1231
00:59:49,670 --> 00:59:55,329
26 and 24 18 you know normal process

1232
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,910
Steven pearl so I don't really care

1233
01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:06,879
about this change but I'm not against us

1234
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:09,170
unless you end up with internet drafts

1235
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,630
following different rules for the

1236
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:13,880
different streams so if you go to make

1237
01:00:11,630 --> 01:00:17,480
this change just talk to the ISEE

1238
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:19,609
and the RTF tear and make sure everybody

1239
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,579
is okay with doing it all over I don't

1240
01:00:19,609 --> 01:00:24,828
care what the process is but anything

1241
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:26,839
yeah I don't see any negative to this

1242
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:28,520
unless it means that we have like

1243
01:00:26,839 --> 01:00:30,049
another screwy rule that applies

1244
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:32,630
differently to different streams which

1245
01:00:30,049 --> 01:00:36,940
with I think with internet crafts is not

1246
01:00:32,630 --> 01:00:39,200
the case today I think that's right yeah

1247
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:40,670
even though the boilerplate may not

1248
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:43,118
really applying some of the other

1249
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:45,140
streams they tend to attract it yeah

1250
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:50,329
yeah fill harm Baker

1251
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:52,790
i I support this change to answer alice

1252
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:57,349
is the way that you can avoid the

1253
01:00:52,790 --> 01:01:01,849
pressure is there's a Perl script just

1254
01:00:57,349 --> 01:01:06,069
works every six months put in contact if

1255
01:01:01,849 --> 01:01:09,200
people want to mark a draft as

1256
01:01:06,069 --> 01:01:11,869
superseded then the way to do it is to

1257
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:15,379
just put in another draft to say but is

1258
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:17,540
blank except hey go here and of course

1259
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:21,290
people could say this is a really bad

1260
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:24,430
idea don't do it and if somebody does

1261
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,430
that buy them a pint

1262
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:35,059
so John yeah I just want to put a stake

1263
01:01:32,540 --> 01:01:38,299
in the ground for the dissenting parties

1264
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:41,359
as as someone who didn't feel like it

1265
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:43,700
was a good idea for the IETF to make

1266
01:01:41,359 --> 01:01:46,880
expired drafts even publicly available

1267
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:50,480
or you see well and and this

1268
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:52,069
conversation confirms it one of the

1269
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,760
things which makes a clear distinction

1270
01:01:52,069 --> 01:01:59,540
between the RFC series archival record

1271
01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:01,260
and the internet drafts is is this notes

1272
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:03,450
an expiration

1273
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:05,880
and it may not be terribly effective in

1274
01:02:03,450 --> 01:02:09,390
the boundaries thinner and thinner but

1275
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:12,390
removing expiration turns thee in an

1276
01:02:09,390 --> 01:02:15,690
address to archival documents and people

1277
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:18,900
who are concerned that that RFC's from

1278
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:21,330
different streams are being confused

1279
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:25,320
with the authority and wisdom of the

1280
01:02:21,330 --> 01:02:28,290
IETF had better think about this one and

1281
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:31,140
the ability of each role to post a draft

1282
01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:34,170
before you make those drafts archival

1283
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:47,009
again just getting to send the human and

1284
01:02:34,170 --> 01:02:51,180
into the record thank you this

1285
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:53,910
difference is touching you know : JS I I

1286
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:55,950
don't I wouldn't want to see a sent a

1287
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:58,080
huge amount of time on those I don't I

1288
01:02:55,950 --> 01:02:59,490
mean the drafts no matter what people

1289
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,109
wish or say and I heard John's point

1290
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,850
they don't expire when you google the

1291
01:03:01,109 --> 01:03:04,680
name they're there they are used as

1292
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,720
archival documents in law cases all the

1293
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:08,430
time I've heard the same argument made

1294
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:10,618
by things and seeing every judge always

1295
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:13,529
instantly reject that these are

1296
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:15,930
documents that do exist and they are

1297
01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:17,369
effectively archival in the sense that

1298
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:18,868
you you get them afterwards and that's

1299
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:20,220
good we use them we refer to them we

1300
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:22,050
could talk about when thing happened the

1301
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:24,660
timelines for when things happened but

1302
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:26,550
like the fact that we would spin up a

1303
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:30,480
working group to spend time on

1304
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:31,770
discussing this I I just doesn't seem

1305
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:36,950
like the most important thing I think

1306
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:36,950
this is your most epic troll ever yeah

1307
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:45,990
that that's a big statement mark

1308
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:47,430
Nottingham I like this I think we should

1309
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:50,129
do this I think this is the right thing

1310
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:52,109
to do because the lines what we say with

1311
01:03:50,130 --> 01:03:55,020
reality which is something I always

1312
01:03:52,109 --> 01:03:56,430
think we should do however I hear it

1313
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:58,050
being asserted that this is small and

1314
01:03:56,430 --> 01:04:00,118
simple and something that back of my

1315
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:03,690
head says that you may have opened a

1316
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:05,609
portal to Hell that's that's exactly my

1317
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:07,859
point of getting to this question yes

1318
01:04:05,609 --> 01:04:10,020
the primary focus of this discussion was

1319
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:12,509
that we are this is talking about making

1320
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:13,330
a change to be cp9 which hasn't happened

1321
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:16,510
in

1322
01:04:13,330 --> 01:04:17,799
right many years right and and and

1323
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:20,380
specifically people are talking about

1324
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,970
different streams and you know let's

1325
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:24,400
face it a large number of internet

1326
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:26,560
drafts are on no stream or they change

1327
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,470
streams or they you know they change

1328
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,790
states multiple times and so you know we

1329
01:04:29,470 --> 01:04:32,379
talk about consulting the community of

1330
01:04:30,790 --> 01:04:34,180
people who use this that's an incredibly

1331
01:04:32,380 --> 01:04:35,740
amorphous thing and oh my god we're

1332
01:04:34,180 --> 01:04:37,660
talking about representational

1333
01:04:35,740 --> 01:04:52,629
communities again and we know where that

1334
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:55,210
goes so just tread carefully I think

1335
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:56,770
yeah Alyssa would yell us yell at us if

1336
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:58,860
we said well we don't know how to

1337
01:04:56,770 --> 01:05:01,959
dispatch it because we're out of time

1338
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,959
[Music]

1339
01:05:04,290 --> 01:05:10,330
Ben exclaims that dispatch in art does

1340
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:14,950
that all the time I'm looking at Alyssa

1341
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:18,430
for some sort of help here I mean I'm I

1342
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:21,960
I heard a lot of just handing this to an

1343
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:25,480
ad is probably not it is that accurate

1344
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,620
yeah I agree with that I mean I guess I

1345
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,120
would be interested in your thoughts of

1346
01:05:26,620 --> 01:05:31,180
whether there's anything you heard today

1347
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,920
that causes you don't want to like spin

1348
01:05:31,180 --> 01:05:35,440
a new version that is substantially

1349
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:41,050
different or like any of these arguments

1350
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:42,880
sway you one way or the other so the one

1351
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,440
thing I did here was statements comment

1352
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,710
which is make this apply to all streams

1353
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,510
equally and that just means I think

1354
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:52,330
making sure that all of the different

1355
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:54,760
stream managers are on board with it as

1356
01:05:52,330 --> 01:05:57,400
well but that might make it an IAB

1357
01:05:54,760 --> 01:06:00,160
document not an IETF document and at

1358
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:02,890
which point I'm happy to go talk to my

1359
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:06,220
esteemed colleagues at the IAB but I

1360
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:08,710
certainly would want to have this run

1361
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,810
through the the ITF as the primary

1362
01:06:08,710 --> 01:06:12,970
consumer of these things and and I will

1363
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:15,460
note for Amusements sake that that

1364
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:17,230
you're faithful chair made a comment in

1365
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,390
the jabber room which made it seem like

1366
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:20,830
there might be some significant

1367
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:21,680
discussion in the IAB if you brought it

1368
01:06:20,830 --> 01:06:23,720
to the

1369
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,879
I would just observe that one can have

1370
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,999
conversations with stream leads without

1371
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:31,130
having processes absolutely absolutely

1372
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:34,368
there is no question of that so the

1373
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:36,499
reason I came here and targeted this at

1374
01:06:34,369 --> 01:06:38,630
the ITF is this this is an IETF

1375
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:41,118
consensus document or actually two of

1376
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:42,890
them that are affected by the change so

1377
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:46,460
this is I think the primary seat of the

1378
01:06:42,890 --> 01:06:50,118
change and I don't think it can go on

1379
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:55,910
the IB stream and become part of BC p9

1380
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:57,799
and 37 but we should my view is I would

1381
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,970
need to go and talk to the stream

1382
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:01,490
managers for the other streams and

1383
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:03,049
simply say does this would you have any

1384
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:05,240
objection to this what sort of process

1385
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:08,720
would you like to see this go through

1386
01:07:05,240 --> 01:07:10,640
what sort of community input do you want

1387
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:13,399
to see before this goes forward but I

1388
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:16,009
think it's primary home is still okay so

1389
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:17,690
I'm hearing your suggestion is you're

1390
01:07:16,009 --> 01:07:20,779
gonna do footwork to talk to stream

1391
01:07:17,690 --> 01:07:22,880
managers and then maybe it comes back to

1392
01:07:20,779 --> 01:07:24,589
a bar for something to figure out how to

1393
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:26,749
handle these sorts of things in general

1394
01:07:24,589 --> 01:07:28,038
I I don't want to bother this I know I

1395
01:07:26,749 --> 01:07:30,049
think this is that this is ad

1396
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:32,630
sponsorship if anything because that's

1397
01:07:30,049 --> 01:07:34,849
the right level of energy that a change

1398
01:07:32,630 --> 01:07:37,489
of this size requires if we can't do

1399
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:39,589
something of this size to our processes

1400
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:41,809
when we have such what what seems to be

1401
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:44,210
quite a large amount of support for the

1402
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:47,239
change then I think that we're stuck

1403
01:07:44,210 --> 01:07:50,299
with the processes that we had in the

1404
01:07:47,239 --> 01:07:52,609
early 2000s and that's not a great place

1405
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:54,499
to be that's why I ran the trial and

1406
01:07:52,609 --> 01:07:56,989
this is really just a test to see what

1407
01:07:54,499 --> 01:07:59,419
the process looks like John do you have

1408
01:07:56,989 --> 01:08:01,249
a sword for this not well no I mean I

1409
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:04,039
just want actually to bring back I'm not

1410
01:08:01,249 --> 01:08:05,660
come in and again I think you will need

1411
01:08:04,039 --> 01:08:07,249
all kinds of I offer in the community on

1412
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,680
this because there is no other process

1413
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:12,379
we have but to have Knox point the

1414
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,690
internet drafts are not a stream they're

1415
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:17,150
not a stream the products that get

1416
01:08:14,690 --> 01:08:19,580
published by the stream managers are the

1417
01:08:17,149 --> 01:08:21,439
stream in internet drafts or this weird

1418
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:25,429
amorphous thing that is handled by the

1419
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,778
Secretariat right and I I agree you're

1420
01:08:25,429 --> 01:08:28,850
putting exactly the right question here

1421
01:08:26,779 --> 01:08:30,889
is we don't know how to target something

1422
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:33,259
that is in this weird gray area so I

1423
01:08:30,889 --> 01:08:35,690
agree this this is even more epic troll

1424
01:08:33,259 --> 01:08:38,089
than our C++ because it

1425
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:41,419
I want to remind the room that we are

1426
01:08:38,089 --> 01:08:43,339
seven minutes over now and you know

1427
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:46,819
people who want dinner might start

1428
01:08:43,339 --> 01:08:48,350
chewing on arms they can do that I just

1429
01:08:46,819 --> 01:08:50,170
happened to be reading the boilerplate

1430
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:53,060
my internet drafts

1431
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:57,440
what people might familiarize themselves

1432
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:58,759
with so the first that well the second

1433
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:00,198
sentence the first sentence of the

1434
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,609
second paragraph is internet drafts or

1435
01:09:00,198 --> 01:09:03,500
working documents internet engineering

1436
01:09:01,609 --> 01:09:04,670
task force then it does say are the word

1437
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,259
groups may I distribute working diverse

1438
01:09:04,670 --> 01:09:08,899
internet graphs but then you own this

1439
01:09:06,259 --> 01:09:10,908
the copyright notice says IETF trust so

1440
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:12,830
like one light will make me for wafer

1441
01:09:10,908 --> 01:09:14,210
given the impression that all internet

1442
01:09:12,830 --> 01:09:15,589
drafts as a practical matter that are

1443
01:09:14,210 --> 01:09:20,020
published for our system our IETF

1444
01:09:15,589 --> 01:09:23,330
documents of one kind or Jamaat some

1445
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:25,850
like deciding whether internet drafts

1446
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:28,969
expire or having the expiry help during

1447
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:31,759
the doser very different things is some

1448
01:09:28,969 --> 01:09:33,980
confusing it and I cannot find in BC p9

1449
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:37,270
or twenty five that the dog should have

1450
01:09:33,979 --> 01:09:41,979
a expiry header so I think that

1451
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:41,980
somewhere else or not specifies at all

1452
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:49,399
so curiously I have looked into this

1453
01:09:46,130 --> 01:09:51,620
question yes the boilerplate and the

1454
01:09:49,399 --> 01:09:54,320
question of expiry are separate notions

1455
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,719
I want to attack the the actual expiry

1456
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:59,330
notion and address the boilerplate is a

1457
01:09:56,719 --> 01:10:01,429
consequence of that and the IV owns the

1458
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:04,219
boilerplate despite the fact that the I

1459
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:07,820
trust is the copyright on the documents

1460
01:10:04,219 --> 01:10:13,040
but I think we'll be fine

1461
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:22,790
on that on that question you okay with

1462
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:26,570
this outcome Alyssa so my understanding

1463
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:28,880
is that Martin is going to go talk to

1464
01:10:26,570 --> 01:10:31,849
the stream managers about their level of

1465
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,230
comfort with this proposal I think if

1466
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:37,280
any of them comes back and is like a

1467
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:41,360
total blocker then then it's probably

1468
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:44,570
not going anywhere and otherwise it

1469
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:47,750
sounds like maybe a little more

1470
01:10:44,570 --> 01:10:49,580
discussion refinement but if there were

1471
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:53,810
a path for this it would be a tease

1472
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:56,090
answer ship you can go with that and

1473
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:58,780
just a note from the jabber John what's

1474
01:10:56,090 --> 01:11:00,470
writing that please talk to the RSC -

1475
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:04,000

1476
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:07,010
on behalf of Martin he can do that I

1477
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,120
don't have a problem with that um and

1478
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:19,640
then has just typed that I believe so

1479
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:24,290
there we believe it yes Phil I do have

1480

an a OB item it quickly and and we will

1481

bring it okay so yeah this isn't gonna

1482
01:11:25,790 --> 01:11:32,180
be something that you can discuss here

1483
01:11:28,570 --> 01:11:35,719
we need to change note well we need to

1484
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:38,410
add antitrust considerations to it and I

1485
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:41,020
will be very happy to explain in private

1486
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:44,630
the circumstances that have made that

1487
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:47,240
essential and I would love to see a

1488
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:49,990
short little draft posted to the gender

1489
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:53,690
specialist and I'm sure there will be a

1490
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:54,920
hearty discussion of it well the problem

1491
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:56,839
here is that this is gonna have to be

1492
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:59,060
drafted by lawyers and I'm not a lawyer

1493
01:11:56,840 --> 01:12:00,770
well I may look like one but I'm not a

1494
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,810
lawyer you're welcome to draft something

1495
01:12:00,770 --> 01:12:04,780
that says we need something that looks

1496
01:12:02,810 --> 01:12:09,650
like such and so whether or not it has

1497
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:12,980
sharp content in it all right thank you

1498
01:12:09,650 --> 01:12:14,330

1499
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:17,679
