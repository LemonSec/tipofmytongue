1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:09,940
all right you're probably right click on

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:12,940
the link and say open on your tap let

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:16,570
yourself or the Russian tennis right

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:25,200
click go back let's see if I can

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:32,519
minimize this no can't do that but then

6
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:35,019
don't scroll down here ok this is the

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,370
just it just goes right back to you what

8
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:49,870
is one more about and you're gonna go

9
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:54,459
back again this one yeah yeah this isn't

10
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:56,709
seat chair it doesn't let you do that

11
00:00:54,460 --> 00:01:00,579
ok though think I can do it you have to

12
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:07,409
just kind of manual is just just copy

13
00:01:00,579 --> 00:01:10,030
that URL up there yes just copy the URL

14
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:12,069
I'm not a manual they just click on the

15
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:19,569
+ to create them to tap and then paste

16
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:19,990
it just open like 10 cents or so I don't

17
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:21,929
know how you

18
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:36,840
there's no it not a dialogue for copy

19
00:01:21,929 --> 00:01:36,840
control V control now so I'm thinking is

20
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:53,859
there's two control V here so I'm

21
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:59,159
thinking okay that's mm that's not what

22
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:59,158
the one that wanted them now let's see

23
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:11,500
okay so this is something else

24
00:02:03,099 --> 00:02:16,330
Gary spin materials so I'm thinking copy

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:17,959
this then just open like pick up eight

26
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,709
types of salad that's

27
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,310
then each tab just go to a different

28
00:02:20,709 --> 00:02:30,650
presentation so like in this one we can

29
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:39,400
go to the agenda status this one will go

30
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:39,400
to BFD agree yeah hi

31
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,899
[Music]

32
00:02:51,510 --> 00:03:02,160
this one didn't truly down low I'm

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,179
having the problem is that this hasn't

34
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:18,510
been converted maybe don't know if it

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:22,319
can actually display it don't you know

36
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:30,750
it did work another line of the problem

37
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:43,730
was okay not registered packing multi I

38
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:43,730
have on this scroll down

39
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,920
almost done

40
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:18,070
okay so think we got all of them now

41
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:20,880
open one more with the agenda see what

42
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:31,210
the agenda slides we've got B if the

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:39,820
orange multi this one you think we got

44
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:49,138
all of them so here I can do with you

45
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:57,219
okay what's going on here

46
00:04:49,139 --> 00:05:19,120
okay escape okay now I figured stuck we

47
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:22,270
can revert you control L now you know I

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,870
think like some PDF viewers use control

49
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,979
L but that doesn't work in a browser

50
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:37,080
let's see is there some kind of

51
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:49,300
presentation this one I guess no that's

52
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:55,090
we cannot quite what do you want but now

53
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:59,199
I guess this this is the best and there

54
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:01,500
is some other option I think in the

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,500
browser

56
00:06:02,009 --> 00:06:10,409
mmm yeah how do you do this guess maybe

57
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:10,409
over here there's our full screen

58
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:54,789
No well it's here

59
00:06:22,150 --> 00:07:23,440
this is this whole screen yeah yeah how

60
00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:27,068
do we get out of this there's a button

61
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,050
to press for full screen okay cool there

62
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:33,539
is a button here for full screen which

63
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,539
is the same as that it is a browser and

64
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,419
so oh really

65
00:07:50,039 --> 00:08:08,199
why are there so few people here that

66
00:07:52,419 --> 00:08:13,529
I've given it to get going oh just

67
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,529
waiting for everyone to show up demo

68
00:08:24,559 --> 00:08:37,129

86
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:11,899
we published our first yang model so

87
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:14,899
that took a long time a lot of effort

88
00:10:11,899 --> 00:10:17,929

completed it's just waiting for some

91
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:24,110
references I think basically some other

92
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:31,040
other documents that need to be

93
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:33,529
published as RFC s as well yeah we got a

94
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,629
lot of stuff in the queue now also the

95
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,560
reserved bits is in the RFC editors

96
00:10:35,629 --> 00:10:41,129
queue

97
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,399

improvements we also just requested

102
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:03,779
publication so what's the stuff we

103
00:10:56,850 --> 00:11:07,019
completed and also MSTP young model so

104
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:09,779
we did get some response from Alvaro he

105
00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:13,230
revealed that and we needed have waiting

106
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:15,300
for a new person I believe do load

107
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,480
balancing as well he requested

108
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,839
publication Alvaro had a lot of comments

109
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,720
that I addressed of one of the offers

110
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:29,189
and it's going to rsg evaluation now

111
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,949
then we have some working group drafts

112
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,599
just three more drafts so basically all

113
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,180
the drafts and just mentioned they're

114
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,339
all like in the queue to be published

115
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:40,670
but they got three drafts that are

116
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:45,480
current working group documents that we

117
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,149
are working on so now register packing B

118
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,300
if the point to multi-point and the

119
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:53,430
Arjun P Emily proxy young models so

120
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:55,979
those are the existing working work

121
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,410
group documents they got some new

122
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,949
documents presented today and guess

123
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:07,290
we'll consider adoption for some of them

124
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:14,099
yeah that's it right all right any

125
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:22,009
comments on that okay then the next on

126
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:27,980
the agenda should be yeah probably yeah

127
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:38,600
should be let's see maybe this one yeah

128
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:38,600
so so should be present it's working

129
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:48,179
your special we figured we have to

130
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:51,720
actually push it all the way in others

131
00:12:48,179 --> 00:12:56,259
other chairs can't figure it out

132
00:12:51,720 --> 00:13:00,749
okay so this is an update there was very

133
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:00,749
interesting discussion on a list about

134
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:09,579
more experienced detection for the world

135
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:16,779
balancing and we already have proposal

136
00:13:09,579 --> 00:13:21,549
how to do dr BD are expedited monitoring

137
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:29,139
using a point-to-multipoint b FD or how

138
00:13:21,549 --> 00:13:42,699
to refer to in RFC as leave d for multi

139
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:50,709
point networks am i doing it wrong no no

140
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:57,549
it's probably i have that's alright I

141
00:13:50,709 --> 00:14:00,910
know I broke it in alright okay we'll

142
00:13:57,549 --> 00:14:04,079
give up on that okay thank you okay so

143
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:04,079
how it works

144
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:16,119
for designated router world balancing so

145
00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:18,639
RFC introduced what now will be our C

146
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:22,990
because okay the draft introduced to

147
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:30,549
hello options capability advertisement

148
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:35,049
and group designated router candidate

149
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:39,879
list what we are proposing that a pin

150
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:42,429
router that includes capability hello

151
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:44,889
option may include be the discriminator

152
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:48,579
PM option that already been defined in

153
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:54,579
this draft in support of dr BD are

154
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:58,209
monitoring and when the router

155
00:14:54,579 --> 00:15:01,959
advertised that it creates BFD session

156
00:14:58,209 --> 00:15:04,569
as multiple in head according to BFD for

157
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:11,920
multi-point networks which is now our

158
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:14,920
50 85 62 it sets the session down so

159
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:19,150
only creates a state no the packets

160
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:23,740
being transmitted if the PM if the

161
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:26,890
router receives that they used the

162
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:30,430
discriminator with a cap hello option

163
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:33,150
sees itself in a group designated router

164
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:37,150
candidate list that dia router

165
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:39,189
distributes then it's a move session to

166
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:43,480
the Upstate and start politically

167
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:44,880
transmitting MIDI control messages at

168
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:49,840
the same time

169
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:55,240
dr creates or before sending the first

170
00:15:49,840 --> 00:16:01,900
up or updated candidate list it creates

171
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:06,340
a session as multi here multi-point leaf

172
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,980
and starts the multiplexing packets

173
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:11,410
because well them could be a

174
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:14,920
multiplicity of candidates so that's a

175
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:17,620
multiplicity of point-to-multipoint in

176
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,459
video sessions so it looks for the

177
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:21,640
discriminator

178
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:25,360
but since the discriminator only in my

179
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:29,140
field which is specific to this type of

180
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:34,360
BFD session it needs to know the source

181
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:36,790
IP address so and as already stated in

182
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,850
the document the source IP address must

183
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:47,079
be the same source the same ip address

184
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:53,740
as included in hello pin hello so the

185
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:58,090
idea is if we can go next slide so the

186
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:02,950
idea is that they are monitors the

187
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:05,589
well-being of candidate or it could be

188
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,220
they are in video because it's a

189
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:12,448
multi-point

190
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:16,180
network and then can detect whether the

191
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:18,120
candidate is available so if it's not

192
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:22,409
available it can generate

193
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:25,589
updated candidate it can generate the

194
00:17:22,409 --> 00:17:30,830
hello message with updated Kindle at

195
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:35,428
least nice faster then hello interval

196
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:43,158
and that's the convergence in a world

197
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:46,289
balancing will happen much faster so

198
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:50,490
that pretty much the same the idea of

199
00:17:46,289 --> 00:17:53,908
course are the dr itself is the

200
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:57,649
candidate but since it doesn't need to

201
00:17:53,909 --> 00:18:03,120
monitor itself others can monitor it if

202
00:17:57,649 --> 00:18:06,570
dr is using a point-to-multipoint b FD

203
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:09,870
is already defined in this draft to for

204
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:13,770
expedited convergence so for example b

205
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:17,699
dr can monitor dr as a candidate for the

206
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:21,750
load balancing as and as a they are so

207
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:27,899
don't need to create two sessions next

208
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:30,330
slide so that's their new update to the

209
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:36,360
draft and we welcome your questions

210
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:37,980
comments and will ask well if there are

211
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,789
not many comments from the consider

212
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:44,039
working group last call and come now

213
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:48,899
from cisco so if you are running these

214
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:53,010
BFBS from GDR to all endpoints are two

215
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:57,059
endpoints is between Dr Ng Diaz yes Dr

216
00:18:53,010 --> 00:19:00,390
Ng there's dr dr and v dr because ok the

217
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:05,850
the benefit is that because it's a

218
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:11,840
point-to-multipoint session so firstly

219
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:15,049
is it creates less state because it's

220
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,389
unidirectional right so the specificity

221
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:22,799
specifics of our point-to-multipoint BFD

222
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:25,830
it uses demand mode so only there one

223
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:30,759
side generates messages but at the same

224
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:33,728
time since it's not active tail

225
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:36,549
listener the leaf knows the state of the

226
00:19:33,729 --> 00:19:39,429
path and their route so in this case

227
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:43,149
they are in vidya will know can monitor

228
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:45,159
the state of an arab candidate okay so

229
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:48,158
basically if you detect a failure you

230
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:55,449
read on the VRA like yes okay that's the

231
00:19:48,159 --> 00:19:57,609
idea yeah so everyone so by the way

232
00:19:55,449 --> 00:19:59,529
thanks for that clarification you just

233
00:19:57,609 --> 00:20:02,849
had it was one of my questions as well

234
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:05,589
okay but one thing I was wondering is I

235
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:08,979
agree that you know you only really

236
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:11,829
needed the art to monitor the GDR but I

237
00:20:08,979 --> 00:20:14,649
know there are some some payment

238
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:16,749
limitations would be a fever you just

239
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:19,089
have hearings between all the neighbors

240
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:20,769
and you just listen you know to check

241
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:29,889
your neighbors going away in general

242
00:20:20,769 --> 00:20:36,639
yeah well again we are not mandating it

243
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:40,619
this is option and they're nice about

244
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:43,689
point-to-multipoint that comparing to

245
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:45,579
RFC fifty eight eighty which described

246
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,009
all actually fifty eight eighty

247
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:50,619
described all the possibility for the

248
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:53,769
team applicability is I believe it's a

249
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:57,369
single hobby FD so it's a synchronous

250
00:20:53,769 --> 00:21:01,889
mode a synchronous mode will create more

251
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:04,119
state because if we have the more

252
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:07,329
routers we have on the same shared

253
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:11,189
segment the raw the more pin routers on

254
00:21:07,329 --> 00:21:14,529
the same shared segment so the more

255
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:17,529
state of BFD sessions that create full

256
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:23,049
mesh between will be there so and I

257
00:21:17,529 --> 00:21:25,659
think that that's where the benefits of

258
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:28,509
using the land mode and

259
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:31,209
point-to-multipoint BFD will become more

260
00:21:28,509 --> 00:21:33,549
significant yeah the main the main thing

261
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:36,549
I was wondering about in a way yeah was

262
00:21:33,549 --> 00:21:38,829
you know there's it says here that you

263
00:21:36,549 --> 00:21:40,839
Lachie they are you take the session

264
00:21:38,829 --> 00:21:42,549
state up or down based on whether you

265
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:44,399
are currently announced yes

266
00:21:42,549 --> 00:21:46,680
and I was wondering a bit in

267
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,160
does it make sense to just always keep

268
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:54,480
it up in case some papers are well the

269
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:56,850
thing well actually its again if there

270
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,980
is a use case when it's might be

271
00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:05,790
interesting just to track the world

272
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:12,120
being of a node yes but at the same time

273
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:14,340
well again we might make it optional yes

274
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,040
I don't really have any answers but I

275
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,169
was wondering about that but I see you

276
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:21,330
know on the slide here it says must set

277
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,900
the session you know such as day two

278
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:30,030
down maybe it shouldn't well well again

279
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:35,240
the idea is that since we're using it to

280
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:40,410
track only the those who are listed in a

281
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:42,870
candidate list so if if we want to make

282
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,270
more generic saying okay well we are

283
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,860
tracking everybody who announced the

284
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:52,560
capability to be candidate then we'll

285
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:54,629
probably will change that because then

286
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,030
then we'll change it even from the

287
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:59,850
beginning that we're after they

288
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:03,060
announced their capability they will set

289
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:05,939
their session up because current text

290
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:08,850
says that the session is initial state

291
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:12,780
is down and you bring it up only if you

292
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:18,719
see yourself on the candidate list so if

293
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:22,490
there is a use case to make it well let

294
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:27,330
me see if it use case to make it less

295
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:30,810
restricted okay so for example we can

296
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:33,840
say should say that set it down so which

297
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:36,179
will allow implementers to consider some

298
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,090
environments where they want to start it

299
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,590
up to begin with and then we can say

300
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:45,480
should take it down

301
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:48,990
we shall Gail give them justification

302
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:52,140
not to take it down yeah yes so I don't

303
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,850
have any answers but but one thing for

304
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,370
instance I'm wondering about this one is

305
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:58,209
the our state right it's useful to use

306
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:02,100
PFD to quickly did

307
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:05,140
Herman who is the Dro GDR but also

308
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,480
possibly maybe things like a start state

309
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:09,340
for instance if you this if you track

310
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,460
neighbors and you see that you know the

311
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:13,929
Oscar winner went down that Islands you

312
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,970
know there could be things like that

313
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:23,800
that's what again I you know I'm not

314
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:26,710
that versed in a Pimm's scenario so if

315
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:31,780
there is a use case I would be willing

316
00:24:26,710 --> 00:24:37,030
to discuss it and then we can modify and

317
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:38,860
make it less restrictive this but but

318
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:40,750
yeah I was gonna say thanks for doing

319
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,699
this I mean Shimano the offers so the

320
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:46,690
allowed balancing - and I think you know

321
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:56,080
that this makes it better thank you okay

322
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:58,450
thank you again

323
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,220
since Stig mentioned that there might be

324
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:06,520
some scenarios that might change the

325
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,490
normative language let's keep it open

326
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:13,840
for comments from the list if they will

327
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:15,880
really like idea of making it less

328
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,399
restrictive for example change must -

329
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:25,240
should and if there are such requests

330
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:27,930
yeah I think that there is no problem

331
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,960
but I would like to first understand why

332
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:36,640
before making it and after that we'll

333
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,320
see yeah I'll try to provide comments on

334
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,660
the list and see if we can you know make

335
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,439
some progress you know with pity for the

336
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:53,130
next meeting

337
00:25:41,440 --> 00:26:03,000
great thank you okay that should be

338
00:25:53,130 --> 00:26:03,000
imagine proxy yeah yeah yeah that's them

339
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,930
no no that's the one we had some trouble

340
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:10,199
with so if Connor came out in the wrong

341
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:10,200
order

342
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:14,260
all right

343
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:26,780
yeah at cousins work you can try it but

344
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:33,830
now it's not actually maybe it's

345
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:39,320
pointing here we have it working for a

346
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:43,699
few seconds again good afternoon i'm

347
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:47,810
shefaly oh I'm here to give a quick

348
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:54,380
update to the I jump in with the epoxy

349
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:58,760
your model next week so this document

350
00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:02,740
that just recently being attacked update

351
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:06,890
to the adult working group document so

352
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:16,310
after that this is a first update after

353
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:19,490
the talk at option nice place yeah so we

354
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:21,409
after the adoption and during the

355
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:30,050
process because someone reveal comments

356
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:34,760
so here some updates so one acted the

357
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:38,120
way I did the option at the confusion

358
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:40,430
leave to specify the sender sauce I

359
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,209
dress so in case we have multiplied

360
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:48,350
dresses so this one will be used through

361
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:52,990
the reporter D and kima option a

362
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:56,780
flexibility for the user so I think

363
00:27:52,990 --> 00:27:58,760
highlights used to be highlighted but

364
00:27:56,780 --> 00:28:02,350
anyway okay so that's aligned with the

365
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,120
source address next my spleen

366
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:09,149
same thing here to the I'm ready

367
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,149
[Music]

368
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:19,740
vacation tree same the pinheaded extra

369
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:25,289
space so another leave your comments is

370
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:28,590
about the future mode were stainless

371
00:28:25,289 --> 00:28:31,940
also each sauce which tell me makes

372
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,830
analysis so it shouldn't be there the

373
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:37,620
theater mode for the core team so you

374
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:39,840
can either any particular sauce or xcode

375
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:45,389
included extras or should be either

376
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:51,720
black also only so we remove the not

377
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:55,709
proper position the filter mode so this

378
00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:01,799
is a clean up next are trees seem seem

379
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:05,370
to the MRD that the same changes next

380
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:14,120
fights so yeah that's it some quick

381
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:18,360
updates to the changes alright thank you

382
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:20,158
so this document was just adopted but I

383
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,990
was gonna say do you feel like the

384
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,179
document is complete do you have

385
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:27,299
anything more you plan to do with it for

386
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:32,370
and yeah well still discussing and we

387
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:38,250
asked further review unless you saw

388
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:41,370
anything to remove one thing I imagine

389
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:43,679
for any vendors to see if this if their

390
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:46,168
implementation works well with this or

391
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:51,269
if if you know needs some adjustments to

392
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:53,549
the model and also for anyone using the

393
00:29:51,269 --> 00:30:04,220
model for any management if it has what

394
00:29:53,549 --> 00:30:09,110
what you need yeah thank you anybody

395
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:20,880
Thank You Craig thank you guys thanks

396
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:22,770
okay sorry it's too late

397
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,050
[Music]

398
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:27,780
just my after shots that are just a

399
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:30,510
question about expressed more to try do

400
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:32,309
you think that you were drafted already

401
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:41,040
includes explicit mode the tracking

402
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:43,139
function well well the the reason why

403
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:46,080
I'm asking this is that because Express

404
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:48,600
trapping sorry for my really great but

405
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:51,659
the explicit tracking mode itself is

406
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,000
really important it it's well known the

407
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:58,830
problem is that that function actually I

408
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,450
was I am still also that expired draft

409
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:08,309
but so so so this is a question so it's

410
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:11,220
already expired and well maybe it's

411
00:31:08,309 --> 00:31:14,610
maybe it's my problem but the question

412
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,679
is that whether we should include that

413
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,110
function because that function sir is

414
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:23,970
very important the problem is that the

415
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:27,240
doctor was not it was not draft rejected

416
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:30,420
I mean that the draft was accepted but

417
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:32,429
the problem was in my I'm not sure what

418
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:34,500
the intention of the draft state is for

419
00:31:32,429 --> 00:31:37,110
example it should be a standard track or

420
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,059
information or experimental and the

421
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:41,129
other vendors are already implemented

422
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:45,600
and that there is no consideration about

423
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:48,059
wired communication so so there was a

424
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,860
comment from the ad so why we definitely

425
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:52,830
need to have that kind of draft

426
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,050
especially for as a standard track

427
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:58,260
document so that's why it's really

428
00:31:55,050 --> 00:32:01,190
stucked and but that function itself is

429
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,629
really important and I'm sure that

430
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,000
several vendors are already implemented

431
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:09,270
that function and young mothers should

432
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,990
focus on that kind of important function

433
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:19,379
so the question is what we or they

434
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:21,750
should do yeah so at least it's possible

435
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,170
to have a young model for something even

436
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:32,910
if there is no no draft right of C for

437
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:34,559
the actual functionality like yeah I'm

438
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:36,390
trying to think here but but basically

439
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,090
you can

440
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,850
you can define you know as long as

441
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:44,459
there's implementations that have like

442
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,230
certain ways knobs were for a

443
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,580
neighboring or whatever you can you can

444
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:50,460
define the young model for how to do

445
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:57,439
that even if it's not 100% define how

446
00:32:50,460 --> 00:33:02,670
the feature works which I'll put a mean

447
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,770
to the draft expert Oh exact problem

448
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:11,460
cause problem even worse than not

449
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:14,730
referencing that right so yeah it's

450
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:16,290
important that I think that there's a

451
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:18,210
common understanding what explicit

452
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,460
tracking means but I think that's pretty

453
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:25,860
well understood it's just that there's

454
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,930
no document for it if technically I

455
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:31,040
think it's fine to have an informational

456
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:33,440
reference to expire draft in all right

457
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:39,930
yeah but but it has to be just

458
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:46,380
informational usually in the model if it

459
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:48,150
put any laughing state in there you know

460
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,910
what I mean is just in general with

461
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:53,160
RFC's you know if it's if it's not to

462
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:55,110
achieve them it's okay if it's just an

463
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,880
expired draft but another thing is

464
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:02,639
whether it's okay for the reference to

465
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,590
just be informative yeah okay we think

466
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,950
about that it's to see if we can catch

467
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:11,040
some direction from Charis I'll be good

468
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:12,540
another thing though is you know in when

469
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:15,509
you are making this model you try to

470
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:18,360
define what is kind of common for all

471
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:20,340
the main implementations right so do you

472
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:24,409
know whether all the months you looked

473
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:27,800
at already have explicit tracking or

474
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:31,380
yeah we need to have some feedback any

475
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,530
vendors can have some information that

476
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:37,679
you great so we know we'll be doing we

477
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,760
will try to actively pull some vendors

478
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,760
see if we can have

479
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:55,119
so yeah hi I'm presenting the

480
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:57,069
non-registered packing draft I'm not an

481
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,830
offer I'm just doing this on behalf of

482
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,830
the offers I should say though that um

483
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:08,759
I've been close involved with with the

484
00:35:05,109 --> 00:35:11,259
offers discussing this and stuff so just

485
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,480
just so you're aware of that but but

486
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,510
just a quick status update or this draft

487
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:21,570
really so there was I worked in a blast

488
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:25,540
call for this draft some months ago or

489
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:28,359
weeks ago and and there was only one

490
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,430
response to that I think and and there

491
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:32,200
are several suggestions in that in that

492
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:34,540
though and one of them was that it

493
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:38,980
should be with some way of coping with

494
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:41,980
that what you see here basically as part

495
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:44,800
of the register packing you try to

496
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:47,680
discover if the RP actually supports it

497
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,660
you don't want to send a packet register

498
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:52,029
unless you know for sure that it can be

499
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,129
processed so there is to find a way of

500
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:58,720
detecting that the RP supported was

501
00:35:54,130 --> 00:36:00,400
having a flag in a register stop but

502
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,230
what happens if your RP is suddenly

503
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,260
downgraded so it doesn't support this

504
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:08,950
anymore so the draft discusses how to

505
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:11,470
detect that basically if I remember now

506
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:13,649
if we send a packed register and you

507
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,270
don't get a register stop back then

508
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:19,270
there's a chance that your RP no longer

509
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:21,970
supports it but is it that there's some

510
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:27,220
new disc text to to discuss how the

511
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:29,020
system otherwise I don't know what else

512
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:34,390
is missing there was only that one

513
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:40,660
response and and this was done to handle

514
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:47,920
that so yeah I guess people need another

515
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:49,770
last call or what do you think Mike why

516
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,180
don't we do it last call last dinner

517
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:55,210
might be like two months ago I think it

518
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:56,529
was after last night EF okay yeah I

519
00:36:55,210 --> 00:37:01,060
think yeah you you sent

520
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:04,120
of the last call requests but well yeah

521
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,950
so at least has a chair you know I feel

522
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:11,410
like you know we need more we need more

523
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:13,060
responses than one person at leasts yeah

524
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,830
and we're entering a create where it's

525
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,390
gonna be hard to get sponsors to with

526
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,850
the whole guys coming up so it's gonna

527
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:21,609
be tough I mean we either wait for the

528
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,140
new year and do it again or well let's

529
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:27,640
you and I figure that out together but

530
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:29,049
ah but probably good ask if people in

531
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,720
the room think it's ready for a working

532
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:32,620
group last call yeah I mean we decided

533
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,189
that it was ready

534
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:38,200
you know previously but we haven't got

535
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:43,600
very few responses or basically one

536
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:47,529
response yeah but yeah I know should we

537
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:51,610
ask the room or just a good I mean okay

538
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:57,820
so as a chair how many people have read

539
00:37:51,610 --> 00:38:02,590
this drafts to two people do you both

540
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:04,690
think it looks useful or yeah yeah I

541
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:06,340
should say we also have another a cert

542
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:08,920
packing draft that we will discuss later

543
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:12,520
and it's basically the same idea

544
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,100
I believe it's there's a number of pages

545
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:18,370
that are Paris comma G but similar to

546
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:22,960
join prints it might be useful to to

547
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:25,390
have multiple a long message okay I

548
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,680
guess we'll figure it out yes responses

549
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:33,220
now anyway it's doubled it yeah yeah

550
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:38,859
yeah so yeah you should go after those

551
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:40,839
people and get their feedback okay yeah

552
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:43,240
but I would say it's a challenge for

553
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:47,620
this working group in general to to get

554
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,720
people to respond in there yeah if

555
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:52,150
you're able to be great to have more

556
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:59,109
activity on the mailing list and more

557
00:38:52,150 --> 00:39:01,440
responses in general okay okay I think

558
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:01,440
Toshi

559
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:12,049
is up let's find it you presenting okay

560
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:24,598
okay so hello everybody I'm Reese

561
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:26,780
controller from telefónica or could do

562
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:29,910
it with you Toshi a xylophone Nick in

563
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,990
this idea of multiple absolute interface

564
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:34,890
support for IEP

565
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,410
I am PMD proxy

566
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:39,420
so the idea well we were turned to

567
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:41,848
revive this the other we did take in

568
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:44,700
some time ago and now trying to be more

569
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:46,680
pushing a little bit more be more active

570
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,859
on on that so basically they they be

571
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,589
able be to having to support in a in the

572
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:54,630
proxy the capability of having multiple

573
00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:57,380
option interfaces this enables a number

574
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:59,690
of use cases I will detail later on but

575
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:02,160
basically the point would be to make a

576
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:04,500
more efficient usage of the network and

577
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,348
also enabling new new situation so the

578
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,680
point will be basically to be able of

579
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:12,869
receiving the multi multicast packets

580
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,279
multicast content in both of these

581
00:40:12,869 --> 00:40:16,470
interfaces according to different

582
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,940
situations different policies could be

583
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,480
applied to on top of that

584
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:23,160
so the we've mentioned there this one

585
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,430
possibilities like well receive a LT

586
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,830
wife a over so the day the the span of a

587
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:34,830
scenario sees is quite large and we will

588
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:38,970
take a little a bit later next slide so

589
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:40,529
the objective yeah basically to have the

590
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:43,200
possibility of receiving multicast

591
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:47,220
sessions because content in different

592
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,450
upstream interfaces the solution sohow

593
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,879
addresses the requirements that are

594
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:53,669
documented in in another draft this and

595
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,369
now progress in in the dependent stream

596
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:58,109
or stop actually progressing so who's

597
00:40:56,369 --> 00:41:02,400
moved to the in the potential mission

598
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:04,680
stream and yeah there are get pain in

599
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,589
the comments to be addressed is somehow

600
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,460
has been in doermann by a while by one

601
00:41:07,589 --> 00:41:13,589
year or so so ideal is also to push

602
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,910
again these other graphs on requirements

603
00:41:13,589 --> 00:41:16,440
but basically a

604
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:18,118
we are looking at those requirements in

605
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,789
order to define the the solutions that

606
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,369
are and at the scope of this draft next

607
00:41:20,789 --> 00:41:24,920
slide please

608
00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:30,000
so regarding the benefits that we

609
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,220
foreseen if this was implemented is

610
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,849
basically having a flexible operation

611
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:38,160
so either we could select the do what is

612
00:41:35,849 --> 00:41:39,690
they obscene interface based on the

613
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,609
subscriber that is requesting the

614
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:46,380
service or either even a in base of the

615
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:49,609
channel of the content that is being

616
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:52,710
provided so we could play with these two

617
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:56,308
alternatives let's say a part of this

618
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:58,230
flexible operation this solution could

619
00:41:56,309 --> 00:42:00,299
enable a robust data reception because

620
00:41:58,230 --> 00:42:02,839
we will be able even after the same

621
00:42:00,299 --> 00:42:05,038
content receipt by the two interfaces

622
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:06,750
this could be one of the of the

623
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:09,180
situations and this enables only

624
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:13,309
scenarios of high availability for

625
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:15,899
instance in the network and all okay

626
00:42:13,309 --> 00:42:17,369
even in other situations where we just

627
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,109
received the condemning in one of the

628
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:21,750
two we could have mechanisms for

629
00:42:19,109 --> 00:42:23,910
protecting the the delivery of the

630
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,089
content and having a switch between

631
00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:29,700
interfaces if required in order to have

632
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:31,220
the service alive yet even in the case

633
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:37,319
of events in the network

634
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:39,779
next in the use cases our refreshment on

635
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:41,400
this huh I will detail trying to tell a

636
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:43,260
bit different use cases that were

637
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,930
documented already in the requirements

638
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:47,339
draft one situation would be the

639
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:50,220
multicast wholesale offer for

640
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:52,220
residential services so we could it

641
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:54,779
could be the case that one operator

642
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:57,899
enables also enables also the delivery

643
00:42:54,779 --> 00:43:00,000
of content from another provider an OTT

644
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,190
provided for instance in such a way that

645
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,309
a subscriber to this operator has the

646
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:07,140
opportunity to receive and a content

647
00:43:05,309 --> 00:43:09,170
from either the own content or the

648
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,819
content from the this OTT provider

649
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:14,789
multicast resiliency for sure in the

650
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:17,520
case we have these two interfaces we

651
00:43:14,789 --> 00:43:19,289
could or two or more interfaces we could

652
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:23,190
provide more resiliency to the delivery

653
00:43:19,289 --> 00:43:26,160
of multicast traffic to the network load

654
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:28,450
balances for multicast traffic so in

655
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,899
this case we basically could take prof

656
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:33,460
the fact that the in a normal deployment

657
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:36,339
in the normal they mentioning of the

658
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:40,030
network for unicast traffic

659
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:43,480
we basically dimension the network with

660
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:45,760
a V of having a low and maximum load per

661
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:48,070
link of fifty percent of the traffic in

662
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:50,619
such a way that if a link goes down to

663
00:43:48,070 --> 00:43:52,839
the link inducks of all the traffic in

664
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:56,290
normal conditions most of the time the

665
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,930
these capacities is bacon so having this

666
00:43:56,290 --> 00:44:00,730
possibility of receiving traffic by

667
00:43:57,930 --> 00:44:02,890
through more than one interface we could

668
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:05,109
take profit of that in order to use this

669
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,270
per capacity in the level for a receive

670
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:09,040
more content and only reducing the

671
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:11,290
available bandwidth in case of an event

672
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,020
so we could enable also these kind of

673
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:15,670
things also there are situations or

674
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:17,980
procedural real operational situations

675
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,630
were having more than one assume

676
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,490
interface would be beneficial like the

677
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:25,540
case of the network merging so you are

678
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:27,729
matching networks and and you have

679
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:29,950
different contents may be overlapping

680
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:32,200
the addressing of the content and so we

681
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:34,839
could play with this fact in order to

682
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,419
have a smooth integration of all

683
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:39,369
networks and finally the multicast

684
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:41,380
service migration so the same idea if we

685
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:43,240
need to somehow to migrate a service we

686
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:45,280
could enable a second interface a second

687
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:50,379
upstream interface for the migrated

688
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:53,589
content while keeping the ribbon another

689
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:55,150
interface for the old content so all of

690
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:57,369
this as I mentioned before is documented

691
00:44:55,150 --> 00:45:02,680
in the requirement and draft so it's

692
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:04,599
available also for for you to check so

693
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,848
we in this solution drug we are

694
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:08,079
proposing to two ways two chances one

695
00:45:06,849 --> 00:45:11,140
would be the automatic upstream

696
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,440
interface configuration to for this case

697
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:16,598
for this choice we have yet we need to

698
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,300
do some more investigation how to solve

699
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,220
the the point so here there is a list of

700
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,290
questions that we are trying to address

701
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,910
so for instance how the proxy can

702
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:28,000
automatically is like the appropriate

703
00:45:24,910 --> 00:45:31,299
obscene interface for this channel so we

704
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,950
will show how to identify what would be

705
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:35,440
the required logic for doing that or

706
00:45:32,950 --> 00:45:37,868
even if they would be required some kind

707
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,940
of signaling for enable that how the

708
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:41,380
procedure detect inactive obscene

709
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:44,140
interfaces maybe

710
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:48,539
checking the status of interfaces maybe

711
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:51,788
enable enabling messages for for that

712
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:54,160
and also starting to research

713
00:45:51,789 --> 00:45:57,400
investigate is what could be the

714
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,890
triggers that would make the the proxy a

715
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:01,839
command switch from one absolute

716
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,420
interface to the other so these are open

717
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:06,759
questions I will try to address in the

718
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,499
next version next slide please

719
00:46:06,759 --> 00:46:11,910
for the second choice that will be the

720
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:14,259
centralized control something like Sdn

721
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,609
basically what we would require is to

722
00:46:14,259 --> 00:46:17,890
have a centralized controller that is

723
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:19,930
able to instruct the proxy in order to

724
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,819
use one interface of the other based on

725
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:26,049
either on the subscriber or in the

726
00:46:21,819 --> 00:46:27,700
content or both so basically for that we

727
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:30,749
will require to define a kind of

728
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:33,009
interface in the proxy to for the

729
00:46:30,749 --> 00:46:38,229
permitting the controller to configure

730
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:40,180
the proxy for the for this election one

731
00:46:38,229 --> 00:46:41,970
benefit of this centralized view would

732
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:45,190
be that the controller could have a

733
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:47,379
centralized overview of all the the

734
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:49,329
proxies in the network and probably

735
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,400
coordinate all the mechanisms of

736
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:53,289
delivery instructing the proxies

737
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:56,769
accordingly in order to set up the

738
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:59,499
properties of not not at least but in

739
00:46:56,769 --> 00:47:03,640
order to identify what is that they

740
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:06,640
appropriate absol interface for for

741
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:08,558
delivering the traffic and this could be

742
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,999
done based on information about

743
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,579
congestion you should recall is shown

744
00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:14,109
etc so we could rely somehow also in

745
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:16,930
things like telemetry and so for having

746
00:47:14,109 --> 00:47:17,339
these these kind of decisions next slide

747
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,038
please

748
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:23,109
so regarding the next steps already has

749
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:24,160
to keep the analysis to keep working on

750
00:47:23,109 --> 00:47:26,200
the analysis without Maddie

751
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,629
configuration so understand what could

752
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:29,979
be the on stand train to figure out what

753
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:32,019
do with the scenary procedures for

754
00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:35,529
enabling this they are in the

755
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:37,149
centralized approach sorry

756
00:47:35,529 --> 00:47:38,950
trying to understand what would be the

757
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,869
implications on the interface that we

758
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:43,839
require for managing and controlling the

759
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:47,200
proxy and our idea will be to provide a

760
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:49,420
revised version of this draft before

761
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:53,169
next site even meeting and keep

762
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:55,300
discussing it is of interest for the for

763
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,340
the working group so any comment

764
00:47:55,300 --> 00:48:01,990
to provide he's more than welcome and

765
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:09,580
that's all for my say thank you any

766
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:11,319
questions okay very good so this is

767
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:14,529
still on the individual track right yet

768
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:16,990
I mean that is that was the yeah the

769
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:21,570
plan forward and it's gonna stay on that

770
00:48:16,990 --> 00:48:25,330
track well actually well actually the

771
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:29,620
the difficulties of this solution is

772
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:32,529
that we don't have automatic best

773
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,200
interface selection mechanism even in a

774
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:37,120
pinwheel out I think so but I'm not sure

775
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,640
so if some of you already know that

776
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:43,600
there is some good mechanism to detect

777
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:46,480
the let's say the interface that does

778
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:49,180
not have a good quality and different

779
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,600
interface that that has a good quality

780
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:55,359
for the same content then we can switch

781
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,370
back to the or we can just use that best

782
00:48:55,360 --> 00:48:59,350
interface or better interface but even

783
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:01,720
in a long tie itself

784
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:04,660
I don't know how we can get such kind of

785
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,779
decision so if there is such kind of

786
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:09,850
mechanism in Pimlott or whatever then we

787
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:12,790
can just add up the same way make a new

788
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:16,240
into this one so the our header equi is

789
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:18,610
actually the topic we service the

790
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:21,220
selection mechanism for our jpml the

791
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:23,920
proxy upstream interfaces it's something

792
00:49:21,220 --> 00:49:27,609
like a specific question our specific

793
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,820
topic but the discussion point or the

794
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:37,990
core question is actually really a

795
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:41,290
similar to the pin loudly so maybe so do

796
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,810
do some does some of you have some good

797
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:48,700
answer for that one

798
00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:51,759
so the heat today made some presentation

799
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:54,250
about Sdn I like situation maybe that is

800
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:57,340
more feasible yeah so controller knows

801
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,110
the quality and that's why he made a

802
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,990
presentation today it's actually he's

803
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:05,050
from operator so he has a great

804
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:07,450
knowledge about operators point of view

805
00:50:05,050 --> 00:50:11,750
so I'm not operator

806
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:15,339
his proposal mainly his proposal is with

807
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:17,900
Sdn like controller based solution if we

808
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:21,190
concentrate on that one

809
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:26,330
then maybe we may have a good chance to

810
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:28,370
provide a more complete solution for the

811
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:31,819
March perhaps 3-meter face selection

812
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:35,380
mechanism but for the pure distributed

813
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:38,650
mechanism like a ping lauter

814
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:42,970
autonomous routers so it's a really

815
00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:45,350
difficult to address this kind of issue

816
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:49,879
what do you think yeah that's a good

817
00:50:45,350 --> 00:50:52,610
point you have yeah so not sure how

818
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:54,680
relevant but I know this one

819
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:59,870
implementation that supports multiple

820
00:50:54,680 --> 00:51:01,940
interfaces that makes you so the well it

821
00:50:59,870 --> 00:51:05,750
means it's a team router to but it makes

822
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:09,170
use of the RPF interface to reverse the

823
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:12,110
RP address to towards GRP to determine

824
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:15,430
where to send a report so let's say you

825
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:18,500
have figure typical use case for this is

826
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:21,169
you have to pimp domains but you don't

827
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:24,920
want to run pin between them so you do

828
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:27,140
your P between the two pin domains but

829
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:29,990
the pim router dance downs the

830
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:32,690
downstream pim router what be configured

831
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:34,370
with two different IP addresses from two

832
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:38,150
different providers or something for

833
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:40,130
four different groups and and you might

834
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:42,140
use the RPF interface to figure out

835
00:51:40,130 --> 00:51:45,500
which provider like where should you set

836
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:47,960
the LGP report for which group that's

837
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,720
just one example oh there could be other

838
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:52,220
ways so you know koala matically

839
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:55,299
determining where to send the report

840
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:56,870
well for the pin router the router

841
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:59,990
logging protocol

842
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:03,710
depends on our lanai on the LPF mekinese

843
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:06,609
but for the proxy it doesn't we cannot

844
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:09,470
rely on our PF interface so this is a

845
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:12,440
biggest difference from the proxy and

846
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:14,209
router because Roxy doesn't have the

847
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:18,170
unicast routing table toward the source

848
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:20,720
right so currently the proxy only decide

849
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:22,100
one single interface he doesn't have any

850
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:25,580
outing protocol allowing proto

851
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:27,860
bandar-log in table itself so always

852
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,420
fixed us one single interface this is a

853
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:31,700
problem so we don't would like to

854
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:33,680
address this kind of a situation the

855
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:36,490
reason why I think are you already

856
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:38,870
remember that wise so why the proxy

857
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:41,149
doesn't allow the multiple upstream

858
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:43,730
interface because it's just for the

859
00:52:41,150 --> 00:52:45,950
simplicity reason so previously map in a

860
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,780
magma we discussed several time for this

861
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,939
kind of stopping but finally we decided

862
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:52,430
we should fix the single upstream router

863
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:54,920
and because proxy doesn't have any

864
00:52:52,430 --> 00:52:57,020
routing protocol routing table so we can

865
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,910
just fix the simple oxime router and

866
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,160
that previously thing is over 15 years

867
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:03,830
ago it's sufficient but now it's not

868
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:05,839
optional so that's why we want to have a

869
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,130
multi-core interface but again we don't

870
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:07,850
have a locking protocol we don't have a

871
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,670
loading table

872
00:53:07,850 --> 00:53:13,940
we cannot have this idea I hear you're

873
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:16,100
saying that but wouldn't the the proxy

874
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,930
often have a unicast routing table I

875
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,560
mean you want to be able to forward

876
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:24,529
únicos packets to the to the correct

877
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:28,400
upstream interface right yes but usually

878
00:53:24,530 --> 00:53:30,770
it assumed that the external outside

879
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,720
like a home net so downstream is

880
00:53:30,770 --> 00:53:36,290
something like home network the upstream

881
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:40,819
is a internet the internet so usually

882
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:42,830
the the downstream network segment is

883
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:46,220
something like a private network and

884
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:48,140
outside is external Internet but it

885
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:51,439
depends on the use case where it's a

886
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:57,400
home network or not but but least like

887
00:53:51,440 --> 00:54:00,470
for instance you know you might like

888
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:02,960
prefix of prefix delegation but but

889
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:05,330
basically there are cases where you

890
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,190
might have a route saying that for

891
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:11,090
certain prefixes always want to route

892
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:12,580
the traffic to a certain provider and if

893
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,800
you have something like that then

894
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:19,460
especially for SSM you you know it would

895
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:21,260
make sense to send s Komachi reports to

896
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:23,600
to that already had a route for the

897
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:26,360
source right in that case the question

898
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:28,790
is in that case the dethklok's eBooks

899
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:33,590
allows multiple upstream interface that

900
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:38,540
is not defined in the policy no

901
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:42,230
no but yeah there's a lot of different

902
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:43,580
use cases and scenarios and I know in

903
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,570
some cases you don't have any

904
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,540
information

905
00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:49,340
you basically just connected to two

906
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:54,590
providers you have a maybe a default

907
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:57,170
route for each and that's it mm-hmm so I

908
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:59,900
think the discussion so that draft

909
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:04,910
itself is really important and it's

910
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:07,540
really the lease and situation we need

911
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:09,680
this function but the problem is again

912
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:15,350
the solution may be a little bit

913
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:19,730
difficult except the situation using Sdn

914
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:23,600
are like them troller if we can just

915
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:25,820
concentrate Sdn based solution if

916
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:29,060
working besides maybe we can just

917
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:31,580
concentrate yeah depends what the

918
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:33,830
working group think is important but but

919
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:35,990
yeah I would say it's probably not a

920
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:41,440
good good idea to try to solve every

921
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:41,439
possible use case of non documents okay

922
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,460
okay

923
00:55:48,940 --> 00:56:05,620
pick your up again yeah see there's some

924
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:19,150
interesting formatting here we looked

925
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:23,440
fun in the PowerPoint okay so this is

926
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:25,570
motivated by some working in beer so in

927
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:30,640
the beer working group we are working on

928
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:32,680
love an IBM PR MLD overlay to signal

929
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:37,299
interest in receiving certain flows

930
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:40,839
across the beer the beer network what we

931
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:43,270
figure though is that we don't get all

932
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,220
the information we need there's some

933
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:48,220
beer specific information that would be

934
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:52,870
quite useful to to receive via the

935
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:56,740
Audion pure ml d report so we have this

936
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:58,540
this side you have in beer we have some

937
00:56:56,740 --> 00:57:00,310
other overlays like a pin overlay for

938
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,170
instance where we usage own attributes

939
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:05,680
that comes past this extra beer

940
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:08,170
information and we are looking for some

941
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:14,620
other way of doing this for a GMP or MLD

942
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:17,440
and what i came up with is there is this

943
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:19,359
additional data part in our MP ml d and

944
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:21,460
maybe we can use that to make an

945
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:24,700
extension and that's what this is about

946
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,650
so this sounds like it's gonna be all

947
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,109
beard but because we are responsible

948
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:32,050
responsible for our EMP and ml d in this

949
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:34,390
working group and it's kind of like a

950
00:57:32,050 --> 00:57:38,950
big change I think it's important to do

951
00:57:34,390 --> 00:57:41,170
it here so so this is beer specific but

952
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:46,390
it might be useful to have a generic way

953
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:52,630
of extending our GMP an ml d so let's

954
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:55,000
see yeah next slide so in our EMP

955
00:57:52,630 --> 00:57:57,550
version 3 and Emily were since you RFC's

956
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,640
there is this text about additional data

957
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:04,930
for both queries and reports

958
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,700
it basically says that if the message is

959
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,230
longer than expected there is some

960
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:08,799
additional data at the end of the

961
00:58:08,230 --> 00:58:11,230
message

962
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:13,270
you should check some everything but

963
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:17,110
usually otherwise they just ignore

964
00:58:13,270 --> 00:58:19,450
whatever is there so it means that if we

965
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:21,520
were to sum up with some extra date at

966
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:25,319
the end existing implementations would

967
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:31,390
just ignore it which is great

968
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:34,150
next slide so what I'm proposing in this

969
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:37,049
draft is that if you have an idea peer

970
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:41,050
MLD message like in this case an IP

971
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:42,880
version 3 query at the end there in blue

972
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:48,760
there is like an extension type and

973
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:50,710
extent extension value so you could say

974
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,630
if you don't support some kind of

975
00:58:50,710 --> 00:58:54,550
extension and you just ignore this

976
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:58,600
the current implementations would just

977
00:58:54,550 --> 00:59:01,090
ignore it but if we if we want to do an

978
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:04,299
extension and say you support a specific

979
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:07,840
extension type then you check what comes

980
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,580
after there and you might say why do we

981
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:11,470
need an extension type why don't why

982
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:14,770
don't they just put the beer data at the

983
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:17,020
end but just in case someone comes up

984
00:59:14,770 --> 00:59:19,060
within a few years so whatever with some

985
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:21,460
other reasons you extended your peer MLD

986
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:24,009
to be useful to have some type to

987
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:25,450
indicate what is this data and make sure

988
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:30,460
that that implementation doesn't

989
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:36,990
accidentally try to parse and think what

990
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:40,960
what is what is there next slide so

991
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:44,770
excuse me so even though I'm not

992
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:46,360
considering any other extensions I think

993
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:48,310
there's a chance at some point in time

994
00:59:46,360 --> 00:59:50,080
it might want some other extension and

995
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:54,220
that's why I want to have this accession

996
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:56,049
type there and the idea is current

997
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:00,399
implementations would completely ignore

998
00:59:56,050 --> 01:00:03,460
it based on the current RFC's if you

999
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,530
support the specific type in extension

1000
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:07,390
and fine you process it if you don't

1001
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:09,550
understand or don't support that type

1002
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:12,670
then you again just ignore it like you

1003
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:15,640
would do today for us

1004
01:00:12,670 --> 01:00:17,529
I haven't seen any bit trying to kind of

1005
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,629
distinguish between what I think you

1006
01:00:17,529 --> 01:00:22,180
want to do right now which is kind of

1007
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:23,349
ignore if you don't understand versus

1008
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:26,288
the sorry this is not

1009
01:00:23,349 --> 01:00:28,480
backward-compatible please panic if you

1010
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,170
don't understand it it's a narrow yeah

1011
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:31,930
right

1012
01:00:29,170 --> 01:00:34,440
so one thing is i don't want to require

1013
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:38,379
any changes to existing implementations

1014
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:40,869
but yeah if you support but I mean

1015
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:44,230
you're defining here watch what you do

1016
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:46,059
if you support extensions and then then

1017
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:47,650
something we could say is yeah if you

1018
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:50,349
see an extension type you don't

1019
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:53,200
understand them no it's it's it's it

1020
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:55,539
sure like I mean I I was just thinking

1021
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:57,189
that in the past we we had in other

1022
01:00:55,539 --> 01:00:59,049
protocols I'm trying to remember where

1023
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:01,299
this this thing and I don't have a good

1024
01:00:59,049 --> 01:01:03,910
example right now but there are people

1025
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:06,549
to consider that ya know certainly I

1026
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:09,549
mean depending on what that extension is

1027
01:01:06,549 --> 01:01:12,038
you know it could be that it completely

1028
01:01:09,549 --> 01:01:14,170
changes how we used the data and the

1029
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:15,910
message and if you just treat it as a

1030
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:26,109
normal message it could be bad

1031
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:29,319
somehow I'm not 100% sure but I giant

1032
01:01:26,109 --> 01:01:29,980
beaker he doesn't have a virgin number

1033
01:01:29,319 --> 01:01:33,130
field

1034
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:35,259
it's right yeah it's based on the length

1035
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:38,380
so they're right that's it right right

1036
01:01:35,259 --> 01:01:41,470
so currently hostile just recognize the

1037
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:46,839
size of the Curie message and then the

1038
01:01:41,470 --> 01:01:49,450
some let's say 100 this is gesture for

1039
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:54,190
example 100 bytes shirley is like a

1040
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:58,569
virgin one 120 32 130 is version 3 like

1041
01:01:54,190 --> 01:02:03,339
this yes yes if you just add the query

1042
01:01:58,569 --> 01:02:06,460
message and it changes the length there

1043
01:02:03,339 --> 01:02:10,000
are the clear message you may fail if we

1044
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:12,339
have the RGB version food right so yeah

1045
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:17,430
let me comment on that so at least the

1046
01:02:12,339 --> 01:02:21,220
way it's defined now is RGB version 2 is

1047
01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:23,379
28 bytes maybe I'm not sure now it is a

1048
01:02:21,220 --> 01:02:25,959
certain size and if the message is

1049
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:26,500
larger than that size then it's supposed

1050
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,130
to be

1051
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:33,580
sergeant Pearson three right partly

1052
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:35,920
because at least for like a specific

1053
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:40,210
query you know it that the length is

1054
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:43,420
variable as well for version 3 so so

1055
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:44,590
it's not always a fixed size but I get

1056
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:46,930
your point

1057
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:49,300
if we were to ever define Olympia worse

1058
01:02:46,930 --> 01:02:51,250
than 4 we would need maybe some other

1059
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:55,240
tricks than just the length to decide

1060
01:02:51,250 --> 01:02:57,820
which which worse than this okay it's

1061
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:00,669
something I'll look into that but yeah I

1062
01:02:57,820 --> 01:03:03,370
believe it should be whether it's the

1063
01:03:00,670 --> 01:03:06,220
minimum size or longer I and that this

1064
01:03:03,370 --> 01:03:11,920
is the Terminator okay I'll look into

1065
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:14,379
that so about this extension types so

1066
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:17,650
yeah I was saying how he would ignore it

1067
01:03:14,380 --> 01:03:22,090
if you don't support it and stuff also

1068
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:24,460
would say though yeah mostly in general

1069
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,230
it will be a non-starter to try to make

1070
01:03:24,460 --> 01:03:28,570
changes to IGMP queries and reports

1071
01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:31,270
because just millions some

1072
01:03:28,570 --> 01:03:34,600
implementations or deployments out there

1073
01:03:31,270 --> 01:03:36,580
and they wouldn't change but if there's

1074
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,520
some extensions like in this case it's

1075
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:42,150
beer specific then you know it might be

1076
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:45,400
doable to expect at least those

1077
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,140
implementations to change or there are

1078
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:54,490
no implementations yet so that is

1079
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:57,879
helpful as well okay next slide so so

1080
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:59,979
that was about a generic part and then

1081
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,990
there is this specific beer extension

1082
01:03:59,980 --> 01:04:04,120
I'll do this a little bit more quickly

1083
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:07,629
it was presented in beer earlier today

1084
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:09,370
as well but the main thing is the

1085
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:12,700
purpose so this extension is to identify

1086
01:04:09,370 --> 01:04:15,400
who sent the message for beer we would

1087
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:18,490
like to know the subdomain that beer

1088
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:22,330
prefix and the B Friday like the beer I

1089
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:24,819
D or the sender so we could potentially

1090
01:04:22,330 --> 01:04:28,060
have used the the source address so the

1091
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:31,710
EMP or ml d message but we would prefer

1092
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:34,380
to have all this information specified

1093
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:37,710
and what I'm saying in this other graph

1094
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:39,240
did not be working group is that that

1095
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:42,030
mentioned on the top there is that you

1096
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:44,430
should always use this extension so we

1097
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:47,070
can know who it came from it's mostly

1098
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:49,140
useful for reports but it could be

1099
01:04:47,070 --> 01:04:53,849
useful for queries as well if you want

1100
01:04:49,140 --> 01:04:57,839
to do some logging or something ok next

1101
01:04:53,849 --> 01:04:59,400
slide and this is what the extension

1102
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:01,859
would look like so you would have your

1103
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,050
normal id Imperium LD message and then

1104
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:06,240
this will come at the bottom with some

1105
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:09,270
extension type assigned by iana and then

1106
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:12,779
the content itself next slide please

1107
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:18,390
if there is one no no okay

1108
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:20,700
so so one question is is it a good idea

1109
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:24,270
to define a generic way of extending

1110
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:27,509
this I would say if you do though you

1111
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:29,880
know we should create a registry and we

1112
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:31,859
set the requirements for creating a new

1113
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,290
extension it should be something that is

1114
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:39,119
strict we don't want people to come up

1115
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:43,349
with lots of different extensions and in

1116
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:45,839
this case for beer I'm at least the way

1117
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:48,089
I'm arguing it is it would only be used

1118
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:51,109
must only be used when you encapsulate

1119
01:05:48,089 --> 01:05:54,560
an attempt you MLD message inside beer

1120
01:05:51,109 --> 01:05:57,240
so it would not be seen by non beer

1121
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:59,099
implementations if they do it though

1122
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:03,000
accidentally see if they were just

1123
01:05:59,099 --> 01:06:04,890
ignore the extra data and the good thing

1124
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:07,640
in this case it's only support need to

1125
01:06:04,890 --> 01:06:11,390
be supported by the beer routers that

1126
01:06:07,640 --> 01:06:13,980
originates or receive these messages and

1127
01:06:11,390 --> 01:06:16,020
there's no implementations today really

1128
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:20,849
so it's not like we need to upgrade a

1129
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:22,680
lot of implementations from Cisco so

1130
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:26,099
question is more for the whole working

1131
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:27,899
group instead of only you so so this

1132
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:30,660
extends and I know that with beer

1133
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:33,119
definitely it adds a lot of value but

1134
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,640
are we expecting more of these kind of

1135
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,950
use cases if some host or some

1136
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:41,609
application who is using IGMP and wants

1137
01:06:37,950 --> 01:06:44,120
to add some extra context about join

1138
01:06:41,609 --> 01:06:45,799
membership requests it's

1139
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,109
in future I mean I said today all the

1140
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,540
hosts they work either in v2 or v3 mode

1141
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:52,790
is it's more of stuck

1142
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:55,730
it's stagnant that we don't we don't do

1143
01:06:52,790 --> 01:06:57,680
anything else in IGMP as of now but when

1144
01:06:55,730 --> 01:07:01,580
we are opening this channel so is it

1145
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:03,319
good it is bad how it is it might add a

1146
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:05,600
lot of value as well if there are some

1147
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:08,120
new application coming they might want

1148
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:10,490
to add some extra content or extra

1149
01:07:08,120 --> 01:07:16,549
context about what they expect from

1150
01:07:10,490 --> 01:07:18,770
upstream Wouter yeah yeah I mean I think

1151
01:07:16,550 --> 01:07:20,450
yeah I think I know you were us in the

1152
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:22,130
group and happy to hear what others

1153
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:26,930
think but yeah I think there could

1154
01:07:22,130 --> 01:07:28,760
potentially be some use cases and well

1155
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,850
filo we you know in this working we

1156
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:36,530
should be in control of what use cases

1157
01:07:31,850 --> 01:07:38,210
get sterilized so what extensions so if

1158
01:07:36,530 --> 01:07:39,830
someone has a use case we should

1159
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:43,850
consider it here and see whether it

1160
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:46,910
makes sense but yeah you could imagine

1161
01:07:43,850 --> 01:07:48,470
for certain cases that maybe some host

1162
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:51,230
implementation for instance was

1163
01:07:48,470 --> 01:07:54,500
announced to support something new the

1164
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:58,720
thing now is you can't expect devices in

1165
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:58,720
general to support new extensions I

1166
01:07:58,990 --> 01:08:02,839
don't know if we could also be some

1167
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,330
interesting things to think about

1168
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:07,580
related to like sleeping and proxying

1169
01:08:05,330 --> 01:08:09,500
and stuff and what happens if some

1170
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:12,259
support and extension and always do nots

1171
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:15,020
and in the beer case at least it's

1172
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:18,800
encapsulated and there's no no LTE

1173
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,750
devices on the path so that's good

1174
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,230
one question I have for the working

1175
01:08:20,750 --> 01:08:28,160
group is well one is is it okay to

1176
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:30,529
extend our Jim PNM LD if we do is this

1177
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:35,960
scheme reasonable with this extension

1178
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:37,130
type another question is I'm trying to

1179
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,839
figure out what should we do in this

1180
01:08:37,130 --> 01:08:40,220
group I what should we do in beer and

1181
01:08:38,839 --> 01:08:43,760
there was some discussion about that in

1182
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:45,500
beer this morning too so I feel like the

1183
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,170
extension mechanism itself should

1184
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:51,950
definitely be done in this working group

1185
01:08:47,170 --> 01:08:54,830
but the actual beer TLV that you see

1186
01:08:51,950 --> 01:08:56,689
here that could potentially be done in

1187
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:59,319
the beer working group depending on what

1188
01:08:56,689 --> 01:08:59,319
people think

1189
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:05,000
mom come not from it Cisco so I think

1190
01:09:02,420 --> 01:09:07,609
yeah you clearly mentioned that this

1191
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:09,410
part of the work can go to be a working

1192
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:12,559
group and I really feel that I am

1193
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:15,139
extension defining a new and you might

1194
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:17,960
be good there might be new use cases

1195
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:20,060
coming in future from multicast and host

1196
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:21,200
might not be just hosts what they are

1197
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,760
today they might be some kind of

1198
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:25,609
application which can do much more than

1199
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:28,010
just doing a jumpin so yeah it would it

1200
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:35,469
would it would open new opportunities

1201
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:39,530
there to do something yeah yeah okay so

1202
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:42,170
yeah that's an offer I'm curious whether

1203
01:09:39,529 --> 01:09:46,009
you know this can be adopted or what

1204
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:52,790
interest rates and they group or okay so

1205
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:54,340
who who's read this draft of those two

1206
01:09:52,790 --> 01:09:58,190
hands do you think it's ready to be

1207
01:09:54,340 --> 01:10:00,050
adopted by the yeah okay so obviously we

1208
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:04,219
need to ask the same question in the

1209
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:06,500
list but yeah so yes some other way in

1210
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:08,870
in beer working with we have this

1211
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:11,630
overlay draft that has its adopted that

1212
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:14,420
has been around for a long time and to

1213
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:15,350
progress that it would be good to get

1214
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:19,580
this done

1215
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:21,740
sorta quickly if we can I mean I may

1216
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,809
have been confused but its own is if you

1217
01:10:21,740 --> 01:10:25,790
mention in beer something like it was

1218
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:28,010
first onion work one working group or

1219
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:30,530
some other document had first been done

1220
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:32,570
in on working group and then thrown over

1221
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:35,059
the fence was they actually something

1222
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:40,299
like that because as long as we don't

1223
01:10:35,060 --> 01:10:43,070
find another example then the beer one

1224
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:46,040
it might be better to kind of bring it

1225
01:10:43,070 --> 01:10:47,330
into good shape and beer first alright

1226
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:49,040
so I think that's that's a little bit

1227
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:52,160
what I what I'm worried about that you

1228
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:54,380
know how do we verify that this is in

1229
01:10:52,160 --> 01:11:02,930
good shape without another example that

1230
01:10:54,380 --> 01:11:05,900
that's best done in beer right so yeah I

1231
01:11:02,930 --> 01:11:09,500
mean if you ask me as some

1232
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:12,429
offer or whatever I mean I'm also

1233
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:14,719
working on that Amidala drafted beer I

1234
01:11:12,429 --> 01:11:17,510
feel like it makes sense to do this

1235
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:20,270
option in beer actually and and you know

1236
01:11:17,510 --> 01:11:21,920
there's been like tlvs for our GPS and

1237
01:11:20,270 --> 01:11:24,560
so on to that were defined in beer

1238
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:27,050
because the actual use case of the

1239
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,480
option how it is handled what you put in

1240
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:34,790
there and so on that's all beer

1241
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:39,290
specifics so my current thinking now if

1242
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:41,210
you guys agree is view this the

1243
01:11:39,290 --> 01:11:44,840
definition of this actual option into

1244
01:11:41,210 --> 01:11:47,030
the MLD overlay drafted beer which is an

1245
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:50,390
existing working with document in beer

1246
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:52,880
and just focus on the extension scheme

1247
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:55,010
and the registry and their rationale for

1248
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:56,900
having extensions in general in this

1249
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:58,850
group I think I think it would be good

1250
01:11:56,900 --> 01:12:02,989
to have a second example right I mean

1251
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:04,670
just even if just yeah even if we don't

1252
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:07,040
want to standardize it just you know is

1253
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:09,409
there any way for us to to better vet

1254
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:11,150
the idea of extensibility so what would

1255
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:13,519
shake one example alright so one thing I

1256
01:12:11,150 --> 01:12:16,610
know is I think some people have been

1257
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:20,840
suggesting putting like me and I or Ian

1258
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:22,730
ID or something into what is that like

1259
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,280
you know for me excellent whatever so

1260
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:27,110
you can know the context or some context

1261
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:30,019
identify in general if you have like

1262
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:32,570
births as well well I mean Greg is

1263
01:12:30,020 --> 01:12:34,280
sleeping so I mean either the obvious

1264
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:36,860
idea coming to mind which would be the

1265
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:41,000
same would be something like if you do

1266
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:42,860
it that for rsvp-te or so if you want to

1267
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,239
build a point-to-multipoint tree would

1268
01:12:42,860 --> 01:12:45,860
that have something like similar

1269
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:48,739
properties because you need to know the

1270
01:12:45,860 --> 01:12:50,599
leaf some specific identifiers not that

1271
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:52,339
I would want to do it right but yeah

1272
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:54,409
just that we kind of vet the

1273
01:12:52,340 --> 01:12:56,360
extensibility somehow yeah another thing

1274
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:58,670
there's been a proposal in this working

1275
01:12:56,360 --> 01:13:00,980
group for reliable IGMP or saying that

1276
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:02,210
you said an AK or something so for

1277
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:04,480
instance you know you could have an

1278
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:07,280
extension in our GMP queries saying I

1279
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:11,150
support a core please sit on a core

1280
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:13,159
whatever or yeah I Cisco so I think I

1281
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:14,809
good steak actually got he's taking a

1282
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:17,030
right approach here that's a there's

1283
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:19,080
undefined space now that you can use but

1284
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:20,670
you cannot use it once for beer right

1285
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:22,530
you have to put his steel research in

1286
01:13:20,670 --> 01:13:23,160
place so other features can be added

1287
01:13:22,530 --> 01:13:25,950
later

1288
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,570
so splitting that into drafts want to

1289
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:29,460
define that you have a structure and one

1290
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:31,410
in beer as a use case I think that's

1291
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:33,350
perfectly enough to do this right you

1292
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:35,639
don't need to another use case I think

1293
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:37,980
yeah I should also say at least my

1294
01:13:35,640 --> 01:13:40,110
thinking is I don't want to go overboard

1295
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:42,450
I mean in theory we could define some

1296
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:44,280
kind of a GMP options like how options

1297
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:46,980
we could add like lots of theories and

1298
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:49,740
so on but I'm intentionally thinking

1299
01:13:46,980 --> 01:13:50,400
it's best to keep it as simple as

1300
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,070
possible

1301
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:55,589
all I want is this identifier to just

1302
01:13:53,070 --> 01:13:59,719
make sure that it doesn't conflict with

1303
01:13:55,590 --> 01:14:02,160
other possible extensions in the future

1304
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:03,870
maybe maybe I wasn't expressing myself

1305
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:06,900
while I'm certain I'm not saying that

1306
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:09,390
the document itself should have a text

1307
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:11,309
about additional examples it was just

1308
01:14:09,390 --> 01:14:14,340
kind of if we had a discussion just in

1309
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,870
terms of okay you know each of us thinks

1310
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:18,000
about something and then we feel more

1311
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:20,610
safe that you know it will work for

1312
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,730
extension right so that's great and I

1313
01:14:20,610 --> 01:14:27,900
certainly be happy to hear from from

1314
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:39,410
people will yeah yeah that sounds good

1315
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:45,559
okay okay so yeah sounds good thanks so

1316
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:45,559
there's up next while you're coming up

1317
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,620
just to confirm with the working group

1318
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:56,070
we've had an understanding with the

1319
01:14:51,620 --> 01:15:00,930
spring working group that they are not

1320
01:14:56,070 --> 01:15:02,639
chartered to work on multicast related

1321
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:04,320
type stuff in the spring working group

1322
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,610
there's been a little bit of question

1323
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,830
recently because they had something

1324
01:15:05,610 --> 01:15:09,690
added to their Charter and so people

1325
01:15:07,830 --> 01:15:11,370
were kind of curious if that was the

1326
01:15:09,690 --> 01:15:12,599
case so this is Ian and I had a

1327
01:15:11,370 --> 01:15:16,410
conversation about this earlier so just

1328
01:15:12,600 --> 01:15:20,400
an hour ago in the the ad the spring

1329
01:15:16,410 --> 01:15:22,680
eighties and and chairs agreed that

1330
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:25,500
spring is indeed not chartered to work

1331
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:30,180
on that type of work that they expect it

1332
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:32,909
to be done here in pym and if we need

1333
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:37,020
their help or get their feedback and

1334
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:39,449
you should we should do so we were under

1335
01:15:37,020 --> 01:15:41,130
this understanding that we could always

1336
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:43,230
put things back to them if we need to

1337
01:15:41,130 --> 01:15:45,360
but it sounds like there's not any plan

1338
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:47,209
for that to even anytime soon to take

1339
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,290
place there's not gonna be any change so

1340
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:51,510
does anybody have any questions or

1341
01:15:49,290 --> 01:15:53,730
comments on that before hooman goes that

1342
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:56,610
that's our understanding so if we were

1343
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:58,349
to adopt we were certainly free to adopt

1344
01:15:56,610 --> 01:16:05,580
these kind of drafts is what I is what

1345
01:15:58,350 --> 01:16:07,290
our point is yeah also I think hopefully

1346
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,019
we'll mention this as part of your

1347
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:12,780
presentation so there is this one draft

1348
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:15,330
being considered for adoption and spring

1349
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:18,809
that is like a replication option or

1350
01:16:15,330 --> 01:16:21,420
something but this is kind of going

1351
01:16:18,810 --> 01:16:24,630
further with with that so so this small

1352
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:31,230
part might be done in screen we might

1353
01:16:24,630 --> 01:16:44,190
consider yeah exactly maybe if you can

1354
01:16:31,230 --> 01:16:47,519
bring up this slide so oh yes yeah so if

1355
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:50,549
you can't go to the next slide but let

1356
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:54,380
me let me start from a score one what

1357
01:16:50,550 --> 01:16:57,330
what this graph is trying to achieve so

1358
01:16:54,380 --> 01:17:00,780
currently when it comes to the transport

1359
01:16:57,330 --> 01:17:03,929
and mainly in in 5g and some of these

1360
01:17:00,780 --> 01:17:06,330
converge course signal routing is

1361
01:17:03,929 --> 01:17:08,940
playing a big role when it comes to

1362
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:11,480
traffic engineering slicing you guys

1363
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:13,830
heard about a slicing at lunchtime

1364
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,239
segment routing is eight and that's

1365
01:17:13,830 --> 01:17:17,820
because of the controller has the view

1366
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:21,178
of the entire network it simplifies the

1367
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:24,719
overlay it simplifies the underlay it

1368
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:26,100
actually signals the MPLS labels via IGP

1369
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,760
and all those good stuff that you guys

1370
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:32,489
know so the issue becomes that when we

1371
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,440
go to providers and we try to sell them

1372
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:36,718
sigma routing if they have any multicast

1373
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,259
type of services that is running

1374
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:42,719
currently NL DP or point-to-multipoint

1375
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:45,510
rsvp-te and the question becomes i want

1376
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:48,660
to say in MPLS type of

1377
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:51,240
transport but now I have all these MPLS

1378
01:17:48,660 --> 01:17:54,750
signaling that I removed from unicast

1379
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:57,660
what should I do and this is where this

1380
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:59,670
draft and this idea comes into play

1381
01:17:57,660 --> 01:18:02,220
so basically when it comes to the

1382
01:17:59,670 --> 01:18:05,160
transport it's the same transport that

1383
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:07,940
we have today in MPLS it's just an

1384
01:18:05,160 --> 01:18:10,050
incoming label outgoing interfaces and

1385
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:14,009
outgoing labels so there's nothing

1386
01:18:10,050 --> 01:18:17,460
changed on the data path of the MPLS

1387
01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:21,750
it's just how we nailed down the

1388
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:24,890
point-to-multipoint tree this idea says

1389
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:27,150
let's use the controller to nail it down

1390
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:30,060
previously we were using signaling like

1391
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:32,879
LVP and rsvp-te so that's the only part

1392
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:36,060
that this draft is trying to resolve

1393
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:40,950
it's trying to simplify multicast remove

1394
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:43,170
some of the current legacy and I used

1395
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:45,090
that term careful in Legacy multi called

1396
01:18:43,170 --> 01:18:49,670
multicast protocols and moving to the

1397
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:49,670
Sdn controller if you can go to the next

1398
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:57,980
so here's a brief a story how it started

1399
01:18:54,840 --> 01:19:01,140
I think my previous explanation kind of

1400
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:04,650
explaining you know what was the theme

1401
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:09,300
behind this idea now we have started

1402
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:12,480
introducing a draft in is free spring

1403
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,890
source routing multicast every single

1404
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,540
node you have a state and you need to

1405
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:18,000
make a decision at every single node on

1406
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:19,710
transit or even on the leaf so it's not

1407
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,750
so much of a source routing when it

1408
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:26,580
comes to the multicast and that's where

1409
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:29,160
they become a little bit of what's the

1410
01:19:26,580 --> 01:19:31,530
right border clash maybe not on what's

1411
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:33,090
the right word to use here in the spring

1412
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:35,219
Charter saying that this is not source

1413
01:19:33,090 --> 01:19:38,640
routing because every single router has

1414
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:42,480
to make a decision and this is why we

1415
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:44,850
introduced one draft in this spring

1416
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,709
it's a replication segment I'll explain

1417
01:19:44,850 --> 01:19:48,780
later on what the application

1418
01:19:45,710 --> 01:19:50,970
replication segment is but the bulk of

1419
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:53,190
the work which is the point to

1420
01:19:50,970 --> 01:19:56,370
multi-point policy how the whole thing

1421
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:58,620
works we decided to bring it into the

1422
01:19:56,370 --> 01:20:00,150
pane just

1423
01:19:58,620 --> 01:20:02,490
we felt like you know there is more

1424
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:05,219
multicast expertise here and you know

1425
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:07,950
they can address this point multi-point

1426
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:11,820
three better in NP mattered in in

1427
01:20:07,950 --> 01:20:14,670
signaling so this is how the

1428
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:17,309
architectural Draft has been a slice and

1429
01:20:14,670 --> 01:20:20,550
dice as of now there is one a small

1430
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:22,320
graph in segment routing in a spring the

1431
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:25,530
reason that we put it there at the end

1432
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:29,160
of the day this draft talks about seats

1433
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:31,290
it talks about policies and a little bit

1434
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:33,480
of signal routing so we needed to have

1435
01:20:31,290 --> 01:20:35,670
something there but then as you will see

1436
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:37,290
in the next slides the entire idea is a

1437
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:40,170
point-to-multipoint three and and the

1438
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:42,540
bigger architectural draft is is gonna

1439
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:45,270
be we are hoping that is going to be

1440
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:49,980
worked on in this working so next slide

1441
01:20:45,270 --> 01:20:51,990
please so here are some other relevant

1442
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:54,150
draft do you guys can go through it so

1443
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:56,910
the entire idea is T there is to

1444
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:58,650
architectural draft the PMS our

1445
01:20:56,910 --> 01:21:00,330
point-to-multipoint policy which we're

1446
01:20:58,650 --> 01:21:03,450
gonna explain here the replication

1447
01:21:00,330 --> 01:21:06,000
segment it's a very a small subset of

1448
01:21:03,450 --> 01:21:07,740
the point-to-multipoint policy so the

1449
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,520
point-to-multipoint policy actually

1450
01:21:07,740 --> 01:21:14,160
covers the replication segments and and

1451
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:16,920
the bigger picture and then there is a

1452
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:18,269
yang draft which we put in the spring as

1453
01:21:16,920 --> 01:21:20,670
of now to you I don't know whatever you

1454
01:21:18,270 --> 01:21:22,830
need to bring that into the PM or not we

1455
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:25,050
can discuss that but if you look at the

1456
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:28,470
yang it kind of explain how their

1457
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:30,720
architecture is it gives you a good

1458
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:32,460
overview of what this whole idea is all

1459
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:35,630
about and then we need to have

1460
01:21:32,460 --> 01:21:35,630
southbound and northbound

1461
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:41,010
I guess communication between the router

1462
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:44,550
and the controller and that's where the

1463
01:21:41,010 --> 01:21:47,040
two last draft is there's a PCE draft

1464
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:49,760
that actually takes care of a Southdown

1465
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:53,070
and also there is acknowledgment a

1466
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:55,890
northbound from the node to the to the

1467
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:58,860
controller and then obviously the sexy

1468
01:21:55,890 --> 01:22:00,780
one is IDR point-to-multipoint policy

1469
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:03,870
for pgps RTS

1470
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:05,190
that's another way to actually program

1471
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:07,559
this screen so there's two way of

1472
01:22:05,190 --> 01:22:10,200
programming the tree depending on the

1473
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,360
operator they can either choose PCE or

1474
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:16,260
they can choose point to multiple

1475
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:24,000
and as our bgp depending on what they

1476
01:22:16,260 --> 01:22:25,590
were so next slide so maybe we can for

1477
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:27,540
the sake of time go through the next few

1478
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:29,510
slides like you can skip the next slide

1479
01:22:27,540 --> 01:22:32,460
and go to the one with a pretty picture

1480
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:35,460
usually pictures explain much much

1481
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:36,960
better so here's a the entire

1482
01:22:35,460 --> 01:22:41,190
architecture of point-to-multipoint

1483
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:44,910
policy so on the route there is a policy

1484
01:22:41,190 --> 01:22:47,280
that actually displays the the root node

1485
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:49,290
and the leaf node so you go under decree

1486
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,330
the point of multiplying policy you say

1487
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:53,910
what are the Leafs how you learn the

1488
01:22:51,330 --> 01:22:56,250
Leafs it could be manually configured on

1489
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:59,580
the controller or you could actually

1490
01:22:56,250 --> 01:23:04,200
have the controller listening to the NP

1491
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:06,290
bgp bgp multi-protocol communication

1492
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:10,830
that is going between the route and

1493
01:23:06,290 --> 01:23:14,370
between the Pease and learn the Leafs

1494
01:23:10,830 --> 01:23:15,390
weird about that communication so that's

1495
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:17,760
how you build your point-to-multipoint

1496
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:20,730
policy their route builds up the

1497
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:23,130
point-to-multipoint policy it uses P SEP

1498
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:25,110
as of now to shoot all that information

1499
01:23:23,130 --> 01:23:27,720
to the controller so the controller then

1500
01:23:25,110 --> 01:23:30,690
understands where the route is where the

1501
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:32,760
Leafs are and because it has the view of

1502
01:23:30,690 --> 01:23:35,790
the entire network it can create a

1503
01:23:32,760 --> 01:23:38,280
point-to-multipoint tree and download it

1504
01:23:35,790 --> 01:23:41,280
to the routers now there are a couple of

1505
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:43,800
ideas here and the first one is a

1506
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,870
candidate path so these ideas are not

1507
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:49,290
new to this graph like a candidate pad

1508
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:51,059
if you look at the SR policy unicast our

1509
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:53,760
policy all these ideas are already there

1510
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:56,840
we are just using them so a candidate

1511
01:23:53,760 --> 01:24:00,240
path within a point-to-multipoint policy

1512
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:01,790
simple term is LSP redundancy so under

1513
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:05,400
that policy could create multiple

1514
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:07,500
point-to-multipoint LSPs and they can be

1515
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:09,360
redundant based on the preference the

1516
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,940
one with the highest preference is the

1517
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:14,490
active point-to-multipoint tree now each

1518
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:17,219
one of those cat candidate pads you can

1519
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:19,349
optimize them globally so there is fast

1520
01:24:17,220 --> 01:24:20,880
reroute concept here let's say one of

1521
01:24:19,350 --> 01:24:23,670
those candidate paths because of a

1522
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,740
failure goes into a fast reroute you can

1523
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:26,640
optimize it globally and that's where

1524
01:24:25,740 --> 01:24:29,070
the ins

1525
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:32,790
ideas come into play so each candidate

1526
01:24:29,070 --> 01:24:35,759
pad can have two point-to-multipoint LSP

1527
01:24:32,790 --> 01:24:38,460
instances and those are actually used

1528
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:41,640
for global optimization and make before

1529
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:44,030
break on the root note so if one of

1530
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:46,950
those instances is doing a fast reroute

1531
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:52,050
the controller can compute a brand-new

1532
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:53,780
tree with with the SLA s that are in the

1533
01:24:52,050 --> 01:24:56,010
laser that are relevant to that

1534
01:24:53,780 --> 01:24:57,660
multicast path and download the second

1535
01:24:56,010 --> 01:25:00,450
instance and on the head end you can do

1536
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:01,430
a make before a break between one to the

1537
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:04,440
other

1538
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:06,360
now the trick is the point-to-multipoint

1539
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,950
policy doesn't have any forwarding

1540
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,019
information and that's where the

1541
01:25:07,950 --> 01:25:14,070
replication policies come in

1542
01:25:10,020 --> 01:25:18,240
so the replication of policy maker long

1543
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:21,860
is very short it's really impaired less

1544
01:25:18,240 --> 01:25:25,160
as of now instruction incoming label

1545
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:27,599
outgoing labels that's it that's all

1546
01:25:25,160 --> 01:25:29,460
there are some tricks that you got to

1547
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:34,290
keep in mind as an example in this

1548
01:25:29,460 --> 01:25:37,760
diagram node a and node C are connected

1549
01:25:34,290 --> 01:25:40,440
via node B but not being is not

1550
01:25:37,760 --> 01:25:42,600
multicast ever it doesn't understand

1551
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,269
multicast so you can actually connect

1552
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:49,620
node a to node C which both have

1553
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:52,440
replications segments via a unique SSR

1554
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:55,530
so you can stack up labels if you are

1555
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:57,660
going to a unique ass domain but as soon

1556
01:25:55,530 --> 01:26:01,650
as you get to a multicast domain and you

1557
01:25:57,660 --> 01:26:04,280
need to do a multicast replication you

1558
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:07,500
need to have the replication policy and

1559
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:10,590
you need to be having an incoming label

1560
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:13,850
and your outgoing interfaces so this is

1561
01:26:10,590 --> 01:26:16,020
the the very high-level idea of this

1562
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:18,800
draft next slide please

1563
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:23,370
so I put a couple of examples together

1564
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:26,520
just for like a case study so in this

1565
01:26:23,370 --> 01:26:29,190
case we have a route that is on North a

1566
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:32,070
and we have two leaves which is T and E

1567
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:35,190
so what will happen is that if there's n

1568
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:39,240
P BGP going on between piece between a T

1569
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:40,099
and E a we learned that router D and

1570
01:26:39,240 --> 01:26:43,130
router

1571
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:44,870
or actually beliefs it's gonna send that

1572
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:46,430
information to the controller the

1573
01:26:44,870 --> 01:26:47,599
controller will create a

1574
01:26:46,430 --> 01:26:50,660
point-to-multipoint

1575
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,690
policy with those information and it's

1576
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:55,250
going to note the tree ID and it

1577
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:58,250
multicasts tree needs to have a

1578
01:26:55,250 --> 01:27:01,580
identifier and that identifier is a tree

1579
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:04,010
ID it builds a candidate that gives the

1580
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:09,080
preference of 1,000 as an example to the

1581
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:13,220
candidate path it goes to note a C D and

1582
01:27:09,080 --> 01:27:16,700
E it creates the replication segments

1583
01:27:13,220 --> 01:27:20,630
and all these nodes that said sorry

1584
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:23,780
it goes on node a C D and E because b is

1585
01:27:20,630 --> 01:27:28,070
not multicast ver that said when it goes

1586
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:32,780
on note a it creates a seat list that

1587
01:27:28,070 --> 01:27:36,500
says push B which is the unicast C and

1588
01:27:32,780 --> 01:27:38,990
then push C which is a multicast

1589
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:41,660
replication C so in this case if the

1590
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:44,990
packet comes in on a is actually going

1591
01:27:41,660 --> 01:27:47,360
to push be on top of the stack see at

1592
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:50,719
the bottom of the stack the packet goes

1593
01:27:47,360 --> 01:27:55,190
to B B just does normal segment routing

1594
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:57,080
pops the label forwards it to C which is

1595
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:59,299
a replication segment and the

1596
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:02,000
replication segment gonna say that your

1597
01:27:59,300 --> 01:28:03,920
outgoing interfaces are DNA and here the

1598
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,390
labels that you need to use to shoot the

1599
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:10,730
packet is the forwarding state with this

1600
01:28:08,390 --> 01:28:14,090
replication sit effectively the same

1601
01:28:10,730 --> 01:28:17,059
what I have an N LD p or rsvp-te kind of

1602
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:19,520
if I'm using SR MPLS I got one incoming

1603
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:22,340
label look that up get a list of

1604
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,530
outgoing labels the other absolutely so

1605
01:28:22,340 --> 01:28:28,430
why do we need to reinterpret this in

1606
01:28:24,530 --> 01:28:30,259
the SR terminology so that's that was my

1607
01:28:28,430 --> 01:28:33,170
first friend right off the bat when it

1608
01:28:30,260 --> 01:28:35,930
comes to the data path it is the same

1609
01:28:33,170 --> 01:28:40,790
it's just that because of the controller

1610
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:43,040
each router gonna have a segment and

1611
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:45,050
this is this is all just terminology

1612
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:47,210
right I mean I could simply have MPLS

1613
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:49,580
terminology for the same thing but what

1614
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:51,290
is what is Sigma routing it's MPLS so

1615
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:53,570
like if you look at UNICAMP nice it's

1616
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:55,159
have F some slightly you know

1617
01:28:53,570 --> 01:28:57,949
more abstraction right the fact that

1618
01:28:55,159 --> 01:29:00,409
you're heading on a per hop basis on

1619
01:28:57,949 --> 01:29:02,449
seats that are forwarded by that are not

1620
01:29:00,409 --> 01:29:03,860
local sit but global sits right on every

1621
01:29:02,449 --> 01:29:05,690
forwarding hope you're changing the

1622
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:08,030
offset that's the key difference you're

1623
01:29:05,690 --> 01:29:11,299
not using this year I think right so so

1624
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:13,219
on there is traffic engineering involved

1625
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:16,730
here because of the controller has the

1626
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:19,849
whole view of the of the network we are

1627
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:22,968
not in the mercy of IGP so the

1628
01:29:19,849 --> 01:29:25,670
controller can create a tree through the

1629
01:29:22,969 --> 01:29:28,790
network for that's for the district you

1630
01:29:25,670 --> 01:29:30,440
can create different and slices through

1631
01:29:28,790 --> 01:29:31,940
the network for the same

1632
01:29:30,440 --> 01:29:34,219
point-to-multipoint policy no I

1633
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:36,138
understand that all I'm saying is that

1634
01:29:34,219 --> 01:29:38,869
I'm not persuaded they're trying to

1635
01:29:36,139 --> 01:29:41,030
apply the city terminology to what the

1636
01:29:38,869 --> 01:29:42,949
forwarding plane is doing is the correct

1637
01:29:41,030 --> 01:29:43,639
thing right it looks to me more like

1638
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:47,089
normal

1639
01:29:43,639 --> 01:29:51,190
MPLS forwarding state on every hop right

1640
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:53,840
that that I have in ml DP rsvp-te so

1641
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:56,030
whereas it's as I said right ARP you

1642
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,889
know network of network wide relevance

1643
01:29:56,030 --> 01:30:00,290
with you know per have sets that are

1644
01:29:57,889 --> 01:30:02,540
changing so that's why I mean I think to

1645
01:30:00,290 --> 01:30:03,079
me the use of CID is more confusing than

1646
01:30:02,540 --> 01:30:08,060
helpful

1647
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:12,710
I mean sure we can definitely talk about

1648
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:14,989
that yeah good point I mean we can talk

1649
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:17,119
about if you come up with points here

1650
01:30:14,989 --> 01:30:18,619
this is why this is a sit right I mean

1651
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:21,949
that would be be helpful to write down

1652
01:30:18,619 --> 01:30:26,299
otherwise why does it do it all I'm

1653
01:30:21,949 --> 01:30:29,269
saying the the other point was a with sr

1654
01:30:26,300 --> 01:30:31,969
v6 how does it work because I mean is

1655
01:30:29,270 --> 01:30:37,719
this kind of prop D cap and re and cap

1656
01:30:31,969 --> 01:30:37,719
logic we we haven't skin that cat yet

1657
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:43,699
you want to because I mean yes we

1658
01:30:41,599 --> 01:30:50,750
definitely yeah we want to we are

1659
01:30:43,699 --> 01:30:53,329
working on a draft for sr v6 but let's

1660
01:30:50,750 --> 01:30:56,420
get let's get this one through first the

1661
01:30:53,329 --> 01:30:59,659
MPLS the planing pls and then we'll get

1662
01:30:56,420 --> 01:31:02,510
to their services but yes there is

1663
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:04,670
something I've worked because I mean we

1664
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:05,900
do have nice address spaces where

1665
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:08,000
effectively this

1666
01:31:05,900 --> 01:31:10,159
thing could simply be setting up

1667
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,640
aesthetic you know a replication tree

1668
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:16,159
for you know right I'm saying kind of

1669
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:17,780
again the same thing of oh yeah

1670
01:31:16,159 --> 01:31:19,909
everything has to be segment routing

1671
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:21,949
where in the end what kind of controller

1672
01:31:19,909 --> 01:31:24,739
built you know static tree right which

1673
01:31:21,949 --> 01:31:27,559
we've done forever I'm saying if you

1674
01:31:24,739 --> 01:31:30,169
want to run with ipv6 right you don't

1675
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:32,719
and you don't need to try to kill

1676
01:31:30,170 --> 01:31:35,120
yourself by making this look like SR v6

1677
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:37,909
with D cap and rien cap you're simply

1678
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:40,580
having you know your encapsulation

1679
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:42,949
destination address in ipv6 multicast

1680
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:44,780
address and you're effectively setting

1681
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:45,620
up controller based replication state

1682
01:31:44,780 --> 01:31:48,620
for that right

1683
01:31:45,620 --> 01:31:51,769
so again yeah I appreciate the comment

1684
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:52,400
for SRB six so we wanted to make this

1685
01:31:51,770 --> 01:31:55,159
very simple

1686
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:56,960
right b1 the MPLS one as one single

1687
01:31:55,159 --> 01:32:00,710
draft because we want to pass it true

1688
01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:02,210
you guys have been in the spring you've

1689
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:04,130
seen all the conversation on a survey

1690
01:32:02,210 --> 01:32:06,290
six right yeah so I think that's fine

1691
01:32:04,130 --> 01:32:08,570
right III I'm pointing to the fact that

1692
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:10,610
I think this this thing might fly it

1693
01:32:08,570 --> 01:32:13,519
easier the more we're trying not to

1694
01:32:10,610 --> 01:32:15,559
fiddle it through you know the needle of

1695
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,480
trying to make it look like a segments

1696
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:19,370
routing but just you know using

1697
01:32:17,480 --> 01:32:21,678
controller based established MPLS

1698
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:23,510
forwarding or when we go to v6 you know

1699
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:27,340
controller based traffic engineering of

1700
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:38,270
existing v6 Nautica's now okay point ik

1701
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:40,760
nice just like okay so here's a example

1702
01:32:38,270 --> 01:32:44,179
of global optimization so previously we

1703
01:32:40,760 --> 01:32:46,850
had candidate Pat one and then there is

1704
01:32:44,179 --> 01:32:48,980
a failure which was going ABC now there

1705
01:32:46,850 --> 01:32:52,040
is a failure between B and C so the

1706
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:53,900
controller kind of realizes that in the

1707
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:56,440
draft there is a fast reroute that he

1708
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:59,540
can actually do a fast reroute between

1709
01:32:56,440 --> 01:33:02,809
link protection and you can go through G

1710
01:32:59,540 --> 01:33:05,449
to make it all the way back up to C but

1711
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:08,420
then the controller tries to optimize

1712
01:33:05,449 --> 01:33:11,000
that path so it's gonna create an second

1713
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:13,159
instance for the same candidate path and

1714
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:15,980
it's gonna nail down the replication

1715
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:18,620
segments for that second instance

1716
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:19,549
throughout the network so basically what

1717
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:23,869
that means that

1718
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:26,329
is on each note C G D and E you're going

1719
01:33:23,869 --> 01:33:29,570
to have to replication segment one for

1720
01:33:26,329 --> 01:33:33,199
the previous primary one and one for the

1721
01:33:29,570 --> 01:33:35,900
instance to LSB ID two throughout the

1722
01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:38,030
network when the second instance is

1723
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:40,879
nailed down throughout the network you

1724
01:33:38,030 --> 01:33:42,980
go on on a on the route and you do a

1725
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:46,369
make before break and you that's how you

1726
01:33:42,980 --> 01:33:49,428
do global optimization on the point to

1727
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:57,619
multiplying Policy hidden so Nexus

1728
01:33:49,429 --> 01:33:59,869
likely or if there's a gum so here's

1729
01:33:57,619 --> 01:34:01,940
another example with regard to the

1730
01:33:59,869 --> 01:34:04,280
candidate pad itself you want to have

1731
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:06,409
LSP redundancy you want to give

1732
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:08,869
different preferences so there's a

1733
01:34:06,409 --> 01:34:11,089
candidate path with preference 1000

1734
01:34:08,869 --> 01:34:15,558
there is a candidate pad with preference

1735
01:34:11,090 --> 01:34:17,690
100 by the way that letter flashing

1736
01:34:15,559 --> 01:34:20,420
should shouldn't be in this slide I

1737
01:34:17,690 --> 01:34:22,250
think a copy page that mistakenly so

1738
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:24,860
that the first candidate path gonna go

1739
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:26,989
through the north direction a b c d e

1740
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:28,940
and you create the second candidate path

1741
01:34:26,989 --> 01:34:32,570
that goes through the south direction a

1742
01:34:28,940 --> 01:34:35,449
B G D and E and this is how you can have

1743
01:34:32,570 --> 01:34:40,070
LSB redundancy throughout your entire

1744
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:44,509
network so this is the basic idea

1745
01:34:40,070 --> 01:34:49,090
without going to through too much detail

1746
01:34:44,510 --> 01:34:49,090
on the fast reroute on other stuff I

1747
01:34:49,179 --> 01:34:56,329
think the the seat comment that was that

1748
01:34:54,050 --> 01:35:00,739
was put under the table you know we can

1749
01:34:56,329 --> 01:35:03,049
definitely discuss that the reason that

1750
01:35:00,739 --> 01:35:04,250
we decided to go with replication series

1751
01:35:03,050 --> 01:35:08,150
obviously because we had an innerspring

1752
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:10,099
right so so what are we trying to

1753
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:11,920
achieve with with this draft if you

1754
01:35:10,099 --> 01:35:14,150
could go to the next slide please

1755
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,480
it's just just a quick comment right I

1756
01:35:14,150 --> 01:35:19,638
mean that either you can you can do I

1757
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:21,530
think what is less work and in pitches

1758
01:35:19,639 --> 01:35:23,540
up to the people who already got MPLS

1759
01:35:21,530 --> 01:35:26,540
multicast deployed whether it's RSVP T

1760
01:35:23,540 --> 01:35:28,369
or ml DP by naming this what I think it

1761
01:35:26,540 --> 01:35:31,280
is which is you know controller based

1762
01:35:28,369 --> 01:35:32,199
MPLS multicast or you're trying to you

1763
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,449
know go through

1764
01:35:32,199 --> 01:35:36,249
more hoops and making it you know sound

1765
01:35:34,449 --> 01:35:37,598
like SR because it's a better marketing

1766
01:35:36,249 --> 01:35:42,728
term which i think is where this was

1767
01:35:37,599 --> 01:35:47,729
coming from I understood I do have a

1768
01:35:42,729 --> 01:35:52,929
question are these SIDS so because III

1769
01:35:47,729 --> 01:35:55,329
confess I read it and I inferred from my

1770
01:35:52,929 --> 01:35:56,829
reading and I'm I probably skipped many

1771
01:35:55,329 --> 01:35:59,469
words in the process of reading because

1772
01:35:56,829 --> 01:36:02,440
I was an early that day like I usually

1773
01:35:59,469 --> 01:36:03,969
am I I presumed that they were SIDS so I

1774
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:10,659
I thought there was it would be a sit at

1775
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:14,229
D and a sit at E and and so on upstream

1776
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:16,539
towards the root for every point in the

1777
01:36:14,229 --> 01:36:19,360
network where some sort of multicast

1778
01:36:16,539 --> 01:36:23,259
awareness was required and that these

1779
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:27,308
were indices into a table that would

1780
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:32,050
then give you a multi-car a label for

1781
01:36:27,309 --> 01:36:35,429
which D for example would map and

1782
01:36:32,050 --> 01:36:38,530
understand when it saw that label

1783
01:36:35,429 --> 01:36:44,199
incoming and that that to me is a SID so

1784
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:46,239
our SIDS or not so here's the thing we

1785
01:36:44,199 --> 01:36:48,339
all know when it comes to a spring and

1786
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:51,218
segment routing you can go on and pls

1787
01:36:48,340 --> 01:36:53,709
back on you can start stacking up sits

1788
01:36:51,219 --> 01:36:55,690
right what is a sit it identifies a

1789
01:36:53,709 --> 01:36:57,999
resource within the network what are the

1790
01:36:55,690 --> 01:37:00,098
resources right it's adjacency see and

1791
01:36:57,999 --> 01:37:02,619
know what see and based on the label

1792
01:37:00,099 --> 01:37:04,780
stack you can traffic engineering source

1793
01:37:02,619 --> 01:37:08,369
route your LSP throughout the entire

1794
01:37:04,780 --> 01:37:10,719
network with multicast you cannot grab

1795
01:37:08,369 --> 01:37:13,839
replication seats and start stacking

1796
01:37:10,719 --> 01:37:16,289
them up the reason for that is that when

1797
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:19,719
you get to a point that you have

1798
01:37:16,289 --> 01:37:20,829
actually you're like a branching point

1799
01:37:19,719 --> 01:37:23,499
in multicast

1800
01:37:20,829 --> 01:37:25,509
and if you have stacked up seats then

1801
01:37:23,499 --> 01:37:28,478
you don't know on north direction which

1802
01:37:25,510 --> 01:37:31,090
seats are relevant on south direction

1803
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:34,150
which seats are relevant that's the

1804
01:37:31,090 --> 01:37:36,760
issue with multicast that said the

1805
01:37:34,150 --> 01:37:40,268
reason that we keep calling a CID is

1806
01:37:36,760 --> 01:37:44,770
because this entire idea can work in a

1807
01:37:40,269 --> 01:37:49,059
unicast it could be actually source

1808
01:37:44,770 --> 01:37:51,309
routing source spraying so you could

1809
01:37:49,059 --> 01:37:54,480
actually go on the head and router

1810
01:37:51,309 --> 01:37:57,570
create a replication seat and that

1811
01:37:54,480 --> 01:38:00,820
replication seat is actually built from

1812
01:37:57,570 --> 01:38:04,030
unicast adjacency seats binding seats

1813
01:38:00,820 --> 01:38:07,509
Nord seats all the way to the leaf so

1814
01:38:04,030 --> 01:38:09,369
multi-hop unicast seats all the way to

1815
01:38:07,510 --> 01:38:12,489
the leaf and the leaf has another

1816
01:38:09,369 --> 01:38:15,670
replication see which just says this is

1817
01:38:12,489 --> 01:38:18,039
multicast on the leaf that's higher so

1818
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:20,079
this is the entire idea that's why we

1819
01:38:18,039 --> 01:38:23,559
call it a replication seat because it's

1820
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:29,469
really identifying a multicast resource

1821
01:38:23,559 --> 01:38:32,949
a multicast seed within the network now

1822
01:38:29,469 --> 01:38:34,360
it's how you skin the cat you could skin

1823
01:38:32,949 --> 01:38:38,400
the cat and say that you know this is

1824
01:38:34,360 --> 01:38:40,900
MPLS label and I'm gonna add a bunch of

1825
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:43,750
unicast sitting on top of a tooth so a

1826
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:46,058
CID ultimately results in getting a

1827
01:38:43,750 --> 01:38:49,389
label when you're using an MPLS data

1828
01:38:46,059 --> 01:38:53,289
plane yes but the city itself isn't a

1829
01:38:49,389 --> 01:38:54,940
label they may be identical values and

1830
01:38:53,289 --> 01:38:58,929
then the recommendation is that they are

1831
01:38:54,940 --> 01:39:01,719
identical values but it is a it's an

1832
01:38:58,929 --> 01:39:05,770
index into a place where you find the

1833
01:39:01,719 --> 01:39:09,280
MPLS label value is that true of these

1834
01:39:05,770 --> 01:39:12,070
or not yeah this is exactly so even with

1835
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:14,349
these ones we actually grab so I did

1836
01:39:12,070 --> 01:39:16,780
understand yeah yeah so it's it's it

1837
01:39:14,349 --> 01:39:18,159
could be globally assigned it could be

1838
01:39:16,780 --> 01:39:24,550
locally assigned because of the

1839
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:29,129
controller so that is exactly it has to

1840
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:31,659
be in done in coordination with the

1841
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:33,159
boxes that will process that's it so

1842
01:39:31,659 --> 01:39:37,058
they understand what the hell it means

1843
01:39:33,159 --> 01:39:39,009
yes exactly yeah as I said as long as we

1844
01:39:37,059 --> 01:39:42,190
stick with MPLS the distinction of

1845
01:39:39,010 --> 01:39:44,469
whether we calling it MPLS right or SIDS

1846
01:39:42,190 --> 01:39:46,119
is a lot more subtle but the problem is

1847
01:39:44,469 --> 01:39:48,550
as soon as we starting calling its it

1848
01:39:46,119 --> 01:39:50,110
we're running into the likely dead end

1849
01:39:48,550 --> 01:39:52,690
then you know we're doing something a

1850
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:55,299
lot more complicated with v6 right as

1851
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:57,940
opposed to keeping you know just as a

1852
01:39:55,300 --> 01:39:59,770
single you know just making it native VC

1853
01:39:57,940 --> 01:40:02,830
three established by the controller

1854
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:04,570
right with some you know v6 multicast

1855
01:40:02,830 --> 01:40:06,910
destination address where every existing

1856
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:09,519
ipv6 multicast router could you know

1857
01:40:06,910 --> 01:40:11,920
from the controller build an engineer

1858
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:13,120
tree that's basically you know if you

1859
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:15,460
want to have backward compatibility

1860
01:40:13,120 --> 01:40:17,140
right for people that like to do things

1861
01:40:15,460 --> 01:40:18,480
from the controller that is the only

1862
01:40:17,140 --> 01:40:20,260
thing you'd be able to do right now

1863
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:23,650
anything where you would have to do

1864
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:25,360
rewrites you know in SR v6 on every hop

1865
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:29,410
is not going to fly with any of the

1866
01:40:25,360 --> 01:40:31,929
existing equipment let's just say I'm

1867
01:40:29,410 --> 01:40:34,660
not guessing I just go so I think here

1868
01:40:31,930 --> 01:40:35,830
the is the label I don't think

1869
01:40:34,660 --> 01:40:37,840
there's an indirection here right

1870
01:40:35,830 --> 01:40:39,190
because you carried that in the

1871
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:41,920
packet and that's what you used to find

1872
01:40:39,190 --> 01:40:43,179
your next application so I don't think

1873
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,600
there's a difference between what you

1874
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:48,670
call a and the label so no but

1875
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:51,430
they're those seats are can be a sign

1876
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:53,830
but so I can go let me put it I think

1877
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:55,830
you need to unpack FRR and a bunch of

1878
01:40:53,830 --> 01:40:59,320
other stuff rather than skipping it over

1879
01:40:55,830 --> 01:41:01,600
to sort of get at all of this and I

1880
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:05,889
agree on there and and I think that it

1881
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:08,050
would be really good if we rather than

1882
01:41:05,890 --> 01:41:10,270
having an oversimplified presentation

1883
01:41:08,050 --> 01:41:13,120
spend some time thinking about this so

1884
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:15,040
so this was exactly the point of this

1885
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:18,730
present and I am absolutely agree with

1886
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:24,760
you it was just to bring some awareness

1887
01:41:18,730 --> 01:41:27,849
to this so you know on the next ITF we

1888
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:30,850
can go in more details about fast rerun

1889
01:41:27,850 --> 01:41:32,590
on all these other stuff so the argument

1890
01:41:30,850 --> 01:41:34,720
for the sit if you really want to go

1891
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:37,300
that way right which I'd prefer not to

1892
01:41:34,720 --> 01:41:39,250
do because if I want to talk to people

1893
01:41:37,300 --> 01:41:41,830
with the you know existing deployments

1894
01:41:39,250 --> 01:41:43,770
with MPLS that's not only the easier

1895
01:41:41,830 --> 01:41:46,030
solution but better marketing for me but

1896
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:47,650
as I said the difference between the

1897
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:49,360
cities when it goes across multiple Hopf

1898
01:41:47,650 --> 01:41:52,540
and then basically every how change is

1899
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:55,059
the offset right so that's basically

1900
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:57,190
something you want to have anyhow right

1901
01:41:55,060 --> 01:41:59,920
then that's a good argument to call it

1902
01:41:57,190 --> 01:42:03,549
is it so that so when we started with

1903
01:41:59,920 --> 01:42:05,260
this it was just a global seed that

1904
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:08,080
represents the point of multi-point

1905
01:42:05,260 --> 01:42:10,480
three right so a single label was

1906
01:42:08,080 --> 01:42:11,300
presenting that tree on every single

1907
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:15,049
router

1908
01:42:11,300 --> 01:42:17,600
right but now that would be tree-sit

1909
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:23,540
more than a replication sit yes now

1910
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:26,930
exactly did ya need to net get new

1911
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:28,940
glasses I'm sorry so now when it comes

1912
01:42:26,930 --> 01:42:34,190
to the replication see each one of these

1913
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:36,559
router can have its own seat area if you

1914
01:42:34,190 --> 01:42:38,750
will can have its own bucket that will

1915
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,980
choose the label from that bucket so

1916
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:42,140
what happened with the tree said I'm

1917
01:42:39,980 --> 01:42:43,519
sorry I didn't follow that so it could

1918
01:42:42,140 --> 01:42:45,800
be either it could be the controller

1919
01:42:43,520 --> 01:42:47,540
creates a three seat and to NH one of

1920
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:48,200
this replication policies gonna have the

1921
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:50,120
same label

1922
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:52,639
or it could be uniquely each one of this

1923
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:54,500
replication policy is gonna have a label

1924
01:42:52,640 --> 01:42:57,200
or a seat that is relevant to that now

1925
01:42:54,500 --> 01:42:58,700
no but what I'm saying is that a tree

1926
01:42:57,200 --> 01:43:00,230
sit that is consistent through the whole

1927
01:42:58,700 --> 01:43:01,970
networking it's not going to be written

1928
01:43:00,230 --> 01:43:05,690
on every hop it's something you can

1929
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:07,640
translate into SR v6 yeah but I want to

1930
01:43:05,690 --> 01:43:09,290
keep like this this is exactly why we

1931
01:43:07,640 --> 01:43:11,240
try to keep their service six out of

1932
01:43:09,290 --> 01:43:13,280
this if you if if you don't want to

1933
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:16,550
think about the different transport

1934
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:18,410
options for something you call a segment

1935
01:43:16,550 --> 01:43:26,960
routing solution you shouldn't call it a

1936
01:43:18,410 --> 01:43:31,670
segment routing solution so then the

1937
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:36,820
next the next slide please so the next

1938
01:43:31,670 --> 01:43:40,760
step is I think we had the the sip

1939
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:42,349
argument in in the spring too so this

1940
01:43:40,760 --> 01:43:44,780
the next step is we are hoping that we

1941
01:43:42,350 --> 01:43:47,600
can have a working group adaptation in

1942
01:43:44,780 --> 01:43:51,920
came and work on this whole idea and in

1943
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:56,950
the pink yeah like if you guys can adopt

1944
01:43:51,920 --> 01:44:00,920
this draft on the pink group you know I

1945
01:43:56,950 --> 01:44:04,790
mean if there is interest why not so

1946
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:07,970
who's read this draft one two three four

1947
01:44:04,790 --> 01:44:09,920
five six of those six hands who do you

1948
01:44:07,970 --> 01:44:17,960
do you feel that this dress should be

1949
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:19,940
adopted one two okay just we're not

1950
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:22,040
raising their hand right I mean except

1951
01:44:19,940 --> 01:44:22,839
for reading all the details but it is I

1952
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:24,760
really

1953
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:27,190
think that the draft the way you

1954
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:29,830
presented it still struggles off of oil

1955
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:32,348
defining you know where it wants to be

1956
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:35,320
right so I'm all for having you know a

1957
01:44:32,349 --> 01:44:37,540
controller based you know forwarding

1958
01:44:35,320 --> 01:44:40,090
scheme for existing MPLS multicast

1959
01:44:37,540 --> 01:44:44,199
hardware but the way that this is being

1960
01:44:40,090 --> 01:44:47,290
done you know with calling it segment

1961
01:44:44,199 --> 01:44:49,150
routing and you know only carrying

1962
01:44:47,290 --> 01:44:51,639
calling it technical thing but not

1963
01:44:49,150 --> 01:44:54,129
caring about both transport for it that

1964
01:44:51,639 --> 01:44:57,010
that those seem to be really sure again

1965
01:44:54,130 --> 01:44:59,080
of he scoping issues that did we should

1966
01:44:57,010 --> 01:45:01,929
we should discuss yeah definitely we can

1967
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:05,349
have a I'm not sure if I understand your

1968
01:45:01,929 --> 01:45:10,599
is our v6 argument but you can have

1969
01:45:05,349 --> 01:45:12,369
offline yeah I think that it's highly

1970
01:45:10,599 --> 01:45:14,230
premature to ask for working group

1971
01:45:12,369 --> 01:45:16,509
adoption I think that at some point down

1972
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:17,980
the road when you've actually answered a

1973
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:20,409
bunch of these questions and thought

1974
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:21,968
about it more and maybe gotten some more

1975
01:45:20,409 --> 01:45:24,250
participation from others to help you

1976
01:45:21,969 --> 01:45:26,800
think about it it could work out but

1977
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:28,840
it's way too soon for that

1978
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:30,940
yeah we are completely open to the

1979
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:32,290
questions here I mean please send the

1980
01:45:30,940 --> 01:45:35,159
questions to the working group man

1981
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:38,290
definitely have a look thank you yeah

1982
01:45:35,159 --> 01:45:41,650
add that you know it seems to be in

1983
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:44,710
charter and it's okay to do the work

1984
01:45:41,650 --> 01:45:47,049
here and we're happy to discuss it here

1985
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:54,940
but yeah it may be too early to actually

1986
01:45:47,050 --> 01:45:57,219
adopt it okay I'll go quick we have a

1987
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:59,440
Bobby about five ten minutes and then I

1988
01:45:57,219 --> 01:46:00,699
cannot over committed myself so we we

1989
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:02,860
need to move on if you haven't signed a

1990
01:46:00,699 --> 01:46:05,379
blue sheet please do so where's the blue

1991
01:46:02,860 --> 01:46:07,509
sheet here anybody you need to sign it

1992
01:46:05,380 --> 01:46:08,550
yeah okay can you get that D in that'd

1993
01:46:07,510 --> 01:46:11,889
be great

1994
01:46:08,550 --> 01:46:15,159
okay so I presented this draft to ITF

1995
01:46:11,889 --> 01:46:16,659
segoe so I don't need to go into too

1996
01:46:15,159 --> 01:46:18,190
much detail but I'll quickly go through

1997
01:46:16,659 --> 01:46:22,119
it it's basically trying to find a way

1998
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:25,869
to optimize asserts in the occasional

1999
01:46:22,119 --> 01:46:27,489
situation where you could have a lot of

2000
01:46:25,869 --> 01:46:29,830
messages a lot of certain messages on a

2001
01:46:27,489 --> 01:46:32,360
land whether it be in an exchange or

2002
01:46:29,830 --> 01:46:35,059
some other type of environment

2003
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:36,650
when you've got a lot of asserts this is

2004
01:46:35,060 --> 01:46:39,310
a way that you can pack asserts into a

2005
01:46:36,650 --> 01:46:42,980
particular packet to kind of reduce the

2006
01:46:39,310 --> 01:46:44,420
reduce the traffic on a particular line

2007
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:45,580
if you can go to if you can be our my

2008
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:50,300
slide guy

2009
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:51,890
so this that's the problem and just go

2010
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:53,810
to the next one if you would just keep

2011
01:46:51,890 --> 01:46:58,490
going alright so there's no change in

2012
01:46:53,810 --> 01:47:00,560
the assert state machine we do develop a

2013
01:46:58,490 --> 01:47:04,309
new pinhole option for assert packing

2014
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:05,510
and we have two different ways if we

2015
01:47:04,310 --> 01:47:06,920
decide that this is something that we

2016
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:08,990
want to do as a working group we have a

2017
01:47:06,920 --> 01:47:13,730
simple packing solution in a more

2018
01:47:08,990 --> 01:47:15,860
involved packing solution next slide so

2019
01:47:13,730 --> 01:47:18,230
this is the PIM hello option to

2020
01:47:15,860 --> 01:47:21,889
determine whether this is a something

2021
01:47:18,230 --> 01:47:29,690
that these the routers on a land can do

2022
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:31,910
next slide so if you're announced that

2023
01:47:29,690 --> 01:47:33,620
you support the a the aggregates packing

2024
01:47:31,910 --> 01:47:38,090
then it's a student you also support a

2025
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:39,890
simple one yes the the one is a simple a

2026
01:47:38,090 --> 01:47:42,980
packing type in the two is a grading

2027
01:47:39,890 --> 01:47:44,750
Pepe so to support both do some to hello

2028
01:47:42,980 --> 01:47:46,839
I'm ever you ask this question or and I

2029
01:47:44,750 --> 01:47:49,820
don't remember we I don't think we've I

2030
01:47:46,840 --> 01:47:51,500
think we've answered that one thing I

2031
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:54,170
would sent a good question so just this

2032
01:47:51,500 --> 01:47:56,480
maybe you say if you support yeah

2033
01:47:54,170 --> 01:47:59,270
aggregate them it's assumed that you

2034
01:47:56,480 --> 01:48:01,339
okay so that's a good point won't add to

2035
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:03,380
the draft if we pursue it thank you so

2036
01:48:01,340 --> 01:48:07,250
this is a simple way to go about doing

2037
01:48:03,380 --> 01:48:09,950
it you just take that existing assert

2038
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:12,770
and put it into an assert record and add

2039
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:15,019
it several of these asserts records into

2040
01:48:12,770 --> 01:48:16,640
one particular packet need there's

2041
01:48:15,020 --> 01:48:18,020
advantages in that it reduces the

2042
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:20,150
packets on the land but there's

2043
01:48:18,020 --> 01:48:26,060
disadvantages because the disadvantage

2044
01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:27,830
is that you're you you have you you're

2045
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:29,800
wasting the payload because many of the

2046
01:48:27,830 --> 01:48:35,090
packets have the same sourcing group

2047
01:48:29,800 --> 01:48:38,060
next slide and this is the packet format

2048
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:41,090
next slide I just yeah this is the more

2049
01:48:38,060 --> 01:48:43,640
involved aggregating packet solution

2050
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:44,910
where you are aggregating based upon the

2051
01:48:43,640 --> 01:48:47,910
source address of the

2052
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:51,180
Arpi address or the group address and so

2053
01:48:47,910 --> 01:48:53,610
you're not you say you're more efficient

2054
01:48:51,180 --> 01:48:56,820
in the packing method but it's a little

2055
01:48:53,610 --> 01:49:00,480
bit more involved adds complexity next

2056
01:48:56,820 --> 01:49:02,219
slide and this is the packet format yeah

2057
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:04,620
that's fine this is good out there just

2058
01:49:02,220 --> 01:49:06,570
for the sake of time yeah so people can

2059
01:49:04,620 --> 01:49:08,809
look at that later so there was a lot of

2060
01:49:06,570 --> 01:49:10,950
discussion last time I presented this on

2061
01:49:08,810 --> 01:49:15,510
whether this is something that's worth

2062
01:49:10,950 --> 01:49:18,599
doing to assert should we pursue it or

2063
01:49:15,510 --> 01:49:21,650
just leave asserts alone do we if we do

2064
01:49:18,600 --> 01:49:24,270
want to pursue it so we replace asserts

2065
01:49:21,650 --> 01:49:25,860
some people mention that you really just

2066
01:49:24,270 --> 01:49:29,430
don't do asserts and just live with

2067
01:49:25,860 --> 01:49:31,320
duplicates and this draft is saying well

2068
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:36,150
there's one option is to optimize

2069
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:37,799
asserts and so there was some people who

2070
01:49:36,150 --> 01:49:39,420
mentioned that it would be you know this

2071
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:40,800
could be a good idea there's many people

2072
01:49:39,420 --> 01:49:43,440
that said this is probably not something

2073
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:44,430
that's worth doing and so we thought

2074
01:49:43,440 --> 01:49:46,200
we'd just bring it to the working group

2075
01:49:44,430 --> 01:49:48,480
again since it's been a couple working

2076
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:50,460
groups and to see if the attitudes

2077
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:53,820
changed at all if there is interest in

2078
01:49:50,460 --> 01:49:55,640
in working on this if so then we will

2079
01:49:53,820 --> 01:50:00,210
continue to work on it

2080
01:49:55,640 --> 01:50:01,770
any comments yes I have a couple of

2081
01:50:00,210 --> 01:50:03,740
comments just as a working with

2082
01:50:01,770 --> 01:50:07,820
participants yes

2083
01:50:03,740 --> 01:50:11,490
so sure it could be nice to get

2084
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:15,389
completely but I think we have to live

2085
01:50:11,490 --> 01:50:18,030
with asserts in my scenarios or less

2086
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:20,580
forever so I think it's I think it's

2087
01:50:18,030 --> 01:50:22,710
worth optimizing asserts if you can't

2088
01:50:20,580 --> 01:50:25,440
get waited on grades but but if he

2089
01:50:22,710 --> 01:50:32,580
counts them but it's better to optimize

2090
01:50:25,440 --> 01:50:34,650
it i I know law so well actual issues

2091
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:36,930
out there in the field where there's

2092
01:50:34,650 --> 01:50:38,580
issues with a cert packets getting

2093
01:50:36,930 --> 01:50:41,490
dropped and stuff because there's just

2094
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:43,200
too many asserts and if you drop on a

2095
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:46,019
Start packet bad things happen like

2096
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:50,070
duplication and stuff so I think this is

2097
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:53,940
worth doing I mainly have two comments

2098
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:57,870
one is a lot convinced that the more

2099
01:50:53,940 --> 01:50:58,678
advanced packing is necessary you still

2100
01:50:57,870 --> 01:51:02,449
have a huge

2101
01:50:58,679 --> 01:51:05,939
benefits just with us simple packing I

2102
01:51:02,449 --> 01:51:07,860
mean if you send the 1500 byte packet

2103
01:51:05,939 --> 01:51:09,570
you will be able to learn what's the

2104
01:51:07,860 --> 01:51:12,119
math you can put quite a few a search

2105
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:14,999
until one packet if you do jumbo grants

2106
01:51:12,119 --> 01:51:17,579
you can get a lot more the only thing is

2107
01:51:14,999 --> 01:51:19,409
I don't understand in your advanced

2108
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:21,630
format while you have an RP address

2109
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:26,070
there because you don't tell an RP

2110
01:51:21,630 --> 01:51:30,780
address in the starts today sourcing

2111
01:51:26,070 --> 01:51:35,478
groups yeah you want just source of the

2112
01:51:30,780 --> 01:51:37,139
serie with it's like an start G assert I

2113
01:51:35,479 --> 01:51:39,840
think that's true

2114
01:51:37,139 --> 01:51:43,590
so G right that wouldn't be needed

2115
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:45,570
you're right I mean in the way logical

2116
01:51:43,590 --> 01:51:47,579
it makes sense because all all the

2117
01:51:45,570 --> 01:51:49,590
eskimo G's in the message are for the

2118
01:51:47,579 --> 01:51:54,869
same RP but I don't think you actually

2119
01:51:49,590 --> 01:51:56,670
need RP address okay okay well we'll

2120
01:51:54,869 --> 01:51:59,929
consider whether we even include the

2121
01:51:56,670 --> 01:52:02,789
more advanced in the draft anyway maybe

2122
01:51:59,929 --> 01:52:04,530
take your advice to only focus on simple

2123
01:52:02,789 --> 01:52:06,688
I mean in a way it makes total sense

2124
01:52:04,530 --> 01:52:08,999
because you have all these metrics the

2125
01:52:06,689 --> 01:52:11,249
same metrics file off to ask emoji often

2126
01:52:08,999 --> 01:52:15,090
but on the other hand here maybe it's

2127
01:52:11,249 --> 01:52:16,709
not worth the complexity okay so won't

2128
01:52:15,090 --> 01:52:20,340
need a Tatarstan list but can you ask

2129
01:52:16,709 --> 01:52:22,979
the working group all right so who wrote

2130
01:52:20,340 --> 01:52:27,050
this draft okay

2131
01:52:22,979 --> 01:52:30,599
two people three three people might wait

2132
01:52:27,050 --> 01:52:32,909
okay three people no does that well it's

2133
01:52:30,599 --> 01:52:33,959
who thinks it's useful or actually I

2134
01:52:32,909 --> 01:52:39,719
should say who should thinks it should

2135
01:52:33,959 --> 01:52:41,670
be adopted okay including myself

2136
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:46,020
I think there's three people that read

2137
01:52:41,670 --> 01:52:47,209
it and two people wants to be adopted I

2138
01:52:46,020 --> 01:52:49,590

2139
01:52:47,209 --> 01:52:51,539
think we can take it to the list if

2140
01:52:49,590 --> 01:52:54,030
you've been presenting this a couple of

2141
01:52:51,539 --> 01:52:56,369
times now and there is something some

2142
01:52:54,030 --> 01:53:00,570
interest it's okay very good thank you I

2143
01:52:56,369 --> 01:53:02,188
think we're done yeah all right thanks

2144
01:53:00,570 --> 01:53:04,889
everyone thanks for coming

2145
01:53:02,189 --> 01:53:07,050
and I'm Bondi by the way is in this room

2146
01:53:04,889 --> 01:53:11,420
just after this so please don't leave

2147
01:53:07,050 --> 01:53:13,800

2148
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:17,429
you're permitted to leave but please

2149
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:47,280
come back there is some coffee or

2150
01:53:17,429 --> 01:53:49,949
something laughter I mean I feel like it

2151
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:54,259
makes sense maybe say certain qualities

2152
01:53:49,949 --> 01:53:58,580
are you so lucky never certain scenarios

2153
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:58,580
but what the actual you know

2154
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:29,199
