something important

9
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:35,080
I know ITT study 12th performance and

10
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:38,460
and body experience quality service mama

11
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,460
is less than happy

12
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:46,119
well it is but we're gonna do anyway I

13
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,510
think it's third time we should get

14
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,510
going

15
00:03:49,600 --> 00:04:04,260

got it good this is horrible it's too

18
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,500
high and it's too

19
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:34,810
this should change as well but it

20
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:37,210
doesn't so if anybody's really tall when

21
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:41,500
you get up here feel free to make

22
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:43,479
adjustments a hi everybody welcome to

23
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,970
benchmarking methodology working group

24
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:50,500
my name is al morton one of the

25
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:55,720
co-chairs my fellow co-chair here it was

26
00:04:50,500 --> 00:05:00,150
not a fellow is sarah banks say say hi

27
00:04:55,720 --> 00:05:03,730
sarah this may be he has said hello so

28
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:08,760
our session is starting now

29
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:13,750
compliment it's late we have the

30
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:14,680
two-hour session here and police move

31
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,780
close to the front

32
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,980
i've even moved the mic close to the

33
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,950
fronts to encourage that and if you are

34
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:26,350
not subscribed to the BMW g list and you

35
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,560
would like to that's the place where you

36
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:37,630
can do it on this first set of slides

37
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:39,070
the agenda slides so it's wednesday we

38
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:41,710
have the note well slide which you

39
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,680
should have seen a few times we work

40
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,780
according to certain IETF processes and

41
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:52,300
policies one of the most important which

42
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:53,770
is you know the video recording and also

43
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,520
because that's going on right now and

44
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:59,380
then the disclosure of IPR which we

45
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,650
asked you to do as quickly as possible

46
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:06,370
and then but the most important thing is

47
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,539
the thing I've added at the top we work

48
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:14,670
as individuals in the IETF and we try to

49
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:17,710
be nice to each other and that happens

50
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:23,590
99.9 percent of the time in BMW G so

51
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:25,599
let's not break that record so here's

52
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:27,820
our agenda and our first step always is

53
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,470
to bash the agenda to make changes and

54
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:33,240
it turns out we're going to do that a

55
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:36,310
little bit today but first off we have

56
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,510
Luis who has agreed to be our note Caton

57
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,010
note taker please

58
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,810
raise your hand there Louise so

59
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:43,780
everybody knows who you are thank you

60
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:46,270
and if you come to the mic to speak or

61
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,340
make a comment make sure Louise can see

62
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:50,620
your badge so that he can get the

63
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:53,919
spelling of your name and where we're

64
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,890
taking minutes today in the ether pad

65
00:06:53,920 --> 00:07:03,250
which is allocated to our working group

66
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:05,440
so our oh yes so say your name like the

67
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,720
little tag says and and and Louise will

68
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,040
also be able to spell it as correctly as

69
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:14,040
possible so we've got the note-taker

70
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:16,780
everybody can help on etherpad

71
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:20,760
we've had trouble with jabber in the

72
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:26,500
past is anybody connected to jabber

73
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:28,120
for this group yeah and I doubt that

74
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,670
there'll be anybody there warned but

75
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,260
yeah but but I appreciate that you've

76
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:37,600
helped us out with this in the past and

77
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:39,370
and it's a big big help because we're

78
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,560
supposed to provide it I've just

79
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:43,030
mentioned the IPR and the blue sheets

80
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,970
are going around this is where you sign

81
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,500
your name only one blue sheet because

82
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,990
we're a fairly small group for sure you

83
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,960
get your name on it and your company

84
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:55,420
affiliation and and so forth so that

85
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,780
covers the administrative stuff except

86
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,240
for the agenda approval so we're first

87
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:02,770
going to do the working group status

88
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,310
we'll look at our charter charter and

89
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:10,240
milestones briefly we have some sins to

90
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:13,360
apologize for there and then we'll look

91
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,990
to tim winters who I think is here yes

92
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,030
hi Tim for presentation on the next

93
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,180
generation firewall networks security

94
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:25,059
device performance

95
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:29,170
I'm authoring a draft on back-to-back

96
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:32,409
frame benchmarks it's updates for that

97
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:35,140
in RC 25:44 so that gets us through the

98
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,959
working group drafts and then we'll have

99
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:41,140
plenty of time I think for the

100
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,500
continuing proposals which include the

101
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:47,610
methodology for vnf benchmarking

102
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,890
automation a Raphael are you here

103
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,740
Raphael is at lunch okay

104
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:53,600
hopefully he joins

105
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,920
in time we may need to shuffle that a

106
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,970
little bit

107
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:00,680
we have Wang bong Lee who is going to

108
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,470
give us a presentation on the

109
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:07,819
considerations for benchmarking in the

110
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:11,209
containerized infrastructure right on

111
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:13,670
topic and then a yang data model for

112
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:18,380
network interconnect tester management

113
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:20,300
vladimir veselov is here he's he's had

114
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,920
his draft available for quite a while

115
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,949
and this is the first time

116
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,069
Vladimir is asked to present it

117
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:30,620
following a successful hackathon over

118
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:36,110
the weekend and I think he also had the

119
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:38,330
hack hack hack demo happy hour last what

120
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:41,000
two nights ago right so I hope that was

121
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:45,290
successful - I note that I apologize I

122
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:48,950
didn't make it there as I planned but

123
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,040
then the last sort of one we originally

124
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:54,920
sort of wanted to do here was the

125
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,810
benchmarking methodology for a VPN

126
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,339
multihoming

127
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:04,270
devices and restoration which we've

128
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:06,970
updated Jim Yutaro and I and then new

129
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:09,319
sort of there's new comments on service

130
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:12,740
density benchmarking but we don't have

131
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,020
anybody here who can really take them so

132
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,680
what we decided to do with this time is

133
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:21,709
to give release a chance to talk about

134
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:24,739
is 5g Benten Network benchmarking again

135
00:10:21,709 --> 00:10:28,640
and so that's an agenda change I'm just

136
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:30,920
describing it verbally and then let's

137
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,560
see I think if there's time I'll talk

138
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,050
about benchmarking and the common nfe i

139
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,989
telco task force which is something

140
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:41,839
newly created in 2019 and it actually

141
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:45,260
has got a lot of overlap with the work

142
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:50,149
that we're doing here containerized

143
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:55,149
infrastructure the modelling work and

144
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:58,459
and so forth so I mean but I'm gonna I

145
00:10:55,149 --> 00:11:01,910
apologize I'm gonna have to play search

146
00:10:58,459 --> 00:11:03,859
roulette to put that presentation

147
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,689
together if there's time which means I'm

148
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:10,160
going to type C NTT

149
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:11,870
no piano fee in the in a search in the

150
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:14,750
search window and we'll see what comes

151
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:19,040
up and I'll select I'll select from

152
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,960
there so but it's just an informational

153
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,240
presentation I want this group to be

154
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:28,490
aware of a lot of work going on there

155
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:29,000
any uh any bashes to the agenda seeing

156
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,130
none

157
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,140
seeing no one at the microphone we will

158
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:41,750
move straight ahead uh Raphael is remote

159
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:44,660
up here apparently so we hit the red

160
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,370
button yeah actually it's my let's be my

161
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,110
little oyster and we'll do the

162
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:51,790
presentation for the vnf benchmarking

163
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,790
automation because referral cannot make

164
00:11:52,420 --> 00:12:03,050
okay oh man well all right very good

165
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:05,329
thank you for letting us know our why

166
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:07,910
don't you give us a test a test one two

167
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:11,600
with one two three four five to ten with

168
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:15,520
your audio and we will adjust the volume

169
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,520
because it was blisteringly loud here

170
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:23,930
yeah you ate him I guess you won the

171
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,580
game by the way okay I think now it's

172
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,410
working can you give me yes hello one

173
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,560
two three yeah that's a much better

174
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:32,390
volume thank you okay okay all right so

175
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:35,479
thank you thank you for that agenda bash

176
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:37,970
and for being ready to go here much

177
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,000
appreciated and thank you for utilizing

178
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:44,300
your audio expertise I should also

179
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,750
introduce our area director advisor who

180
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:52,990
is a Warren Ace Kumari here at the front

181
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:56,900
address today like a like a strawberry

182
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,380
but that's cool so very cool actually

183
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:05,660
so good so let's go ahead with those

184
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,939
changes so the quick status is you know

185
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,969
along the way we adopted this back to

186
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:13,130
back frame benchmarking and that meant

187
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,150
we actually got some comments from folks

188
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:18,410
which I almost forgot to incorporate so

189
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:19,550
and they've been coming in very nicely

190
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:24,500
so

191
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:27,800
I had to do was wait till the submission

192
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,779
window opened again and so now there is

193
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,579
a new version of that draft available I

194
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:33,649
apologize for missing the regular

195
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,089
deadline so I don't expect a lot of

196
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,680
comments on that today but we'll talk

197
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,200
about the ones we got and how will you

198
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,920
were result them so the new proposals

199
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,000
keep coming and if you don't see your

200
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,219
name here it means I missed it somehow

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,790
but but there's just the the point is

202
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:55,250
that there's a lot and here's where we

203
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,709
get to apologize and work with our area

204
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:02,260
director to fix all our milestones which

205
00:13:57,709 --> 00:14:07,609
we keep forgetting to do so yeah yeah

206
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:10,730
yeah so let's let's do that but these

207
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:14,089
are all the things that in fact some of

208
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:18,260
them for example methodology on evpn

209
00:14:14,089 --> 00:14:19,940
benchmarking we're I think we've pushed

210
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:24,020
the button on publication requested

211
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:26,959
right and and so for that one we have a

212
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,279
write-up to do the document Shepards

213
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:34,790
right up all done

214
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:38,689
oh cool cool okay so great so then it's

215
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:40,490
an I guess it's in Warren's hands that

216
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,959
that's fine that's fine that's a busy

217
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:46,880
week I know so let's uh let's let's all

218
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:52,550
be nice to each other as I said at the

219
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:54,649
start no problem one so we we're

220
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:58,969
willfully behind in fixing this but we

221
00:14:54,649 --> 00:15:01,279
will do it okay new RFC's none charter

222
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:04,970
update none we still got a supplementary

223
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:06,770
page thanks to Sara and you can go that

224
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:10,430
go to this page and and read it if

225
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:13,189
you're new to BMW G and let me ask the

226
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:18,939
question if please raise your hand if

227
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:21,949
you're new to BMW G one to two people

228
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:24,800
that's great so you'll find this group

229
00:15:21,949 --> 00:15:27,589
incredibly easy to join and the reason

230
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,109
for that is we're all very kind to each

231
00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:33,059
other but also if you know anything

232
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,069
about testing you can read our

233
00:15:33,059 --> 00:15:39,019
fundamental RFC's which will quickly

234
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:39,019
find out from the list what they are and

235
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:43,739
and get on board with what we try to

236
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:46,709
accomplish here it's a laboratory

237
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:49,409
testing data planes primarily sometimes

238
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,299
control planes and so forth folks who've

239
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:53,579
just joined us the blue sheets have made

240
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,159
it to the front and if you would please

241
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:59,218
sign the blue sheet so that we don't get

242
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,639
a broom a broom closet sized room for

243
00:15:59,219 --> 00:16:05,179
next time that would be much appreciated

244
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:09,989
and let's let's leave that in the back

245
00:16:05,179 --> 00:16:12,839
of course so I just want to give you a

246
00:16:09,989 --> 00:16:15,809
verbal update if you go to data tracker

247
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,309
and look at the BMW G milestones I think

248
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,709
what we have here is an outdated

249
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:21,539
snapshot oh really and I did sit down

250
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:24,839
and do this last year and I looked and

251
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:27,089
it shows with the exception of one all

252
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:30,479
of our milestones are this month so we

253
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:32,699
are technically on track for so only one

254
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:34,739
well okay yes that's true

255
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:37,709
but I'm just saying technically speaking

256
00:16:34,739 --> 00:16:39,719
the clock has not run out August 2019

257
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:42,238
was methodology for next-gen firewall

258
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:46,619
benchmarking okay um other than that

259
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:50,579
everything is December 2019 cool cool

260
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:52,739
okay well yeah well probably you know

261
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:55,949
who try to keep some expectations

262
00:16:52,739 --> 00:17:00,029
realistic and that August 2018 one was

263
00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:03,539
always aspirational so okay I think

264
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:05,699
that's oh yeah and this came up I just

265
00:17:03,539 --> 00:17:08,849
sent comments to the considerations for

266
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:11,429
a containerized infrastructure author

267
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:13,378
team we do have the standard paragraph

268
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:16,259
that helps us get through security

269
00:17:13,378 --> 00:17:18,599
considerations review and feel free to

270
00:17:16,259 --> 00:17:20,490
modify it but always try to put

271
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,748
something like this in because the key

272
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:27,059
part is that we're activities described

273
00:17:24,749 --> 00:17:28,619
in this memo are limited to technology

274
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,019
characterization using controlled

275
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:32,759
stimuli in the laboratory environment

276
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:34,830
you know we had a bunch of people and

277
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:37,139
security go what the hell are you doing

278
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:39,299
and and and then they finally get to the

279
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:41,428
to the end paragraph and they go oh oh

280
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,750
and they've done a bunch of typing and

281
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:46,510
it's you know

282
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,929
it's better if they if they look at this

283
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,480
first I guess I don't know so anyway

284
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:54,130
it's a good it's a good starting place I

285
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,190
don't think this is the final place

286
00:17:54,130 --> 00:18:00,490
feel free to edit this as you go and I

287
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:01,929
guess that's it yeah so I just want to

288
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:06,400
make a quick note especially for

289
00:18:01,929 --> 00:18:08,799
newcomers with new drafts BMW G are only

290
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,340
issues I believe informational track

291
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,500
drafts worse they are RFC's we are not

292
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,510
on the standards track and I bring this

293
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:21,220
up because the last the last document

294
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,340
that we just sent in for publication

295
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:26,020
when in a standards track and Cynthia

296
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,490
actually caught it and came back and

297
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,799
said did you intend this or did you mean

298
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:32,470
for it to be informational and even I

299
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:35,110
missed that so it's easy to do because

300
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:37,480
so much of the IETF tends to be on the

301
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:39,039
standards track and so we tend to

302
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,200
overlook that so I just wanted to call

303
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,480
out hey while you're cutting and pasting

304
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,299
that paragraph that I'll just had on the

305
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,600
screen into your draft we want to make

306
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:51,100
sure that the status is informational

307
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,010
and if you feel there's some particular

308
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,439
need for that exception I guess you

309
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:58,330
could let us know but it should we would

310
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:01,780
generally expect it to be informational

311
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:06,460
and by the way the history and the

312
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:08,530
reason for that is that there was at the

313
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:12,520
time that was sort of decided this group

314
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:18,250
goes back to 1989 by the way there was

315
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:21,280
no process to move testing internet

316
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,870
drafts or RFC's along the standards

317
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,789
track you had to look for

318
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,309
interoperability and prove that

319
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:30,490
interoperability and deployment in order

320
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:32,678
to advance along the standards track so

321
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:34,750
in the IP PM working group IP

322
00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:36,990
performance metrics working group we

323
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:41,850
figured out a way to get our drafts and

324
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:44,260
RFC's on the standards track by proving

325
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:48,490
interoperability in the form of

326
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:51,610
measurement equivalence and we have a

327
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:55,650
process for doing that and that process

328
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,490
would very much apply to benchmarking

329
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:59,620
methodology drafts we could

330
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:01,480
modify it a little bit certainly apply

331
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:05,408
it but nobody has really strongly

332
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:07,990
petitioned to get their draft on the

333
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:11,500
standards track and use some kind of

334
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:13,510
form of measurement equivalents to to

335
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,450
prove that it should be moved up to a

336
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,730
standard so and we've done that

337
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,880
successfully with a couple of the key IP

338
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:24,850
PM specifications let me tell you there

339
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:29,200
was a lot of work but it was worthwhile

340
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:30,879
in the end so this is there's something

341
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,039
we could talk about some more when the

342
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,429
last time I raised this one when the I

343
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,620
ppm process was new people weren't so

344
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:40,779
interested in it in fact our industry

345
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,489
has been just completely satisfied with

346
00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:43,809
taking these informational drafts

347
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:46,929
although they have all these

348
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:48,940
requirements turns in them and building

349
00:20:46,929 --> 00:20:51,580
their equipment to satisfy those

350
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:53,880
requirements so if there's no need from

351
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:56,939
the community then we won't pursue it

352
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:01,720
you guys tell us what you want to do

353
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:04,000
alright thank you for that good point

354
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:09,039
all right so let's let's go back to the

355
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,080
agenda here for a quick look so Tim is

356
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,270
going to be up next with the

357
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:16,080
benchmarking methodology for network

358
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,080
security devices

359
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:51,309
okay so I'm presenting on a working

360
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:52,809
group draft next-generation firewall

361
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,889
performance testing we have a couple of

362
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:58,658
updates we posted a new draft yesterday

363
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:00,159
yeah I think yesterday a new one got

364
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,419
pushed and I'm gonna talk about some of

365
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,309
the changes and just kind of highlight

366
00:22:01,419 --> 00:22:04,570
them

367
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:06,370
um just a quick reminder this is the

368
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:08,500
reminder slide we have going on here

369
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:09,879
this is really creating performance

370
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,440
testing for next generation firewalls

371
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,900
the last IETF draft for benchmarking

372
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,659
firewalls was 15 years ago probably time

373
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:18,309
we updated most of the work hasn't been

374
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:20,200
happening directly on the benchmark

375
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:22,090
working group mailer it's been happening

376
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,770
through a group of companies that have

377
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,559
gotten together at net sec open forum

378
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:28,600
and it's basically two labs three tool

379
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,210
vendors and eight firewall members that

380
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,029
have been working on developing all of

381
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,240
the sections are inside of this so I'm

382
00:22:34,029 --> 00:22:38,320
gonna report on the updates we have

383
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,090
first thing is is we've actually started

384
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,460
beta testing so we have several

385
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:45,370
firewalls that are in labs both at the

386
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,260
UNH iol and a NTC that are actually

387
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:49,149
running testing one of the things we're

388
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,559
doing and it's going to come up is we're

389
00:22:49,149 --> 00:22:52,600
comparing measurements from multiple

390
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,668
tools so we have multiple tools at

391
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,049
multiple labs and we're finding it not

392
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:58,659
everything surprise surprise was

393
00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:00,460
measured exactly the same so we're going

394
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:02,080
through figuring out what makes the most

395
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:04,390
sense you know things like time to first

396
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,918
byte those kind of things we're

397
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,210
negotiating on how to properly measure

398
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,179
it you know one thing we want to make

399
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:12,130
sure as part of this is that no matter

400
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:13,419
where you go what lab you go to or what

401
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:15,700
tool you use you're gonna get the same

402
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:16,840
answer so that's a big part of the

403
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,159
effort that we have right now it's a

404
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,539
beta test and we're also comparing

405
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,880
measurements from different firewalls to

406
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:22,990
see you know what affects them and what

407
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,270
doesn't affect them and I'll talk about

408
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:27,640
more of that in a second some of the

409
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:29,049
output of those that's all ongoing right

410
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,880
now I think we're gonna wrap up probably

411
00:23:29,049 --> 00:23:31,899
in the next before the end of the year I

412
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,510
think we'll have our first set of

413
00:23:31,899 --> 00:23:35,830
results to be companies to publish is

414
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,840
where we're at timeline wise so I know

415
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:39,460
in the Charter we have this date that

416
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,199
we've missed I think we're probably

417
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,789
going to finish the actual testing and

418
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,659
be able to finalize the draft probably

419
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:48,309
by the next ITF will have we should have

420
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:52,690
everything in a better spot to go to

421
00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:54,370
working group last call yeah why are you

422
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:58,120
calling generally so when you go into

423
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,678
UNH or yeah NTC it's paid and yet you

424
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,699
called it beta testing so I'm wondering

425
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,549
it

426
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,570
is there are going to split hairs I'm

427
00:24:03,549 --> 00:24:05,739
just wondering is there something you

428
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,399
think you're missing which is why you're

429
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,570
calling it baby

430
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,969
we're calling it beta because we're

431
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:13,210
going through multiple runs so we do a

432
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:14,950
run and then we adjust we exchange we

433
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,029
exchanged emails discuss then you're

434
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,129
gonna see two of the things that we

435
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,700
weaved in a first round on firewalls and

436
00:24:18,129 --> 00:24:24,309
said oh thank you yeah that's really why

437
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:26,139
we're calling it beta updated firewall

438
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,928
configuration so this is two of them the

439
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:31,678
original draft and now it says must had

440
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:34,330
a should for configuring ACLs and

441
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,889
basically what we found is that you know

442
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,389
obviously that affected performance and

443
00:24:35,889 --> 00:24:40,840
realistically you know most firewalls

444
00:24:37,389 --> 00:24:43,178
out and will have some amount of ACLs so

445
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,070
we said hey every firewall should do

446
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:47,409
this so they all can be measured

447
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,639
correctly and have the right ackles so

448
00:24:47,409 --> 00:24:50,249
we're adding that that was one of the

449
00:24:48,639 --> 00:24:52,449
things you know one of the labs the

450
00:24:50,249 --> 00:24:53,739
firewall vendor didn't have them

451
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:56,080
configured originally and the other labs

452
00:24:53,739 --> 00:24:57,789
did we've worked that out another one

453
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,980
that came up was traffic logging the

454
00:24:57,789 --> 00:25:01,809
original draft said all traffic which

455
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:04,450
obviously is gonna have a big impact on

456
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:07,720
firewall performance we updated it to

457
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,609
say you know flows sue so it doesn't

458
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,549
have to be every packet the first goes

459
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:14,049
through the firewall you know it this

460
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:16,029
was really the performance was going to

461
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:17,769
drastically change every packet had to

462
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:19,149
be logged for the actual testing one

463
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:21,279
thing note when we do this testing we

464
00:25:19,149 --> 00:25:22,748
try to set up the configuration once at

465
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,249
the beginning to see the security of the

466
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:25,869
box and then we use that same

467
00:25:24,249 --> 00:25:27,759
configuration for every one of the test

468
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:31,570
cases so this is the kind of stuff we're

469
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:33,070
working out through the beta the other

470
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,950
updates we made to the draft there are

471
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:36,939
two main things that we made I'm gonna

472
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,139
talk about the second bullet first

473
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,899
because it's just easier to talk about

474
00:25:38,139 --> 00:25:42,100
we had a lot of extra KPIs that weren't

475
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:44,049
necessary and as we went through the

476
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,389
beta testing we said this is this is of

477
00:25:44,049 --> 00:25:48,369
zero value so we removed a lot of those

478
00:25:46,389 --> 00:25:50,439
a lot of the original ideas we've had

479
00:25:48,369 --> 00:25:51,580
we've as we actually run the test and we

480
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,730
find that there wasn't a whole lot of

481
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,899
value so we're removing the extraneous

482
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,179
kpi's if you do add if you can see which

483
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:59,678
ones came out I gave an example of a

484
00:25:58,179 --> 00:26:01,809
couple of test cases where it just made

485
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,429
more sense the other thing we removed

486
00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:07,509
that we weren't currently measuring was

487
00:26:03,429 --> 00:26:09,009
application transaction latency I wasn't

488
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:11,019
sure this was the best KPI to measure

489
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:12,669
things so we took it out and when we

490
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,899
took it out we had a several places

491
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:14,520
where we wanted to measure it we found

492
00:26:13,899 --> 00:26:17,250
better ways

493
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,050
to measure different values so we

494
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,680
basically took it out and found better

495
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:23,399
ways to measure the different

496
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,930
measurements that we have and we're

497
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,700
going and using those going forward we

498
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,200
think we think now we've got it better

499
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:29,550
and like I said we're hoping to wrap the

500
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,960
testing up for the first set of

501
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:35,700
firewalls and then it will be more turn

502
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,880
the crank going forward yeah I think

503
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:50,750
that's everything

504
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:54,630
any questions yes okay yeah it's on okay

505
00:26:50,750 --> 00:27:00,930
Tim I'm wondering how we're best going

506
00:26:54,630 --> 00:27:03,660
to transfer some of the discussion here

507
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:05,580
yeah to the BMW GG lists I've been

508
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:08,010
wondering that as well I I think there's

509
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:10,679
a couple of options yeah okay give me

510
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,930
your ideas yeah well one of them is

511
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:14,400
definitely to do we have a change log

512
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:17,550
we've made some decisions I think some

513
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,020
of that should go directly to the list

514
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:20,970
to the benchmarking list as we go

515
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,540
forward as we've decided some of these

516
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:26,130
things are happening between you know

517
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:27,870
between the benchmarking group we should

518
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:30,240
be clear when we made changes to the

519
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,500
draft what's going on I think now we're

520
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,460
at the point where we should be doing

521
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,930
that so that's something I'm gonna bring

522
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,120
up with the benchmarking working group

523
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:37,710
I'm gonna try to make an effort to match

524
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,939
the two going forward so I think that's

525
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,040
gonna be one of my goals going forward

526
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,870
so we can help give the group more

527
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,490
insight into what's that's kind of a

528
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:47,520
black box situation at the moment which

529
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:49,980
right and it's a I mean it's it's a

530
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:53,400
chance to get additional input yeah

531
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:56,460
input on these I agree on these items I

532
00:27:53,400 --> 00:28:00,120
mean I I appreciate there may be a need

533
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:04,350
to anonymize the specific pieces of

534
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:07,590
equipment involved yeah that's fine to

535
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:10,649
do that we don't really care who who's

536
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:13,230
what broke this yeah and so forth it's

537
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:16,860
really just about how do we clarify

538
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:19,650
things so that measurements clear and it

539
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:24,000
and it ends up sort of ensuring the the

540
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:25,680
kind of multi device equivalent

541
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,640
measurements that I was talking about

542
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,110
that would be great

543
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
yep and then one thing another thing we

544
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,209
did

545
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,970
we did start putting the draft and get

546
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,559
to help us track changes you can

547
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:36,630
definitely make that link available so

548
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,399
that people can see as commits go in and

549
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:40,590
pull request they can people can easily

550
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,850
see what changes are made I will so that

551
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,470
doesn't get at context but I think that

552
00:28:41,850 --> 00:28:44,399
will help I think the next you know the

553
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:46,529
other thing we need to do a better job

554
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,299
is when we decide as a group you know

555
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:49,559
they get together once a week and as a

556
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:51,210
group if we decide to change something

557
00:28:49,559 --> 00:28:52,320
based on the testing that we give that

558
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,580
feedback at this point I think the

559
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,049
drafts far enough along that we should

560
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,570
be getting blow-by-blow at this point

561
00:28:55,049 --> 00:28:59,820
even even before you decide it's it

562
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,840
should be a probably yeah we've got an A

563
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,158
and a B possibility here and what does

564
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,110
the working group think I mean I think

565
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:09,450
that's what that's the level of them

566
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,129
okay there was a time when when you guys

567
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,840
were just developing yeah we were deadly

568
00:29:11,129 --> 00:29:13,860
crashing a lot more I think it's what

569
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,149
the beta testing and if we're at the

570
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
point where you're probably right is I

571
00:29:15,149 --> 00:29:18,600
will make an effort I will bring that

572
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,949
back to the group and say yeah look I

573
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,240
think we're at the point now or when

574
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,470
we're trying to decide these things we

575
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,059
should just go to the whole benchmarking

576
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:25,500
group instead of to the net SEC openers

577
00:29:24,059 --> 00:29:26,759
right right I mean I think that's fair

578
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,610
that that's really got to happen

579
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:31,649
otherwise I can hear you know people say

580
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:35,129
you know this wasn't developed in the

581
00:29:31,649 --> 00:29:37,949
IETF so why should we take it through

582
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:41,250
our standardization process yeah I even

583
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,440
that informational model so let's let's

584
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:50,429
do that okay only I will bring up

585
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:54,120
feedback back to the courtesy so any any

586
00:29:50,429 --> 00:30:06,120
questions about this topic or the topic

587
00:29:54,120 --> 00:30:08,489
of measuring firewalls in general yeah

588
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,459
thanks for the presentation Tim I think

589
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:13,860
I wouldn't expect too many changes any

590
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,450
more hopefully so yeah I completely

591
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:17,758
agree we should have done a better job

592
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,639
and we will try to do a better job in

593
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:24,360
keeping the team WG mailing-list

594
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:26,158
informed but I think from my point of

595
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,149
view I would rather like to try and

596
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,799
progress the draft towards like last

597
00:30:30,149 --> 00:30:36,590
call or something like that not sure

598
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:36,590
what your advice is on that era

599
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:47,940
pardon Oh last call

600
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:57,090
Burton good let's call so yeah I know I

601
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:59,129
appreciate that Carsten yeah yeah it

602
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:02,189
would be III don't think we've had the

603
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:03,990
list discussion yet to warrant that so

604
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:06,720
let's get some let's get some reviews

605
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:10,499
from the benchmarking community and then

606
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:13,200
we can justify that working group last

607
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:16,230
call I think and and I and I appreciate

608
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,789
Carsten that you've given us lots of car

609
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:20,399
cementum that you've given us lots of

610
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:23,240
opportunity to do that I know that I've

611
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:26,428
provided comments I know that others

612
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,950
have sort of held back let's let's put

613
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:32,100
it that way to this point but we need a

614
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:36,899
little wider review on the BMW G list I

615
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:41,129
think that's fair to ask okay okay

616
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:44,389
that's that's the one precondition that

617
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:47,939
we need to meet and of course to get the

618
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:50,490
draft stable and to verify it in orbiter

619
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,360
pilot testing program or are there more

620
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:56,039
preconditions

621
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,289
I think the precondition for us is

622
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:00,570
always to have the conversation on the

623
00:31:58,289 --> 00:32:02,460
list so we can get the eyeballs on it

624
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,918
get folks weighing in and then as chairs

625
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:07,259
we can say yep there's clear consensus

626
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:09,629
here or rough consensus I suppose but

627
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:11,759
some kind of consensus to move this

628
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:13,889
along to working group last call so I

629
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,600
realize I'm one hand saying at that out

630
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:17,820
loud I realize you probably already know

631
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,759
that but it's not a I mean I guess

632
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,899
that's an always precondition there

633
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,119
precondition there's nothing special

634
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:26,039
about it we just want to see it formally

635
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,168
come over onto the list have more of

636
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:30,419
that discussion and then we can easily

637
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:32,460
move it along to presumably looking at

638
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,840
how it's going right now moving this to

639
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,470
working group last call would make sense

640
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,470
at that point

641
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:48,480
thanks Kirsten okay any other comments I

642
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:52,790
don't see anybody else at the microphone

643
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,790
so thank you Tim and Carsten both

644
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:31,690
okay so al Morton is back again this is

645
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:33,710
gonna be a brief presentation on the

646
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:36,280
updates for the back to back frame

647
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,280
benchmark

648
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:55,980
one is this one one up is powerful

649
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:07,700
ah yeah okay thank you ah all right too

650
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:11,179
many buttons let's see so there's been

651
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:15,020
lots of comments on this including from

652
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:16,159
the authors of the search search

653
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:19,879
algorithm dress

654
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:24,740
Maciek Ratko and and at the last meeting

655
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:29,089
Tim Carlin from a UNH offered to provide

656
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:32,328
some comments and so since the original

657
00:34:29,089 --> 00:34:35,060
submission deadline we have addressed

658
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:37,280
vrak COEs comments and you can see all

659
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:39,259
of that going on in the email on the

660
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,929
list I'll and I'll briefly look at the

661
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,960
diffs here in a moment

662
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:47,510
and the comments from Tim also a reply

663
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,570
on the list there so things to keep in

664
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:57,500
mind this is one of several updates to

665
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:59,810
the sections of RFC 2544 and I I

666
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:02,990
realized that there's actually a lot of

667
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:05,779
updates that we've performed there so

668
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:09,049
the previous updates include the ipv6

669
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:13,849
address space updates to reset and

670
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:17,180
restoration MPLS benchmarking is kind of

671
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:19,609
an update to 25:44 and also there's a

672
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:23,509
latency measurement in 2544 which is

673
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:25,400
based on one packet state-of-the-art of

674
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:27,140
all the test equipment around is pretty

675
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:30,770
much that they're measuring at least a

676
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:33,828
sample of packets and very often all the

677
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:37,430
packets and providing a minimum an

678
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:44,480
average and a maximum so I mean that's a

679
00:35:37,430 --> 00:35:46,970
de facto change to what's in 2544 so so

680
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,670
this is this is about measuring buffer

681
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,740
time and trying to correct the

682
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:54,200
measurement of buffer time that we get

683
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,560
when we when we think we've measured it

684
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:02,450
and so we use the simple example of a

685
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:04,880
traffic generator and the on ingress to

686
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,279
the device under test packets are stored

687
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,680
in a buffer there's a header processing

688
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,870
function they're removing packets from

689
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,270
the buffer and then sends a method

690
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:16,339
at the ingress to the receiver and in

691
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:18,680
the in the so in this form of testing

692
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:21,680
ingress burst arrives at the maximum

693
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,930
theoretical frame rate so initially the

694
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,690
frames are buffered and a header

695
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,770
processing removes them and

696
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:29,960
approximately at the measured throughput

697
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,300
rate some we've previously characterized

698
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,790
the throughput we know what this device

699
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:37,910
can do in terms of that header

700
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:40,820
processing rate frames that have not

701
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:43,700
been processed are have been processed

702
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:45,830
are clearly not in the buffer and so the

703
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:49,100
size of the bursts that you send before

704
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:51,970
you send too big a burst and packets or

705
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:55,640
frames are lost it is actually reduced

706
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,560
by the header or the packet frame

707
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,600
processing so that's the calculation

708
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,600
we're trying to put together here and

709
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:05,000
and we do that so that we get a more

710
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:07,130
accurate view of the actual buffers

711
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,060
buffer size and the time that's

712
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:13,190
available so a a few just clarifications

713
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,009
here in the text that we talked about

714
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,460
with the previous testing so the number

715
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:21,050
of back-to-back frames with zero loss

716
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:25,190
reported for a large frame size was

717
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:26,050
unexpectedly long for for large large

718
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:30,350
frames

719
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:34,820
this is cases where the large frames and

720
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:38,779
their frame header rate didn't exceed

721
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:42,080
the frame header processing maximum rate

722
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,270
so basically there were few frames or no

723
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,110
frames in the buffer when you were

724
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:50,660
sending frames at these high frame sizes

725
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:52,700
maximum that you could and the

726
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:54,799
measurement devices would not

727
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,230
necessarily detect that so we've

728
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:02,330
actually got prerequisite testing now to

729
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:05,600
say anytime you've got a test where you

730
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:09,950
you send frames at a particularly when

731
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:12,529
you get a throughput equal to them the

732
00:38:09,950 --> 00:38:14,569
maximum theoretical you don't test for

733
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:17,720
buffer size there it's just not possible

734
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:20,870
that's the way this it's one of the ways

735
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:25,129
that this update improves things and

736
00:38:20,870 --> 00:38:25,880
then it's apparent that the let's see

737
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,140
what's this way

738
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,450
one here it was found that the actual

739
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,670
buffer time in the dot could could be

740
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:33,950
estimated using the results from the

741
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:39,200
throughput tests conducted according to

742
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:41,089
20 section 26 one of RFC 25:44 it's

743
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,700
apparent that the duds frame processing

744
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:45,500
rate tends to increase the implied

745
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:49,040
estimate that's what I've just been

746
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:52,400
talking about according to section 26

747
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,750
point 4 and a calculation using the

748
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,570
throughput measurement can reveal a

749
00:38:53,750 --> 00:39:00,530
corrected estimate so this is the

750
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:04,160
additional text we've added and this is

751
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,810
what that sort of what that that

752
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:11,330
equation looks like although this is a

753
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:14,420
new equation so in the reporting what we

754
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:19,360
have is that we have a table where we

755
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:23,510
ask over repeated tests of the longest

756
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:25,580
burst length of back-to-back frames we

757
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,160
ask that the minimum and maximum and the

758
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:31,549
standard deviation be reported in

759
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,140
addition to the average length and so we

760
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:36,620
have a table that makes that possible

761
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:39,259
and then of Ratko asked hey look you

762
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:40,970
know you're sending these frames at this

763
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,640
maximum theoretical rate the

764
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:49,009
back-to-back rate on the ingress

765
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:51,890
interface what if what if I my tester

766
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:57,110
and I know that I want to understand the

767
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:58,490
frame time of a lesser rate and we

768
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,070
talked about that a little bit this is

769
00:39:58,490 --> 00:40:02,750
the calculation that lets you figure

770
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:05,920
that out so it would be the actual

771
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:10,880
buffer time for a lesser than then

772
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:13,820
back-to-back frame size rate and and

773
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,160
that's the calculation there a report

774
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:18,650
you can report this value as I says now

775
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,040
in section 6 but properly labeled so

776
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:27,080
that it doesn't confuse the the

777
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:29,810
situation and yeah and so this is

778
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,130
basically what I talked about here that

779
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:36,380
there's two factors in creating this

780
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:39,140
corrected buffer time the original

781
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,710
implied buffer time where some of the

782
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,020
frames had

783
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:44,359
remove from the buffer we fight we

784
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,839
figure out how many have been removed by

785
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:49,580
taking the measured throughput over the

786
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,910
maximum theoretical frame rate and

787
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:58,098
that's the factor we reduced this

788
00:40:51,910 --> 00:41:00,040
implied buffer time by so I think that's

789
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:02,599
it

790
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,369
any questions or comments on the

791
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:09,830
comments and questions that were raised

792
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:11,330
seems not so I'm not asking to advance

793
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:15,170
this at this meeting or anything like

794
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:18,500
that but Sara so if you go back to the

795
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:21,830
previous slide he'll in 2544 I know this

796
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,630
is so nitpicky in 2544 there's one

797
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:25,520
instance of standard deviation I had to

798
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:28,700
go back and look to see if it actually

799
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:31,369
calls it out in they do and it says

800
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:33,618
should be reported and I think or excuse

801
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:36,640
me it says should be reported yes and I

802
00:41:33,619 --> 00:41:40,339
think your text calls for go back to one

803
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,170
more it's a three times it should yeah

804
00:41:40,339 --> 00:41:44,170
Oh yours should as well uh not me

805
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:51,619
25:44 is may in yours is should it's not

806
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,240
a huge nitpick I don't think I

807
00:41:51,619 --> 00:41:54,710
particularly care one way or the other I

808
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,868
just wanted to call out hey there is a

809
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:58,790
slight difference there's a lot of

810
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:04,280
differences here so let's you're

811
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:06,290
comfortable with yeah thank you

812
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:13,250
the question is is the group comfortable

813
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:15,109
with should so I see one nod so that's

814
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:17,630
good and I think it's good to

815
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:21,890
characterize the variability as well I

816
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:24,080
mean I think that's a very often the

817
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,270
difference between may and should it has

818
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:29,660
been determined you know in this

819
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:34,099
particular case twenty years ago by the

820
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:39,710
ability to look over the individual

821
00:42:34,099 --> 00:42:42,050
results and I think that you know we're

822
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:45,710
it's it's not a bad idea to make this a

823
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,480
recommend it's still not must so yeah I

824
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,609
think those tests gear equipment

825
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:52,190
manufacturers are going to settle the

826
00:42:49,609 --> 00:42:53,490
the score on mayor should here anyhow

827
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:55,290
right

828
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,729
I just thought I'd ask you know that's

829
00:42:55,290 --> 00:43:00,240
good I'm glad you're glad you made that

830
00:42:56,730 --> 00:43:04,440
check there's only a couple of I mean

831
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:07,950
the the 26.4 section for a description

832
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,810
of this test is extremely concise we've

833
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:13,439
now got like about a six page memo that

834
00:43:09,810 --> 00:43:16,020
goes into this so and and it's you know

835
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,810
and it's doing a lot more than than 26.4

836
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:20,839
ever ever envisioned I think I can't I

837
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:23,220
can't wait to get Scott Brad nurse

838
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:25,020
review so I was gonna ask you that

839
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,819
offline actually I wonder what Scott

840
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:29,810
gonna think about this I don't know but

841
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:32,460
we'll find out I guess I'll have to

842
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:37,560
let's make sure he gets the OP stirrer

843
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:40,880
review I think you'll I think you'll be

844
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,500
glad to see this so any other comments

845
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:45,300
no okay good thank you

846
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,720
so that gets us through all of the

847
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:50,400
working group drafts and now I guess

848
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,700
we're gonna have the remote presentation

849
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,700
from

850
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:12,359
okay again just want to that's the mic

851
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:14,900
work yes okay great

852
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:18,090
hello everybody my name is mano coaster

853
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:20,610
I'm going to replace Rafael holder

854
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:23,190
because he was not able to make it and

855
00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:26,370
I'm trying to be present our and updates

856
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:28,680
for our draft on methodology for vnf

857
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:32,130
benchmarking automation which is now

858
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:39,450
submitted in version 5 um if you go to

859
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:42,240
the next slide this is basically what

860
00:44:39,450 --> 00:44:43,890
happened so far let's go briefly put you

861
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,770
into picture and this draft is about

862
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:48,779
automating benchmarking of virtualized

863
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,600
Network function so it's it's not about

864
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,070
and what measurements actually perform

865
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:55,650
on these virtualized network function

866
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:57,920
it's more about how to specify the

867
00:44:55,650 --> 00:45:01,050
benchmarking experiments and how to

868
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,760
specify the results and and how to

869
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:04,890
automate everything end to end because

870
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,500
general idea is if we have our network

871
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,629
functions entirely developed software we

872
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:13,110
can make much more use of automation and

873
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:19,050
run those experiments fully automated on

874
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:20,880
the next slide we have overview why or

875
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,150
what was updated in the draft first of

876
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,830
all we are presenting in that draft and

877
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:28,830
different models which describe on the

878
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:31,799
one hand how the experiment should be

879
00:45:28,830 --> 00:45:34,080
performed those models are called INF

880
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:36,510
benchmarking descriptors or short we

881
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:39,210
have big E's those descriptors can then

882
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,520
be wrapped or used by automation would

883
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:43,460
actually run those benchmark

884
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,660
well let me updated maybe n fvd

885
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:49,200
specification and we also provide now

886
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:51,420
young models which specify how such a

887
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:53,819
descriptor has to look like and we

888
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:56,370
started to also prevent the morale for

889
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:58,650
me and F performance profile which is in

890
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:00,630
our case the term for describing the

891
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,760
results from such an automated benchmark

892
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:05,070
and also started to develop a young

893
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,360
model for this problem we addressed

894
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,330
comments which were sent to

895
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:12,060
remaining.this by luis on eros and i

896
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:14,029
think they were even more comments

897
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,340
coming up on the mailing list and i

898
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,620
remember comments from even when Rossum

899
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:21,530
they not get addressed but there is

900
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:23,900
upcoming number of reviews on the

901
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:26,740
mailing list which we are working on if

902
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,740
you go to the next slide

903
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,990
yeah this are the main main points in

904
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:35,450
our update this time first of all as I

905
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:38,779
said this means F P P so this is

906
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:40,279
basically a model which gives you the

907
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:42,950
result from such an automated

908
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:46,120
benchmarking procedure and it's

909
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:49,189
basically kind of a template in which

910
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,350
these automation tools can fill in the

911
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:53,330
measurement results so general

912
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:56,020
measurements are divided into tests

913
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:58,910
subdivided into trails and so on and

914
00:46:56,020 --> 00:47:03,140
this model basically describes how you

915
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:05,029
can um give those results in a

916
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,620
structured manner so they become machine

917
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:10,580
readable so you can define different

918
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:12,920
metrics you can define how many trails

919
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,259
are executed things like this and all

920
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,900
this is basically captured by this model

921
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:21,230
so you have a kind of a machine-readable

922
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:23,240
outcome of your benchmarking then the

923
00:47:21,230 --> 00:47:24,950
next point are these young models as I

924
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:27,200
said and those models are right now

925
00:47:24,950 --> 00:47:29,839
available on each F we put the link here

926
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,990
so you can go there and check all those

927
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:35,450
young models this is also something we

928
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,729
have as a question we are not yet sure

929
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:40,520
how to add those who are attached those

930
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:44,300
young models to an ITF draw so we know

931
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:46,220
that the IDF s there are the young

932
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:47,930
modeling rules and we try to follow them

933
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:49,819
and we know that in the data track up

934
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:53,089
there are existing drafts which have

935
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,860
young models designed so our question

936
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:57,050
would be how how to do that how to get

937
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:59,530
our young one attached to this so maybe

938
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:03,350
we can get an answer to this later and

939
00:47:59,530 --> 00:48:05,810
in addition to the draft we also updated

940
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:07,490
our two reference implementations one of

941
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,190
them in young and the other one is TMG

942
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:14,299
bench this was also one one issue which

943
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:15,980
came up I think on ITF 104 that the

944
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,780
journey opens go through was not yet

945
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:19,190
available open source this has changed

946
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,110
no suppose

947
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,780
Huth are available and linked from the

948
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:25,880
graph and on top of that we did first

949
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:27,740
test run with both of the tools and

950
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:29,420
which are

951
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,459
results on the step test ones are also

952
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:33,020
available on github and you can check

953
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:36,380
them out the idea here is that we try to

954
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:38,540
compare if we give both of our towards

955
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,330
the benchmarking description let them

956
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:43,310
run the experiment and how similar are

957
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:45,529
the results obtained by them and do they

958
00:48:43,310 --> 00:48:47,930
really do the same when given the same

959
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:51,619
information and the next slide just

960
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,589
gives a brief example on this and

961
00:48:51,619 --> 00:48:55,700
basically on the left side there is a

962
00:48:53,589 --> 00:48:57,290
picture of the model and on the right

963
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:59,868
side there are the example outputs of

964
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:02,930
two two routes so they are not 100%

965
00:48:59,869 --> 00:49:04,369
aligned but they are pretty close to

966
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:06,618
each other right now we are looking into

967
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:08,270
the details here and this is just to

968
00:49:06,619 --> 00:49:13,430
give you some examples I think we can go

969
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:16,390
out they go to the next slide here and

970
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:19,940
yeah that's basically on our to do list

971
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,890
the BNF piggy as I said we check with

972
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:23,480
our reference implementations and the

973
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,819
same check needs to be done now author

974
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:30,890
for the vnf peepee this is work to be

975
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:32,450
done we are still trying to update those

976
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:35,299
models a bit because we got some

977
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:38,569
additional feedback from our colleagues

978
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,070
so they might be any minor changes and I

979
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,040
think there are a lot of synergies to

980
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:45,200
other drafts in this in this working

981
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:47,089
group especially the young data model

982
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:49,069
for a network interconnection tester

983
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:51,619
management so I'm quite interested in in

984
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:53,839
their presentation maybe we have near

985
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:56,839
sand familiarities or can make our

986
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:58,460
models compatible to each other or

987
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:00,470
something like this so this is something

988
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:05,320
where we think a collaboration might be

989
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:10,700
possible and going to the last slide

990
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:12,260
to recap 0.5 was updated loaded and

991
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:14,060
comments are arriving on the mailing

992
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,910
list we try to capture all of them and

993
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:19,490
address all of them the reference tools

994
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:22,520
are now finally available and from our

995
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:25,848
stage yeah we think the draft becomes

996
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,910
more and more stable and once we are

997
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:30,950
able to add the young models to this ITF

998
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,960
graphs in the data tracker and we would

999
00:50:30,950 --> 00:50:35,750
be interested and what the net next step

1000
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:37,970
could be if we should aim for having a

1001
00:50:35,750 --> 00:50:39,800
last call or something like that that's

1002
00:50:37,970 --> 00:50:41,509
more more like an over questioning

1003
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:46,700
and that's basically everything

1004
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:48,260
thank you okay thank you

1005
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:51,830
Thank You Manuel stay with us for a

1006
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:56,440
moment there um folks who would like to

1007
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:56,440
make comments please go to the mic now

1008
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:12,020
hi ya ibadi Whiteside instruments it is

1009
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:14,029
really relevant you're dropped to the

1010
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:17,509
meat to have a formal way to represent

1011
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:20,630
test results and the idea is good but I

1012
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:24,430
think you need some help with young the

1013
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:27,220
young models I have looked into them and

1014
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:31,750
they really need some review and

1015
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:34,368
refactoring so I can join the discussion

1016
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:37,130
and I think it's going to be a lot of

1017
00:51:34,369 --> 00:51:39,470
changes but if you are dedicated to

1018
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:43,609
working with this draft I can help you

1019
00:51:39,470 --> 00:51:47,089
this one thing ii think this is very

1020
00:51:43,609 --> 00:51:49,279
easy to add the young code to the drafts

1021
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:53,030
if you just look to another draft that

1022
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:56,060
has young and just like i don't know if

1023
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:59,690
you're using xml or directly write it as

1024
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:02,509
text probably xml so just check some of

1025
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:05,090
the sources it is a five-minute efforts

1026
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:09,230
and you can have your iran models okay

1027
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:11,119
okay to discuss and one more thing young

1028
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:17,200
you should write it with capital letters

1029
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:20,270
because it gives bad impression but i

1030
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,879
don't have focus on what you have as

1031
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:25,490
topic on your draft but it should be

1032
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:28,130
done well and you should put really

1033
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:30,709
effort into making it open because all

1034
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:34,780
the tests are going to be integrated

1035
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:38,180
into that so it really needs an effort

1036
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:40,460
okay i think it would be very very happy

1037
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:42,410
to see some feedback to the models as

1038
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:44,420
such because for them we never get

1039
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:50,960
received any feedback so this would be

1040
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:53,369
really really appreciated so and Vlad is

1041
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,589
is being very

1042
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:57,680
modest one of the drafts where you can

1043
00:52:55,589 --> 00:53:00,540
look to see how a yang model is

1044
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,779
incorporated in internet draft is is his

1045
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:06,960
draft on a yang model for control of

1046
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,250
traffic generators okay so that's a

1047
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,470
that's a good place to start and it's

1048
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:12,930
right within our working group as a is a

1049
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,390
good example okay thank you very much

1050
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:20,220
for the pointer I noted and we will have

1051
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:21,930
a look then manual just just to close

1052
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:23,868
the loop on the comment you made on the

1053
00:53:21,930 --> 00:53:26,359
previous slide with the testing results

1054
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:29,970
mm-hmm

1055
00:53:26,359 --> 00:53:31,828
here I'd be very interested to see when

1056
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:36,689
you guys dig into what the differences

1057
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:39,240
weren't here you come back with yeah

1058
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:42,420
what would be noticed and while all

1059
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,209
those experiments are testing a IDs

1060
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,430
system arm which is deployed as a

1061
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:51,930
knocker container and we run traffic

1062
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:54,029
traces through the system and the

1063
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:56,520
difference is on the one side of course

1064
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,900
the absolute numbers because experience

1065
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,660
might be performed on slightly different

1066
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,339
hardware we were more interested at

1067
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:03,990
first into seeing if the trends are the

1068
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:06,240
same and this is something we could

1069
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:08,490
confirm here and don't be confused

1070
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,979
because the colossi exactly is what is

1071
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:13,078
the blue in the one pot is an orange and

1072
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:16,319
the other plot that's a profit of the

1073
00:54:13,079 --> 00:54:18,300
plotting library i guess but the general

1074
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,849
trends seem to be the same and this is

1075
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:24,420
what motivated us to continue and this

1076
00:54:20,849 --> 00:54:26,609
work I think if you write or the goal is

1077
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:28,859
that if we run the experiments on the

1078
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:30,359
exact same machine because it always

1079
00:54:28,859 --> 00:54:32,549
depends on your virtualization

1080
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:34,828
virtualization infrastructure that we

1081
00:54:32,550 --> 00:54:36,810
then try to achieve or want to achieve

1082
00:54:34,829 --> 00:54:40,790
the exact same result and I think from

1083
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,790
our methodology this should be possible

1084
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:46,109
but this needs to be confirmed with

1085
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:47,339
additional experience yeah exactly so I

1086
00:54:46,109 --> 00:54:49,560
think one of the things that we've

1087
00:54:47,339 --> 00:54:51,990
struggled with in BMW ge the

1088
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:54,150
virtualization is how do we confirm the

1089
00:54:51,990 --> 00:54:57,479
ability to run the same test over and

1090
00:54:54,150 --> 00:54:59,250
over and over and I know Al and I

1091
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,230
sometimes differ a little on this but on

1092
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:03,990
one hand you're usually looking to get

1093
00:55:01,230 --> 00:55:06,300
if the exact same variables are run ten

1094
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:09,419
times one would expect the same result

1095
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,910
sometimes we don't and I think there's a

1096
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:13,890
lot of angst around virtualization where

1097
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:17,040
how do you confirm that hey I can run

1098
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:19,560
that same test ten times so that I have

1099
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,330
ten apples to apples comparisons and ten

1100
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:24,210
numbers that I can actually point to to

1101
00:55:21,330 --> 00:55:25,680
say yep this makes sense and so because

1102
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:27,120
you've done a lot of heavy lifting here

1103
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,310
and you said you were digging into it

1104
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:31,589
and I thought okay if you guys could

1105
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:34,380
continue as you update the draft and

1106
00:55:31,590 --> 00:55:36,900
Vlad is helping you when you guys come

1107
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:40,230
back next time in Vancouver possibly and

1108
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:42,420
you present again hey just you know I'd

1109
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:44,730
like to keep focus on that because it's

1110
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:47,700
our heritage and you're also helping us

1111
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:49,980
prove out and solve to say yep we can

1112
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:51,299
actually benchmark and here's how we

1113
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:53,040
went about it and here's what we're

1114
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:54,570
seeing as you're doing it which is

1115
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:57,270
exactly what you've got here I just want

1116
00:55:54,570 --> 00:55:59,250
to make sure you continue to do so yeah

1117
00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:01,770
exactly yeah that's basically on our

1118
00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:05,360
agenda that's one of the main areas of

1119
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:05,360
focus right now thank you

1120
00:56:07,850 --> 00:56:13,290
so I've got a question about these

1121
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:17,250
graphs as well men well you said this

1122
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:20,340
for an intrusion detection system yeah

1123
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:23,940
it's the ricotta I think it was version

1124
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:25,620
three if I if I'm right I think this

1125
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:29,190
example graphs showing the number of

1126
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,930
drop packets and they are made up for

1127
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:33,200
different races with different flow

1128
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:36,720
sizes and so on so in the experiment

1129
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:38,879
folders of the github repository there

1130
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,290
we have specified the more the

1131
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,200
information is available which exact

1132
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:48,960
setup misused couldn't put everything on

1133
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:50,640
the slide okay all right well then we'll

1134
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,580
what take a look at that and and

1135
00:56:50,640 --> 00:57:01,170
appreciate this results presentation a

1136
00:56:53,580 --> 00:57:05,730
bit more okay oh yeah and and have you

1137
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:08,340
tested more than one type of vnf yes

1138
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,750
we haven't compared with those tools but

1139
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:12,240
at least 40 energy bench where I'm

1140
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:14,460
mostly working on we tested not only the

1141
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:17,220
story Qatar and and intrusion detection

1142
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:19,500
system stuff that we we tested couple so

1143
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:20,129
snorts Wakata and so on we also tested

1144
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:25,010
things

1145
00:57:20,130 --> 00:57:27,570
like HTTP proxies load balancers and

1146
00:57:25,010 --> 00:57:29,780
recently we also try to do first

1147
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:32,130
experiments with some IOT like

1148
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,530
virtualized network functions or

1149
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:39,360
specifically different kinds of mqtt

1150
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:41,160
procas and to see if we basically can

1151
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,950
use our approach of describing

1152
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:47,160
experiments with very different kinds of

1153
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:49,799
network functions and that worked well

1154
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,450
even though it always needs to be some

1155
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:54,090
custom tailoring of the experiments of

1156
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:56,040
course and this is basically what gives

1157
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:58,620
us input what might be needed in

1158
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,050
addition in our models so it's kind of

1159
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:03,569
our own cross-check you don't talk food

1160
00:58:01,050 --> 00:58:04,890
at the context so so many well there

1161
00:58:03,570 --> 00:58:09,210
there's enough there's enough

1162
00:58:04,890 --> 00:58:14,879
variability across that list of vnfs

1163
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:18,270
that I feel I feel like you must be in

1164
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:21,390
some sense defining your own vnf

1165
00:58:18,270 --> 00:58:25,650
specific benchmarks to measure as young

1166
00:58:21,390 --> 00:58:27,629
as you do that so that's I mean that's

1167
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:30,000
an important part of our work as well

1168
00:58:27,630 --> 00:58:34,530
and it's usually something that we have

1169
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:38,190
a complete complete sometimes a set of

1170
00:58:34,530 --> 00:58:43,560
internet drafts in order to agree upon

1171
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:47,370
so for I guess for for a load balancer

1172
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:50,820
for example I don't think we've done any

1173
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:52,350
benchmarking work on unload balancers it

1174
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:56,400
would be interesting to get your ideas

1175
00:58:52,350 --> 00:58:59,000
on what the proper metrics are and what

1176
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,490
we can take for that which might be

1177
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:04,680
useful to the rest of the industry ok

1178
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:07,859
yeah we can certainly work on this and

1179
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:11,580
polish those work and and try to provide

1180
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:15,960
for inside Syria yeah and if in

1181
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:18,509
Vancouver we're always good testing

1182
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,700
junkie nerds in this working group if

1183
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:22,620
you wanted to share some of the output

1184
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:24,660
or graphs that you had generated from

1185
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,569
those those are always hugely popular in

1186
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:29,040
BMW G we would thank you for it and I

1187
00:59:27,570 --> 00:59:31,710
realize you're going to refine this

1188
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:33,270
draft but to Al's point you've tested a

1189
00:59:31,710 --> 00:59:33,750
bunch of different types of being apps

1190
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:36,060
and how

1191
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:39,030
being what you were looking at and how

1192
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:41,730
you did that as future potential drafts

1193
00:59:39,030 --> 00:59:44,820
would be hugely beneficial to us testing

1194
00:59:41,730 --> 00:59:47,099
on our own in our day jobs right so I

1195
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:49,290
would encourage you to consider more

1196
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:53,119
than just a little balancing share any

1197
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:59,670
ideas that you have okay okay thank you

1198
00:59:53,119 --> 01:00:00,810
thank you very much so so your work

1199
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:03,810
you're looking for working group

1200
01:00:00,810 --> 01:00:06,869
adoption and in order to get there we

1201
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:09,480
have to have at least some people in the

1202
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:12,390
working group who have looked at the

1203
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:14,310
draft and I think you mentioned let me

1204
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:23,279
look back here I think you you guys did

1205
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:25,020
get some some comments from Luis help me

1206
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,180
out did anybody else provide comments on

1207
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:32,730
the list I know there was even on Ross

1208
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,290
on the guy from again sending an email I

1209
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:36,720
haven't looked into the details yet and

1210
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:39,480
it still needs to be addressed on those

1211
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,459
other two which I am way off so far and

1212
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,680
I think I provided some comments on a

1213
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,970
very early version of this but not since

1214
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,549
oh yeah yeah yeah so um I think I think

1215
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:53,819
before we examine a working group

1216
01:00:50,550 --> 01:01:00,240
adoption let's get a few more reviews

1217
01:00:53,820 --> 01:01:04,920
and sure yeah yeah so we have we have at

1218
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:08,430
least two volunteers Sarah and Vladimir

1219
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:12,089
who will do a review in the interim and

1220
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:15,359
that will help help our case to adopt

1221
01:01:12,089 --> 01:01:21,630
this okay great that would be great to

1222
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:26,869
hear from you anything else from the the

1223
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:30,330
group assembled here seems not okay well

1224
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:36,390
what one thing I've I always want to

1225
01:01:30,330 --> 01:01:38,609
encourage people about is one way that

1226
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:40,950
folks who are proposing new work can

1227
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:46,560
help each other is to read each other's

1228
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:47,578
drafts and perform reviews and even if

1229
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:49,259
it's work you're not familiar

1230
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:52,079
with you may learn something and that's

1231
01:01:49,259 --> 01:01:56,249
good always a good thing

1232
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,859
so consider that as you come to the

1233
01:01:56,249 --> 01:02:01,019
microphone today and then stand here

1234
01:01:58,859 --> 01:02:04,920
boldly asking for the working group to

1235
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:07,848
drop your draft if you get some help by

1236
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:07,849
helping others

1237
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,580
so next up

1238
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:37,970
is the containerized infrastructure only

1239
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,569
will do the presentation and please go

1240
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:43,700
ahead sir

1241
01:02:38,569 --> 01:02:48,109
yep thank you I'm Alan Lee from HP their

1242
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:49,788
draft title is consideration for

1243
01:02:48,109 --> 01:02:54,890
benchmarking natural polymers in

1244
01:02:49,789 --> 01:03:00,440
contrast infrastructure I'm presenting

1245
01:02:54,890 --> 01:03:03,589
briefly the some minor updates for the

1246
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:08,089
huge page up and luma these part of the

1247
01:03:03,589 --> 01:03:11,630
our interest in this rep team so so we

1248
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:14,900
are in this trip to we are trying to how

1249
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:17,239
to configure those things and then what

1250
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:20,569
impacts on those things to containerize

1251
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:25,460
the networks so we are still trying to

1252
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:29,749
find out and then in this a coat on so

1253
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:31,460
we are still try out those things to how

1254
01:03:29,749 --> 01:03:34,999
to configure in them what performance

1255
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:38,140
issues from them just read to you some

1256
01:03:34,999 --> 01:03:41,078
just some we are add some more

1257
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:47,299
explanation about huge pages in nuuma

1258
01:03:41,079 --> 01:03:50,680
pages and some probably the container is

1259
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:54,200
as isolated in the application level and

1260
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:57,730
administrator can set which pages or

1261
01:03:54,200 --> 01:04:04,419
growing wrapper but like like m

1262
01:03:57,730 --> 01:04:08,089
kubernetes or us to use of 500 112

1263
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:11,539
megabytes and i'm but we are still

1264
01:04:08,089 --> 01:04:15,078
trying to for that value and then the

1265
01:04:11,539 --> 01:04:17,660
next next resource being since Numa is

1266
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:23,079
we are still trying to find out what's

1267
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:27,019
going on from this hackathon we are

1268
01:04:23,079 --> 01:04:29,950
still trying to verifying the cpu or

1269
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:31,729
location using current container

1270
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:33,120
container engines

1271
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:38,060
where

1272
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:41,430
- - techniques use : tix

1273
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:44,220
CP schedule and same K and then we are

1274
01:04:41,430 --> 01:04:47,970
measuring throughputs with them - things

1275
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:51,270
with CP variations and next in some we

1276
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:57,720
are still trying to define a huge page

1277
01:04:51,270 --> 01:05:00,780
values but and our results and I'm our

1278
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:05,430
test environment the slides it's from

1279
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:08,880
them the web page so it can you can find

1280
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:12,480
out that and I'm this is our basic a

1281
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:15,870
test pad you know so we can use the EM

1282
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:20,190
the turtle engine traffic generator for

1283
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:26,130
the tracks in some container networking

1284
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:31,410
technology TPK and then and we we use -

1285
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:35,130
m'kay and kinetics natives and and then

1286
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:38,250
the pot won't party some for application

1287
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:40,920
we use the surrogate time and then we

1288
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:43,290
are more a simple one we use there just

1289
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:49,050
forwarding application and part of this

1290
01:05:43,290 --> 01:05:52,830
testing we some some problems on the

1291
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:56,880
some point you know the the between two

1292
01:05:52,830 --> 01:06:00,080
points and I'm we will prepare interface

1293
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:04,230
and then part interfaces we have some

1294
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,810
peg drops which is some error checks the

1295
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:13,940
most packets are dropped on that point

1296
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:16,410
so we still know area and some we are

1297
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:19,250
regenerating him some

1298
01:06:16,410 --> 01:06:21,720
traffic's and reinstalling some

1299
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:25,940
components and then after there's no

1300
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:30,899
know any visual so I'm we finally we are

1301
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:36,000
we are you know the the change the

1302
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:41,660
interfaces the which is the Belarus 100

1303
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:46,940
gigs but we changed the one Jake Intel

1304
01:06:41,660 --> 01:06:51,480
interfaces it works so so we go not

1305
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:53,760
yeah just yeah that is to fear we

1306
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:57,060
are find out in this eckerton and then

1307
01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:04,830
you know yeah so next day be some you

1308
01:06:57,060 --> 01:07:06,750
know with a new new interface or with

1309
01:07:04,830 --> 01:07:09,270
new interfaces and new test bed

1310
01:07:06,750 --> 01:07:15,630
we are still keep trying to find out

1311
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:18,450
more and them you know some is our some

1312
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:21,570
learning from their hackathon and we are

1313
01:07:18,450 --> 01:07:27,870
still keep trying to update new

1314
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:30,690
technologies and and then so now we

1315
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:33,330
still more find out you know what what's

1316
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:36,240
going on the Bala notes interface that's

1317
01:07:33,330 --> 01:07:39,150
the problem on that interfaces but I'm

1318
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:41,930
not quite sure but we're gonna find out

1319
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:44,280
so and so

1320
01:07:41,930 --> 01:07:48,180
so next step on out the next step is

1321
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:52,980
some from your comments and then updates

1322
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:56,879
our thread and then next the BAM double

1323
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:58,230
Hector we will still trying to um our

1324
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,770
experimental things

1325
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:05,310
so finally you know in our dread to we

1326
01:08:01,770 --> 01:08:12,450
are we are still trying to provide how

1327
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:17,300
to set the Numa Numa and memory things

1328
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:24,929
and then we are going to propose some

1329
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:28,170
test beds yeah that's it thank you thank

1330
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:31,440
you thank you very much any questions or

1331
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:34,380
comments about this benchmarking I mean

1332
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:38,509
this is containerization is going to be

1333
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:40,890
the kind of the future of virtualized

1334
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:43,380
deployments we've got you know pretty

1335
01:08:40,890 --> 01:08:48,000
pretty good understanding of the

1336
01:08:43,380 --> 01:08:50,520
hypervisor based virtualization we have

1337
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:54,109
a lot to learn about containers there's

1338
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:54,110
a obvious advantages and

1339
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:59,278
some obviously a lot more things to

1340
01:08:56,399 --> 01:09:00,899
learn about now making that work in

1341
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,600
general I think some people are very

1342
01:09:00,899 --> 01:09:06,839
good at it but they don't talk about

1343
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,520
performance except in loading the images

1344
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:15,049
everybody knows that's going to be

1345
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:21,180
quicker so what one one one additional

1346
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:23,850
point I wanted to make is that your

1347
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:26,250
considerations draft and I think I

1348
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:31,230
mentioned this to you at the to you all

1349
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:35,160
at the the hackfest the considerations

1350
01:09:31,229 --> 01:09:38,429
draft could include some information on

1351
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:40,290
a troubleshooting test setups I think

1352
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:42,839
you know your you guys are generally

1353
01:09:40,290 --> 01:09:47,430
going to get some good experience doing

1354
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:50,430
that and some of the tricks and tools

1355
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:52,259
and getting a set up working things that

1356
01:09:50,430 --> 01:09:55,530
you could recommend these are these are

1357
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:58,320
also considerations with a new

1358
01:09:55,530 --> 01:10:02,009
technology that I think everybody is

1359
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:05,880
going to appreciate so feel free to add

1360
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:09,000
your experiences there I'll go ahead sir

1361
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:11,670
I would extend that to say it would be

1362
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:14,430
nice to see the outcome from the

1363
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:16,050
hackathon and on one hand it's always

1364
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:17,520
frustrating I think when you go into the

1365
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:19,920
hackathon and things don't work

1366
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:21,660
perfectly but you're also experiencing I

1367
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,900
think a lot of what we are experiencing

1368
01:10:21,660 --> 01:10:28,099
in the field right now outside of ITF

1369
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:29,969
just in our day jobs and so capturing a

1370
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:32,340
presenting what you're seeing in

1371
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:35,370
hackathon in BMW G would be helpful and

1372
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:36,810
then extending that to hey as you're

1373
01:10:35,370 --> 01:10:38,940
learning things and troubleshooting

1374
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:41,100
through the hackathon adding that to in

1375
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:44,429
terms of your troubleshooting or things

1376
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:46,620
learned or best practices or and then

1377
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:49,380
thoroughly documenting the test beds I

1378
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:52,800
know you're going to present future test

1379
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:55,770
beds but formally documenting what was

1380
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:58,530
used is helpful because I think again

1381
01:10:55,770 --> 01:11:00,150
we're seeing huge differences I've seen

1382
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:02,070
huge differences depending on the NIC

1383
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:04,259
that I use and it's interesting you're

1384
01:11:02,070 --> 01:11:06,360
saying the exact same thing and I don't

1385
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,910
think this is unique to us but again it

1386
01:11:06,360 --> 01:11:09,190
helps

1387
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:10,960
we set up a test bed to understand off

1388
01:11:09,190 --> 01:11:12,519
if I really need it to work at least I

1389
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,310
can point back to this draft and know uh

1390
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:17,980
here's what they used and here's what I

1391
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:21,460
saw and so it gives me some hope or a

1392
01:11:17,980 --> 01:11:24,459
good sane starting place to go does that

1393
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:27,510
make sense yeah okay thank you thank you

1394
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:31,390
yeah we are shooting our results always

1395
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:37,090
from this website and I'm will welcome

1396
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:43,630
to your comments thank you Thanks

1397
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:46,990
I'll just mention two I'll mention two

1398
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:51,370
that among our slides I put the the

1399
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:54,370
hackathon slides and it's sort of the

1400
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:57,820
next deck in the list behind this one

1401
01:11:54,370 --> 01:11:59,740
and you know you can see there some of

1402
01:11:57,820 --> 01:12:02,500
the additional experiences that this

1403
01:11:59,740 --> 01:12:05,849
author team was kind enough to share in

1404
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:09,130
their in their three-minute presentation

1405
01:12:05,850 --> 01:12:11,410
we all get three minutes but it was it

1406
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:14,500
was an excellent opportunity to spend

1407
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:16,960
some more time together with Vladimir

1408
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:19,750
and and and also with the whole

1409
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:22,000
containerized infrastructure team we sat

1410
01:12:19,750 --> 01:12:25,480
together in a couple of a couple tables

1411
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,980
side by side and we're able to give

1412
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:28,719
little presentations about what we're

1413
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:32,440
doing and then subsequently the results

1414
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:36,220
of our tests I highly encourage that so

1415
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:39,219
folks who have the ability to use the

1416
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:44,020
hackathon as you know kind of a

1417
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:47,230
measurement experience exchange it's

1418
01:12:44,020 --> 01:12:50,590
it's a great idea I was I can tell you

1419
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:52,929
last last year that here in Singapore

1420
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,520
two years ago in Singapore I guess it

1421
01:12:52,930 --> 01:12:56,710
was I was struggling with a particular

1422
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:01,030
configuration I couldn't get it going

1423
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:03,300
and I got a lot of help but I had to

1424
01:13:01,030 --> 01:13:07,030
leave without getting it going

1425
01:13:03,300 --> 01:13:10,090
so in the next couple of weeks though I

1426
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:12,849
did get some help and that was the kind

1427
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:15,310
of thing that made a difference so in

1428
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:16,840
any case it it helps to have more more

1429
01:13:15,310 --> 01:13:19,860
eyes on what you're trying to accomplish

1430
01:13:16,840 --> 01:13:22,130
this is a great place to do it

1431
01:13:19,860 --> 01:13:22,130
Thanks

1432
01:13:25,960 --> 01:13:28,590
right

1433
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:34,360
so like I said these are the these are

1434
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:44,770
the hackathon slides but we do not show

1435
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:46,269
you is today now we've got Vlad it was

1436
01:13:44,770 --> 01:13:52,239
also at the heck of my life I just

1437
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:55,739
mentioned and yeah and got to talk to us

1438
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:55,739
about the network interconnect tester

1439
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:08,650
and this is your this is your most

1440
01:14:04,450 --> 01:14:13,179
recent version of slides yeah

1441
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:24,219
those are exactly as I want them text

1442
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:26,940
only except one just nobler experience

1443
01:14:24,219 --> 01:14:26,940
talking to people

1444
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:41,290
Thanks

1445
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:43,960
sorry yeah so I just wonder if anyone is

1446
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:47,350
interested in the draft by the title or

1447
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:50,280
if someone has read it or is generally

1448
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:56,200
interested in young or test generators

1449
01:14:50,280 --> 01:14:58,870
so a young model for test generator

1450
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:02,679
that's what this aims at so when you

1451
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:05,170
configure t-rex for example in order to

1452
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:09,040
generate traffic you do it with some

1453
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:11,620
interface if it's XML or a graphical

1454
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,620
interface this is just a way to

1455
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:20,590
configure a stateless traffic generator

1456
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:23,950
and analyzer with young so that it can

1457
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:28,060
be used in a net comp interface in the

1458
01:15:23,950 --> 01:15:30,219
same way as a switch or router when you

1459
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:33,310
test them you won't don't want to use

1460
01:15:30,219 --> 01:15:34,600
different interfaces at least until now

1461
01:15:33,310 --> 01:15:36,790
if there are different interfaces

1462
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:42,280
without one need to use this skippy

1463
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:44,260
which is meant for free

1464
01:15:42,280 --> 01:15:46,360
nc analyzers and things like that they

1465
01:15:44,260 --> 01:15:47,760
use that interface very successfully

1466
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:50,920
actually that's one of the best

1467
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,650
interface you can get and that's

1468
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:57,670
outdated it's not for networking and I

1469
01:15:53,650 --> 01:16:01,420
think young can that confess what has to

1470
01:15:57,670 --> 01:16:13,330
come at some point so this is what this

1471
01:16:01,420 --> 01:16:15,360
draft is about so this is giving a

1472
01:16:13,330 --> 01:16:18,700
summary of the deficiencies of the

1473
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:22,299
current approach by all the companies

1474
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:25,780
that develop traffic generators and

1475
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:28,210
analyzers in other words code network

1476
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:35,889
interconnect testers which is a term

1477
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:39,400
that comes from RFC 25:44 now there is

1478
01:16:35,890 --> 01:16:43,090
no standard based major vaunt interface

1479
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:45,280
or those devices so it is taken from

1480
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:50,040
different industries and adopted to

1481
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:52,269
networking there is no multi vendor

1482
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:54,730
interoperability you can buy two

1483
01:16:52,270 --> 01:16:55,960
different traffic generators and they

1484
01:16:54,730 --> 01:16:58,750
will have absolutely different

1485
01:16:55,960 --> 01:17:01,510
interfaces you can use a lot of time

1486
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:03,340
developing tests and then you cannot

1487
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:07,300
move to another company because you have

1488
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:09,250
used the interface that is absolutely

1489
01:17:07,300 --> 01:17:14,610
different from everything else you don't

1490
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:16,960
have that choice 3 they don't have a

1491
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:21,820
transactional model definition which

1492
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:23,770
means this is what you can get with

1493
01:17:21,820 --> 01:17:25,599
young in that conf and this can allow

1494
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:29,190
you to actually simulate a traffic

1495
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:34,660
generator in discrete event simulation

1496
01:17:29,190 --> 01:17:39,280
so if you want to specify a traffic

1497
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:42,430
generator in a simulator you really

1498
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:45,759
can't do it with something that already

1499
01:17:42,430 --> 01:17:47,770
exists and is standardized by the ITF so

1500
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:54,940
people in that industry are defining

1501
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:59,580
their own models to do that and there

1502
01:17:54,940 --> 01:18:02,290
no standard for generating reports that

1503
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:07,809
document absolute any transaction that

1504
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:10,630
you do to those devices so he comes net

1505
01:18:07,810 --> 01:18:14,350
confettis intentionally made to be

1506
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:15,910
readable by humans so that all the

1507
01:18:14,350 --> 01:18:19,900
transaction with the equipment you can

1508
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:21,910
just walk to a file and you can use it

1509
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:27,429
as a legal document this is a big

1510
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:29,320
advantage so how does ITF young dot

1511
01:18:27,430 --> 01:18:36,580
model for network interconnect

1512
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:38,730
estimation solve these problems a very

1513
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:43,360
important point is to have multi vendor

1514
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:45,400
interoperability tools can be reused you

1515
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:47,769
have a what-if net convenient tools

1516
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:52,480
available you will be able to use those

1517
01:18:47,770 --> 01:18:54,610
with any generator and analyzer test

1518
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:56,889
programs you can write that that are

1519
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:59,230
going to be compatible the generator is

1520
01:18:56,890 --> 01:19:03,120
going to appear just like a replaceable

1521
01:18:59,230 --> 01:19:05,879
bricks so you can buy from different

1522
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:09,730
manufacturers and they will seamlessly

1523
01:19:05,880 --> 01:19:12,400
be replaced and one advantage is that

1524
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:15,989
you can actually have self tests written

1525
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,940
in open source language so that you can

1526
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:21,639
adjust parameters and verify that your

1527
01:19:18,940 --> 01:19:23,530
traffic generator satisfies those

1528
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:25,600
requirements so if you have an Python

1529
01:19:23,530 --> 01:19:29,139
script that does self tests you can

1530
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:31,120
change values and figure out exactly

1531
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:34,420
what it's jitter point is for different

1532
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:37,690
traffic patterns you can't do that today

1533
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:39,489
he have to just trust the manufacturer

1534
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:42,759
you buy a traffic generator from you

1535
01:19:39,489 --> 01:19:45,389
just have no way of proving he doesn't

1536
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:47,820
do something right and you can do it but

1537
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:54,430
it's not easy

1538
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:56,889
so transactional nature if not confer

1539
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:00,400
also if you have common commits which

1540
01:19:56,890 --> 01:20:03,370
ends every time it won't actually affect

1541
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,949
the device in a way now this is done

1542
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:08,719
with different commands start commands

1543
01:20:05,949 --> 01:20:13,269
which are specific to the interfaces or

1544
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:16,340
- anything else with this you can do

1545
01:20:13,270 --> 01:20:18,320
device changes in parallel so you send

1546
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:20,000
them commit to all the device in the

1547
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:22,219
network and they start applying the

1548
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,560
changes simultaneously you can't do it

1549
01:20:22,219 --> 01:20:26,449
today if you have multiple generators

1550
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:29,480
you have to do the specific changes

1551
01:20:26,449 --> 01:20:31,699
which started the traffic generation and

1552
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:33,349
you can't just automate it by sending

1553
01:20:31,699 --> 01:20:38,269
commit to everything after you have

1554
01:20:33,350 --> 01:20:41,540
prepared the candidate database and if

1555
01:20:38,270 --> 01:20:45,800
that's the reason it's not scalable it's

1556
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:48,080
not easy to document and it doesn't have

1557
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:50,120
any support in discreet simulators so

1558
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:52,910
you don't have a model for each to test

1559
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:54,680
their in on that plus plus that you can

1560
01:20:52,910 --> 01:20:57,650
just put with the configuration you will

1561
01:20:54,680 --> 01:21:03,770
use on a real device all this can change

1562
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:05,719
with a standard model yeah that's this

1563
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:09,010
standard session that you can just

1564
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:13,910
capture and you have a ready document

1565
01:21:09,010 --> 01:21:16,430
for the test you have performed so in

1566
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:21,880
the hackathon we wanted to demonstrate

1567
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:25,910
this concept it works so we took our C

1568
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:28,699
2544 setup and we picked some real

1569
01:21:25,910 --> 01:21:32,660
devices that generate nice traffic in

1570
01:21:28,699 --> 01:21:35,169
hardware so taken with this diagram

1571
01:21:32,660 --> 01:21:38,269
which is one of the the diagrams there

1572
01:21:35,170 --> 01:21:42,949
we wanted to have Python scripts that

1573
01:21:38,270 --> 01:21:46,670
takes the input in XML and produce the

1574
01:21:42,949 --> 01:21:48,919
results in XML now we didn't accomplish

1575
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:52,510
that part because this is what the

1576
01:21:48,920 --> 01:21:57,020
previous draft was about where you have

1577
01:21:52,510 --> 01:22:00,350
standard common input for the tests and

1578
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:06,100
a common place to store the results what

1579
01:22:00,350 --> 01:22:06,100
we did was it creates a physical setup

1580
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:19,160
this is the running hardware that's

1581
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:22,580
needed and we managed to make a simple

1582
01:22:19,160 --> 01:22:26,510
trail that complies with the twenty

1583
01:22:22,580 --> 01:22:29,480
5:44 RFC so when they discussed trails

1584
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:32,510
in the previous draft that they're going

1585
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:34,490
to be registered in that result XML they

1586
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:37,100
have to be described some somehow and

1587
01:22:34,490 --> 01:22:40,510
that's what we do with that traffic

1588
01:22:37,100 --> 01:22:44,030
generator model we describe a trail

1589
01:22:40,510 --> 01:22:46,510
which generates the traffic so we have

1590
01:22:44,030 --> 01:22:50,210
that in github these are the results and

1591
01:22:46,510 --> 01:22:52,790
I think it's interesting for anyone who

1592
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:54,470
is wondering how this young is going to

1593
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:56,870
be used to write a simple Python script

1594
01:22:54,470 --> 01:23:00,470
to configure things compared to what's

1595
01:22:56,870 --> 01:23:03,860
available today that's the two pi two

1596
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:05,960
scripts that are they are using a young

1597
01:23:03,860 --> 01:23:08,450
CI which makes young in that comes much

1598
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:10,880
simple you don't need to deal with XML

1599
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:13,370
on the command level you just do it on

1600
01:23:10,880 --> 01:23:15,320
the replies that you get so I really

1601
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:17,599
recommend that for people doing testing

1602
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:20,809
and I used to come and whine and Skippy

1603
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,790
and interfaces like that and then you

1604
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:26,120
have the reports generated which I

1605
01:23:22,790 --> 01:23:28,550
mentioned to it not confer so and you

1606
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:31,340
have a configuration which actually is

1607
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:33,620
based on this topology level specifying

1608
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:36,080
how all these devices are connected so

1609
01:23:33,620 --> 01:23:37,900
that the test has the credentials to

1610
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:41,769
connect to each of the devices

1611
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:44,660
here's the models and can actually

1612
01:23:41,770 --> 01:23:48,500
figure out things without you specifying

1613
01:23:44,660 --> 01:23:50,389
everything on the command line this is

1614
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:54,830
how the test is run so when you want to

1615
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:56,540
run one trail sending packets from the

1616
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:59,930
one port going on the other on that

1617
01:23:56,540 --> 01:24:02,300
switch that we used you use a set net

1618
01:23:59,930 --> 01:24:04,400
command which initializes everything on

1619
01:24:02,300 --> 01:24:07,280
that nuts with a fixed spread affiant

1620
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:11,299
setup in XML and then you start the

1621
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:16,309
tests which execute in this case it

1622
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:18,290
executed 64 bytes with very big

1623
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:20,930
interframe gap if you notice here and

1624
01:24:18,290 --> 01:24:26,510
I'll explain why why we have to do that

1625
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:29,870
so the switch that we use for tests and

1626
01:24:26,510 --> 01:24:32,930
was working very well on hardware mode

1627
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:34,940
when it was no no futures defined and

1628
01:24:32,930 --> 01:24:35,730
our no puck is dropped actually you have

1629
01:24:34,940 --> 01:24:37,889
to run

1630
01:24:35,730 --> 01:24:41,219
Mary Wong sequence to get pocket walls

1631
01:24:37,890 --> 01:24:43,860
and but when weakened fear it in a

1632
01:24:41,220 --> 01:24:46,650
special mode which makes it up as open

1633
01:24:43,860 --> 01:24:49,410
force which it does it in software and

1634
01:24:46,650 --> 01:24:52,170
it is listed by the manufacturer this

1635
01:24:49,410 --> 01:24:54,739
just experimental and it works but it

1636
01:24:52,170 --> 01:24:58,890
drops most of the pockets as you can see

1637
01:24:54,739 --> 01:25:01,950
you get you have less than one percent

1638
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:07,680
of the traffic and so that it doesn't

1639
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:10,800
drop pockets and that's simply unusable

1640
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:15,780
but it is possible to enable it and

1641
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:19,500
that's for my case just perfect so we we

1642
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:24,179
had a run which washes with nine

1643
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:26,400
thousand this is 9 times 1 K and this is

1644
01:25:24,180 --> 01:25:29,070
how the result looks when it is dropping

1645
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:32,489
so many pockets you get 60 seconds of

1646
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:35,519
run you generate a lot of pockets there

1647
01:25:32,489 --> 01:25:37,589
is a lot of thoughts being dropped and

1648
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:40,730
these from the border before that it's

1649
01:25:37,590 --> 01:25:44,100
even worse so when we get to 9 K of

1650
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:45,959
interframe gap between each pocket of 64

1651
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:50,280
bytes then it starts working much better

1652
01:25:45,960 --> 01:25:53,460
and in the next test with 10 K it starts

1653
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:55,440
working without doors so this is

1654
01:25:53,460 --> 01:25:57,450
something that the bandwidth test would

1655
01:25:55,440 --> 01:25:59,370
do automatically we did it manually

1656
01:25:57,450 --> 01:26:03,300
because we didn't make the search

1657
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:06,360
algorithm and but the the positive thing

1658
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:09,060
is that we made simple scripts that does

1659
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:11,910
that and then this can be reproduced and

1660
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:16,230
code automatically but this you have to

1661
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:18,030
do in a in the next pass so this how it

1662
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:20,459
looks when it is not dropping any

1663
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:25,559
pockets it gets about one point two

1664
01:26:20,460 --> 01:26:33,060
milliseconds of latency and you can

1665
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:36,000
compare it with this then it's yeah so

1666
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:37,739
the results are not particularly

1667
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:41,100
practical this is not something you

1668
01:26:37,739 --> 01:26:45,089
would get on a regular switch but we we

1669
01:26:41,100 --> 01:26:48,280
used net conf interface with young

1670
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:51,400
models on all the three devices

1671
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:53,889
and the switch was configured as a for

1672
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:56,589
capable device having a wrapper around

1673
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:58,510
the open for presenting it as an that

1674
01:26:56,590 --> 01:27:01,650
convenient device so there's a pure

1675
01:26:58,510 --> 01:27:07,330
young system based on generators and a

1676
01:27:01,650 --> 01:27:09,790
breech which I I have been looking

1677
01:27:07,330 --> 01:27:12,070
forward to accomplish for us for some

1678
01:27:09,790 --> 01:27:17,200
time I'm very happy that we made it even

1679
01:27:12,070 --> 01:27:20,110
though yeah so that's about it that's

1680
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:22,710
the the references if anyone is

1681
01:27:20,110 --> 01:27:24,790
interested in that topic I really

1682
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:26,860
recommend if you're doing anything with

1683
01:27:24,790 --> 01:27:30,250
young and net conf and you're

1684
01:27:26,860 --> 01:27:31,929
configuring devices in order to test

1685
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:34,060
them to walk into the Python scripts

1686
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:35,730
because you don't want a controller in

1687
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:38,830
your way when you are testing a device

1688
01:27:35,730 --> 01:27:40,839
you want to have a direct access so that

1689
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:43,570
that's the device and not the controller

1690
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:46,480
and I haven't seen any good automation

1691
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:47,980
scripts around there so this is good

1692
01:27:46,480 --> 01:27:53,049
experience and I recommend it to

1693
01:27:47,980 --> 01:27:59,980
everyone who's interested yeah so that's

1694
01:27:53,050 --> 01:28:01,950
about it it's really good the every

1695
01:27:59,980 --> 01:28:06,759
statement you made about sort of the

1696
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:08,139
University of the yang model anybody

1697
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:13,180
who's been around IETF for a while

1698
01:28:08,140 --> 01:28:14,650
should resonate with that and don't run

1699
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:19,290
away maybe there's going to be some

1700
01:28:14,650 --> 01:28:21,969
questions or comments here for you I

1701
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:26,830
think well you and I exchanged some mail

1702
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:31,630
on the on the mailing list and I think

1703
01:28:26,830 --> 01:28:34,980
you've covered those points the I was

1704
01:28:31,630 --> 01:28:39,310
basically asking or kind of verifying

1705
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:42,940
where this fits in the sort of in the

1706
01:28:39,310 --> 01:28:46,210
hierarchy of the the complete turnkey

1707
01:28:42,940 --> 01:28:51,759
test device and what was clarified I

1708
01:28:46,210 --> 01:28:53,950
think as Vladimir said was the yang

1709
01:28:51,760 --> 01:28:57,490
model basically commands the the test

1710
01:28:53,950 --> 01:29:00,309
equipment into one configuration but

1711
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:02,080
very often we want to run multiple

1712
01:29:00,310 --> 01:29:05,430
trials that that can

1713
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:08,260
figuration so you'd basically repeat the

1714
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:11,440
repeat the test and then if you wanted

1715
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:15,610
to use a search algorithm you would

1716
01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:17,259
change those parameters and run it so as

1717
01:29:15,610 --> 01:29:19,750
you said you were running it manually

1718
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:21,460
that's completely possible to do but a

1719
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:25,900
lot of people want to do this it sort of

1720
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:28,270
in an automated way and that's a that's

1721
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:34,059
logic that would operate and use this

1722
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:35,650
gang model to accomplish it right yeah

1723
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:39,670
actually I think the the search

1724
01:29:35,650 --> 01:29:42,929
algorithm is not difficult to develop on

1725
01:29:39,670 --> 01:29:46,540
this infrastructure is working the

1726
01:29:42,930 --> 01:29:48,940
tireless days and nights to get this

1727
01:29:46,540 --> 01:29:52,150
working going to actually dealing with

1728
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:55,389
issues with the young parser the net

1729
01:29:52,150 --> 01:29:57,070
conf interface and now that it's ready I

1730
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:59,440
haven't spent a single minute thinking

1731
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:00,910
about the search algorithm logic but I

1732
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:03,129
think there are a lot of people that can

1733
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:05,500
implement this without investing time

1734
01:30:03,130 --> 01:30:08,020
into the issues that I have been dealing

1735
01:30:05,500 --> 01:30:10,330
with and they're poorly specialists who

1736
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:12,880
have already done this so they can just

1737
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:15,730
just take this function that returns

1738
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:18,400
them results and they can provide the

1739
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:20,889
parameters and they can just play with

1740
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:26,259
that if someone is interested I'm their

1741
01:30:20,890 --> 01:30:30,300
Institute to work with him we've got

1742
01:30:26,260 --> 01:30:33,100
actually several I mean several

1743
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:34,360
candidate search algorithms being

1744
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:37,300
discussed here

1745
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:43,360
those guys are the Maciek and Greko or

1746
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:46,060
the experts in their algorithms and I

1747
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:47,920
guess they're using the t-rex tool so

1748
01:30:46,060 --> 01:30:50,440
they've they've already got those going

1749
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:53,680
but it would be good for them to kind of

1750
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:56,799
look at this and see how they can how

1751
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:58,960
they can help also I mean we have one

1752
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:03,030
let me just go back here for a moment

1753
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:06,480
because I saw in the picture

1754
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:09,550
Vladimir's excellent and transportable

1755
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:12,580
test setup is is what's dominating the

1756
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:14,870
picture here but behind it is my laptop

1757
01:31:12,580 --> 01:31:17,120
and my little black

1758
01:31:14,870 --> 01:31:20,240
bare metal tester that I was using in

1759
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:23,300
the IP capacity testing so you know I I

1760
01:31:20,240 --> 01:31:26,290
had a much more efficient fits in my

1761
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:29,210
backpack kind of set up for my testing

1762
01:31:26,290 --> 01:31:30,320
but oh there's a search algorithm we're

1763
01:31:29,210 --> 01:31:32,570
using there as well

1764
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:34,340
so that may be something we can look

1765
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:36,500
into because I think I mean there's

1766
01:31:34,340 --> 01:31:39,590
there's clear crossover between what

1767
01:31:36,500 --> 01:31:41,990
we've learned in the benchmarking world

1768
01:31:39,590 --> 01:31:44,630
and implemented in the binary search

1769
01:31:41,990 --> 01:31:46,760
with loss verification when we went to

1770
01:31:44,630 --> 01:31:49,250
do the production Network search

1771
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:52,280
algorithm that we use in this IP

1772
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:55,310
capacity testing sort of the access

1773
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:58,460
links so it's a there's a there's a good

1774
01:31:55,310 --> 01:32:01,400
I think if you've done an excellent job

1775
01:31:58,460 --> 01:32:03,170
and left a good break point for others

1776
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:13,099
to to jump in with their expertise

1777
01:32:03,170 --> 01:32:15,620
that's that's a good point one yeah yeah

1778
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:19,460
hello thanks for the presentation really

1779
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:21,470
cool so what I don't understand yet is

1780
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:25,430
you know what is the relationship of

1781
01:32:21,470 --> 01:32:27,500
this draft going to be to existing test

1782
01:32:25,430 --> 01:32:30,080
methodology RCS

1783
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:33,050
so typically I know from mother I kept

1784
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:36,740
working groups that yang model RFC's are

1785
01:32:33,050 --> 01:32:38,810
linked to protocol Arty's so I wasn't

1786
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:40,940
sure whether that was registry or point

1787
01:32:38,810 --> 01:32:44,420
here if you are trying to create an IRC

1788
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:46,370
for a young model covering RC 2544 or

1789
01:32:44,420 --> 01:32:48,410
any you know related stuff or just

1790
01:32:46,370 --> 01:32:53,540
everything that's question one and

1791
01:32:48,410 --> 01:32:54,889
question two is the main problem from my

1792
01:32:53,540 --> 01:32:57,890
point of view is not only configuration

1793
01:32:54,890 --> 01:33:01,070
it's also reporting from its do you have

1794
01:32:57,890 --> 01:33:05,210
any thoughts on those what was the most

1795
01:33:01,070 --> 01:33:07,820
part of the question part of the

1796
01:33:05,210 --> 01:33:10,340
question was the main one of the main

1797
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:13,219
problems is not only provisioning a test

1798
01:33:10,340 --> 01:33:18,290
tool like understanding how to configure

1799
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:23,450
it but also how to get the results okay

1800
01:33:18,290 --> 01:33:27,560
I understand a question the goal is very

1801
01:33:23,450 --> 01:33:28,429
specific it is alternative to the

1802
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:32,470
current

1803
01:33:28,430 --> 01:33:37,450
the existing interfaces to the

1804
01:33:32,470 --> 01:33:40,880
interconnect testers so it allows you to

1805
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:44,210
measure things with interconnect tester

1806
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:45,980
it doesn't focus on how those results

1807
01:33:44,210 --> 01:33:51,200
are going to be reported

1808
01:33:45,980 --> 01:33:52,570
it doesn't even focus on RFC 25:44 the

1809
01:33:51,200 --> 01:33:57,070
good thing is that

1810
01:33:52,570 --> 01:34:00,830
2544 is a very simple elegant algorithm

1811
01:33:57,070 --> 01:34:04,330
using only stateless traffic and it is

1812
01:34:00,830 --> 01:34:07,870
perfect much for what this interface

1813
01:34:04,330 --> 01:34:13,840
accomplishes so you can implement

1814
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:17,630
2544 algorithm using that interface the

1815
01:34:13,840 --> 01:34:19,280
young modules they are extendable so

1816
01:34:17,630 --> 01:34:23,110
they are going to be extended by

1817
01:34:19,280 --> 01:34:26,300
different features different complexity

1818
01:34:23,110 --> 01:34:30,139
but they are presenting a stable base

1819
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:34,640
for for that so this is doing like the

1820
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:37,970
base for adding stateful generation more

1821
01:34:34,640 --> 01:34:41,030
complicated analysis and custom

1822
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:43,580
protocols and algorithms so this is as

1823
01:34:41,030 --> 01:34:50,860
simple as being able to specify a

1824
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:53,600
repeated sequential pattern with like

1825
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:55,130
precision and determinism that is needed

1826
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:58,700
for this kind of technologies that

1827
01:34:55,130 --> 01:35:01,130
require it so in my case we were using

1828
01:34:58,700 --> 01:35:03,679
an FPGA hardware to do that because

1829
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:05,720
that's why you need it you could use

1830
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,900
t-rex if you didn't really care about

1831
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:11,270
the determinism you can just generate

1832
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:15,349
the water pockets but if you really want

1833
01:35:11,270 --> 01:35:18,290
to generate RFC 25:44 traffic which is

1834
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:21,020
equally spaced with interframe gap which

1835
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:22,610
is repeatable and doesn't jitter then

1836
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:24,080
really you need the hardware generator

1837
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:26,960
that's why people are buying those

1838
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:29,269
devices with this model you are

1839
01:35:26,960 --> 01:35:31,400
specifying actually a configuration that

1840
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:34,370
goes into the hardware you can implement

1841
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:38,240
it in software as well of course but it

1842
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:40,070
is mainly targeting deterministic hard

1843
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:41,599
regeneration so you are specifying the

1844
01:35:40,070 --> 01:35:45,739
table of

1845
01:35:41,599 --> 01:35:48,380
of streams how they're going to be

1846
01:35:45,739 --> 01:35:50,659
separated they're going to be a burst

1847
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:52,760
what kind of bucket is going to be

1848
01:35:50,659 --> 01:35:54,290
generated and they otherwise your sight

1849
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:56,329
because there are two modules they

1850
01:35:54,290 --> 01:36:04,519
otherwise decide specialized measuring

1851
01:35:56,329 --> 01:36:07,570
latency sequins drops on our things for

1852
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:12,619
a normal normal counters we are using a

1853
01:36:07,570 --> 01:36:14,900
ITF interfaces so input pockets output

1854
01:36:12,619 --> 01:36:17,960
pockets the test is using the standard

1855
01:36:14,900 --> 01:36:21,290
counters so in a way this module it's

1856
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:24,290
forcing also it implementation of the

1857
01:36:21,290 --> 01:36:26,989
standard ITF modules so if anritsu for

1858
01:36:24,290 --> 01:36:30,409
example Spirent sena networks tomorrow

1859
01:36:26,989 --> 01:36:33,409
decide to use ITF modules to control

1860
01:36:30,409 --> 01:36:35,480
their equipment this will be very

1861
01:36:33,409 --> 01:36:37,940
positive for anyone who is used to those

1862
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:40,159
modules then you don't have to be

1863
01:36:37,940 --> 01:36:41,928
familiar with their own interface to

1864
01:36:40,159 --> 01:36:45,829
retrieving a counter then you can just

1865
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:48,579
use ITF interfaces in addition with the

1866
01:36:45,829 --> 01:36:51,170
traffic generation modules which do that

1867
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:54,799
so I think it's a very simple concept

1868
01:36:51,170 --> 01:36:57,320
I'm not focusing on this being an RFC or

1869
01:36:54,800 --> 01:37:00,260
standard truck just getting the the

1870
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:03,769
visibility and to working on it I think

1871
01:37:00,260 --> 01:37:06,560
I'm very happy with with with that so

1872
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:12,500
it's just I don't know if I made myself

1873
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:15,949
clear I'm not sure with my question with

1874
01:37:12,500 --> 01:37:17,869
regards to the results wasn't really

1875
01:37:15,949 --> 01:37:20,119
answered or maybe I didn't understand it

1876
01:37:17,869 --> 01:37:22,790
so you said ATF models or modules I'm

1877
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:26,269
not sure if I understood it is those can

1878
01:37:22,790 --> 01:37:30,010
be used for results interpretation or

1879
01:37:26,270 --> 01:37:32,599
results transfer so maybe we can take

1880
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:35,690
and so I'm sorry we are five minutes

1881
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:37,010
over time so if we could please Carsten

1882
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:39,259
and black could you take this to the

1883
01:37:37,010 --> 01:37:44,090
list awesome

1884
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:45,590
I'm so sorry thank you alright folks

1885
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:48,500
thanks for hanging out the extra five or

1886
01:37:45,590 --> 01:37:52,239
six minutes we appreciate you we will

1887
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:54,190
see I thought we were down to three

1888
01:37:52,239 --> 01:38:17,199
we're done

1889
01:37:54,190 --> 01:38:18,460
oh yeah look I I it was your sessions I

1890
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:27,239
thought maybe you're giving up the time

1891
01:38:18,460 --> 01:38:30,460
so I apologize two hours all right so uh

1892
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:33,639
thank you all for hanging out late with

1893
01:38:30,460 --> 01:38:36,670
us please take the comments to the list

1894
01:38:33,640 --> 01:38:38,320
read the drafts as you've seen when you

1895
01:38:36,670 --> 01:38:42,250
read somebody else's draft they're more

1896
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:43,540
likely to help out on yours and then

1897
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:49,060
hopefully we will see you all in

1898
01:38:43,540 --> 01:38:50,560
Vancouver and and police guys in the

1899
01:38:49,060 --> 01:38:54,390
back who came in late signed the blue

1900
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:57,280
sheets Roland and your friend please do

1901
01:38:54,390 --> 01:39:01,650
one other point which we forgot to

1902
01:38:57,280 --> 01:39:05,860
mention is that we've declared

1903
01:39:01,650 --> 01:39:09,460
publication requested on the evpn we did

1904
01:39:05,860 --> 01:39:10,660
mention that I didn't remember it at

1905
01:39:09,460 --> 01:39:28,510
least I don't and I don't see it in the

1906
01:39:10,660 --> 01:39:30,010
notes here either oh you did okay I

1907
01:39:28,510 --> 01:39:34,660
thought it was I thought we'd have to go

1908
01:39:30,010 --> 01:39:36,580
in here where you have no scent okay

1909
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:39,040
okay got it got it good okay what's

1910
01:39:36,580 --> 01:39:41,820
covered good good enough all right folks

1911
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:46,620
until next time please read the drafts

1912
01:39:41,820 --> 01:39:46,620
thank you sorry Louise

1913
01:40:02,360 --> 01:40:04,420
you
