1
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:17,080
good morning everyone welcome to

2
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:21,669
dispatch and the first working group of

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:23,619
the week if you're here for something

4
00:00:21,669 --> 00:00:32,560
other than a dispatch well we're happy

5
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:34,899
to have you anyway we have got we've had

6
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:40,510
some very helpful volunteers to take

7
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:43,600
notes and jabber relay so now get

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:45,610
remember they are Steve and Pete are

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:57,340
taking notes for us and Jonathan is

10
00:00:45,610 --> 00:01:00,310
jabber wheeling sure so this is the note

11
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,990
well it is a description of the IPR

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,579
practices that govern your participation

13
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:06,579
in this working group and actually all

14
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,170
IETF activities it is you know Monday

15
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,609
morning by ATF Week and I see a lot of

16
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:13,689
familiar faces but if you are new

17
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:17,469
welcome and make sure you you read up on

18
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:19,658
the privacy policy as well as the IPR

19
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:21,460
implications of this statement I'm happy

20
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:23,710
to talk with you after the meeting about

21
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:25,600
it or you can chat with one of our ATS

22
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:27,548
if you have any questions yeah I think

23
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,899
all three ATS in the room which is

24
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:36,520
really great I'm gonna let Patrick do

25
00:01:31,899 --> 00:01:39,759
all the talking from here huh so we have

26
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,658
a slight agenda Bosch we reversed the

27
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,090
order of the to dispatch items just

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:48,639
because to make sure we had timing work

29
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,359
out and some concern that rep might try

30
00:01:48,639 --> 00:01:53,798
to steal time so in unless anyone

31
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:55,270
objects to that we will go with the

32
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,880
order on the screen which is slightly

33
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:03,490
different than the order on the in the

34
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:05,320
materials and

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,600
since we are in the status and agenda

36
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,899
batch section I think the Cheerios have

37
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,730
a few messages for us I'm sorry not to

38
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,450
cheers I will the chairs the 80s it's

39
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,450
Monday morning sorry

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:23,980
yes hello everybody you might have

41
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:25,450
noticed that I couldn't quite hear that

42
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:31,000
did you say my name please state your

43
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:33,310
name for the mic Alexei Melnikov so you

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,850
might have noticed that in front of the

45
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:41,380
room we have a new face so Patrick is a

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:45,060
new co-chair of dispatch welcome Patrick

47
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:47,980
[Applause]

48
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,890
yeah our Taiji's decided to rotate

49
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,790
chairs and we intend to do this more

50
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:56,649
frequently in the future so we would

51
00:02:54,790 --> 00:03:00,000
like to thank Mary for more than 10

52
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:09,670
years of co-chairing this working group

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:12,190
initially yes so she started in dispatch

54
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:15,730
in the right area and lived through

55
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,260
transition and in art the maryedith

56
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,608
chair of dispatch from the very

57
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,078
beginning and i think she was the chair

58
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:23,470
of that being something like beforehand

59
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:27,519
so she goes even further back then then

60
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:32,700
before I think you Mary I think that's

61
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:35,680
it from AG's that's it from that ad but

62
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,089
this is Barry Lee but I've just but

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,890
while I'm up here after that I'll just

64
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,810
add my thanks to Mary as well she's

65
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,899
really done a great job chairing this

66
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:47,019
over the years and the other thing I

67
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,660
wanted to say was we have thank you the

68
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:52,329
five of you who put your names in or at

69
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:54,989
least accepted nominations for art ad

70
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:54,989
this time

71
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,200

76
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:13,860
as they follow the next piece of what

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,620
I'm going to say the NomCom needs your

78
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,930
opinions on these people please go to

79
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:21,810
the NomCom website and in the data

80
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:25,050
tracker and log in and give feedback

81
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:28,260
because that's how the NomCom figures

82
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,410
out who will be best to appoint them

83
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,659
yes that's good Eric Eric says suggested

84
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:39,120
thank you that anyone on the NomCom in

85
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,440
the room please stand up as well all

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,350
right that's all that's all I had to say

87
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,570
feedback please just to add on to that

88
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:48,180
point as a non-voting member of NomCom

00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:49,530
the NomCom is open for office hours

90
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,970

anything to further Bashan the agenda

94
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,280
thank you everyone for those comments

95
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,970
and I think we're ready to move into our

96
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:28,469
first discussion shreekant and and/or

97
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:30,810
customer okay hey guys I'm Shrikant and

98
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm here with my colleague Kosta so

99
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,310
we're here to present the sip out of

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,270
here

101
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,860
all right so this is what we're gonna

102
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:40,710
cover in the talk in the next ten

103
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:44,669
minutes I'm just going to move on to the

104
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:46,469
first part right so the first thing I

105
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:47,729
want to talk about is give you basically

106
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,669
a sense of the problem that we're trying

107
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:51,960
to solve here what we've got here on the

108
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:55,710
screen is a typical enterprise

109
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:57,870
deployment with the edge SBC in the

110
00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,590
middle talking to the cert provider the

111
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:03,480
IT SB and we are basically trying to fix

112
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,659
problems in that interaction in the

113
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,320
interoperability between the SBC and the

114
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,289
itsp

115
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,909
so what we see today is

116
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:14,729
administrators find it difficult to

117
00:06:11,909 --> 00:06:16,800
deploy these SBC's and get all of the

118
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:18,300
calls and our use working it takes a lot

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,020
of trial and error to get the working

120
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,649
configuration right and you know we want

121
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:27,599
to help make their life easier you know

122
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:29,610
earlier we had the legacy telephony

123
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,830
networks analog and digital circuits

124
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,199
which were easier to set up which were

125
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,849
quick and a breeze and you know you only

126
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,860
had issues in corner cases such as

127
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:40,139
hardware problems however when you come

128
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,210
to sip and RTP there are a whole set of

129
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,930
parameters that are then introduced

130
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:47,938
which cause further issues so getting

131
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:48,599
that working config is time consuming

132
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:50,490
right

133
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,770
and usually the administrators have to

134
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,719
open up tickets with the HSBC vendor and

135
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,580
the service provider and then they work

136
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,770
together to solve the problem and this

137
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,080
scales back the deployment times by a

138
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:04,438
few days so we want to reduce that to a

139
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,719
few hours or even a few minutes so the

140
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:08,309
first thing we had to figure out was you

141
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,589
know how much of a problem this is and

142
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:13,379
for that we went back to our support

143
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:16,199
cases and we pulled the data for a year

144
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:19,529
and over the year we saw there's about

145
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,110
6,000 cases on the SBC and about 22% of

146
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,479
those cases directly related to the SIP

147
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,659
interoperability problem so if you

148
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,878
multiply this this was on our SBC the

149
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:31,319
cube so if you multiply this with all of

150
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:33,839
the SPC's that are there out in the

151
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,669
market today you can see that it's quite

152
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,419
a significant problem that needs to be

153
00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:41,459
solved apart from that you know a lot of

154
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:43,799
the telephony deployments are still

155
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:45,599
legacy analog and digital circuits and

156
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,539
people are slowly moving over to SIP

157
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:50,550
trunks so this problem is not going away

158
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:51,899
we're just going to see more of this and

159
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,399
it's better to fix this as soon as

160
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,659
possible right so there are a couple of

161
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,550
current solutions that are already there

162
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:01,800
the first one is the SIP connect

163
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:03,930
technical recommendations so this is a

164
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,839
really good document that provides a

165
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:09,389
guideline to the SP and the enterprise

166
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,550
on how they need to behave it covers

167
00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,360
topics ranging all the way from initial

168
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:16,649
registration of the device till

169
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,810
complicated stuff such as call transfers

170
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:22,499
call forwarding and even the security

171
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:24,270
aspects and how to handle media so all

172
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:26,880
of this all of these guidelines

173
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:30,299
there and even though we have week we

174
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,630
can have like you know sip connect sip

175
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,549
connect compliant products right today

176
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:37,289
we still see interoperability issues

177
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,779
which you know we will cover in the next

178
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,789
slide the second thing is the service

179
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,979
provided documentation that's provided

180
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,589
to the customer when they buy the SIP

181
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,600
trunk this covers only high-level

182
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:50,880
information such as the authentication

183
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,250
and you know a single server IP that you

184
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,649
can communicate with and apart from that

185
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:58,890
just basic codec information however it

186
00:08:55,649 --> 00:09:00,510
does not cover advanced features which

187
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,420
you know again we'll cover in the next

188
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:05,520
slide which cause problems when the

189
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,370
testing begins

190
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:10,410
apart from this let's say tomorrow

191
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:12,930
there's a new codec right or there's a

192
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:15,510
new parameter that's in introduced there

193
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,089
is no way today no efficient way today

194
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:20,520
for the SP to inform the enterprise

195
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:23,430
administrator about this usually what

196
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,860
happens is the service provider enables

197
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,290
this new feature or parameter and then

198
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,670
when a call is made the call fails and

199
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,469
then there's troubleshooting that needs

200
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,699
to be done and that's when the

201
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,950
administrator actually figures out that

202
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,959
hey you know what this convict was

203
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:41,550
missing on the SVC so we need to start

204
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,439
configuring the SBC this way right so

205
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,579
here are some of the issues that we

206
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,920
still see today which basically have no

207
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:52,439
answers right so for example when I'm

208
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,329
sending the call to an IT SP what

209
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,430
happens if the itsp folks that call

210
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:59,489
right and creates multiple dialogues now

211
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:01,890
as an edge SBC do I pass all of these

212
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,740
folks dialogues all the responses back

213
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,720
to the enterprise or do I actually wait

214
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,640
for a confirmed dialogue before you know

215
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,850
letting the enterprise know so it would

216
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,529
be good to be aware of that fact the

217
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,380
second thing is what about hairpin calls

218
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:18,000
so we have called forwarding and called

219
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,910
transfer is happening all the time on

220
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,370
calls that come from the itsp so when

221
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,110
the call is sent back a lot of ideas P

222
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,420
is actually wait for that first RTP

223
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,640
packet to come from the enterprise side

224
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,079
and if that does not come from the

225
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,630
enterprise side then they don't stream

226
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:35,550
RTP either and this results in you know

227
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,649
a no way audio or a dead air issue so

228
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,589
again that's another type of issue

229
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:42,899
we've seen now with supplementary

230
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:45,089
services such as hold and transfers

231
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:47,339
there are many transactions that happen

232
00:10:45,089 --> 00:10:52,649
within a single dialogue and we've seen

233
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:55,619
that a lot of the time the SP is reject

234
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,420
that rien vite beyond a certain limit or

235
00:10:55,619 --> 00:11:00,050
they just reject three invite altogether

236
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,910
so that's another thing that we've seen

237
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:05,639
we'd like to know how the SP routes

238
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,410
calls does it route the calls based on

239
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,449
the call party in the to field in the

240
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:11,368
request URI or the P call party ID

241
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:15,660
header so it would be good to know that

242
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:17,610
as well as an enterprise how do I send

243
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,850
the call out to the SP in the from head

244
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:22,110
of field should I give the D ID number

245
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,050
that I bought from the service provider

246
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,670
or can I just encode any information any

247
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:29,240
user information so that's another

248
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:31,740
important issue that we've seen and

249
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,869
finally now with the rise of video

250
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,999
endpoints on the enterprise side we see

251
00:11:33,869 --> 00:11:38,910
that a lot of calls actually are sent

252
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:40,649
with the video em line so there are many

253
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,300
service providers they just are okay

254
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:44,399
with this they're like they just change

255
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,569
the video port to zero and then respond

256
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,579
saying that you know what I don't

257
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:49,589
support video with this trunk but there

258
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,660
are others that actually reject the call

259
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:56,579
altogether so again it would be good to

260
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:57,929
know this beforehand so coming to the

261
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,050
SIP out of here so all of these

262
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:02,790
scenarios that we've seen so far right

263
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,709
we want to be able to give these answers

264
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:06,779
to the administrator the day they are

265
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:08,670
configuring the SVC the first day itself

266
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:10,769
so that they don't have to go through

267
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,240
this trial and error over days and just

268
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:14,309
try to troubleshoot the problem and

269
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:18,389
basically make life easier for them

270
00:12:14,309 --> 00:12:20,040
we've encoded you know the generic

271
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:24,949
parameters that are applicable to any

272
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:26,969
SBC in a yang model we've created the

273
00:12:24,949 --> 00:12:28,949
parameters and the framework in such a

274
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,230
way that it can be parsed and this can

275
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:33,089
be automated so that that there needs to

276
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,959
be no manual intervention by the

277
00:12:33,089 --> 00:12:37,110
administrator

278
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,540
so the SBC can get the information parse

279
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:42,600
it and then configure itself to get

280
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,589
calls working fine right and another

281
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,999
thing is we've covered from simple

282
00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:50,490
information just such as the registrar

283
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,510
IP or the call server IP do something

284
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:53,100
more advanced such as

285
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:55,550
the RTP scenario that I was just

286
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,949
mentioning in the previous slide and

287
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,109
finally like we have we've we've created

288
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,510
a data set right of the parameters but

289
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,970
this is by no means the final data set

290
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:08,310
we'd love some input on this because we

291
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,740
want to solve as many problems as we can

292
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:13,319
that administrators face today that's

293
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,449
the goal of this drop so we are open to

294
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:17,430
input on what we may have overlooked and

295
00:13:15,449 --> 00:13:20,550
you know what we could add and what we

296
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,930
could refine in that capability set all

297
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:25,859
right so this is a high-level overview

298
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:28,170
of what exactly the draft does right

299
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,019
there are just four steps the first step

300
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:33,000
is that the SBC gets the information of

301
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,000
the capability server that's the new

302
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,220
element on the SP network it just has to

303
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,709
be a web server right that's hosted by

304
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,680
the SP with the required capability set

305
00:13:40,709 --> 00:13:46,709
information the HSBC gets this

306
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,199
information and you can either manually

307
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:51,869
provide it or it can be discovered it

308
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,569
can be discovered right on its own once

309
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:57,510
it gets that URL it goes ahead and sends

310
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:59,490
an HTTP GET for the capability set it

311
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,980
gets the information in the response and

312
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:03,930
once it gets that response it parses it

313
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,000
and configures itself or an

314
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:10,138
administrator can go through that and

315
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,829
configure the SBC as required right so

316
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,600
the first thing is why HTTP because why

317
00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:18,199
not HTTP because it's it's the most

318
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,310
common protocol it's well established

319
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,560
you know it's the path to least

320
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:24,029
disruption you don't have a chain we're

321
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,209
not trying to change the sip stack here

322
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:28,380
because that would be a mess so HTTP is

323
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,569
much easier to implement

324
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:33,269
that's why we've gone ahead with HTTP

325
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:35,910
and apart from that most SBC is today

326
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:37,529
already have an HTTP stack built in so

327
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,779
all you need to give is that URL and

328
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:44,100
then they'll go ahead and query the HTTP

329
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:46,170
server apart from that you know there's

330
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:48,449
no point of querying the capabilities

331
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:51,599
once the trunk is registered between the

332
00:14:48,449 --> 00:14:53,279
service provider and the HSBC because in

333
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,110
order to get that registration up you

334
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
also need to provide information such as

335
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,130
where the registrar server is and what

336
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,130
the credentials are so that kind of

337
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:05,350
defeats the purpose right so the second

338
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:09,610
question that we had is how do we encode

339
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:11,380
this data right so we are like on the

340
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:13,210
fence about this whether we should go

341
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,360
with XML or JSON because both of them

342
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:18,910
have their pros XML is synonymous with

343
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,750
configuration files today so most I

344
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,400
guess pcs except xml's in the form of a

345
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,780
document and then you know configure

346
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,329
themselves based on that so they have a

347
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:31,209
parts are built in you also have xml

348
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,860
schemas that has strong constraints the

349
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:34,780
only problem is that it's bulky and

350
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,340
verbose and you know you have to convert

351
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,860
a document to a data structure but

352
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:41,350
that's ok we've we have code that does

353
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:43,960
that already on the other hand json is

354
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:47,560
compact it's readable it's already data

355
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:49,690
that's formatted as a map right so it

356
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,670
has a bunch of advantages going for it

357
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:53,920
it's just the only weakness it has is

358
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:58,420
you know it can't deal with unstructured

359
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,579
data that well but that's ok again right

360
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,560
so in this draft we've tended to go

361
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:05,050
towards XML just because we've seen it

362
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,030
more in action I'll be showing an

363
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:10,780
example of that capability document in a

364
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:13,420
future slide right so the next thing is

365
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,600
the yang model that we've defined in

366
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:19,780
this draft so as you can see you know

367
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:22,270
these are parameters that are applicable

368
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,880
to any SBC it's not just vendor specific

369
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:28,090
it's very generic it's as generic as can

370
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,350
be and we've covered transport

371
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:34,090
information call specification media

372
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:37,660
security and any kind of sip extensions

373
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:39,880
that are supported by the SP also apart

374
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:42,880
from this the good thing about using a

375
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:45,310
yang model is that even if the service

376
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,710
provider wants to encode vendor specific

377
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:49,630
information they can just import this

378
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:50,860
yang model and then build on top of that

379
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:55,270
so they can add their vendor specific

380
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:58,180
information on top of that all right so

381
00:16:55,270 --> 00:17:00,370
here's the example of what the document

382
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,099
looks like again we went with XML just

383
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,660
because we you know we've seen more of

384
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,640
it that's all but we've not made a final

385
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,949
decision that it is going to be XML we'd

386
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,860
love to hear pointers on which would if

387
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,630
JSON would still be better I'm not going

388
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,639
to go through all of the fields this is

389
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,900
just a slide to show what it would look

390
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,699
like so as you can see

391
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:20,559
you know all of the important parameters

392
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:22,630
are there and this is something that the

393
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,010
SBC could just parse on its own and

394
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:29,680
configure itself all right so the way

395
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,800
forward we want to hear any objections

396
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:34,690
or challenges that you see and we want

397
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,149
to hear anything else that we can refine

398
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:40,420
in that capability set like I mentioned

399
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,160
before you know it's not exhaustive and

400
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,870
we want to solve as many problems as we

401
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,790
can so that we can make life easier for

402
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,979
these administrators who are sitting out

403
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,899
there and doing this every day basically

404
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,090
count figuring and testing and

405
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:54,550
provisioning SIP trunks every day with

406
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,110
the service provider so that's who we're

407
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:58,629
targeting here and that's who we want to

408
00:17:56,110 --> 00:18:00,879
make life easier for so we love your

409
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:02,980
inputs on refining the capability set

410
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,080
and you know anything that we've

411
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,390
overlooked we've got to get help page

412
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,210
and you know we'd love to hear your

413
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:11,710
inputs there and yeah I'd like to open

414
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,410
up to the group as to how the draft

415
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:21,040
should be taking forward as well

416
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:22,809
thank you so in light of not everyone

417
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:26,290
jumping to the mic first does anyone

418
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:28,030
have any questions about the content of

419
00:18:26,290 --> 00:18:33,129
the draft or technical questions or

420
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:36,730
comments and I'm not seeing anyone so

421
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:38,290
then do people have opinions on what do

422
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,980
we do with this is this something that

423
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:45,420
the IETF should progress and if so

424
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:45,420
what's the best way

425
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:59,670
so Hoss I think the problem being listed

426
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:03,990
is something that we have come across

427
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:06,390
earlier in deployments and I definitely

428
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,600
think we should spend some time solving

429
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:12,600
this graph proposes one way we might

430
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,300
have to probably think about what are

431
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,530
the parameter sets that there and what

432
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,120
are the defaults that we can also

433
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,149
provide so that you know it's easy to

434
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,500
Auto configure if needed and I totally

435
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:25,110
agree there there are some cases where

436
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,120
manual intervention is required that

437
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:29,370
cannot we cannot remove but if it can

438
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,620
solve most of the use cases that we are

439
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:36,959
dealing today then I think it's worth

440
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:39,209
doing yeah yeah absolutely agree burial

441
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,130
basically we we can't we can hit all

442
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:43,410
100% of the grounds but at least 95

443
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:48,590
percent if we can do that that would be

444
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:52,140
great yeah I appreciate those comments

445
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:53,310
does anyone else have opinions on the

446
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,750
use cases and sort of the problem

447
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:56,129
statement as well and one of the things

448
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,320
you addressed there was that you had

449
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,540
seen this problem as well I'm curious if

450
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:10,250
there's a broad-based support for that

451
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:12,389
coming all right

452
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:16,580
just write curious question do we have

453
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:16,580
people in the room from any SPC vendors

454
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:30,870
half a hand I mean are you half a person

455
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:37,410
or half of them do you ever see this

456
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:41,459
problem so I would never claim to be

457
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:44,780
from an SPC vendor know so Gonzalez

458
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,100
Cisco so I work on the support side and

459
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:48,450
there's problems real we see it and we

460
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,100
see with enough frequency that it's

461
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,870
worth solving thank you so let me ask

462
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:58,320
the authors with respect to sort of the

463
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:59,580
parameters how much how much more effort

464
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,169
do you think should go into the question

465
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,990
of establishing the right set of

466
00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:05,700
capabilities and parameters

467
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:08,940
so so first of all the parameters that

468
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,860
we did come up with well after sort of

469
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,440
going through a large number of cases

470
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:15,719
not just with Ciscoe but you know stuff

471
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,809
that we could find generally out there

472
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:21,510
I think the parameter set that we have

473
00:21:18,809 --> 00:21:23,129
right now is certainly not a hundred

474
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,760
percent representative of everything

475
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,980
that could be solved by this framework

476
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,110
but I certainly think that with some

477
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,220
dialogue we we ought to be able to reach

478
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:36,629
to that parameter set pretty quickly

479
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,580
this has been Campbell pretending to be

480
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,679
from the floor oh I'm sorry go ahead Ted

481
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,820
and you were in line before me go ahead

482
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:47,550
I was just going to ask what are your

483
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:50,428
thoughts on how fixed this capability

484
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:53,190
set will be over time do you see it

485
00:21:50,429 --> 00:21:55,290
changing much as you find new areas of

486
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,880
incompatibility or are we talking about

487
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,250
the same set of injuries that are pretty

488
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,010
much done and not changing stuff so

489
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,929
unless there are going to be radical

490
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:06,990
extensions to step in our TP we don't

491
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:11,610
expect the capability set to change a

492
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:14,309
whole lot over time so we expected

493
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:20,010
remain pretty much static or usable or

494
00:22:14,309 --> 00:22:21,928
for long durations of time Saturday in

495
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:23,970
in the chapter we were sort of trying to

496
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:25,500
figure out if this looked more like it

497
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,380
it belongs in one of these groups or

498
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,559
needed new place to go and one of the

499
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:34,640
questions I had was whether or not it

500
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,070
were a new place whether belonged in

501
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,929
this area or in ops slash network

502
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,790
management and so I think my question to

503
00:22:39,929 --> 00:22:43,380
the authors is how much dialogue have

504
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:45,928
you already had with the folks at option

505
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,270
nm about this because a lot of the yang

506
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:50,400
modeling work and stuff looks a lot more

507
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:51,540
like their set of expertise than

508
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,980
certainly what I would bring to the

509
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:57,510
table if it came to here the simple

510
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,390
answer to your question is we haven't

511
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:03,059
had any dialogue but but we are open to

512
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,880
finding a place that's most suitable for

513
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:06,960
this effort

514
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,360
thanks for the answer I think it might

515
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,720
be valuable to to consider chatting with

516
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,000
the ops and nm area directors as well as

517
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,669
the art area directors because there are

518
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,060
certainly pieces of this which they

519
00:23:17,669 --> 00:23:21,000
might

520
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,490
have insight into the right communities

521
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,720
of experts to health absolutely thank

522
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:31,160
you Alexei Melnikov has one of our

523
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,700
Taiji's we just had a quick informal

524
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:37,260
discussion between 80s I think it

525
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,720
probably makes sense to have a mini

526
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,629
working group I think we should keep the

527
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:44,700
dad's question in mind and our tidies

528
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,500
probably can talk to ops and management

529
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:51,480
AG's and see whether this will land but

530
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,910
for me personally not being a sip expert

531
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,520
or anything it seems like a reasonable

532
00:23:53,910 --> 00:24:00,080
problem to solve and seems like a

533
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:06,420
reasonable area to bring this to so

534
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:08,730
thank you relaying for Robert sparks I'm

535
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,320
John Lennox but really starting job or

536
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:12,240
yes have you had any conversations with

537
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,710
SIP connectors at forum is there

538
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:19,140
something very receptive to adding so we

539
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:21,270
we realized that the sit connect or

540
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,070
rather the crux of the SIP Connect

541
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,080
recommendation is to actually smooth and

542
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:28,980
interrupt between enterprise vendors and

543
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,750
service providers so the direct answer

544
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,460
to your question is no we haven't had

545
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:34,140
any dialogue with folks from sip

546
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:35,750
connects however we look at this as

547
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:38,220
pretty much a complementary effort

548
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,780
something that actually complements that

549
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:44,970
connect and makes lives easier for

550
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:47,520
administrator's this has been I'm gonna

551
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:49,440
make been sorry to interrupt you but I'm

552
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:54,420
gonna make one follow-up comment on that

553
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:58,980
is you really should talk to them Chris

554
00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:01,650
went I guess my only comment is I wonder

555
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,730
if this is too little too late like you

556
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:07,980
know is SIP connected it's it's good it

557
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:12,120
what didn't catch on like wildfire I

558
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:14,690
know like generally when our customers

559
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,270
connect with PBX is it's sort of like

560
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:20,400
you know just painful enough that makes

561
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:22,050
our life hard but not painful enough

562
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,400
that I mean anybody wants to really

563
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:28,560
change it and type of thing so you know

564
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,930
I just wonder how

565
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,030
motivated people will be to adopt a

566
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:36,840
single standard here because most

567
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:41,100
vendors don't seem to align on anything

568
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:45,060
from my experience sure one thing that

569
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,639
we're hopeful hopeful about is somewhere

570
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:49,379
down the line with people so which would

571
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:51,420
see the economic and time benefits

572
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,070
associated with this effort on the part

573
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,230
of a service provider all that surely

574
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,790
required off them at the end of the day

575
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:58,830
is to just look at the capabilities that

576
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:01,170
populated in terms of whatever it is

577
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,639
that they do or don't do and it's

578
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:04,770
basically up to the enterprise after

579
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:07,770
that to configure the SPC accordingly so

580
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:10,020
I think in light of the economic benefit

581
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,000
and the amount of time that saved this

582
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:17,190
this could be something that motivates

583
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:19,980
them to perhaps adopt dog line yeah I

584
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,900
just want to add on to that so another

585
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,670
thing is that you know we see that

586
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,500
solution test teams today have a huge

587
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,880
backlog of testing because of this

588
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,550
because they have a test with multiple

589
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,290
providers and we're just gonna see more

590
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,970
people migrating to sip in the coming

591
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,010
years so this is gonna become a bigger

592
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:37,290
problem so maybe when it's a bigger

593
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,030
problem than people might care but point

594
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:43,500
is let's fix it before it becomes that

595
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:44,370
big problem Jonathan is relaying for

596
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,770
Mary Barnes

597
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,510
she says giving her we could never get

598
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:50,850
folks to even agree on basic sip device

599
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:52,170
configuration I'm not sure this will get

600
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,270
anywhere not that I don't think it's a

601
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:55,710
good idea and step four I'm tried to do

602
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,540
device configuration couldn't get

603
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:04,580
traction this might be a good thing to

604
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:07,440
see if we get a bavitz if knock so I I

605
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:10,230
think in our personal opinion it's not

606
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,330
so much as configuration as much as

607
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,920
discovery of or whatever it is that the

608
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:17,610
service provider does doesn't do like

609
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:19,020
does like we are not advocating for the

610
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:21,179
service provider for example to push

611
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:23,370
configuration to the SPC what we are

612
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,320
advocating for is the administrators who

613
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:29,399
have as much knowledge as possible on

614
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,840
day zero so this has been Campbell from

615
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:35,280
the floor and then at the chair in just

616
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,300
a second from the floor I would say one

617
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,030
of the things I'm kind of hearing the

618
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,059
discussion is it would be good to have

619
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:42,379
him input from the peep

620
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,940
they wouldn't implement this to make

621
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:45,830
sure they really would that would be

622
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:48,110
both the service providers and the

623
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,970
specie vendors and since we only had

624
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,559
half a hand on the SBC vendors earlier

625
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,740
we don't really have we don't know the

626
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:56,330
answer to that right now yeah I mean

627
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:58,100
this is a joint effort this is

628
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,840
definitely a joint effort we need we

629
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,980
need people from both ESPYs as well as

630
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:06,590
SBC's here working on this year and then

631
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:08,629
speaking it's chair is there anyone in

632
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:14,509
the room that thinks we should not work

633
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:22,969
on this we being the greater IDF and

634
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:25,070
related communities okay I think a

635
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:27,309
little bit of summarize a summary of

636
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:31,480
what I heard and people feel free to

637
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:34,460
interject if I have some of it wrong is

638
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:36,679
the people think in general this is

639
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,840
probably worth doing there's some

640
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:42,909
concerns about whether it would be used

641
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:46,189
if we do it we think that it needs

642
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:51,259
coordination with the people that would

643
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:56,659
actually implement it and deploy yes

644
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:58,190
thank you and the area directors have

645
00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:00,169
talked about it and consider that it

646
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:02,600
might be worth a mini working group and

647
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:05,119
it it's not clear if it belongs in art

648
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:07,369
or UPS or straddling the borders of

649
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,199
those and that actually reminds me of

650
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:11,330
one question I meant to ask a minute ago

651
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,580
since the 80s made the comment this

652
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:15,289
might be moot but since you brought up

653
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:19,059
zip core I think we have a support chair

654
00:29:15,289 --> 00:29:19,059
in the room Brian you have any thoughts

655
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:25,100
we certainly could do this in succour

656
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,369
and I wonder if it is worth spending up

657
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:30,259
as a mini group for it I'm on the on the

658
00:29:28,369 --> 00:29:33,439
bubble the workload right now is

659
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:35,059
moderate so timewise we've got time you

660
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,950
got shares and infrastructure and all

661
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:40,700
the people you really want to review are

662
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,740
there so the advantage of going doing it

663
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,080
in succour is you've got this ready

664
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:46,549
review crew and there's enough time to

665
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,869
do it

666
00:29:46,549 --> 00:29:52,730
it's not a precise fix fit because it

667
00:29:50,869 --> 00:29:54,418
isn't core sit right we're not changing

668
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:57,330
sip in any way so

669
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,399
by the by the strict reading of the

670
00:29:57,330 --> 00:30:01,649
Charter it's a little bit outside I

671
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:06,600
still think it probably makes a lot of

672
00:30:01,649 --> 00:30:08,908
sense to consider it though actually I

673
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,889
can say is this is Adam Roach that yeah

674
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:12,989
we probably would want to like adjust

675
00:30:10,889 --> 00:30:14,850
the Charter and if we see if we see like

676
00:30:12,989 --> 00:30:17,429
the paces that's going on and set course

677
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,570
staying the same way it is and more

678
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,850
things like this coming along we might

679
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:24,259
want to sort of loosen things back to

680
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,259
the way they were back when it was set

681
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:29,668
once upon a time this is John Peterson

682
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:32,399
by the way there was a working group

683
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:34,379
called modern which actually still

684
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,570
exists it still exists in part because I

685
00:30:34,379 --> 00:30:38,129
insist that it be kept on life support

686
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,939
because we're gonna need it oh my god

687
00:30:38,129 --> 00:30:40,799
there's like all this configuration

688
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,759
stuff related to like stir and all these

689
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,168
things that we're gonna have to do at

690
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:44,580
some point and we're just too busy doing

691
00:30:43,169 --> 00:30:47,399
stir and shakin and everything in the

692
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:48,779
moment but um it does exist as a bucket

693
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,209
and Steve Donovan was sitting over there

694
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:55,019
is still a Stuckey responsible for it

695
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:58,379
it's an alternative to consider modern

696
00:30:55,019 --> 00:31:02,059
which is like managing operating like I

697
00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:05,668
don't remember man's really convoluted

698
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:08,549
okay so - John likes to realize first

699
00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:10,739
for Robert sparks he says this is very

700
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:13,220
not sip core there's no actual sip here

701
00:31:10,739 --> 00:31:20,100
just nouns about sip and RTP things and

702
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:21,570
then mary says i think a mini working

703
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,519
group is better given ops and management

704
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:24,899
type stuff and I agree with John

705
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,679
Peterson about moderate if stuff works

706
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:31,350
there's no impetus for change I'm sorry

707
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,850
could you say the last part again sorry

708
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,219
she agrees with John Peterson about

709
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:40,619
modern if stuff works there is no

710
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:44,249
impetus for change and this is Barry

711
00:31:40,619 --> 00:31:46,590
liebe I said Minnie Minnie working group

712
00:31:44,249 --> 00:31:48,210
to start with when Brian suggested you

713
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:50,158
doing in sip core I was good with that

714
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:52,230
Mary's point is well-taken

715
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,809
we could certainly draw the right ops

716
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,330
people in for the discussions but it

717
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:59,580
might be better to have a mini working

718
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:03,509
group to highlight that and actually

719
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,689
assign an ops advisor or something so

720
00:32:03,509 --> 00:32:07,860
I'm ambivalent that what Mary makes a

721
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,149
good

722
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:17,250
so I think at this point the affair go

723
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:19,229
ahead : is just true Colin Jenks Benoit

724
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,580
has been reviewing it from a yang point

725
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,960
of view and a little bit of ops review

726
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,309
so there's been a little bit but doesn't

727
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,539
change anything that people just said

728
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:32,610
about the overlap and what we should do

729
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:36,419
there okay so I believe that the

730
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:38,189
resolution at this point is that people

731
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,080
are thinking in terms of a mini working

732
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:42,809
group and the bit the area directors

733
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:51,740
ready to go think about this is that the

734
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:54,210
right resolution for the minutes I think

735
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:58,500
saying we're leaning toward a mini

736
00:32:54,210 --> 00:33:01,169
working group is fair yeah yeah so you

737
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,730
might say the it would not be a bad

738
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:04,380
thing for people to start drafting a

739
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,690
charter and then we can see where that

740
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,549
goes okay so then the next step is

741
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:10,740
trying to work out what the Charter

742
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:15,168
would look like and I think if you guys

743
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,399
and maybe Cullen or someone can help you

744
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:18,840
the Adam Rose the only other thing that

745
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,789
I would suggest that we probably want to

746
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,459
put a call out on the dispatch list and

747
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,990
or in this room about level of interest

748
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:26,970
like who would actually be willing to

749
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:29,990
push things forward review documents etc

750
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:32,639
well we can ask in this room right now

751
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:33,960
who in this room would be interested in

752
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:36,389
participating and working on this

753
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:40,279
whether that is from a writing documents

754
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:40,279
or reviewing documents or perspective

755
00:33:45,220 --> 00:34:01,160
so we're seeing in the eight to ten ish

756
00:33:48,080 --> 00:34:03,800
range make sure the notes caught that

757
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,380
part we fell eight to ten people in the

758
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:08,330
regatta okay

759
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,100
Thank You Jenna thank you thank you

760
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:11,739
everybody

761
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,810
so because it's Monday morning go ahead

762
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:16,339
okay hey aunt Colin's next because this

763
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:18,620
Monday morning and the chairs weren't on

764
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,910
our ball on the ball we forgot to send

765
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:21,230
out the blue sheets at the beginning of

766
00:34:19,909 --> 00:34:25,520
the meeting so we sent it out kind of in

767
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:28,070
the middle of that discussion with no

768
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,120
words so or no words for us about it so

769
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:46,310
if anyone forgot the blue sheets please

770
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:48,980
looks like we got it covered okay okay

771
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:52,610
I'm here to talk about this rip protocol

772
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:55,190
which has very little to do with the

773
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:58,640
previous presentation at all but it is

774
00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:01,190
about connecting up voice and possibly

775
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,640
video things between different services

776
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:06,590
and making this easier so there's you

777
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,180
know a bunch of co-authors on this is

778
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:09,770
very early work it's not like all of us

779
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,049
agree on any of this or anything or just

780
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:13,370
that the ideas are gelling um various

781
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:14,870
people's positions on some of this stuff

782
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:17,000
I will try and highlight where where

783
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:20,330
it's key to two things going on forward

784
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,760
some of them are hilarious my goal for

785
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:23,960
today is really just to like get people

786
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:27,250
to understand a little bit the problem

787
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,900
we're trying to solve and then int

788
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:31,010
overview a little bit of a basic flavor

789
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,170
of what we're thinking though it could

790
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:34,730
all change and then get some scope of

791
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:36,140
how big are some small problems that

792
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:38,420
people want to solve who's interested in

793
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:40,160
just sort of the range of how the

794
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:46,190
information that we would need to start

795
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:48,259
proposing and writing a charter so what

796
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:49,610
we're trying to do I mean you know this

797
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,490
is similar to step trunking right

798
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:53,780
there's all kinds of cloud services

799
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:56,870
whether they're WebEx whether they're

800
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:58,450
call centers whether they're hangouts

801
00:35:56,870 --> 00:36:01,240
meeting conferencing systems

802
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,890
which initially are just trying to

803
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,229
connect clients and then connect to the

804
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,779
PSTN so this work started with a very

805
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:10,569
much of PSTN focus what do we need to do

806
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:12,430
to make it easy to cross across to a

807
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:16,140
service provider that has PSTN gateways

808
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,308
and make that work now at the same time

809
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:19,839
I'm going to talk in a second about the

810
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:22,569
problems of doing that with sip today

811
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,460
and why the the sip solution is not

812
00:36:22,569 --> 00:36:27,880
really all that awesome for us in some

813
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:29,349
ways as we talk about this more and more

814
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,180
it becomes clear we'd also like to use

815
00:36:29,349 --> 00:36:32,470
it you know Justin very much feel

816
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,808
strongly we'd like to be able to use it

817
00:36:32,470 --> 00:36:36,970
from end-user clients to the cloud and

818
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:38,920
along with that comes a much stronger

819
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:40,689
desire for it to support video not just

820
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:43,900
audio because it's not just a PSTN

821
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:46,000
Interop solution and also brings to make

822
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,200
you know ups the the requirements framed

823
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,510
in security and stuff like this so

824
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,890
that's that's how the problems expanded

825
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:55,240
since so I talked about this four months

826
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:56,980
ago everybody's like well isn't this

827
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,109
just a sip trunk I mean like what's the

828
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:03,760
problem there and the problem is is that

829
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:07,119
you know sort of still done the way we

830
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:08,770
did it largely 20 or 15 years ago and we

831
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,240
have these incredible cloud services

832
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:13,660
that have built all kinds of

833
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,160
infrastructure from gateways to load

834
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,259
balancers to all of these things and

835
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:19,990
they're all focused around HTTP they all

836
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,900
leverage HTTP as a really good way to

837
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:24,609
provide a lot of services to build very

838
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:26,890
stateless highly distributed highly

839
00:37:24,609 --> 00:37:29,319
reliable services and sips really a bad

840
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:31,598
match to them if you try and deploy sip

841
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:33,790
in an AWS data center you get basically

842
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,819
nothing you get largely some raw metal

843
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:38,380
that you can run your stuff on where if

844
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:40,509
you could have a way to do a lot of

845
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:42,160
these same types of things over a

846
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:45,250
mechanism that looks very much like a

847
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,078
HTTP you could leverage an incredible

848
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,790
amount of infrastructure that's been

849
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,230
built to do that and and do a much

850
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:51,970
better solution and that's really what

851
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:53,230
we're proposing here is to to move to

852
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:58,509
that type of environment we can take

853
00:37:53,230 --> 00:38:00,339
advantage of that so use cases some of

854
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:01,480
the ones I talked about a straight up

855
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:03,730
but you know you're running a large

856
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:06,670
cloud data center and you want to be

857
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:09,160
able to take advantage of of those types

858
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:10,059
of environments for PSTN interconnect ok

859
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:12,549
I don't really talk about these use

860
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:14,950
cases too much you know

861
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:18,580
so the SIP trunking those come up in all

862
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:19,660
kinds of different cases we have a lot

863
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,890
of things that are difficult what's it

864
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:22,480
both like you know as you're trying to

865
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:24,339
just run VMs and tear them down and

866
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,210
bring them up for reloads of software or

867
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,940
whatever reasons

868
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,740
does not have a lot of support built in

869
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,540
for those types of management exercises

870
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,950
or high liability exercises where you

871
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:36,100
can do it without ever degrading your

872
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:38,470
service yes people have managed to build

873
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,850
incredible SPC's that can hide some of

874
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:43,089
this and make it do and work in a high

875
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:44,440
reliable way but it's it's the protocol

876
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:45,790
was never really designed very well for

877
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,740
that it wasn't one of those the things

878
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:52,029
was trying to do and it's very difficult

879
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:53,709
to do also interested in just

880
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:55,120
straight-up enterprise voice trunking

881
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:56,560
and making that very simple and easy to

882
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:59,380
deploy a lot of those types of things

883
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,490
that's expanding rapidly right now

884
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:05,830
I I didn't mention it here but there's

885
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:08,259
also a lot of use cases around speech

886
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:10,690
recognition services so speech

887
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:13,120
recognition right now has taken off like

888
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:15,190
crazy largely due to ml approaches to it

889
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,600
and the ML approaches require an

890
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,070
incredible amount of data to train

891
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,140
against and the people that have huge

892
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:21,760
amounts of data often have the best

893
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:23,020
speech recognition systems because of

894
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,720
the data they can bring to bear on the

895
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:27,460
problem so you see that with lots of

896
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:29,259
people trying to use a small number of

897
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,000
large cloud providers speech recognition

898
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,030
systems because they basically do better

899
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,620
than more just ones that aren't large

900
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:36,640
cloud Suns and we don't have

901
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,650
particularly good ways if you go to

902
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,180
cross the api's across all the vendors

903
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,620
I'm not picking on anyone it is that the

904
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:47,470
streaming API is for streaming real-time

905
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:49,779
reking voice recognition across every

906
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:51,160
vendor right now leave things to desire

907
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:52,750
so that's another use case that we're

908
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:55,899
really trying to hit with this and doing

909
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:58,330
that from cloud to cloud Ted better tea

910
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,160
with a clarifying question when you're

911
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,140
talking about speech recognition here

912
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,750
obviously a lot of that is also moving

913
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,549
on to devices at the moment with

914
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,520
specialized systems are you particularly

915
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:11,440
concerned with cases for the speech

916
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,150
recognition where there's some other

917
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,100
process which occurs after speech

918
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:19,810
recognition like IVR or translation to a

919
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:22,720
secondary system or are you really

920
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:24,990
concerned with speech recognition itself

921
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,060
because I'm

922
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,830
yeah that's that's a good question so

923
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,660
look if the speech recognition happens

924
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:33,690
on device that solves a lot of privacy

925
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,220
problems is great for many cases but if

926
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,390
you're building a small you know if

927
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,790
you're a small startup company and

928
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:40,980
you're building a contact center based

929
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:42,990
on top of say you know Twilio xapi eyes

930
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,869
or somebody like that you are very

931
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:47,669
likely to be calling out to google's or

932
00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:49,710
some other large cloud providers voice

933
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:51,450
recognition system because it gets

934
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,280
better results than any of the local

935
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,020
systems or anything else like the cloud

936
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,550
systems do have a higher recognition

937
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,590
right then in anything else we've

938
00:40:56,550 --> 00:41:00,480
measured its energy thanks for the

939
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,970
clarification it might be worth keeping

940
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,320
in mind then that it's particularly the

941
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:07,020
case where you want both voice

942
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:08,550
recognition and then an interconnect to

943
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:10,890
some other system because that API is

944
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:15,630
kind of a critical question that you

945
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:17,490
eventually need to answer Thanks um so

946
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:18,960
to give a flavour of the type of thing

947
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:20,279
we're thinking about and I wouldn't say

948
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,570
any of these ideas are locked down in

949
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,160
any way whatsoever and I'm going to talk

950
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:26,940
about how bunch of them are different

951
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,850
than the draft is even today so in any

952
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:31,770
one of these calls they have you know

953
00:41:28,850 --> 00:41:33,630
sort of there's someone at the beginning

954
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,530
maybe it's offline ahead of time or but

955
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,390
there's there's a way of understanding

956
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:39,540
the capabilities of both systems at some

957
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,640
level there's a way of setting up a

958
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,930
media flow and saying what actual

959
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:44,790
capabilities you're using you know this

960
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:47,190
is Opus or this is jisub on the the

961
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:48,869
facts about it there's some event

962
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,460
notification back particularly we're

963
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:53,130
talking about PSTN are off call you know

964
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,040
calls ringing the calls answered those

965
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,060
types of ideas and I and I think that's

966
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,290
you know it's one of difficulties is the

967
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:00,930
way that was mapped into sip wasn't

968
00:41:58,290 --> 00:42:02,480
really ideal it was was always confused

969
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,339
with how the billing was going to work

970
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:07,320
and then there's the actual media audio

971
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:09,060
and DTMF and video is what this is

972
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,830
expanding into or the the key ones we're

973
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:14,910
thinking about right now the

974
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,350
capabilities there's some proposal in

975
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:20,190
this document for just a simple way to

976
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:21,600
do capabilities I'll talk about range of

977
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:25,980
different ways we might solve that right

978
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:28,200
now I am arguing very much for a

979
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:30,180
wholesale replacement of SDP to

980
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:31,589
something much more much simpler based

981
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,540
on the work that John and I did very

982
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:37,109
many years ago on advertisement

983
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:38,910
proposals justin is at the far end of

984
00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:41,000
spectrum from me as usual and he is our

985
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:43,950
before we totally use sdp offer answer

986
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,630
so if this strikes anyone is funny it

987
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:49,348
strikes both of us is funny because it's

988
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:50,880
a 180 from where we were on web RTC but

989
00:42:49,349 --> 00:42:53,970
you know there's some range of those and

990
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,609
in between I'm gonna skip the slide a

991
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,839
caller ID right now we're just passport

992
00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:00,630
seems to be the thing we're looking at

993
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,299
open to other ideas there but we need

994
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:05,819
some identity mapping um the protocol

995
00:43:03,299 --> 00:43:09,240
mapping there's some some rough proposal

996
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:11,880
how to move this into HTTP like requests

997
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:13,140
where you can you know have objects

998
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,180
representing calls and stayed in

999
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:18,240
information about that I would views all

1000
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,828
of this right now as you know a

1001
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,419
laughable straw man at the beginning of

1002
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:23,940
it and we need to so refine that and

1003
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:25,799
bring that in but we want the point here

1004
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:28,289
is we want to do it in a way where we

1005
00:43:25,799 --> 00:43:31,288
can take advantage of all the ways we

1006
00:43:28,289 --> 00:43:33,329
build modern applications in HTTP based

1007
00:43:31,289 --> 00:43:34,769
data centers and take advantage of the

1008
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:36,210
infrastructure that there's they use it

1009
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:39,808
and make sure we can use those for voice

1010
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,849
calls not just other applications um

1011
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,609
the media by ways was oleh to send

1012
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:47,279
real-time media both directions by

1013
00:43:44,609 --> 00:43:52,130
striping multiple transactions over an

1014
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:54,779
HTTP connection I I think this was a an

1015
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:56,700
initial sort of stab at something to get

1016
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,259
something down but I really think that

1017
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,339
if the web transport stuff goes well

1018
00:43:58,259 --> 00:44:00,690
this week we'd probably move to

1019
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:03,538
something like that I don't think any of

1020
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:04,859
us are very are thrilled with this exact

1021
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:05,299
design if we can figure out something

1022
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:07,410
better

1023
00:44:05,299 --> 00:44:08,910
Jonathan Rowland largely wrote this up

1024
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:11,308
to show that that something is possible

1025
00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,379
like here's here's proof of existence of

1026
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:15,359
we could do something and you know

1027
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:17,549
variations of this have been implemented

1028
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,839
by meander mini voice over IP systems

1029
00:44:17,549 --> 00:44:21,599
over the years so it's not like there's

1030
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:23,808
not much to invent here but we're you

1031
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,980
know I think that the desire is moving

1032
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:27,059
to something largely running over quick

1033
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:29,670
because we believe quick will be

1034
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:31,650
supporting the data centers with

1035
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:32,910
probably unreliable transactions which

1036
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,960
we'd like to see going there so that's

1037
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:37,920
that's where we're thinking on some of

1038
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,509
that transport stuff events this is our

1039
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:42,210
simple set of events that we have right

1040
00:44:39,509 --> 00:44:43,529
now of the feedback information I don't

1041
00:44:42,210 --> 00:44:46,460
think much more than this is needed I

1042
00:44:43,529 --> 00:44:48,809
think that pretty much deals with it

1043
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:51,210
we're interested in being able to do

1044
00:44:48,809 --> 00:44:52,800
things like how both sides say to move a

1045
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,660
call because they need to

1046
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,640
administratively take down a server and

1047
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,279
bring up another one or load-balanced or

1048
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,170
are many of those issues so either side

1049
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,090
of this sort of trunk that's going on

1050
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:05,550
can move it to a different server and

1051
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:07,080
that you know embedding that in the

1052
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:08,220
design from day one really makes it a

1053
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:10,350
lot easier to deal with some of the

1054
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,819
stuff and when I say move I mean it's

1055
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:15,230
moving the signaling and the media which

1056
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,230
are both shared over the same connection

1057
00:45:15,410 --> 00:45:21,270
security you know TLS hop two hop

1058
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,520
ooofff for some of the client

1059
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:25,920
authentication stuff ant and when our

1060
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,870
scope was only PSTN we didn't really see

1061
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,170
a need for Indian security because it

1062
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:34,680
really went from one hop to the PSTN

1063
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:36,840
gateway where then all security ended so

1064
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,919
that one hop was already secured the

1065
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:40,410
Indian wasn't gonna buy you anything

1066
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,360
there and so you know but as we move to

1067
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:48,810
using it down to clients and expanding

1068
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:50,280
out the use cases for use in in downed

1069
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:52,740
clients and a broader sort of things in

1070
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,900
video then clearly some sort of Indian

1071
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,399
security needs to be put in here rough

1072
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:58,260
thinking right now people been sort of

1073
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,270
vaguely talking about the ideas of MLS

1074
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:02,940
but we need a clear identity mechanism I

1075
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:04,740
mean we need to know who's encrypting it

1076
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,780
to who we don't you know or else not

1077
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:09,390
really it was a susceptible dama man in

1078
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,830
the middle so that part needs some some

1079
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:12,600
big questions as big answers there

1080
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:16,350
before we figure out what to do we're

1081
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:17,759
looking for feedback on that so this is

1082
00:46:16,350 --> 00:46:21,000
what questions where I'd love love some

1083
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,040
feedback um you know the the problem

1084
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,570
scope is the biggest thing right now

1085
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,770
when we originally thought about this we

1086
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:31,260
were thinking only between data centers

1087
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:32,610
and PSTN gateway providers and and it

1088
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,380
was for PSTN on ROM now we've expanded

1089
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:36,720
that out quite a bit for like the speech

1090
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,220
recognition case and we're talking about

1091
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:41,459
moving out to audio and video and also

1092
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:44,270
to endpoints anyone have feedback on

1093
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,270
this one way or another

1094
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:58,640
you know we're not above an exit I think

1095
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,620
a lot of the ideas have applicability

1096
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,390
and all of those things that doesn't

1097
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:05,000
mean you should try to do them all with

1098
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:06,890
one protocol but I mean some of that

1099
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,960
some of the I mean the basic paradigm

1100
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:18,759
you describe could be used for many of

1101
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:21,980
those things Chris when Chris went I

1102
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:23,870
think you know I've been thinking about

1103
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,630
this stuff in multiple contexts we've

1104
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:29,720
been talking about video relay services

1105
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:34,640
like in FCC context we've been talking

1106
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:36,169
about you know just like a lot of people

1107
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,970
are building web RTC gateways that

1108
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:38,990
support audio and telephone calls and

1109
00:47:37,970 --> 00:47:43,629
other things like that

1110
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:46,479
I think the fundamental problem is that

1111
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:50,420
video has turned out to be pretty much

1112
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,300
multi-party context with no features no

1113
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,820
application features but we have this

1114
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,430
thing and the PSTN side where for

1115
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:01,460
enterprise telephone calls for any

1116
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:05,629
complex thing we have all these you know

1117
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:07,730
diversion all this stuff you know and

1118
00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:09,290
and when you talk about like Enda and

1119
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,850
security and all this stuff if you're

1120
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:13,640
passing calls like all over the place

1121
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:17,540
and it's being forwarded it just like

1122
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,790
becomes a complete mess so you know in

1123
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,070
the way that we've implemented things we

1124
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:23,720
sort of try to abstract that stuff but

1125
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:25,640
the problem is the applications sort of

1126
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,140
like you have the N and I on one side

1127
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:29,480
you have the applications and the

1128
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:31,430
network and then you have you know the

1129
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:35,210
essentially pure connection thing that

1130
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:38,359
goes from the application to the actual

1131
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:41,870
endpoint and your and at the end of the

1132
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:45,170
day that's just about media I mean there

1133
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:47,150
is the other complication of terminals

1134
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,520
that actually implement applications as

1135
00:48:47,150 --> 00:48:52,190
well and other things like that but like

1136
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:53,990
I think you know I haven't really scoped

1137
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:57,560
that too well but I think that hopefully

1138
00:48:53,990 --> 00:49:00,649
that illustrates part of the problem I

1139
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:03,290
think we're facing when we try to

1140
00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:07,850
look at supporting things in terms of

1141
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:12,860
trunks or trying to combine the world of

1142
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:15,040
video and current telephony that makes

1143
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,040
sense

1144
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:24,560
Eric rajala so this feels a little like

1145
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:26,930
fighting a lost war um so when you know

1146
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,490
when SIPP was like first designed um you

1147
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:34,330
know it was designed as a quasi like

1148
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,620
decentralized um you know quasi

1149
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:38,900
peer-to-peer system or centralized

1150
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:40,490
signaling and that didn't work out like

1151
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,390
as well as we were hoping and we kind of

1152
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:46,040
got like centralized like everything and

1153
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:48,170
like I can certainly see like one would

1154
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:50,480
have the urge to be like well let's just

1155
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:51,860
like declare defeat and be like let's

1156
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,720
say I like centralized everything and

1157
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:55,240
you know in design a system which

1158
00:49:53,720 --> 00:50:01,069
doesn't have any of those mechanisms

1159
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:02,990
centralized but like you know Simon to

1160
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:05,480
do that at the same time has like you

1161
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:08,029
know as like the PSTN is dying and like

1162
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:09,470
over the top is taking off and an end in

1163
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:13,820
encryption is like more important than

1164
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:15,680
ever I mean just seems like like this is

1165
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,360
the design you like one might have one

1166
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:19,279
would have done 20 years ago and now

1167
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:21,620
we're talking having this design now and

1168
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,780
not having a like design which is like

1169
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,640
endpoint first now just like seems

1170
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,080
either one direction so I mean if you

1171
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,990
will design like some new thing that

1172
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:35,900
like uses quick and like you know and

1173
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:38,120
and um and it is you know um and doesn't

1174
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:39,620
use STP or like you know doesn't use a

1175
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:41,299
circular or whatever because you think

1176
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,589
that like the the modalities those

1177
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,820
things are set up for like that seems

1178
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,980
like a reasonable thing that you need to

1179
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,570
talk about but like starting from the

1180
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,680
position that like you're a design which

1181
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:50,060
I get inappropriate for anything with

1182
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,490
centralized conferencing like some flies

1183
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:55,130
calling just like I'm talking anymore

1184
00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:56,330
but that so I'm fair enough I got your

1185
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:57,950
point I should be clear to I should have

1186
00:50:56,330 --> 00:50:59,330
said this is the game I have no thought

1187
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,439
that this is going to replace anything

1188
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:02,720
that people are doing with sip today

1189
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,360
it's about building the new applications

1190
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,680
on top of that my big science and it's

1191
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:08,360
like then that but that makes me very

1192
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,740
sad because now you basically now you

1193
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:11,160
now you design and you're putting design

1194
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,359
together which normals

1195
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,740
when you try to like when you try to

1196
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,210
like actually use it for like any kind

1197
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:21,180
of like peer to peer or calling uh you

1198
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:22,590
your why do you want to say like why do

1199
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,620
you believe MLS would not be appropriate

1200
00:51:22,590 --> 00:51:27,180
there or are you see what I mean

1201
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:30,630
like I don't want that media to go to

1202
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:32,609
location like I mean this is a design

1203
00:51:30,630 --> 00:51:35,130
this is design this is a client-server

1204
00:51:32,610 --> 00:51:37,710
design with potentially over-the-top and

1205
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:39,060
crushing other cut yourself onto it

1206
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,320
right right you're not talking about

1207
00:51:39,060 --> 00:51:41,759
security you're talking about the media

1208
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:43,190
routing being going through a

1209
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,720
centralized server versus peer-to-peer

1210
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,770
in part I mean right this is just this

1211
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,299
is just designed as AI star

1212
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:51,090
configuration I clearly show yeah

1213
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:53,700
totally yeah ah yes but the fact that

1214
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:55,710
then it also has like hand-wave may be

1215
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:58,710
inserted in encryption here like is like

1216
00:51:55,710 --> 00:52:00,540
a little stretching as well right so I

1217
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:02,180
will say that the reality of current

1218
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:05,790
deployments including all the new

1219
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:10,140
systems do seem to largely be using that

1220
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:16,350
cloud server mediated media path right I

1221
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:18,600
mean Jeff Lennox on the question of just

1222
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:21,720
audio or audio and video I think a lot

1223
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,819
of the reasons why video you know the

1224
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:26,930
lot of things that make video so

1225
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:29,520
annoying in both RTP and SDP is that

1226
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:31,680
they were both designed with let's do

1227
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,750
audio first we understand that and we'll

1228
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:35,490
retrofit video later and it turns out

1229
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,780
that video is very different and you

1230
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:38,580
know has a lot of new requirements and

1231
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,320
retrofitting them on is hard so I would

1232
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:42,000
say either design us with video from the

1233
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:44,370
beginning or explicitly to care video

1234
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:50,040
out of scope don't have don't say you're

1235
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:52,290
gonna add video later John Peterson and

1236
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,210
I love when the ITF divides things into

1237
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:57,420
you and I and and I finally feel at home

1238
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:59,940
here in the ITF and that's actually what

1239
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:01,710
I guess I wanted to say about the first

1240
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,510
bullet here I mean I think if you're

1241
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:05,880
gonna do this and just declare an and I

1242
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:07,800
which one could maybe something that

1243
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,230
might soften the blow of Becker's

1244
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,760
despair there is it have any at least

1245
00:53:10,230 --> 00:53:13,890
some requirement for what you and I

1246
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,540
would be that would then interface with

1247
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:17,069
this in a way that would enable and end

1248
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:19,259
security without necessarily being

1249
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,790
prescriptive about what that uni

1250
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:21,840
interface is going to be because the

1251
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:24,000
Chris Ben's point I mean it's very

1252
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:24,960
pluralist it could be you know Weber

1253
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,330
Kesey or something right

1254
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:29,070
that is connecting up to WebEx and then

1255
00:53:27,330 --> 00:53:31,500
WebEx is talking across the Comcast and

1256
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:33,540
I can imagine there being an N and I as

1257
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:35,430
much as you know the words turn to ash

1258
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:37,230
as my mouth defined here on the ITF for

1259
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:40,200
precisely those kinds of cases but only

1260
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:42,330
if it then had these hooks say okay you

1261
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:44,939
know any uni that is gonna work with

1262
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,279
this must provide the following things

1263
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:48,510
that enable and end security and I think

1264
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:50,250
they probably are available in like

1265
00:53:48,510 --> 00:53:51,839
WebRTC and things like it right but I

1266
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:54,060
could see you dodging the bullet that

1267
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,040
way not doing between endpoints just

1268
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:57,390
doing the between data set data center

1269
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,770
server parts but just putting

1270
00:53:57,390 --> 00:54:06,779
requirements on you and eyes that can

1271
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:08,490
interface with them Brian Rosen I I have

1272
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,690
this feeling when you got up here and

1273
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:14,910
said oh now we're gonna talk about

1274
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:17,930
endpoints that this is sip 3.0 I mean

1275
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:22,279
where you're talking about redesigning

1276
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:26,399
the protocol for creating multimedia

1277
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:28,920
connections across the internet and it

1278
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:32,190
might really be time to talk about that

1279
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:35,369
I'm I'm not afraid of opening that but

1280
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:37,830
what I am afraid of is side stepping

1281
00:54:35,369 --> 00:54:41,430
into it because that's what we did was

1282
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:44,279
set and and we didn't say no we're

1283
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:46,259
really talking about a protocol for

1284
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,790
doing multimedia communications over the

1285
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:53,040
Internet the right way if we're gonna do

1286
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:54,599
that and we might want to do that that

1287
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:57,690
might be the right it might be the right

1288
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:59,160
time to talk about doing that but let's

1289
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:04,800
decide that that's what we're gonna do

1290
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:07,589
and not do something small that turns

1291
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,510
into the wort on the elephant please

1292
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:11,490
that makes sense the same thing Jonathan

1293
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:14,670
said about a slice of it you're saying

1294
00:55:11,490 --> 00:55:18,569
about the whole broad thing Mosin any

1295
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:22,589
two points on the scope endpoints and

1296
00:55:18,570 --> 00:55:23,730
video greatly greatly magnify the amount

1297
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:26,910
of work that that's gonna have to be

1298
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:28,950
done for this the amount of complexity

1299
00:55:26,910 --> 00:55:31,170
that comes and the ugliness that would

1300
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:32,879
that we think lies in STP and separate

1301
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,130
things like that is not really just

1302
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:36,790
syntactical ugliness there's a lot of

1303
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,640
complication that

1304
00:55:36,790 --> 00:55:41,710
an endpoint specific audio formats or if

1305
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,259
you're talking about just going to a you

1306
00:55:41,710 --> 00:55:45,880
know I TSP mmm there's usually a very

1307
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:47,710
simple set of rules that you could use

1308
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:48,280
and and you could standardize it and

1309
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:50,650
that'd be easy

1310
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:51,970
adding in points to the mix to allow you

1311
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:54,700
know endpoint to endpoint even

1312
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:57,069
communication that greatly expands the

1313
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,500
universe of of codecs and formats and

1314
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:02,140
and and and when you add video another

1315
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:04,690
two to four X Factor so I think it's

1316
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:06,069
good to keep those in mind but somebody

1317
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:08,440
has to be conscious that this is easily

1318
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:10,270
a four to eight X you know amount of

1319
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:16,450
effort for adding those things in the

1320
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:19,600
scope aircrew scroll again so I mean I

1321
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:22,210
guess this is dispatch not often so

1322
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,830
usually that is our call John Wooden

1323
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:26,770
culpa don't I do but the you know the

1324
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:28,509
usual things here are um you know this

1325
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:30,790
should be a be sponsored killer will

1326
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:32,980
fire this should be a t sponsored there

1327
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:34,840
should be a buff or ticketing working

1328
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:36,640
group I think clearly

1329
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:38,950
like we can't be any sponsoring this

1330
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:40,210
like that's like way too big um I can't

1331
00:56:38,950 --> 00:56:43,509
go missed you working coop also we can

1332
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:45,340
make um I don't think his bite my my

1333
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,320
concerns earlier I'm not sure I didn't

1334
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,540
say kill it with fire so I think the

1335
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:51,400
only plausible outcome on here is you

1336
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,610
need to like he's like you know you know

1337
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:53,710
like

1338
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:55,870
put together a buff puzzle for like the

1339
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,310
next you know next idea right or some

1340
00:56:55,870 --> 00:57:01,029
future IT effort I guess forgive you

1341
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:02,470
mailing list I had a couple more slides

1342
00:57:01,030 --> 00:57:04,090
on this but I'm not I think that we're

1343
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:05,859
actually getting the heart of at what's

1344
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:07,090
the actual important part of things to

1345
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:08,320
discuss right now so I'm fine with the

1346
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:13,360
discussion we can and wherever we need

1347
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:15,310
to end and I I as clearly to me it needs

1348
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:17,500
to be a working group I totally agree on

1349
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,120
I think I think you know at that point

1350
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:21,640
once you know once you come with a

1351
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:22,630
proposal that has like a scope then we

1352
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,640
can debate whether or not those all the

1353
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:25,750
right things but trying to hear well and

1354
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,190
I mean was the point I started this

1355
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,930
slide deck on to is I'm trying to get

1356
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:30,670
the information to help write a proposed

1357
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:32,259
charter is about the stage less I guess

1358
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,810
and watch and what my port would be I'd

1359
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:38,350
like you to have more I'd like you don't

1360
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:40,710
have to come more cut more a combination

1361
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:43,810
in consideration for the cases that's

1362
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:45,100
okay that's let's get feedback so one

1363
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:47,770
comment from the chariot this has been

1364
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:50,319
the one thing I think Edgar left out of

1365
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,700
this list is that we can dispatch things

1366
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:53,170
directly to a mini working group or that

1367
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:54,549
sort of thing or even a full working

1368
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,780
group and bill charter working here if

1369
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:58,210
the eighties want to do it that way

1370
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:01,000
but I'm not saying that's what we should

1371
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:03,370
do but it's still an option I mean I I

1372
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,370
think Brian's characterization of this

1373
00:58:03,370 --> 00:58:09,009
it's as sip 3.0 or at least maybe 2.9

1374
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:13,230
but probably 3.0 like Ito this is not

1375
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:13,230
not a this is not a mini working group

1376
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:26,440
on that note mark Nottingham uh so are

1377
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,450
you giving up in your presentation or is

1378
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,920
there more to come I have a more general

1379
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,669
comment I'm happy to wait I'm happy to

1380
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,860
do it

1381
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:34,630
I'm giving up on my presentation okay we

1382
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:36,220
have we have a solid 15 minutes left so

1383
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:37,570
people want to ask questions about their

1384
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:39,490
technology and explore that further we

1385
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,220
got some time we can also go right into

1386
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:44,109
the just patchy questions of you okay so

1387
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,069
I'm gonna put slides in front of people

1388
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,660
though while they're talking just for

1389
00:58:45,070 --> 00:58:48,370
the fun of it just just randomly in

1390
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,080
random slide you are teasing mark with

1391
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,660
the slide so I'm here and not talk about

1392
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:55,480
uh I just would like to make a

1393
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:58,480
suggestion and it's going to require

1394
00:58:55,480 --> 00:59:00,070
some work on your part but you will have

1395
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:05,590
the eternal gratitude of the community

1396
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:07,810
and I'll buy you a drink so we have this

1397
00:59:05,590 --> 00:59:09,850
draft in in HTTP working group called

1398
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:13,360
BCP 56 bits it is surprisingly a

1399
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:15,940
revision of BCP 56 which is how to use

1400
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:18,550
HTTP as a substrate for transfer for

1401
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:21,910
application protocols and it is

1402
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:23,800
attempting to give advice and best

1403
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:25,330
practice for how you build something on

1404
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,160
top of HTTP to get the most out of the

1405
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:28,840
infrastructure which sounds like what

1406
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:30,850
you're trying to do and document

1407
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:33,880
well-known pitfalls and so forth I would

1408
00:59:30,850 --> 00:59:36,009
love it if this were to actually if you

1409
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,110
decide to do this if you overcome the

1410
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:39,580
other hurdles you have when you start

1411
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:43,690
that process to look at that document

1412
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:45,400
and either take its advice and change

1413
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:47,410
what you're doing we're necessary or

1414
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,840
tell us why you don't think you need to

1415
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:53,410
change or tell us why you didn't you

1416
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:55,030
know just report back and that would

1417
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:57,100
help us make sure that that document is

1418
00:59:55,030 --> 00:59:58,420
is doing the right thing because we're

1419
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,560
seeing more and more we've talked about

1420
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,500
this before we're seeing more more

1421
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:04,299
protocols using HTTP they're kind of all

1422
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,570
over the map and so we need to document

1423
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,790
these

1424
01:00:04,570 --> 01:00:08,350
practices we think it's done we're just

1425
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:09,250
waiting for the HP core documents to

1426
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:11,140
finish so that they can be referenced

1427
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:13,510
but there's still time to incorporate

1428
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,400
feedback so it would be ever so helpful

1429
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:17,200
and drink worthy if you were to do that

1430
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,670
and I suppose you want feedback more

1431
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,560
than my last time when I said we should

1432
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:25,450
deprecated the draft was the feedback so

1433
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:28,779
like more constructive than that to

1434
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:30,970
drink quality so I think that the thing

1435
01:00:28,780 --> 01:00:33,820
is maybe I can try maybe there's a

1436
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:35,680
couple other people who know HTTP fairly

1437
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:38,500
well and web RTC and the problems went

1438
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:40,180
wrong with it they could help scope some

1439
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:42,910
of this into that that's I mean I think

1440
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:44,470
we need some HTTP expert we look so

1441
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:46,029
here's that we need some HTTP clue

1442
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:48,220
involved with the people who are sending

1443
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:50,350
real-time media over quick right like

1444
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,240
we're not debating that sure so how do

1445
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,680
we get a short call together with that

1446
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,200
group of people and sort those things

1447
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,520
out and provide feedback for BCP 56 I

1448
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,960
think it'll be great if you looked at

1449
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,270
the document first and then had the

1450
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,010
discussion because the h-2b clue doesn't

1451
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:04,090
scale there are a lot more people trying

1452
01:01:03,010 --> 01:01:05,260
to build protocols on top of it than we

1453
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,030
have people available to give their

1454
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:09,730
vendor reviews because they have day

1455
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:11,410
jobs and so forth and so on so if you

1456
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:13,270
just start by doing that and then we can

1457
01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:13,450
try and give you some some reasons fair

1458
01:01:13,270 --> 01:01:17,730
enough

1459
01:01:13,450 --> 01:01:17,730
I'll do that okay I won't drink though

1460
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:26,200
Chris went I generally agree with the

1461
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:29,850
discussion going on but I to try to go

1462
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:32,649
to back to my original point I think

1463
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:35,049
there has to be some explicit you know

1464
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:38,590
scope that's decided that are we trying

1465
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:41,410
to solve you know some interoperable a

1466
01:01:38,590 --> 01:01:44,770
peer to peer signaling or multi-party

1467
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:46,690
signaling or are we trying to solve like

1468
01:01:44,770 --> 01:01:49,390
things like how contact centers

1469
01:01:46,690 --> 01:01:51,610
interface with different interconnection

1470
01:01:49,390 --> 01:01:53,230
points and all this other stuff because

1471
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:59,730
I think those are two completely

1472
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:59,730
different problems okay

1473
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,309
so I guess we can explicitly open the

1474
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:10,339
floor for questions on sort of just

1475
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:12,290
better suggestions Bryan Rosen I I keep

1476
01:02:10,339 --> 01:02:14,270
thinking that if you try to limit the

1477
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,970
scope somebody's gonna come for the next

1478
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:21,410
meeting and expand the scope and if

1479
01:02:16,970 --> 01:02:24,618
unless you unless that that we're really

1480
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:26,808
are better off maybe starting with a

1481
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:28,099
subset in other words saying well we're

1482
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:30,410
not gonna boil the ocean in the first

1483
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:32,450
version of the protocol but if our

1484
01:02:30,410 --> 01:02:36,078
intention is to think about doing this

1485
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:37,669
over then let's design it that way even

1486
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,220
if we're starting with a limited scope

1487
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:42,109
which I absolutely admire or recommend

1488
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,720
doing start with limited scope just

1489
01:02:42,109 --> 01:02:46,490
don't have that in mind don't think that

1490
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:49,220
the only piece we're doing is that

1491
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:50,750
whatever you start with because I just

1492
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:52,549
don't think that that's gonna happen I

1493
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:56,119
think especially if it's good because

1494
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:57,890
especially if it succeeds result we will

1495
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:00,319
have we will have the problems that we

1496
01:02:57,890 --> 01:03:01,819
created and said right so I mean III

1497
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:03,950
think a bunch of things I heard today

1498
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:05,270
really rang true with me of first of all

1499
01:03:03,950 --> 01:03:07,549
I totally believe that this group of

1500
01:03:05,270 --> 01:03:09,049
people will inevitably expand this to

1501
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:10,549
fill all the space you know all the type

1502
01:03:09,049 --> 01:03:14,000
of problems that wants to obey be very

1503
01:03:10,549 --> 01:03:17,630
broad scope right video as ekor points

1504
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,790
out peer to peer so it seems like we

1505
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:21,740
need to you know we didn't deal with a

1506
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:23,210
lot of those things when we design sip

1507
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:26,419
from day one it was very much a

1508
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:29,540
trapezoid model and with proxies which

1509
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:31,250
then didn't exist I mean I think we have

1510
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:32,839
to learn from that and and I mean like

1511
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:34,280
what Jonathan said about video can't add

1512
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:36,109
it later we can't add peer-to-peer

1513
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,400
security later or we you know we're

1514
01:03:36,109 --> 01:03:39,319
going to have to hit all of those from

1515
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,790
the beginning is that like as I was

1516
01:03:39,319 --> 01:03:43,160
listening to everyone talking like that

1517
01:03:40,790 --> 01:03:44,720
seems inevitable to me we could we could

1518
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,040
discuss for a long time how big that

1519
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:48,259
ocean is and how much we wish it was

1520
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,808
smaller but in the end I I doubt we're

1521
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:52,819
willing to go forward unless we solve

1522
01:03:50,809 --> 01:03:55,130
some of those problems or have a picture

1523
01:03:52,819 --> 01:03:57,319
of how they're going to be solved so I

1524
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:59,440
think that's the direction I'm leaning

1525
01:03:57,319 --> 01:04:03,980
right now on on thinking about this

1526
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:06,829
which does not make it a mini mini

1527
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:08,240
anything so you began you me and your

1528
01:04:06,829 --> 01:04:09,829
presentation saying you were you know

1529
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:11,359
sort of seeking advice on helping to

1530
01:04:09,829 --> 01:04:13,400
build that charter do you think that's

1531
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,640
been our proposed charter do you think

1532
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:17,540
that's been accomplished or definitely

1533
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,160
on the

1534
01:04:17,540 --> 01:04:20,480
overall scope and the important of why

1535
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:28,339
we need to bring some of these things in

1536
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:29,780
I I mean I think that one of the things

1537
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:32,510
I would say particularly in this

1538
01:04:29,780 --> 01:04:34,190
negotiation scope is one of the

1539
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:37,280
decisions we made in WebRTC which

1540
01:04:34,190 --> 01:04:38,870
extremely limited WebRTC was that we are

1541
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:42,050
going to try and gateway to sip from

1542
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:45,560
WebRTC without processing the media and

1543
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:47,240
I think that the view here is to not

1544
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:48,650
have that limitation not worry about the

1545
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:50,509
past not heard about backwards

1546
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,760
interoperability and any gateway to an

1547
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:56,390
existing sip system would require full

1548
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:58,550
gateway of the media and that that's

1549
01:04:56,390 --> 01:04:59,990
that's just the nature of being able to

1550
01:04:58,550 --> 01:05:04,550
remove all the limitations we had in

1551
01:04:59,990 --> 01:05:10,089
designing web RTC people strongly

1552
01:05:04,550 --> 01:05:10,090
disagree with that I'd love to hear I

1553
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:19,040
think when I think about the security

1554
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:22,549
stuff one of my biggest problems or one

1555
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:24,710
of my biggest questions is you know how

1556
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,270
we deal with the identity stuff I would

1557
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:27,440
love to hear people not not right now at

1558
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:29,840
the mic but just come and talk to me

1559
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:34,190
this week and talk about how can we make

1560
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:35,450
a how can we make the indie and security

1561
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:36,590
in a way that was actually work what

1562
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:37,640
would our design like that look how

1563
01:05:36,590 --> 01:05:38,720
would we scope that because that's

1564
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:41,660
that's one of the problems I really

1565
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:44,810
struggle with and yeah I think that's a

1566
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:47,089
good place to stop so this has been

1567
01:05:44,810 --> 01:05:50,560
speaking for the chairs just listening

1568
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:52,640
to everything we've heard here and and

1569
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:56,240
you know I see that there seems to be

1570
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:00,140
interest the scope needs to be

1571
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:03,109
constrained yet big the the the almost

1572
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:05,089
all of these scope questions came down

1573
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:06,410
to you had to be good if he can

1574
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:09,710
constrain this but people are gonna add

1575
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:13,040
on to it and the chairs think this

1576
01:06:09,710 --> 01:06:14,510
probably Crosse area impact here this is

1577
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,890
not just purely art because we're

1578
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:21,140
talking about transport issues and all

1579
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:22,580
these things so we're feeling like what

1580
01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:23,990
we're getting for hearing trying to

1581
01:06:22,580 --> 01:06:25,040
integrate everything we're hearing in

1582
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:28,640
the rooms that we're talking about a

1583
01:06:25,040 --> 01:06:30,390
buff and yeah so I was a duck to see if

1584
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:33,069
you threw something at me when I said

1585
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:35,379
well you know I mean the way we did

1586
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:36,490
WebRTC from this point in WebRTC to the

1587
01:06:35,380 --> 01:06:38,380
point we had a working group was about

1588
01:06:36,490 --> 01:06:40,629
two years who's gonna make a slide on

1589
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:42,550
that I we need to do better than that we

1590
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:45,640
need to figure out like ITF is going to

1591
01:06:42,550 --> 01:06:47,620
fail if that's that's our process but I

1592
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,529
don't disagree with we we need a Boff ID

1593
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:53,230
at all on this never mind this slide but

1594
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:54,370
so you know but I think we should we

1595
01:06:53,230 --> 01:06:57,400
should get moving on it and figure out

1596
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:59,140
how to have a boss that moves quickly so

1597
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,940
we're looking at your slide you would

1598
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,350
use and you'll get a charter to that ESG

1599
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,960
would be getting a buff Charter to the

1600
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:07,810
if or a buff coupled ASG then we're

1601
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,580
talking about I mean the this whole

1602
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:12,940
discussion is expanded the scope greatly

1603
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:15,460
then when I wrote this slide right but I

1604
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:19,060
I think the the thing that we need to

1605
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:21,670
think about is as a group is how do we

1606
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,210
move things along quickly versus doing

1607
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:27,970
them away we've always done them and

1608
01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:29,470
that doesn't that doesn't remove the

1609
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:31,029
need for a Boff on something that's

1610
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:34,029
large okay I'm not arguing that in the

1611
01:07:31,030 --> 01:07:35,410
slice so I'm hearing you say we need to

1612
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:38,260
do the things we always we've always

1613
01:07:35,410 --> 01:07:40,509
done but just do them faster let's

1614
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,190
figure out where we can a lot of our

1615
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:43,330
discussions have the nature of everybody

1616
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:44,650
knows where it's going to end eight

1617
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:46,090
months from now and we spend eight

1618
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,260
months having the discussion we need to

1619
01:07:46,090 --> 01:07:50,010
figure out how to make those discussions

1620
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,010
takes less than eight months

1621
01:07:55,710 --> 01:08:01,990
this is Barry liebe given that we think

1622
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:05,050
we want to have a buff on this in

1623
01:08:01,990 --> 01:08:08,080
Vancouver that restricts when we could

1624
01:08:05,050 --> 01:08:10,270
get something formal but we can

1625
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:12,340
certainly set up a mailing list and have

1626
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:15,430
people continue writing documents and

1627
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:20,560
move this forward while that happens and

1628
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:22,450
I don't think we should wait for Heroes

1629
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:25,150
Nick there is no reason you can't do a

1630
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:27,220
virtual buff and have it happen before

1631
01:08:25,149 --> 01:08:30,009
Vancouver and things along more quickly

1632
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:33,010
as per what you're looking at if you

1633
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:36,240
want to move quickly do things now do

1634
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:36,240
things not face-to-face

1635
01:08:39,020 --> 01:08:45,109
Robert sparks Cullen right now you own

1636
01:08:41,839 --> 01:08:47,059
the delay remember the discussion give

1637
01:08:45,109 --> 01:08:50,450
ekor the discussion he was looking for

1638
01:08:47,060 --> 01:08:53,750
for example I knew I was gonna get that

1639
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:55,189
comment that's very fair Robert yeah I

1640
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:59,120
mean I wouldn't put it that way

1641
01:08:55,189 --> 01:09:02,149
um arrogant but I think you know you're

1642
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:07,250
surely right to say that um usually

1643
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:08,660
right to say that that you know

1644
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:09,710
sometimes discussions everyone knows was

1645
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:11,960
gonna go eight months from now it takes

1646
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:13,370
forever to get there um but I guess I

1647
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:16,330
don't know this is gonna get where this

1648
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:20,210
is gonna go and um so I think you know

1649
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:21,410
like you know obviously you've been

1650
01:09:20,210 --> 01:09:23,299
around this divorce like a you know you

1651
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:24,979
know I think your next steps are like

1652
01:09:23,299 --> 01:09:26,899
sound like like one to one in a small

1653
01:09:24,979 --> 01:09:27,950
group socialize these ideas and try to

1654
01:09:26,899 --> 01:09:28,910
like Camille's feedback or try to come

1655
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,528
back home pros all that you think

1656
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:32,269
addresses like most the people's

1657
01:09:30,529 --> 01:09:33,560
feedback and then like it and we can

1658
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:35,029
crank it through fast but I think that

1659
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:36,410
the problem the problem here probably

1660
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:39,980
right now is all the process the problem

1661
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:41,000
right now is consensus now let's say you

1662
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:42,108
can't get consensus quickly but a

1663
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,120
problem right now is something I mean

1664
01:09:42,109 --> 01:09:45,319
the problem the reason the reason people

1665
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,339
were saying sure of off is not just

1666
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:48,020
because a lot of work but it's also

1667
01:09:46,339 --> 01:09:49,760
because it's like they're crazy like a

1668
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:54,920
fair amount of like non total agreement

1669
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:57,050
out what want to be done okay hi Aaron

1670
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:59,360
Falk trying to think a little bit out of

1671
01:09:57,050 --> 01:10:01,100
the box in terms of process is there

1672
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,410
anything that would prohibit having a

1673
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:06,920
Boff in one of the open sessions later

1674
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:09,110
in the week I I don't think we could be

1675
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:10,340
seriously ready for that from from my

1676
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:12,679
take but I don't think there's anything

1677
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:14,180
that III don't think there's any process

1678
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:16,430
thing that eliminates that but I do not

1679
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:18,260
think the advocates of this would would

1680
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,470
have something that answered people's

1681
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:22,910
questions really put together by

1682
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:24,170
thinking cuz there's the you know the

1683
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:25,670
whole idea we get together face to face

1684
01:10:24,170 --> 01:10:28,720
is to have the high bandwidth

1685
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:28,720
discussions so yeah

1686
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:34,570
ELISA Cooper we could update that RFC

1687
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:37,330
about how to have a successful boss

1688
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:42,440
didn't plan it two days in advance as

1689
01:10:37,330 --> 01:10:44,090
one of the recommendations just musing

1690
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:48,230
about this a little bit I think the

1691
01:10:44,090 --> 01:10:50,120
tears that it took to charter RTC web is

1692
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:52,040
small compared to the eight years it

1693
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,940
took to complete the documents and so

1694
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:55,730
you might also

1695
01:10:52,940 --> 01:11:00,349
how to correct for that given that it's

1696
01:10:55,730 --> 01:11:02,660
a overlapping set of interested parties

1697
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:06,740
in an effort of approximately

1698
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:09,530
potentially similar size so maybe don't

1699
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,849
just I mean and in that case if there's

1700
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:12,290
actually very clear agreement about the

1701
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:14,690
scope when the chart when the thing

1702
01:11:12,290 --> 01:11:17,090
actually finally got chartered and yet

1703
01:11:14,690 --> 01:11:21,530
the eight years still passed so just

1704
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:24,470
something to think about I totally agree

1705
01:11:21,530 --> 01:11:27,170
it's been deeply on my mind I will say

1706
01:11:24,470 --> 01:11:28,820
that some people believe the solution to

1707
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:30,560
that is only involve people in the

1708
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:33,400
consensus process who are implementing

1709
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:35,720
it which would take it outside the IGF

1710
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:37,910
Saturday just reflecting something said

1711
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:40,640
in the room which was obviously what

1712
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:42,260
WebRTC needed was better chairs and as

1713
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,340
one of the chairs I'm sure that that's

1714
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:48,650
true and my apologies to you : is

1715
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:50,000
totally great of course but I I think

1716
01:11:48,650 --> 01:11:52,639
you you actually touched on a way to

1717
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,920
make this faster in your presentation

1718
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,630
and possibly weren't holding it up quite

1719
01:11:54,920 --> 01:11:58,310
high enough for people to realize it and

1720
01:11:56,630 --> 01:12:00,140
that is you're you're changing the

1721
01:11:58,310 --> 01:12:02,030
interoperability strategy here very

1722
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:05,780
fundamentally by saying you will no

1723
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:08,509
longer care to make it simple to do

1724
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:10,730
interoperation with legacy devices and

1725
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:15,410
the interoperability strategy that was

1726
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:20,059
taken up by WebRTC was to make it simple

1727
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:21,980
to do inter operation with legacy

1728
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:24,950
devices by presuming that the gateways

1729
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:27,019
themselves were very simple devices and

1730
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:28,970
not responsible for the media and I

1731
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:31,430
think if you if you do change that

1732
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:34,460
interoperability strategy and say this

1733
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:37,070
this this new thing is not in fact sip

1734
01:12:34,460 --> 01:12:40,760
3.0 and it will not care to do simple

1735
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:42,019
interoperation with previous versions of

1736
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:44,120
sip or WebRTC

1737
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:45,620
but is presuming that Andy

1738
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:49,130
interoperation goes through an

1739
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:52,910
arbitrarily complex gateway then your

1740
01:12:49,130 --> 01:12:55,880
engineering tasks got a lot simpler and

1741
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:58,010
a lot of the fights we had in WebRTC the

1742
01:12:55,880 --> 01:13:00,650
codec one and many of the others were

1743
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:04,580
proxy fights around the simplicity of

1744
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:06,679
inter operation with legacy code and I

1745
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:09,050
strongly urge you if you wants

1746
01:13:06,679 --> 01:13:10,969
beed hold tight to that new

1747
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:14,389
interoperability strategy because the

1748
01:13:10,969 --> 01:13:17,449
minute you let it go the amount of work

1749
01:13:14,389 --> 01:13:19,130
you you have to do goes up by several

1750
01:13:17,449 --> 01:13:21,829
orders of magnitude and the amount of

1751
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,459
time you will spend will stretch until

1752
01:13:21,829 --> 01:13:25,329
when

1753
01:13:22,459 --> 01:13:27,320
maybe our grandkids can see us as

1754
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:28,728
participants in this working group as

1755
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:33,590
opposed to our children who grew up

1756
01:13:28,729 --> 01:13:35,179
during the last one so a chair comment

1757
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:39,139
that fell at fifteen minutes we said we

1758
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:41,030
had is almost done I think what we've

1759
01:13:39,139 --> 01:13:42,499
heard still is we're talking about a

1760
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:47,659
buff we want to find ways to make it

1761
01:13:42,499 --> 01:13:50,030
move fast I see that some that the

1762
01:13:47,659 --> 01:13:52,308
comment about having a buff this week is

1763
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:55,268
probably not realistic but are you

1764
01:13:52,309 --> 01:13:57,860
looking at site meetings this week

1765
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:59,300
now I we tried scheduling inside

1766
01:13:57,860 --> 01:14:01,219
meetings last time it's just too hard to

1767
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,570
resolve the conflicts so not really I

1768
01:14:01,219 --> 01:14:03,979
mean if people have a time that they

1769
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:05,478
think aside me would like to do it and

1770
01:14:03,979 --> 01:14:07,309
like to do it I'm totally open to that

1771
01:14:05,479 --> 01:14:09,400
but it's didn't really work for us last

1772
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,400
time

1773
01:14:09,939 --> 01:14:14,719
Moser Danny um since you presumably

1774
01:14:13,340 --> 01:14:16,219
looking to use web transports and

1775
01:14:14,719 --> 01:14:17,479
they're having a ball later this week

1776
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:19,340
would it make sense to try to have a

1777
01:14:17,479 --> 01:14:21,019
barb off after that because I mean what

1778
01:14:19,340 --> 01:14:22,459
transports doesn't exist for itself it

1779
01:14:21,019 --> 01:14:24,469
exists for applications on top of it

1780
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:26,389
this is a prime application so if that

1781
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:28,070
work moves forward understanding the

1782
01:14:26,389 --> 01:14:29,959
needs of a real application a big

1783
01:14:28,070 --> 01:14:32,209
application you know we could move

1784
01:14:29,959 --> 01:14:33,079
faster to and maybe getting all the

1785
01:14:32,209 --> 01:14:36,289
right things that we need out of what

1786
01:14:33,079 --> 01:14:39,530
transport for our application yeah makes

1787
01:14:36,289 --> 01:14:42,139
sense yeah barb off after after the

1788
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:43,820
Wednesday meeting or something ok though

1789
01:14:42,139 --> 01:14:46,400
I think the resolution we have here is

1790
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:49,459
that the proponents and the area

1791
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,799
directories will discuss how we can the

1792
01:14:49,459 --> 01:14:53,630
celery with the Boff the idea of a

1793
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:54,619
virtual broth with mentioned I don't

1794
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:57,499
know if it's doable but it's worth

1795
01:14:54,619 --> 01:14:59,150
discussing the I noticed you've had a

1796
01:14:57,499 --> 01:15:01,610
virtual interim on February on your

1797
01:14:59,150 --> 01:15:05,659
slide you know maybe that could be a

1798
01:15:01,610 --> 01:15:10,209
virtual bath I don't know we do see a

1799
01:15:05,659 --> 01:15:12,978
lot of interest in working on this and I

1800
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:14,360
guess the next steps is like I said

1801
01:15:12,979 --> 01:15:16,789
proponents talk to ladies and figure out

1802
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,438
how we can move this faster see if we

1803
01:15:16,789 --> 01:15:20,599
can get at least a buff description

1804
01:15:18,439 --> 01:15:22,219
proposal together quickly yeah

1805
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:24,349
and there's other people who think they

1806
01:15:22,219 --> 01:15:26,119
could help craft charter texts on this

1807
01:15:24,349 --> 01:15:29,349
or a Boff proposal I think I'd really

1808
01:15:26,119 --> 01:15:29,348
appreciate them reaching out to me

1809
01:15:29,380 --> 01:15:32,960
Elissa Cooper there are a bunch of

1810
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:35,510
meeting rooms left Thursday Thursday

1811
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,239
morning open slot with nothing that

1812
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:39,889
wouldn't conflict' with okay for this so

1813
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:41,629
if you want to take a look

1814
01:15:39,889 --> 01:15:43,099
can someone come on the 80s help me

1815
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:46,460
schedule one of those Thursday morning

1816
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:52,460
slots then it's a wiki you just sign up

1817
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:56,780
I will send you the link : yeah then we

1818
01:15:52,460 --> 01:16:08,449
have like 20 conflicts so yep okay

1819
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:10,460
thanks thank you so we're now moving

1820
01:16:08,449 --> 01:16:12,710
into the art area part of the meeting I

1821
01:16:10,460 --> 01:16:14,630
see myth mostly the same people so

1822
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:17,929
welcome everyone to the art area part of

1823
01:16:14,630 --> 01:16:20,060
the meeting the first item we have is

1824
01:16:17,929 --> 01:16:22,909
we've got some buffs out there and some

1825
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:26,869
other groups of interest I think we have

1826
01:16:22,909 --> 01:16:42,190
a slide oh you know get used machinery

1827
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:45,049
right why are we going backwards okay so

1828
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:46,610
we do have a first a couple of new

1829
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:47,840
and/or interesting work groups obviously

1830
01:16:46,610 --> 01:16:48,920
all the working groups are interesting

1831
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:52,159
but these are the ones we felt like

1832
01:16:48,920 --> 01:16:53,900
calling out in particular we like to

1833
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:57,348
call out Jenn dispatch and then also

1834
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:59,360
mentioned security dispatch partially

1835
01:16:57,349 --> 01:17:00,710
because we're so proud parents of the

1836
01:16:59,360 --> 01:17:04,159
new all these new dispatch working

1837
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:05,810
groups but also I think everyone's

1838
01:17:04,159 --> 01:17:07,820
interested in generating and there's a

1839
01:17:05,810 --> 01:17:09,349
lot of overlap between things that are

1840
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:12,349
going on in this room and things that go

1841
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:14,090
in security dispatch as far as the

1842
01:17:12,349 --> 01:17:17,060
people that need to think about them so

1843
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:18,920
we would in we would hope as many art

1844
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:23,960
participants as possible can attend

1845
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:25,550
security dispatch and Ted I was actually

1846
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:28,340
Ted Hardy it was actually waiting till

1847
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:29,840
you got to Wednesday 13:30 to discover

1848
01:17:28,340 --> 01:17:32,809
that web transport had been taken over

1849
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:35,340
by the DNS and to suggest that maybe

1850
01:17:32,809 --> 01:17:37,840
when I wanted to stop

1851
01:17:35,340 --> 01:17:39,370
it's gonna be a complicated enough thing

1852
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:41,590
to discuss so that's having two

1853
01:17:39,370 --> 01:17:43,030
applications doing DNS there it has been

1854
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:49,870
a long chair tradition to hide Easter

1855
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:51,880
eggs and slice people find them alright

1856
01:17:49,870 --> 01:17:54,580
so we will highlight the art box and try

1857
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:56,770
and clarify the typos I suppose and give

1858
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:58,480
folks who are participating in these

1859
01:17:56,770 --> 01:18:00,900
basta trips to talk about what's going

1860
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,339
on and maybe guard or some attendance

1861
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:13,509
ABCD would some let you talk about ABCD

1862
01:18:03,340 --> 01:18:15,219
Oh Tuesday so this one's probably Dave

1863
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:18,280
Lawrence this has probably been super

1864
01:18:15,219 --> 01:18:20,409
easy to overlook because like it really

1865
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:22,330
hasn't been too much of a topic of

1866
01:18:20,409 --> 01:18:27,099
discussion around various IETF forums

1867
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:29,050
but a while ago I started oh yeah we

1868
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:30,670
started this whole well we thought about

1869
01:18:29,050 --> 01:18:32,170
having a bar bought but it's pretty

1870
01:18:30,670 --> 01:18:34,540
clear at this point that we'd need like

1871
01:18:32,170 --> 01:18:38,889
the biggest bar ever in every sense of

1872
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:41,290
the word but in this particular case

1873
01:18:38,889 --> 01:18:43,600
when I'm driving at is that you know a

1874
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:45,909
few years ago we started this whole like

1875
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,670
let's work on privacy for protocols at

1876
01:18:45,909 --> 01:18:50,949
the ITF and that led to the DNS privacy

1877
01:18:48,670 --> 01:18:54,310
working group deprive that rolled out

1878
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:57,730
among other specs DNS over TLS draft and

1879
01:18:54,310 --> 01:19:00,190
then two years ago or so we started the

1880
01:18:57,730 --> 01:19:02,290
DNS over HTTPS working group with the

1881
01:19:00,190 --> 01:19:03,940
idea that we could up a pop up working

1882
01:19:02,290 --> 01:19:07,719
group get in get out and we would solve

1883
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:09,849
one problem and be done turned out that

1884
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:13,170
that was just kind of turning the key on

1885
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:17,770
opening a whole lot of other things and

1886
01:19:13,170 --> 01:19:20,980
some of these topics that DNS over HTTPS

1887
01:19:17,770 --> 01:19:23,560
has brought to light are clearly very

1888
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:25,239
thorny issues but there's also pretty

1889
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:27,150
clear to a number of us that there are

1890
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:29,739
some technical issues that we can adjust

1891
01:19:27,150 --> 01:19:34,299
address in a relatively policy neutral

1892
01:19:29,739 --> 01:19:35,860
way and so ABCD is going to be a the

1893
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:38,650
intent is that it is a working group

1894
01:19:35,860 --> 01:19:40,570
forming Boff where we can hope to come

1895
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:42,820
to some agreement on just what types of

1896
01:19:40,570 --> 01:19:44,590
problems we can solve in the idea kind

1897
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:46,540
of based on the understanding that like

1898
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:47,080
refusing to work on these areas doesn't

1899
01:19:46,540 --> 01:19:48,790
mean they don't

1900
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:53,019
worked on but at least if we can do them

1901
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:57,070
in the ITF we can get some sense of

1902
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:58,510
cohesion on the technical direction that

1903
01:19:57,070 --> 01:20:02,620
these things go in and hopefully end up

1904
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:04,150
with better engineered solutions to any

1905
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:08,260
of the abs want to add anything about

1906
01:20:04,150 --> 01:20:09,429
that thing thank you

1907
01:20:08,260 --> 01:20:11,680
we should also talk a little bit about

1908
01:20:09,430 --> 01:20:13,630
the web transport both which has nothing

1909
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:15,490
to do with applications doing dns we

1910
01:20:13,630 --> 01:20:17,080
apologize for the as we talked about

1911
01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:18,340
that does seem to go everywhere so it's

1912
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:21,790
apparently found its home here on the

1913
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:26,710
slide so web trends is on Wednesday at

1914
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:28,360
when 30 has nothing to do with DNS as

1915
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:31,630
far as we know we don't have any intent

1916
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:33,460
to figure it out either and so if I

1917
01:20:31,630 --> 01:20:35,440
could put it in a nutshell what that's

1918
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:37,300
about is I think I think of it as the

1919
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:39,429
next step beyond WebSockets

1920
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:41,080
so we're going to start off by

1921
01:20:39,430 --> 01:20:43,000
introducing some of the work that's been

1922
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,040
done on quick datagrams although that

1923
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,500
really isn't central to what we're doing

1924
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:49,180
just as a little bit of background and

1925
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:51,340
then talk about a couple of proposals

1926
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:53,260
for taking the next step beyond

1927
01:20:51,340 --> 01:20:54,760
WebSockets I think those there's

1928
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:57,820
something called a web transport

1929
01:20:54,760 --> 01:21:01,330
framework there's two proposals on HTTP

1930
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:02,860
two you know and hanison connect and

1931
01:21:01,330 --> 01:21:06,040
then talk also a little bit about use

1932
01:21:02,860 --> 01:21:08,049
cases and I think Colin covered a couple

1933
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:11,250
in there that are some of the things

1934
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:14,200
people are been thinking of doing and

1935
01:21:11,250 --> 01:21:16,930
we've got 90 minutes but time flies when

1936
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:19,630
you've got so much material so David and

1937
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:21,040
I still have to work through how much we

1938
01:21:19,630 --> 01:21:22,390
can do and how much should be allocated

1939
01:21:21,040 --> 01:21:24,340
so we can have a reasonable amount of

1940
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:29,650
discussion in Q&A as well as just

1941
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:32,020
talking to you with slides and David's

1942
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:35,440
gonna see a quick point to add so this

1943
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:38,440
is work in partnership with the w3c that

1944
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:41,110
is so WebSocket is an API available to

1945
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:44,110
the web WC stuff and they're interested

1946
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:47,259
in leveraging new transfer protocols

1947
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:51,250
most notably quick and levered offering

1948
01:21:47,260 --> 01:21:54,010
those rich features to the web so we've

1949
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:56,170
we were there particular at tea back a

1950
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:59,200
few months ago and there was interest

1951
01:21:56,170 --> 01:22:00,640
there so the idea here is let's see what

1952
01:21:59,200 --> 01:22:05,769
we can build in term of IT

1953
01:22:00,640 --> 01:22:08,440
protocols to support that work okay

1954
01:22:05,770 --> 01:22:10,330
and also on Wednesday we have the W pack

1955
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:12,730
Webb packaging Boff which also has

1956
01:22:10,330 --> 01:22:15,610
nothing to do with DNS or not much in

1957
01:22:12,730 --> 01:22:17,469
any event this is the sort of logical

1958
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:19,389
progression of the work that Jeffrey

1959
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:22,240
askin has presented I think in dispatch

1960
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:24,670
in the past involving HTTP and

1961
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:26,500
essentially offline signed exchanges and

1962
01:22:24,670 --> 01:22:28,300
what that means when separated from sort

1963
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:31,480
of a transport context of the security

1964
01:22:28,300 --> 01:22:33,460
and distribution considerations of that

1965
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,750
and so that's what we talking about that

1966
01:22:33,460 --> 01:22:37,300
is a potentially working group

1967
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:39,220
performing Boff Wednesday afternoon

1968
01:22:37,300 --> 01:22:40,360
if Jeffrey's in the room I would give

1969
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:47,320
him a minute to talk about it I don't

1970
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:48,880
think I see him though no okay and then

1971
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:50,469
we have a few moths that are outside of

1972
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,930
the art area but may still be of

1973
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:54,610
interest for people if anyone is in the

1974
01:22:52,930 --> 01:22:55,870
room that isn't a position and would

1975
01:22:54,610 --> 01:22:57,429
like to plug you and they're welcome to

1976
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,870
I'm assuming that's not going to be true

1977
01:22:57,430 --> 01:23:01,750
for mathematical magic that baath is

1978
01:22:58,870 --> 01:23:03,940
going on now but as far as the other

1979
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:06,610
three is anyone here that's a chair or

1980
01:23:03,940 --> 01:23:07,179
is otherwise interested who can not

1981
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:12,040
speak to them

1982
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:13,480
I just enricher transactional

1983
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:15,670
authorization is going to be happening

1984
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:19,509
this afternoon and we're basically going

1985
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:21,220
to be looking at sort of you know future

1986
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:24,550
next-generation protocols of how we do

1987
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:27,190
authorization delegation systems like a

1988
01:23:24,550 --> 01:23:34,950
lot but hopefully less messy at least to

1989
01:23:27,190 --> 01:23:34,950
start any others

1990
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:44,469
then to move into our first discussion

1991
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,469
in the art area which I believe is bran

1992
01:23:54,489 --> 01:24:07,940
alrighty

1993
01:23:55,699 --> 01:24:10,638
this is way too short espera alright so

1994
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:12,619
here's the problem space we have user

1995
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,630
devices that want to get information

1996
01:24:12,619 --> 01:24:16,549
from some service provider on the

1997
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:17,989
internet and want to know when

1998
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:20,409
something's changed that service

1999
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:22,400
provider on the Internet

2000
01:24:20,409 --> 01:24:24,049
generally there's two ways to this you

2001
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:26,570
can keep the connection open which is

2002
01:24:24,050 --> 01:24:28,310
our battery and which depending on the

2003
01:24:26,570 --> 01:24:31,400
protocol there's no really good way

2004
01:24:28,310 --> 01:24:33,380
other than polling or you can push via

2005
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,589
some kind of cloud service that the

2006
01:24:33,380 --> 01:24:38,480
device is connected to all the time

2007
01:24:35,590 --> 01:24:40,190
there's already some stuff that exists I

2008
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:43,190
can remember to put on the slides here

2009
01:24:40,190 --> 01:24:45,589
in this space Apple have their own thing

2010
01:24:43,190 --> 01:24:48,469
except or push which exists in IMAP and

2011
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:49,909
exists in Kelvin card eV and their

2012
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:52,460
devices will connect to a server that

2013
01:24:49,909 --> 01:24:54,739
supports it and it says please push me

2014
01:24:52,460 --> 01:24:56,150
updates through the Apple notification

2015
01:24:54,739 --> 01:24:57,769
service back to the device and it will

2016
01:24:56,150 --> 01:25:01,969
know that something's changed and in

2017
01:24:57,770 --> 01:25:04,699
close to real time it gets updates for

2018
01:25:01,969 --> 01:25:07,340
other first party clients like the Gmail

2019
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:08,690
client with Gmail again they will get

2020
01:25:07,340 --> 01:25:10,489
pushes straightaway through their

2021
01:25:08,690 --> 01:25:13,480
protocol because they control both ends

2022
01:25:10,489 --> 01:25:16,669
and they can put something in between

2023
01:25:13,480 --> 01:25:18,349
back there and it all works nicely for

2024
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:20,389
third party clients they're pretty much

2025
01:25:18,350 --> 01:25:22,610
out of luck they're stuck poling or

2026
01:25:20,389 --> 01:25:25,100
they're stuck implementing every single

2027
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:30,259
service providers custom protocol just

2028
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:32,630
for them so there are a couple of isn't

2029
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:34,760
this great a couple of existing drafts

2030
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:38,060
for this for caldera and cardova there's

2031
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:41,179
been a proposed draft to add push just

2032
01:25:38,060 --> 01:25:44,000
to there and for IMAP there's now

2033
01:25:41,179 --> 01:25:46,719
proposed draft to add a push mechanism

2034
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:49,010
there as well from the dovecot people

2035
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,810
all of these it would be good to have a

2036
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:52,080
standard way of doing it so everyone's

2037
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:54,480
not implementing their own thing

2038
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:56,850
J map has implemented its own thing

2039
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,019
because there was nothing else but it

2040
01:25:56,850 --> 01:25:59,280
would be good to make sure that anything

2041
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:01,350
else that comes along the lines with

2042
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:03,300
that so I guess my question for this

2043
01:26:01,350 --> 01:26:05,280
group is where should this work happen

2044
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:06,960
well first of all should it happen at

2045
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:09,120
the ITF where should it happen at the

2046
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:13,590
ITF and who wants to get involved in it

2047
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:17,120
so : question that Colin Jane's question

2048
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:20,850
about this is I mean is isn't there

2049
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:23,280
Apple and androids push notification

2050
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:25,680
service which every single third party

2051
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:26,730
today love it or hate it uses codes to

2052
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:28,290
those two so they can do push

2053
01:26:26,730 --> 01:26:30,719
notifications right is that day

2054
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:34,140
relatively true is that yes it is okay

2055
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:36,660
roughly there are currently two of those

2056
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:38,070
yeah but what doesn't exist is a

2057
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:39,920
standard way to tell the service

2058
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:42,780
provider to push through those channels

2059
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,090
or more specifically there's there's two

2060
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:47,040
there's Google's way and Apple's way

2061
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:49,080
yeah and there would be nice to have one

2062
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:50,550
way but the average protocol doesn't

2063
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:52,650
have that built in you can't just go to

2064
01:26:50,550 --> 01:26:56,420
a random car dev server and say please

2065
01:26:52,650 --> 01:26:59,670
push me updates to my address book via

2066
01:26:56,420 --> 01:27:02,430
my protocol that I know how to recognize

2067
01:26:59,670 --> 01:27:03,480
through the Google push channel right so

2068
01:27:02,430 --> 01:27:05,760
I mean I think the question I'd be

2069
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:06,870
looking for I mean I love this I argued

2070
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:12,420
for something like this many years ago

2071
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:14,490
but it's it doesn't matter unless both

2072
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:16,230
those two push notifications that are

2073
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,910
everything today are willing to

2074
01:27:16,230 --> 01:27:19,679
implement that API unless they're

2075
01:27:17,910 --> 01:27:21,059
willing to do that I don't like that

2076
01:27:19,680 --> 01:27:22,710
seems to be the you need to put

2077
01:27:21,060 --> 01:27:24,630
something in front of them that talks

2078
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:26,220
your API and then knows about those two

2079
01:27:24,630 --> 01:27:29,220
which is certainly one of the

2080
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:31,920
possibilities or you can just specify

2081
01:27:29,220 --> 01:27:33,480
those two as specific options they don't

2082
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,690
need to care all they're doing is is

2083
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:38,129
transporting some kind of payload to the

2084
01:27:36,690 --> 01:27:40,830
device on your behalf and they'll do

2085
01:27:38,130 --> 01:27:41,790
that for all sorts of things already but

2086
01:27:40,830 --> 01:27:43,290
you need to have a way to tell the

2087
01:27:41,790 --> 01:27:45,450
service provider I want you to push to

2088
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:47,640
Google or when you push to Apple in this

2089
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:51,019
format that my third-party app will

2090
01:27:47,640 --> 01:27:51,020
recognize when it comes through to me

2091
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:56,280
dirty no the third-party app has to be

2092
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:57,180
registered with the Cir cloud service or

2093
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,190
they won't deliver it for security

2094
01:27:57,180 --> 01:28:00,900
reasons right the third-party app can

2095
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,849
just register well it can have its own

2096
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:05,849
device ID whatever it needs to register

2097
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:08,970
to the classification

2098
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:10,500
I don't yeah III guess I think this is

2099
01:28:08,970 --> 01:28:11,670
overly simplifying what you're like the

2100
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:13,110
picture you said of like there's

2101
01:28:11,670 --> 01:28:14,790
somebody like Twilio who provides a

2102
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:16,469
common API that then pushes it to the

2103
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:17,880
Android and Apple back-end I can imagine

2104
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:21,510
that working but I think you need to

2105
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:25,380
describe solutely this is just the rough

2106
01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:28,680
scope I yeah just clarifying the scope

2107
01:28:25,380 --> 01:28:32,220
of this a little bit this is about if

2108
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:34,650
you have a third-party client that's

2109
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:37,740
going to talk to mail contacts calendar

2110
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:42,089
or whatever server which is not owned by

2111
01:28:37,740 --> 01:28:43,679
the same company you want it needs some

2112
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:45,390
way of saying hey I have this push

2113
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:47,310
channel that I can receive stuff from

2114
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:49,410
and so that app registers yes a

2115
01:28:47,310 --> 01:28:51,330
certificate with Apple or Google so it

2116
01:28:49,410 --> 01:28:53,250
can receive pushes but it needs to have

2117
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:56,670
some way of tones giving the service

2118
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:58,980
provider to push information in a way

2119
01:28:56,670 --> 01:29:02,790
that's gonna end up routing back to that

2120
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:05,580
fight and that might so we have our C 80

2121
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:07,800
30 which is kind of how all this can all

2122
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:10,290
work together you know standardized way

2123
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:13,890
but what we need is a standardized way

2124
01:29:10,290 --> 01:29:16,740
for the client to set up that whole

2125
01:29:13,890 --> 01:29:19,560
channel with the service provider but

2126
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:26,130
that's my attempt clarifying that which

2127
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:28,290
may not be that clear but staff gentle

2128
01:29:26,130 --> 01:29:29,850
sorry I Neal you might have just

2129
01:29:28,290 --> 01:29:31,140
answered my question but I'm trying to

2130
01:29:29,850 --> 01:29:33,410
be clear on whether as a point of

2131
01:29:31,140 --> 01:29:35,850
clarification is this third-party

2132
01:29:33,410 --> 01:29:37,740
applications so the Twilio app on my

2133
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:37,950
phone or is this specifically for things

2134
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:40,410
like

2135
01:29:37,950 --> 01:29:42,210
calendaring an email where I don't

2136
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:43,590
necessarily install an app for my

2137
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,870
particular service provider on my phone

2138
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:47,850
but we want to be able to connect to a

2139
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:49,349
calendaring service and then I want the

2140
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:52,170
specific app on my phone which is not

2141
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:54,450
connected to that service to be able to

2142
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:56,730
register for yes the idea is that you

2143
01:29:54,450 --> 01:29:58,500
install cool calendars on your phone and

2144
01:29:56,730 --> 01:30:01,379
cool calendars connect to your CalDAV

2145
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,840
server and says hi I'm an app that's on

2146
01:30:01,380 --> 01:30:05,900
a Android phone so please push to the

2147
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,940
Google notification service with my apps

2148
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:10,469
registered ID against Google to tell me

2149
01:30:08,940 --> 01:30:16,919
when there are changes to my account on

2150
01:30:10,470 --> 01:30:18,960
your service great thank you okay Sean

2151
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:21,510
Leonard I think that this

2152
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:23,880
good work to pursue or you know with an

2153
01:30:21,510 --> 01:30:27,090
ITF and you ask the question of where so

2154
01:30:23,880 --> 01:30:29,130
why not have it done in extra I guess is

2155
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:34,429
there a more appropriate place than that

2156
01:30:29,130 --> 01:30:34,429
it seems like extras pretty good cool I

2157
01:30:35,659 --> 01:30:41,610
mean I'm happy to take it an extra

2158
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:44,340
extras finishing up the the current work

2159
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:46,259
that it has pretty soon you know I was

2160
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:48,360
the moment that charter is very I'm up

2161
01:30:46,260 --> 01:30:51,929
specific so this is going slightly

2162
01:30:48,360 --> 01:31:00,808
beyond that I mean it's sort of related

2163
01:30:51,929 --> 01:31:02,400
but it's bigger scope yeah this is Barry

2164
01:31:00,809 --> 01:31:05,940
but I think extra will have the right

2165
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:08,280
people in the room for it so reach are

2166
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:11,250
during extra to cover it might be a

2167
01:31:08,280 --> 01:31:18,030
better idea than doing another working

2168
01:31:11,250 --> 01:31:19,469
group what do you think I refuse to make

2169
01:31:18,030 --> 01:31:23,130
the solution that this both yeah

2170
01:31:19,469 --> 01:31:25,170
probably and you think about that yeah

2171
01:31:23,130 --> 01:31:27,210
obviously I put a slide here with some

2172
01:31:25,170 --> 01:31:29,789
of the considerations that it will need

2173
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:31,469
to come up but there's plenty more there

2174
01:31:29,789 --> 01:31:32,670
so Adam Roach not really talking about

2175
01:31:31,469 --> 01:31:34,590
where this practice but just to make

2176
01:31:32,670 --> 01:31:37,500
certain is on your radar have you looked

2177
01:31:34,590 --> 01:31:39,780
at RFC $85.99 which does this same sort

2178
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:41,610
of thing but for sip endpoints no I have

2179
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:47,699
not okay we're looking at that and

2180
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:51,690
anybody know you can borrow yeah cool so

2181
01:31:47,699 --> 01:31:53,909
Matthew Miller one so again we're we're

2182
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:55,320
exactly this happens I I don't know what

2183
01:31:53,909 --> 01:31:57,058
one thing to consider though is that

2184
01:31:55,320 --> 01:31:59,460
often with these at least my experience

2185
01:31:57,059 --> 01:32:02,099
with both both push services have been

2186
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:03,510
the major push services have been there

2187
01:32:02,099 --> 01:32:06,119
needs to be an existing relationship not

2188
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:08,760
just between the application and the

2189
01:32:06,119 --> 01:32:10,889
device it's on but the service that's

2190
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:12,599
providing it and that push service like

2191
01:32:10,889 --> 01:32:15,360
there there's there's a lot going on

2192
01:32:12,599 --> 01:32:17,369
here yeah that that that really needs to

2193
01:32:15,360 --> 01:32:19,579
be part of this consideration I know

2194
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:21,630
that's going to vastly complicate this

2195
01:32:19,579 --> 01:32:23,610
but there's not much of a point of

2196
01:32:21,630 --> 01:32:25,530
continuing unless there is that shared

2197
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:27,989
some way of standardizing that shared

2198
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:30,929
relationship if at all yeah I mean there

2199
01:32:27,989 --> 01:32:31,919
certainly needs to be some way to deal

2200
01:32:30,929 --> 01:32:33,239
with the abuse can

2201
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,540
generations which is why everyone

2202
01:32:33,239 --> 01:32:37,949
requires the registration but we want to

2203
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:40,170
wind up in a situation where you can

2204
01:32:37,949 --> 01:32:41,910
take arbitrary third-party client a

2205
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:44,370
against arbitrary server B and they

2206
01:32:41,910 --> 01:32:46,019
don't have to have a pre-existing into

2207
01:32:44,370 --> 01:32:51,690
EM relationship in order to have any

2208
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:53,670
push at all sure like like I mean a lot

2209
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:57,989
of what I've seen has been the concern

2210
01:32:53,670 --> 01:33:00,270
about you know about spam not just from

2211
01:32:57,989 --> 01:33:02,610
a client receiving too much butter but a

2212
01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:03,540
service receiving too many bogus

2213
01:33:02,610 --> 01:33:06,480
requests yeah

2214
01:33:03,540 --> 01:33:08,820
and that's that's where like cool the

2215
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:12,780
cool app or my calendaring service would

2216
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:14,940
have to have a relationship with Google

2217
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:17,550
and Apple in order to push yeah things I

2218
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:19,799
expect on this picture here that you're

2219
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:22,320
cool client would have a cool calendar

2220
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:24,540
that client would have the user device

2221
01:33:22,320 --> 01:33:25,980
registration against a cloud service so

2222
01:33:24,540 --> 01:33:27,120
it'd be registered with if it's an

2223
01:33:25,980 --> 01:33:30,269
Android app would be registered with

2224
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:33,030
Google and it would have its application

2225
01:33:30,270 --> 01:33:34,530
ID and each instance of it would have a

2226
01:33:33,030 --> 01:33:37,199
user ID that was registered with Google

2227
01:33:34,530 --> 01:33:39,540
that said pushes for my device use this

2228
01:33:37,199 --> 01:33:41,460
key to here then there needs to be some

2229
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:43,860
way to register with arbitrary CalDAV

2230
01:33:41,460 --> 01:33:48,690
server Albert Ricardo server sorry here

2231
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:50,130
is how you push via Google to me here's

2232
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:51,989
the channel that you get updates to me

2233
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:54,210
and here's the updates that I want and

2234
01:33:51,989 --> 01:33:57,449
then the server can push those updates

2235
01:33:54,210 --> 01:34:00,360
down that channel somehow that's the bit

2236
01:33:57,449 --> 01:34:03,690
that needs to be standardized sure I

2237
01:34:00,360 --> 01:34:05,820
Mike my concern is I guess reiterating

2238
01:34:03,690 --> 01:34:07,199
one earlier I mean are we going to be

2239
01:34:05,820 --> 01:34:11,699
able to do that with these providers

2240
01:34:07,199 --> 01:34:15,059
yeah Chris when I was gonna make a

2241
01:34:11,699 --> 01:34:16,790
similar comment I I think I'm more

2242
01:34:15,060 --> 01:34:19,679
familiar with Apple than Google's

2243
01:34:16,790 --> 01:34:21,269
notification service but I think they've

2244
01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:24,960
made that extremely restrictive now

2245
01:34:21,270 --> 01:34:28,050
where you know you can't even share

2246
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:30,179
because we operate a a service on my

2247
01:34:28,050 --> 01:34:33,480
team that does some of these similar

2248
01:34:30,179 --> 01:34:34,980
things and you know we've had to go

2249
01:34:33,480 --> 01:34:36,599
around hoops even just to pass

2250
01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:38,989
notifications from different

2251
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:43,080
applications through the same channel so

2252
01:34:38,989 --> 01:34:43,759
yeah I if if you were already I think

2253
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:46,580
this is more

2254
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:48,980
Terms of Service issue than a protocol a

2255
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:50,540
certain if you draw a four party version

2256
01:34:48,980 --> 01:34:52,549
of this way you have two things in the

2257
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:55,250
cloud one of which is cool calendar

2258
01:34:52,550 --> 01:34:57,020
services endpoint that you push to that

2259
01:34:55,250 --> 01:34:59,450
their device is registered against and

2260
01:34:57,020 --> 01:35:01,670
then it has its via Apple or via google

2261
01:34:59,450 --> 01:35:05,300
channel kind of embedded between its

2262
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:07,100
cloud endpoint and its device and so you

2263
01:35:05,300 --> 01:35:09,080
tell the CalDAV server to push to cool

2264
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:11,570
calendar services cloud endpoint that

2265
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:12,920
then whatever path that follows gets

2266
01:35:11,570 --> 01:35:14,750
through to the device to tell the device

2267
01:35:12,920 --> 01:35:17,150
here's the change but I think the

2268
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:20,630
security of everybody and the chain has

2269
01:35:17,150 --> 01:35:22,820
to be owned but and you know yeah by a

2270
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:27,680
single set of certificates and things

2271
01:35:22,820 --> 01:35:30,679
like that this is Neil Jenkins again

2272
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:33,920
yeah the the way you make this work for

2273
01:35:30,680 --> 01:35:36,380
now is that the app on the phone or

2274
01:35:33,920 --> 01:35:37,790
wherever has to also have its own server

2275
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:39,860
component and that's what the service

2276
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:42,050
provider actually talks to and then that

2277
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:43,820
server component obviously is registered

2278
01:35:42,050 --> 01:35:45,260
same way as the client is with the push

2279
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:46,880
service it wants to use and has all this

2280
01:35:45,260 --> 01:35:50,360
difficut since to actually get the push

2281
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,880
to the user's device potentially in the

2282
01:35:50,360 --> 01:35:55,429
future Apple or Google may support RFC

2283
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,770
80 30 on its own so you don't need

2284
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:59,989
something in between but in the meantime

2285
01:35:57,770 --> 01:36:01,640
that that's how you would make it work

2286
01:35:59,989 --> 01:36:04,610
that's that's it's still a useful thing

2287
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:06,830
of yes the of the having stand way for

2288
01:36:04,610 --> 01:36:08,750
the device to register that it wants to

2289
01:36:06,830 --> 01:36:10,489
receive these on its audit server from

2290
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:15,050
from the service provider that actually

2291
01:36:10,489 --> 01:36:23,030
has the data so registering a web hook

2292
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:25,400
type of thing alright so I guess next

2293
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:28,370
step Alexi is to talk to you once you've

2294
01:36:25,400 --> 01:36:31,700
had a chance to to think about whether

2295
01:36:28,370 --> 01:36:35,269
extras the right home for this area of

2296
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:37,820
work or to bring it for a ball or

2297
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:39,590
something else later though this is this

2298
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:42,349
is not actually my work it's work that I

2299
01:36:39,590 --> 01:36:43,640
see out there in the world happening in

2300
01:36:42,350 --> 01:36:47,420
a couple of different places that I

2301
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:50,150
think should be coming to the ITF this

2302
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:52,340
has been Campbell from the chair as far

2303
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:53,719
as these work from other places that

2304
01:36:52,340 --> 01:36:55,310
need to come to that ETF do you think

2305
01:36:53,719 --> 01:36:56,719
these people or people that would

2306
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:58,390
participate in the process and the idea

2307
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:03,230
yes

2308
01:36:58,390 --> 01:37:04,340
and then I'll go further to say the

2309
01:37:03,230 --> 01:37:05,629
conversations get a little bit

2310
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:08,510
dispatcher here but that's I don't think

2311
01:37:05,630 --> 01:37:09,800
that's a problem but I think one of the

2312
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,030
big things to find here since there are

2313
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:14,030
several different pieces that work going

2314
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:16,040
on is you know who's interested in and

2315
01:37:14,030 --> 01:37:18,219
paying and working on this sort of thing

2316
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:21,670
and how can these work efforts be

2317
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:24,980
combined or at least coordinated and

2318
01:37:21,670 --> 01:37:26,540
that's be a good discussion to have what

2319
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:29,389
are your next steps on that discussion

2320
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:31,070
not counting just we're actually talking

2321
01:37:29,390 --> 01:37:32,770
about where it would stay or are you

2322
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:36,290
thinking about other site meetings or

2323
01:37:32,770 --> 01:37:38,780
yeah that's the authors of those two

2324
01:37:36,290 --> 01:37:40,880
that we already have obviously look at

2325
01:37:38,780 --> 01:37:42,679
$85.99 which I wasn't aware of and say

2326
01:37:40,880 --> 01:37:47,120
whether this work from that that we

2327
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:48,620
should be taking all right so just as a

2328
01:37:47,120 --> 01:37:50,780
rough idea in the room who would be

2329
01:37:48,620 --> 01:37:54,099
interested in working on this if we

2330
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:54,099
brought it to the ITF somewhere

2331
01:37:54,250 --> 01:38:06,320
Neal put your hand up to cope so keep

2332
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:07,460
that in mind you may need to do some

2333
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:08,690
outreach before we can do anything

2334
01:38:07,460 --> 01:38:16,220
really useful yeah

2335
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:18,580
all right thank you request signing

2336
01:38:16,220 --> 01:38:18,580
Justin

2337
01:38:30,260 --> 01:38:34,920
all right so most of this conversation

2338
01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:37,920
is going to be happening at sec dispatch

2339
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:40,560
tomorrow afternoon but because the whole

2340
01:38:37,920 --> 01:38:44,160
idea of signing an HTTP request message

2341
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:47,130
is very much right at that border of the

2342
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:49,800
sec area and the art area I wanted to

2343
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:52,860
get people in this room's attention so

2344
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:55,020
the TLDR version is that people want to

2345
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:58,170
sign HTTP request messages whether or

2346
01:38:55,020 --> 01:38:59,520
not you agree with that as a goal people

2347
01:38:58,170 --> 01:39:01,440
are doing it for lots of different

2348
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:03,780
reasons a lot of these reasons conflict

2349
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:05,339
with each other and so at and you know

2350
01:39:03,780 --> 01:39:08,160
it's very hard TLS doesn't solve

2351
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:09,900
everything nobody's ever heard of s HTTP

2352
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:12,900
I bring that up because somebody

2353
01:39:09,900 --> 01:39:15,420
actually brought that up on the list

2354
01:39:12,900 --> 01:39:16,889
Jose doesn't solve everything but the

2355
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:19,020
important thing here for this group is

2356
01:39:16,890 --> 01:39:23,430
that people are actually doing this out

2357
01:39:19,020 --> 01:39:26,310
in the wild there are at least five

2358
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:29,550
major versions of this I invented at

2359
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:31,910
least two of these myself and I've

2360
01:39:29,550 --> 01:39:35,310
implemented almost all of these as well

2361
01:39:31,910 --> 01:39:38,010
and they all solve different bits and

2362
01:39:35,310 --> 01:39:39,960
pieces of the problem the thing is even

2363
01:39:38,010 --> 01:39:41,520
as an as an implementer and as a draft

2364
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:43,410
editor I don't know if there is a

2365
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:45,180
universal solution or if there should be

2366
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:47,220
a universal solution but the fact that

2367
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:49,680
people are building these things and

2368
01:39:47,220 --> 01:39:53,760
using them today for lots of different

2369
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:56,430
but related use cases is telling me that

2370
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:58,560
it's really starting to get to the time

2371
01:39:56,430 --> 01:40:00,870
where we need to look at this as as a

2372
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,700
holistic solution space and figure out

2373
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,559
where these things are going so gonna be

2374
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:07,230
talking more about that at sec dispatch

2375
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,960
hopefully this stuff can actually find a

2376
01:40:07,230 --> 01:40:11,730
home whether that's a new working group

2377
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:15,270
in psychie area or in here I don't know

2378
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:18,360
whether it finds a an existing working

2379
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:20,850
group you know HTTP off probably would

2380
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:25,610
have been a good place for this at one

2381
01:40:20,850 --> 01:40:28,980
point in the past but oh that chart yeah

2382
01:40:25,610 --> 01:40:31,740
so the basically I don't know where this

2383
01:40:28,980 --> 01:40:33,450
needs to land but I'm getting a stronger

2384
01:40:31,740 --> 01:40:35,519
installer stronger feeling that this

2385
01:40:33,450 --> 01:40:39,860
does need to land somewhere at some

2386
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:42,269
point hopefully in the near future so

2387
01:40:39,860 --> 01:40:44,670
any thoughts or questions

2388
01:40:42,269 --> 01:40:46,519
and like I said we're gonna have we're

2389
01:40:44,670 --> 01:40:48,749
gonna have a chance to get into deeper

2390
01:40:46,519 --> 01:40:50,849
discussion on this during SEC dispatch

2391
01:40:48,749 --> 01:40:52,880
but I do want to respect people's time

2392
01:40:50,849 --> 01:40:56,999
here and let you guys know this exists

2393
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:58,530
yes how does this replace relate to the

2394
01:40:56,999 --> 01:41:04,349
webpack stuff I mean I get there all

2395
01:40:58,530 --> 01:41:05,849
right yes thank you so uh okay somebody

2396
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:07,829
wants to answer that for me that'd be

2397
01:41:05,849 --> 01:41:10,320
awesome

2398
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:13,530
it's a dirty they are completely and

2399
01:41:10,320 --> 01:41:15,090
utterly distinct yes and so the there

2400
01:41:13,530 --> 01:41:16,800
was a discussion at some point earlier

2401
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:20,039
on the W PAC list about whether they

2402
01:41:16,800 --> 01:41:22,380
ought to be yoked together and the the

2403
01:41:20,039 --> 01:41:25,099
rending of teeth and gnashing of clothes

2404
01:41:22,380 --> 01:41:28,440
or strike that reverse it was quite high

2405
01:41:25,099 --> 01:41:31,670
this is already difficult enough and the

2406
01:41:28,440 --> 01:41:36,659
set of systems you might want or

2407
01:41:31,670 --> 01:41:38,670
responses and for requests are

2408
01:41:36,659 --> 01:41:40,710
sufficiently distinct that shoving them

2409
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:43,860
all into one thing is too much and that

2410
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:48,749
seems to be the upshot so far right yeah

2411
01:41:43,860 --> 01:41:51,329
and I also want to I want to add to the

2412
01:41:48,749 --> 01:41:53,519
fact that this there is there are a

2413
01:41:51,329 --> 01:41:55,349
couple places where they should at least

2414
01:41:53,519 --> 01:41:57,599
talk to each other and that's that we've

2415
01:41:55,349 --> 01:42:00,389
got two different drafts that define the

2416
01:41:57,599 --> 01:42:01,920
HTTP signature header one on request one

2417
01:42:00,389 --> 01:42:06,119
on response and they're completely

2418
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:06,539
different from each other that's a bad

2419
01:42:06,119 --> 01:42:10,679
thing

2420
01:42:06,539 --> 01:42:12,329
by the way Mike Jones Microsoft maybe I

2421
01:42:10,679 --> 01:42:17,400
wasn't listening well or maybe you were

2422
01:42:12,329 --> 01:42:20,999
talking too fast or maybe both you said

2423
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:24,719
this needs to land somewhere you have a

2424
01:42:20,999 --> 01:42:27,480
set of misses which are five right what

2425
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:33,539
is the this that you want to land and

2426
01:42:27,480 --> 01:42:35,730
why I'm not sure yet so so I think maybe

2427
01:42:33,539 --> 01:42:40,349
there's a grand unified HTTP signing

2428
01:42:35,730 --> 01:42:43,468
thing that needs to exist I don't know

2429
01:42:40,349 --> 01:42:45,449
so cabbage signature draft is probably

2430
01:42:43,469 --> 01:42:47,340
the most implemented one out there but

2431
01:42:45,449 --> 01:42:51,058
that also has some pretty severe

2432
01:42:47,340 --> 01:42:53,039
limitations into in what it can express

2433
01:42:51,059 --> 01:42:55,409
and what it can do so whether we start

2434
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:56,070
there and build on the stuff that depop

2435
01:42:55,409 --> 01:43:00,660
add

2436
01:42:56,070 --> 01:43:03,750
I I don't actually know so that's that's

2437
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:05,880
the reason that this is at dispatch and

2438
01:43:03,750 --> 01:43:09,090
at sec dispatch because right now

2439
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:11,670
there's more questions than reasonable

2440
01:43:09,090 --> 01:43:12,150
directions and i I hope we can move past

2441
01:43:11,670 --> 01:43:15,990
that

2442
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:18,150
let me second your point in general that

2443
01:43:15,990 --> 01:43:20,880
these groups need to talk to each other

2444
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:23,639
mm-hmm including 200 us I know that the

2445
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:27,240
cabbage draft the last time I looked at

2446
01:43:23,640 --> 01:43:29,850
it used the authorization header which

2447
01:43:27,240 --> 01:43:32,639
wants to use making them mutually

2448
01:43:29,850 --> 01:43:34,760
incompatible yes so it turns out that at

2449
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:37,110
least recent versions of the draft use

2450
01:43:34,760 --> 01:43:38,250
you've got more choices than you know

2451
01:43:37,110 --> 01:43:40,019
what to do with you can use the auth

2452
01:43:38,250 --> 01:43:43,380
header you can use the signature header

2453
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:46,620
which they invented and also conflicts

2454
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:49,250
with the Gaskin response draft so yeah

2455
01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:52,620
it's it's a mess

2456
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:54,120
mark Nottingham so just to give some

2457
01:43:52,620 --> 01:43:57,960
flavor and other discussions motor

2458
01:43:54,120 --> 01:43:59,880
insect dispatch we've had this on kind

2459
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:01,710
of the radar in the HTV working group

2460
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:03,900
for at least a couple of years we have

2461
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:05,610
draft cabbage on our list of documents

2462
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:07,559
to watch okay and I think we haven't

2463
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:09,389
moved on it yet because of the issues

2464
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:11,940
you you've raised of there's a lot out

2465
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:14,520
there it's not really clear what the

2466
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:17,250
right solution is here my heart are

2467
01:44:14,520 --> 01:44:19,020
hired or bit concerns with moving

2468
01:44:17,250 --> 01:44:21,030
forward were you know webpack is out

2469
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:22,410
there I had a chat with Jeffrey and he

2470
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:23,790
confirmed that well that was kind of on

2471
01:44:22,410 --> 01:44:27,180
their radar earlier it's definitely off

2472
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:28,680
the radar now which is good and they're

2473
01:44:27,180 --> 01:44:30,930
even looking at do they need to have a

2474
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:33,780
header at all which kind of solves the

2475
01:44:30,930 --> 01:44:34,860
header name it was always kind of

2476
01:44:33,780 --> 01:44:38,009
lurking out there because that could be

2477
01:44:34,860 --> 01:44:40,019
unpleasant 2d conflict and and so I'd

2478
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:42,290
encourage you to and I'm sure we'll talk

2479
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:45,810
about this more what day is it

2480
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:47,730
it is Monday now SEC dispatches tomorrow

2481
01:44:45,810 --> 01:44:51,150
afternoon Tuesday I'm sure we'll talk

2482
01:44:47,730 --> 01:44:52,349
about it then you know at the least we

2483
01:44:51,150 --> 01:44:53,730
need to involve the HD implementer

2484
01:44:52,350 --> 01:44:55,320
community in this absolutely

2485
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:57,000
I've always personally considered this

2486
01:44:55,320 --> 01:44:58,559
to be in scope for HTP working group so

2487
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:01,050
consider that one of the places you

2488
01:44:58,560 --> 01:45:03,360
might want to yeah I mean I think that

2489
01:45:01,050 --> 01:45:05,250
that would be a very fine place for this

2490
01:45:03,360 --> 01:45:07,159
to end up I personally I don't care

2491
01:45:05,250 --> 01:45:09,590
where it lands

2492
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:11,839
but yeah III think now is the time for

2493
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:13,550
it to land and that's really I think

2494
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:14,870
that's the interesting information here

2495
01:45:13,550 --> 01:45:16,699
is is that we've been putting it off for

2496
01:45:14,870 --> 01:45:17,960
so long because getting engagement with

2497
01:45:16,699 --> 01:45:20,540
the disparate communities has been hard

2498
01:45:17,960 --> 01:45:22,310
and there's been a lot of churn yeah and

2499
01:45:20,540 --> 01:45:23,810
and if we can get some consolidation

2500
01:45:22,310 --> 01:45:25,250
where we can okay let's go in this

2501
01:45:23,810 --> 01:45:27,560
direction and solve this percentage of

2502
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:30,170
the use cases it's it's maybe it's worth

2503
01:45:27,560 --> 01:45:32,570
trying so absolutely and for for context

2504
01:45:30,170 --> 01:45:35,870
the cabbage draft that several us have

2505
01:45:32,570 --> 01:45:38,509
referenced goes back to 2013 it's it's

2506
01:45:35,870 --> 01:45:41,269
and it's been an ID without a working

2507
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:44,630
group without any real engagement in the

2508
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:52,340
ITF since that time so great thanks

2509
01:45:44,630 --> 01:45:54,560
thank you well and we recently have gone

2510
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:57,170
through exactly this kind of exercise

2511
01:45:54,560 --> 01:46:00,290
not for you to be but for co-ed yes I'm

2512
01:45:57,170 --> 01:46:03,739
familiar with the Oscar work and so

2513
01:46:00,290 --> 01:46:06,190
co-op has some art some aspects to it

2514
01:46:03,739 --> 01:46:10,190
that make it a much easier and solvable

2515
01:46:06,190 --> 01:46:12,799
solutions ways that HP does not share I

2516
01:46:10,190 --> 01:46:15,469
just want to mention that the the art

2517
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:18,500
part of the problem really was

2518
01:46:15,469 --> 01:46:19,280
understanding well what is a request in

2519
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:21,770
the first place

2520
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:24,040
mmm-hmm so how much context do you

2521
01:46:21,770 --> 01:46:26,330
actually have together before you can

2522
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:28,159
design that before you okay not Santa

2523
01:46:26,330 --> 01:46:31,730
Kate it what is the freshness concept

2524
01:46:28,159 --> 01:46:34,580
you're using lots of things going on

2525
01:46:31,730 --> 01:46:37,129
that really application related to the

2526
01:46:34,580 --> 01:46:39,530
protocol that you're trying to support

2527
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:41,929
right and some of these drafts address

2528
01:46:39,530 --> 01:46:44,420
that by having that be a specific

2529
01:46:41,929 --> 01:46:45,800
extension point but not all of them do

2530
01:46:44,420 --> 01:46:47,179
and that's one of the things that I

2531
01:46:45,800 --> 01:46:51,230
think needs to kind of come together

2532
01:46:47,179 --> 01:46:53,210
because some groups like Cavett rafts

2533
01:46:51,230 --> 01:46:55,459
for example basically say like you're

2534
01:46:53,210 --> 01:46:59,690
doing this all the time

2535
01:46:55,460 --> 01:47:03,230
and others don't so yeah John John

2536
01:46:59,690 --> 01:47:05,809
Bradley yubico I'm perhaps to blame for

2537
01:47:03,230 --> 01:47:11,049
one of the the options or partially to

2538
01:47:05,810 --> 01:47:16,370
blame for it the observation is that

2539
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:19,610
signing is easy HTTP is hard yeah

2540
01:47:16,370 --> 01:47:20,749
so my inclination is to actually you

2541
01:47:19,610 --> 01:47:24,289
know and we keep

2542
01:47:20,749 --> 01:47:26,389
you know basically for Deepak we stole

2543
01:47:24,289 --> 01:47:29,960
part of your draft and simplified it

2544
01:47:26,389 --> 01:47:31,849
down to remove all of the things that

2545
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:33,710
were sort of intractable problems with

2546
01:47:31,849 --> 01:47:37,630
HTTP yeah all the stuff immediately

2547
01:47:33,710 --> 01:47:40,909
useful yeah yeah and I know I noticed

2548
01:47:37,630 --> 01:47:42,769
but again it's not useful if people

2549
01:47:40,909 --> 01:47:45,829
can't do it so that's that's the problem

2550
01:47:42,769 --> 01:47:48,309
sort of no I know yeah something that we

2551
01:47:45,829 --> 01:47:51,139
wind up in is do you add enough features

2552
01:47:48,309 --> 01:47:53,389
so that it's useful for the use case but

2553
01:47:51,139 --> 01:47:55,760
not deployable or do you restrict it to

2554
01:47:53,389 --> 01:47:57,590
be deployable but not necessarily useful

2555
01:47:55,760 --> 01:48:00,019
I think we need to work with the HTTP

2556
01:47:57,590 --> 01:48:01,519
working group would be my point like if

2557
01:48:00,019 --> 01:48:04,550
we're gonna actually make real progress

2558
01:48:01,519 --> 01:48:06,619
that's probably the right place to do

2559
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:08,659
this because the crypto part is the easy

2560
01:48:06,619 --> 01:48:11,380
part right now you know the how to

2561
01:48:08,659 --> 01:48:13,670
manage the HTTP yeah and perhaps and

2562
01:48:11,380 --> 01:48:16,610
deprecating HTTP and doing something

2563
01:48:13,670 --> 01:48:19,550
sensible might also be a way to approach

2564
01:48:16,610 --> 01:48:22,728
the problem I want to take that last bit

2565
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:25,429
probably off the table for right now and

2566
01:48:22,729 --> 01:48:28,999
just to be cognizant of time constraints

2567
01:48:25,429 --> 01:48:29,960
and stuff like that for a bit of context

2568
01:48:28,999 --> 01:48:33,769
that I breezed through we are

2569
01:48:29,960 --> 01:48:35,630
specifically looking at detached style

2570
01:48:33,769 --> 01:48:38,179
signature systems here and not

2571
01:48:35,630 --> 01:48:40,760
encapsulated signature systems here so

2572
01:48:38,179 --> 01:48:42,829
we actually want to use HTTP as HTTP

2573
01:48:40,760 --> 01:48:45,050
without copying all the stuff into some

2574
01:48:42,829 --> 01:48:46,518
sub object and without hiding all of

2575
01:48:45,050 --> 01:48:52,190
that stuff in other words we don't want

2576
01:48:46,519 --> 01:48:54,559
soap with squiggly braces so that's that

2577
01:48:52,190 --> 01:48:57,710
please come to sec dispatch I'm sure

2578
01:48:54,559 --> 01:48:59,510
it's gonna be a rockin good time so we

2579
01:48:57,710 --> 01:49:01,449
encourage everyone who commented here go

2580
01:48:59,510 --> 01:49:04,249
make the same comment affect dispatch I

2581
01:49:01,449 --> 01:49:06,949
think though if the minutes capture at

2582
01:49:04,249 --> 01:49:08,989
least this discussion suggested that the

2583
01:49:06,949 --> 01:49:11,259
art related issues is this maybe that's

2584
01:49:08,989 --> 01:49:14,329
some of the harder ones and that HTTP

2585
01:49:11,260 --> 01:49:16,190
this might be a good place that we

2586
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:17,239
worked on but this is all subject to

2587
01:49:16,190 --> 01:49:25,370
further discussion it's gonna happen

2588
01:49:17,239 --> 01:49:28,040
inside dispatch so

2589
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:30,290
everything that we have on the schedule

2590
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:33,970
we're now to the any other business

2591
01:49:30,290 --> 01:49:40,730
section so do we have any other business

2592
01:49:33,970 --> 01:49:43,040
going once going twice there will be a I

2593
01:49:40,730 --> 01:49:47,950
will have a rip side meeting Thursday at

2594
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:52,280
8:30 in the Sofia room Wow look at that

2595
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:53,990
which is this room rip was the name of

2596
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:57,370
the draft that I was presenting earlier

2597
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:59,510
I don't know what it stands for

2598
01:49:57,370 --> 01:50:00,710
look at that dispatch work we have

2599
01:49:59,510 --> 01:50:03,350
dispatched to a site meeting that's

2600
01:50:00,710 --> 01:50:04,670
already been scheduled I want to thank

2601
01:50:03,350 --> 01:50:07,340
everyone for their consideration today

2602
01:50:04,670 --> 01:50:10,220
and also remind you that just by just

2603
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:12,380
not just an IETF week phenomenon so if

2604
01:50:10,220 --> 01:50:13,640
we read the mailing list and participate

2605
01:50:12,380 --> 01:50:15,770
on the mailing list and bring your work

2606
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:17,360
there it's even plausible to dispatch

2607
01:50:15,770 --> 01:50:20,420
things between meetings which i think is

2608
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:22,790
a really exciting possibility so keep

2609
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:26,750
that in mind is anything else not only

2610
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:29,350
possible it is encouraged and with that

2611
01:50:26,750 --> 01:50:29,350
I believe we're adjourned

2612
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:39,549
