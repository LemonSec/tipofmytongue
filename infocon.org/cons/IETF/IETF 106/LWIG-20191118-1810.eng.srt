we all kind of know because I was like I

3
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:09,429
think it's times of rich dark it's

4
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,430
already one fast

5
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,009
good evening welcome to hell week I am

6
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:30,770
pretty sure you are all here for Elvis

7
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:32,510
so this is Morten then I'm sure you have

8
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,940
seen the note well since the morning but

9
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,380
since it's still Monday if you want to

10
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:50,539
have a look at it if you have any

11
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:55,220
questions please come to the mic I'm

12
00:01:50,540 --> 00:02:13,520
breaking help us for a mini Staker and

13
00:01:55,220 --> 00:02:33,940
Java Master P so Wes Roku can you count

14
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:33,940
on rock ooh oh he's back what is here

15

[Music]

16
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,190
yet here's some update since last IDF or

17
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,340
oh we didn't have meeting last time and

18
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:50,690
we have walking blast Corps for the TCP

19
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:53,390
draft and which has been updated plans

20
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,000
and we are going to report the walking

21
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:59,420
rubric last score update of this

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,280
document today and the other Trotter is

23
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:06,530
related to crypto and the status of the

24
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:09,049
drafts there we curve representations

25
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:13,070
are in the ad evaluation but we have

26
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:16,280
some discussion with the CFR G research

27
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:19,940
group chair and I think the current

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,030
consensus that st i think is still be it

29
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,150
can be processed to you and but I think

30
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:28,340
it's a kosher perd with the to working

31
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,880
group and we are sent the IETF last core

32
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:34,070
knows too

33
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:36,290
the cfrp Sivaji many lists and happily

34
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,450
we had to long walking group document

35
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,540
updated during this period the first

36
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:47,780
wine star customs drop-down there are c

37
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:50,959
17 to 28 piece and we are waiting I

38
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:53,300
don't know if there is any request to

39
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:56,480
adopt this document anyway we are going

40
00:03:53,300 --> 00:04:02,870
to discuss this and the other drafting

41
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:07,370
is the security classes draft hi

42
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:10,040
so my just speaking no hat as a

43
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:11,960
participant I think we got some

44
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:13,450
information that NIST is also doing

45
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,489
something what this has liquor

46
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:18,440
representations is doing perhaps John

47
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:20,690
and Renee have more information on this

48
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,738
since they fall honest much more than I

49
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,410
do

50
00:04:21,738 --> 00:04:26,330
there is probably some overlap but that

51
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,610
there is no reason why we should move

52
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:35,169
this forward I don't know if John you

53
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:35,170
want to comment something on that agree

54
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:56,900
yes hand the blue sheet so I think the

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:59,659
title this light is wrong and so we we

56
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:02,419
have some other working group document

57
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,820
that has been adopted but there seems no

58
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:07,220
activity since for these draft we are

59
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,370
going to ask the all sorts of restaurant

60
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:14,150
how what's the status of the draft and

61
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:19,700
so that we can have pre plan about each

62
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:24,890
draft and anything want to mention but

63
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm going to ask one by one first one is

64
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:31,789
the Rahu's draft down the labor

65
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:34,550
management policy yeah so we really were

66
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:36,080
looking for the review reviews we had

67
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,720
the implementation in place the

68
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,889
performance results in place but since

69
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,749
we didn't get any any any any

70
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,539
any any feedback from the working group

71
00:05:42,749 --> 00:05:46,409
so I mean we just didn't update it

72
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,870
anymore

73
00:05:46,409 --> 00:05:50,900
but if there is any one interested we

74
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,919
really feel that the problem is kind of

75
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,748
important to be handled we have seen

76
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:58,549
that problem getting discussed on Wi-Fi

77
00:05:54,749 --> 00:06:01,110
Alliance mailing group and all that but

78
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,400
to continue any further we need some

79
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:05,669
sort of feedback from the working group

80
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:08,248
so that's where we stopped my suggesting

81
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,258
that we can issue the working group last

82
00:06:08,249 --> 00:06:12,990
call right after the meetings so that

83
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,840
because people tend to avoid doing

84
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,490
anything if there is no then I so if we

85
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,969
issue a walking blast core probably

86
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,800
there will be P critical views or you

87
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,930
know help for views about these routes

88
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,659
there will be helpful for you and also

89
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,919
the working group that will great thank

90
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:35,729
you okay so so then we we can update the

91
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,758
draft and then do really really any

92
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:42,120
updates in mind or you know it's just I

93
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,680
mean we have to know there is no new

94
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,830
thing we have already deployed this in

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,949
in production it's already working in

96
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:56,068
production with the open source and the

97
00:06:49,949 --> 00:06:57,810
performance data okay so I will know

98
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:00,389
this we will issue the working blast

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:04,139
core right after meeting and the other

100
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:04,560
one so the security portico how about

101
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,939
this one

102
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,580
yeah not a time to update this the plan

103
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:15,060
is as discussed last meeting to update

104
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:20,029
it with GLS 102 and DTLS one or two as

105
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:24,930
well as group or score for two parties

106
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:27,439
and I think I have been contacted by I

107
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:30,689
don't remember which University but

108
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:33,539
asking exactly for TLS one or two

109
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:37,409
numbers the new available numbers so you

110
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:41,520
can compare if TLS 103 TLS 102 there's

111
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,889
just high level like 500 bytes and so on

112
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,719
so that's the thinking needed then the

113
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:49,229
long-term plan

114
00:07:45,719 --> 00:07:52,589
I don't know ed Hocken CTLs will it will

115
00:07:49,229 --> 00:07:54,389
take a while before these are stable I

116
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:57,300
don't know maybe I

117
00:07:54,389 --> 00:07:59,039
here or something so the question is do

118
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:02,580
we wait on these what do we do do we

119
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,938
have do we remove them and publish - we

120
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:10,560
have preliminary numbers and say that

121
00:08:05,939 --> 00:08:12,180
these might be updated yeah a solution

122
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,259
so I would say take it off right if

123
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,319
you're gonna wait for it like you know

124
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,900
let it get updated later just like go

125
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,539
for it right now so I think there's like

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:26,039
value in having this published so just

127
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:32,549
go and get it done okay thank you thank

128
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:33,630
you this one fixed how about he's won

129
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:38,609
custody

130
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:40,349
I think that's ready for rank last call

131
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,899
maybe I should we submitted so it's not

132
00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:49,680
expired but I think that's all that

133
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:51,600
needs to be done okay so I think there's

134
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,880
another design team in the sixth row

135
00:08:51,600 --> 00:09:00,500
about the similar topic topic right -

136
00:08:53,880 --> 00:09:04,949
really - yeah it's a bit weird that we

137
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:08,579
that there are three drafts covering two

138
00:09:04,949 --> 00:09:10,920
bases one is what does the existing

139
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:12,810
protocol allow you to do and then

140
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,360
there's one new protocol the new

141
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:18,869
protocol has its own draft but the

142
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,660
existing thing for some reason got split

143
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,940
up between six low and and a week that

144
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,360
doesn't make a lot of sense but it's how

145
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,870
this this document came to be so the

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,329
virtual reassembly document this one

147
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:35,810
describes how to do it and the one in

148
00:09:33,329 --> 00:09:40,079
six low tells you how good the residence

149
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,630
and the one in six law is I think has

150
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:46,109
passed working last call and and all so

151
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:51,839
it's kind of not so useful without this

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:56,480
one okay so I think from this point of

153
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,279
view TC this one is more practical just

154
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,529
answering different questions so this

155
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,439
tells you how to do it and the other one

156
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:06,770
tells you what you get okay that's a

157
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,770
good answer

158
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,680
suresh krisshnan as like responsibility

159
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,260
for both of these I don't mind holding

160
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,939
it until this gets to me before it goes

161
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,980
forward that could be something we do or

162
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,140
if you think there's value in merging

163
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,970
them that's okay with me too so catalyst

164
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,230
is also here so he can comment as well

165
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:29,630
but I don't see why they cannot be the

166
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:33,210
same document if if that's your question

167
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,840
so we can work on the specifics so we'll

168
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:42,930
figure out how to do this okay Alice you

169
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:46,020
want to say something Carlos Gomez so

170
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:48,989
yeah basically in the 6lo session on

171
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,510
Wednesday we have a lot dealing with

172
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:53,610
both fragmentation related documents so

173
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,610
one of the points there was something

174
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:59,820
that the rise from the internet area

175
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,470
directed review which was related with

176
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,300
the intended status for the six long

177
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:08,400
document so that we'll be wanting to

178
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:14,670
discuss okay this one's had be fixed I

179
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:20,579
good very productive today how about

180
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:26,910
this one is Daniel here or any body on

181
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:29,310
the AUSA list no going to skip this okay

182
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:32,040
this one is a pretty tricky because I

183
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:34,319
think III really stalk him in multiple

184
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:36,290
times I think he's a useful document but

185
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,850
the thing is that the core has been

186
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:43,790
changed too much so we start to really

187
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:48,120
to up this document to reflect the

188
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:52,829
advancing call walking group or we can

189
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,980
leave it along custom so the the

190
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:58,890
intention of course was to use this

191
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:02,610
document to collect some some

192
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:10,460
information about a protocol that that

193
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:12,810
is increasingly being deployed and the

194
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,480
within the car Wagner we have been

195
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:17,729
discussing that maybe we need something

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:21,350
that that's more that's more along the

197
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:26,780
lines of what was it RFC 48

198
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:31,670
five my RFC number guesser doesn't work

199
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:34,310
today which was document in the rock

200
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:37,849
working group where we for for five

201
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:41,949
years kept it open as a internet draft

202
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:45,080
and collected errors and clarifications

203
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:48,560
so the the work that needs to be done is

204
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:51,220
to risk redistribute the content between

205
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,599
those two documents so the other one is

206
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,490
in the car working group but not

207
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:01,520
particularly active at the moment but we

208
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:05,570
have started collecting issues that need

209
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:07,280
to go into that document so there is

210
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,480
some work being done but just not the

211
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,370
document yet but on the github

212
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,710
repository

213
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:16,040
and the next step is actually getting

214
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:17,810
these issues over there and then to look

215
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:24,290
at the two documents and to see which

216
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:28,310
part goes where yes the intention

217
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:30,680
understand the intention so but the I

218
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,630
don't do you have any suggesting how to

219
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,239
possess this document oh we just leave

220
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:38,660
either life and make it open all the

221
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,910
time or maybe someone who can be editor

222
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:42,589
so that we can poke this editor every

223
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,930
now and then if the draft is not being

224
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:47,050
updated because like the author's

225
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,579
clearly have moved on to other things

226
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,120
document hasn't been updated in quite a

227
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:55,040
while it's very useful piece of

228
00:13:53,120 --> 00:14:00,500
information but we need someone to kind

229
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:05,810
of see through yeah that's good you and

230
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:08,960
you volunteer to be the editor all right

231
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:16,729
can you do the job ask me again in

232
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:19,610
February but in principle yes okay yes

233
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:22,010
Kristen and I would say let it die for

234
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:23,840
now it's like a document it's like you

235
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,730
know it's available for whenever when

236
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,290
when this energy to edit it like some we

237
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:29,630
can just revive it and go on so it's

238
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,370
like a carson finds time in february or

239
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:32,780
in june right whenever there's something

240
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,910
to update like somebody's gonna come

241
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,329
back with it then we update it because i

242
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,738
think if

243
00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:38,299
there's no energy to update it like you

244
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,350
know I don't want to be stuck with the

245
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:41,449
Stockman because nobody's going to

246
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,879
review it either so I think it's just

247
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,349
let it die and when somebody needs it we

248
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,749
can just drive it and keep going you

249
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:51,529
don't without going through the process

250
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:56,379
again okay my opinion okay that's very

251
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:56,379
good guy thank you thank you sir rich

252
00:14:57,339 --> 00:15:03,319
yes that's pretty much we have and the

253
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:05,720
custom yeah so you have updated this

254
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:08,199
document to you so what's your intention

255
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,439
do you want to request a adoption

256
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:16,779
immediately or this peace document there

257
00:15:12,439 --> 00:15:18,799
are several new things in in this

258
00:15:16,779 --> 00:15:22,429
document of course we already have

259
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:25,910
published as having a true 28 so there

260
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:28,579
are new things in here and it would be

261
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:33,019
good to get some feedback about these

262
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:35,859
new things what one new thing is

263
00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:39,829
security classes which is an interesting

264
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,759
thing given the other draft but there

265
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:49,339
are also some some other new parts about

266
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:54,439
energy usage and about additional

267
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:58,009
classes of processor power so I think it

268
00:15:54,439 --> 00:16:01,669
would be good to get some reviews for

269
00:15:58,009 --> 00:16:11,149
that and then I actually would propose

270
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:14,449
adopting it so I think before we move

271
00:16:11,149 --> 00:16:18,019
forward with the agenda for today in a

272
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:19,910
week maybe this is something for the

273
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:21,230
participants to consider where do they

274
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,799
see the working group going in the

275
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,509
future

276
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:27,019
because one challenge I see with the

277
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:29,269
documents is that they are kind of very

278
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,399
specific on certain topics so the crypto

279
00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:34,009
document is is being driven by one or

280
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:36,019
two guys who know no crypto but then

281
00:16:34,009 --> 00:16:39,320
there's very few participants who are

282
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:42,180
actually providing reviews the same with

283
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,580
minimal s or some of the other documents

284
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:50,310
so what kind of you're missing is having

285
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:53,160
this broad participants and provide

286
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:58,290
comments and you know the participation

287
00:16:53,160 --> 00:17:00,689
is seems to be going down so maybe as a

288
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,520
suggestion one way we can think about it

289
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:04,230
is we don't have a physical meeting

290
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:06,030
every time but only when there is a

291
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,310
significant mass of documents that have

292
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:09,959
been updated we keep the working group

293
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:13,020
alive we keep the mailing list alive

294
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,720
when there is sufficient drive let's say

295
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,000
from caution on on certain documents we

296
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,760
can schedule a meeting or when John

297
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,560
updates the protocol comparison document

298
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,470
we can schedule a meeting but then it's

299
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:27,810
up to you how frequently you want the

300
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,550
meetings we will not ask for a meeting

301
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:33,360
until there is significant mass of

302
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:36,629
documents updated so one one one problem

303
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,449
that we have is that sense tract of

304
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,630
humans always override informational

305
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:47,550
documents so during an IETF week it's

306
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:51,530
really hard to find spare cycles maybe

307
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,870
we should actually do virtual interims

308
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:58,680
at some point at some point where we are

309
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,530
not in a frenzy getting stuff done here

310
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:09,030
the ITF and try to progress documents in

311
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:09,450
this way like what do you say it sounds

312
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,670
good to me

313
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:13,470
and if Carson like once you try it I

314
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:14,490
think I'm open to it like you know just

315
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,850
like set up a meeting

316
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:22,260
probably like mid cycle if you want and

317
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:24,060
see if people turn up right but I do see

318
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,650
the low energy too and I think it's like

319
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:27,540
fair like you know similar thing

320
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:29,100
happened to DHC right so DHC had like a

321
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,720
period where like I know there was not

322
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,070
much energy and then like they had like

323
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,690
a little bit more right like there's

324
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,939
like maket as assignment came up and

325
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:37,500
then there's more energy so it's it's up

326
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,270
to you guys like you know I'm fine

327
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:42,480
keeping the group open and then just

328
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:44,250
waiting it out to see like give it give

329
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,920
it a year that's kind of what I told the

330
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:48,810
DAC chairs like I give you a year and if

331
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,340
like nothing turns up I close it down so

332
00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,620
that's kind of like the thinking I have

333
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,000
your ass

334
00:18:52,620 --> 00:19:00,219
sounds good to us do you have some

335
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,530
comments Karlis let's go miss well-known

336
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:04,440
the question about future of the working

337
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,629
group but on the point of getting

338
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,610
participation on specific topics for

339
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:12,340
example for the TCP draft the

340
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:14,139
involvement of TCP M has been great so I

341
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,810
think that trying to involve

342
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:21,520
participants from the more related topic

343
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,929
topic related working groups would be

344
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,570
great to get feedback

345
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:27,550
indeed that perhaps the exception that

346
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:37,510
proves the rule 8 has received a lot of

347
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:41,200
comments and reviews so let's continue

348
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:43,180
with such a digital agenda today so

349
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,760
first of all we have colors to present

350
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:50,070
the TCP usage guidance in the for the

351
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,070
IRT and Connor's is shortened

352
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:07,110
hello everyone my name is Carlos Gomez

353
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:09,180
I'm going to present the current status

354
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:11,550
and the last update of the draft and

355
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,860
title TCP uses guidance in Internet of

356
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,899
Things

357
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,270
first of all let's see the status of the

358
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,340
document the last time the draft was

359
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:23,370
presented was in brac that was the

360
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:25,800
revision 0-5 then around that time we

361
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:29,790
received comments by stuart shire and

362
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:33,720
corey Fairhurst which led to revisions 0

363
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,670
6 and 0 7 respectively then there was a

364
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,040
working group last call on Burton 0 7

365
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,320
and during the working group last call

366
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:43,379
we received comments by Ingemar

367
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,020
Johansson and two very thorough and

368
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,990
comprehensive reviews by ilpo and mark

369
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,110
oh by the way thanks a lot to everyone

370
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:56,220
who has given feedback for this document

371
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:58,560
which has been really useful so we

372
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,420
produced version 308 with the aim to

373
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,090
address the working robles call comments

374
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:05,880
but still after that there were some

375
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,980
remaining points so the last update is -

376
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,540
0 9 which is aimed to address those

377
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:15,660
remaining points well now let's look at

378
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:18,420
the update in this last revision first

379
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:21,770
of all ill Poe had three rather minor

380
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:25,680
comments basically he suggested to

381
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:29,129
replace a term pure ACK by another term

382
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:31,830
ACK without payload then the second

383
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,980
point was related with the section where

384
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:37,080
we explained that Windows size of 5

385
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,900
segments is needed in order to trigger

386
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,389
first retransmit and fast recovery so we

387
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,220
have an example there and however the

388
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:47,370
there was a sentence that could mislead

389
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,950
the reader to understand that segments 1

390
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,629
to 6 could be sent immediately right

391
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:55,620
from the beginning so we corrected that

392
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:57,990
and also there was one purely editorial

393
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:02,449
improvement suggested so we applied that

394
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:05,310
as well then regarding Marcus

395
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:08,370
outstanding comments there was a more

396
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:11,310
general comment about a term which was

397
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,320
single segment so in most of the

398
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:15,850
versions of this document we have been

399
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,149
using the term single MSS

400
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:23,800
basically this refers to implementations

401
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:27,610
that handle window sizes and buffers of

402
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,990
size of single MSS however in the

403
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:30,490
previous version we had maybe

404
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:33,460
spiritually

405
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:35,680
changed that to single segment however

406
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:38,770
after comments by Markov it became clear

407
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,620
that single MSS was actually the more

408
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:45,310
appropriate term to use here because it

409
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:49,090
reflects the behavior what is supported

410
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:51,790
in the category of more lightweight TCP

411
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:56,080
implementations which support single MSS

412
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:58,600
window sizes and buffers and also that's

413
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:02,020
what is described and consistent with

414
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,149
what we explained in the document then

415
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:06,790
in the section where we provide guidance

416
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:09,460
on how to set the NSS there was a

417
00:23:06,790 --> 00:23:13,149
suggestion to change the phrase limit

418
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:16,090
MTU to limit the IP datagram size and we

419
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,760
did that change in fact the MTU is

420
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,439
rather parameter property of the

421
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:25,030
underlying network technology below ipv6

422
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,670
then there was another comment in the

423
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:30,820
section where we attempted to provide

424
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:34,810
guidance for how to set the MSS when

425
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:38,260
ipv4 is used however after a comment by

426
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:41,679
Markku we thought that it was better to

427
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,740
remove that attempt because in fact

428
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:47,380
there is not an ipv4 equivalent of the

429
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,970
ipv6 MTU requirement so it was hard to

430
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,820
provide guidance in the same way then in

431
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:59,560
a section that discusses single MSS

432
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:02,169
stacks we explained that in coop there's

433
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:05,230
usually stop and wait behavior so

434
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:07,900
usually a single MSS window would be

435
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,570
sufficient for for that use however

436
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:14,080
there is one exception noted by Markku

437
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:17,409
which is that there's the CSM message

438
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,179
this is for co-op over TCP the CSM which

439
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:21,640
is sent at the beginning of a connection

440
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:24,010
which can be followed immediately by the

441
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,910
first application layer message that

442
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:28,920
carries actual user data so here in this

443
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:30,480
case depending on the

444
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:32,790
sizes of the CSM and the first

445
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:35,070
application-layer message then perhaps

446
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:39,180
single MSS window might not be

447
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:41,870
sufficient then in the section that

448
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:44,550
discusses delayed acts for single MSS

449
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:47,909
implementations we have made some

450
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:49,530
clarifications we had a sentence where

451
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:51,450
we explained that the saving disabling

452
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,460
Nagel has no impact if the sender can

453
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:55,110
only handle stop and wait operation we

454
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:57,720
added at the end of the sentence that

455
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:01,169
this is the TCP level to avoid potential

456
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:03,660
confusion with stop and wait operation

457
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:05,760
at the application level and also we

458
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,700
applied some additional editorial

459
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,890
clarifications

460
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,970
then there's the section where we

461
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:17,660
discuss the RTO algorithm for single MSS

462
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:21,210
implementations here the idea is that

463
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:23,760
the RT algorithm that is used may have a

464
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,420
greater impact on performance then when

465
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,970
larger window sizes are supported and we

466
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:32,520
already cited in previous versions of

467
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,730
the document an algorithm called Coco

468
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:39,560
which was designed for co-op actually

469
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:42,540
and now we have also added another

470
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:44,700
advanced RTO algorithm which has been

471
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:50,280
designed also in the context of Coco

472
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:52,770
which is called phaser and also related

473
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,810
with the section I mentioned before when

474
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,690
we discuss the window size to trigger

475
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:59,909
fast retransmit and fast recovery in the

476
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:02,940
previous version we explained that with

477
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:04,680
limited transmit window size of three

478
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,600
segments in the previous version would

479
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:08,370
be enough to trigger sending segments

480
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,800
one to five in the example that we have

481
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:11,340
in that section where segment number two

482
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,520
is lost

483
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:16,679
however marco pointed out that it's

484
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,440
actually two segments that's needed as a

485
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:21,360
window size to trigger the transmission

486
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,390
of those segments one to five

487
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:26,550
however there's the downside of the

488
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:32,030
sender having to wait for the delayed

489
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:34,500
ACK for second one so that was all the

490
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:38,000
updates from my side I don't know if

491
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:38,000
there may be any comments or questions

492
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:49,909
I guess it's time for us to do the

493
00:26:47,269 --> 00:26:54,309
shepherd it right up and send it forward

494
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:55,789
oh yeah thank you thank you very much

495
00:26:54,309 --> 00:26:58,460
Thank You Carlos

496
00:26:55,789 --> 00:27:01,190
and thank you for for maku and you know

497
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:13,970
who have you distraught comprehensively

498
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:16,009
thank you the the the the final item on

499
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,039
the agenda is the presentation from Rahu

500
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:21,200
and it there's no draft reflecting this

501
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,139
presentation but the content of this

502
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,360
presentation has some insights and can

503
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:29,870
provide some insight to our IT airport

504
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:33,350
code especially for the IOT realm and I

505
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:35,989
think we can all learn from something

506
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:38,779
for me and especially for the portico

507
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:41,299
designers hello everyone I'm Rahul

508
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:44,149
Jadhav so this is more of a deployment

509
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:45,529
experiences which we took back and you

510
00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:49,580
know which had a lot of impact on the

511
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:51,110
protocol and protocol designs which we

512
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,710
took back to the individual working

513
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:57,320
groups and we found it not useful so

514
00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:00,529
this is essentially in 2014 we started

515
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,840
off with a project for AMI and we found

516
00:28:00,529 --> 00:28:05,840
that you know we assembled a protocol

517
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,879
stack we tested it in Kuja we found that

518
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,799
everything is working all fine and then

519
00:28:07,879 --> 00:28:14,000
we try to check whether it can actually

520
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:18,049
scale so we would we had to put up a

521
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,779
hardware based test environment of 300

522
00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:23,299
nodes and it was really really difficult

523
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:26,240
to manage that kind of scale on hardware

524
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,649
and we realized that on hardware the

525
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,279
same protocol stack was not able to

526
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:33,139
scale at all and then we tried we tried

527
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,009
to check what was the problem and we

528
00:28:33,139 --> 00:28:36,158
realized there were a lot of

529
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:39,279
deficiencies in the individual protocols

530
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:41,330
that were not addressed because

531
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,610
especially from the performance point of

532
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:45,649
view in Kuja everything worked fine the

533
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,149
network convergence time was great the

534
00:28:45,649 --> 00:28:49,610
node joining time was great but in

535
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:52,309
reality it didn't really scale up that

536
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,990
well so that's when we started about

537
00:28:52,309 --> 00:28:57,830
about this work

538
00:28:53,990 --> 00:29:01,460
roughly around idea of 96 four years

539
00:28:57,830 --> 00:29:03,620
back and most of the work that we had

540
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,540
taken back reversed was for the role

541
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:08,149
working group and that is what the there

542
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:09,500
is one draft in a week also which is

543
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,630
about neighbor management policy which

544
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,690
had that particular framework had a lot

545
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:16,520
of impact on it so what is this about

546
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:18,290
it's about experience sharing we have

547
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:21,290
lot of I Triple E papers and other

548
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:26,480
papers online most of them are doing the

549
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:28,570
tests in Kuja I'll be talking why it may

550
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,480
not be reliable in certain situations

551
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:34,550
the results might be untrustworthy the

552
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,460
protocols that are defined as part of

553
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,730
those papers may not necessarily be

554
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,820
realistic

555
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:44,030
we had burned I mean we have spent a lot

556
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:46,220
of time on on fixing those issues and we

557
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:51,950
really want others to understand what

558
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:53,330
the issues could be so so so the

559
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:55,130
experiments most of the experiments that

560
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:58,309
were done in the existing papers that

561
00:29:55,130 --> 00:30:00,410
they have very limited scope because you

562
00:29:58,309 --> 00:30:02,660
cannot there are no frameworks available

563
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:04,340
outside which could actually scale to

564
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:06,530
the kind of number of nodes that you

565
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:08,360
want for example if you want to actually

566
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:10,129
simulate a thousand nodes network or

567
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,309
hundred nodes network there are options

568
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:16,160
available like in s3 or castelia omnibus

569
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:19,970
press but it's got them too hard to use

570
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,440
those tools and this is where we this is

571
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:24,110
what exactly we had been through and

572
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,230
this this this particular talk is about

573
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,879
that those experiences so my context

574
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:31,340
here we started off with multi-hop mesh

575
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,559
routing protocols we had very bigger we

576
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:35,629
had big networks 1,000 nodes we we aim

577
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:40,210
to reach to that scale of 1,000 nodes

578
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:42,559
with 16 ops a typical ami scenario so

579
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:44,990
this is what we thought what we want is

580
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,550
from this from this framework is you

581
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:48,860
know we wanted something which we can

582
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,800
benchmark for and we can have other

583
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:53,510
peoples submit that data their results

584
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,480
or their experiments in the same

585
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:58,610
framework so that it can be compared in

586
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,260
the same context this was the most

587
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:02,090
important thing we wanted something to

588
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:05,140
be reproducible the data should be

589
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:07,399
reproducible in in on a different system

590
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,879
data should be under realistic Network

591
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,769
condition

592
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:11,569
I say realistic it's still simulation

593
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:13,339
but some with realistic path loss

594
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:15,229
modeling with realistic interference and

595
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:17,089
collision modeling so that kind of

596
00:31:15,229 --> 00:31:21,409
realism you can of course use the

597
00:31:17,089 --> 00:31:22,928
realistic real hardware but to deploy

598
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:24,709
real hardware with five hundred or

599
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:26,929
forget you in five hundred you in one

600
00:31:24,709 --> 00:31:29,779
hundred nodes is it requires a lot of

601
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:31,669
manpower and requires a lot of not not

602
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:33,709
most of the most of the teams here could

603
00:31:31,669 --> 00:31:35,179
muster that kind of that kind of energy

604
00:31:33,709 --> 00:31:37,009
or that kind of resources that are

605
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:38,719
required for a hardware test but the

606
00:31:37,009 --> 00:31:40,789
third important the next important thing

607
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:44,359
was the interrupt testing we wanted to

608
00:31:40,789 --> 00:31:45,829
test at scale so we have a lot of open

609
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:47,359
source options available we wanted to

610
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,829
check if the know those open sources

611
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,829
could actually inter work with each

612
00:31:48,829 --> 00:31:53,089
other at scale so in most of the

613
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:55,789
interrupts you would see that there are

614
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:57,678
few nodes kept on the desk they talk to

615
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,449
each other and it's and that's how we

616
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,039
prove the interoperability but at

617
00:31:59,449 --> 00:32:03,409
performance but if you want real

618
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,899
performance at scale if you are putting

619
00:32:03,409 --> 00:32:10,969
two 100 nodes a lot of protocol specific

620
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:13,279
idiosyncrasies that come up which

621
00:32:10,969 --> 00:32:17,059
results in a very bad performance

622
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,829
eventually for the whole network and we

623
00:32:17,059 --> 00:32:21,168
want something we wanted something which

624
00:32:18,829 --> 00:32:23,448
we're in a scenario configuration could

625
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,979
be shared to other developers they can

626
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:29,299
just take the scenario configuration and

627
00:32:24,979 --> 00:32:31,190
start from there and get the data so we

628
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:32,769
understood that realistic models aren't

629
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,849
necessarily especially for wireless

630
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:36,289
constrained networks some some

631
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:38,389
characters such as asymmetric links

632
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:39,469
impact of channel access interference

633
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,968
and collision patterns could have a

634
00:32:39,469 --> 00:32:45,289
really really big impact on the overall

635
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:47,809
design performance data is important to

636
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:49,639
be measured but best is to use hardware

637
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:51,499
but it's not always possible so the

638
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:55,369
these were the premises that where we

639
00:32:51,499 --> 00:32:57,319
build upon so now that we are talking

640
00:32:55,369 --> 00:32:58,668
about yet another framework I should

641
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:00,019
explain that there are a lot of

642
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:02,149
framework already in place for example

643
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:04,459
the Kuja it's very good to use it has

644
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:07,158
extremely good visualization and that is

645
00:33:04,459 --> 00:33:09,049
why we could see that almost 60 to 70

646
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,839
percent of I Triple E papers give data

647
00:33:09,049 --> 00:33:13,940
based on Kuja it's it's and it

648
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,379
integrates very easily with the existing

649
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:19,129
most popular open-source operating

650
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:21,500
system called quanta key and it's it it

651
00:33:19,129 --> 00:33:23,389
makes it very easily real easy to use

652
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,980
it supports hardware emulation that is

653
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,600
another feature that it has but it

654
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:29,180
doesn't really have any realistic path

655
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:30,830
loss modeling and propagation models it

656
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:33,350
cannot scale to hundreds of nodes

657
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,210
it works on top of JVM if you try to put

658
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:39,260
in hundreds of node that it's going to

659
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:41,630
just die off one good option is to use

660
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:43,790
NS 300 minute plus plus these are these

661
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:46,280
provide you realistic options but it is

662
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:48,200
impossible to use the realistic net real

663
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:50,470
network stack if you want the network

664
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,020
stack from riot or quantity or any other

665
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:57,470
Linux kernel for that matter to be used

666
00:33:54,020 --> 00:34:00,260
on top of NS 3 or only clusters you have

667
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,850
to put your code in context 2 n is 3 or

668
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:04,550
a minute plus plus which is a really

669
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:08,449
really big ask it's it's it's a big work

670
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:10,070
in itself so there are certain options

671
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:12,799
such as NS 3 provides something called

672
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:14,990
as tab bridge but these options cannot

673
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,330
scale to hundreds of nodes you can't

674
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,918
have really I mean you can have hundreds

675
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:23,029
of tap interfaces but it's really an

676
00:34:18,918 --> 00:34:24,620
ugly way of doing that using the doing

677
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,040
at that kind of scale you know you you

678
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:31,549
don't want 1,000 tap interfaces on your

679
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,230
machine just for simulation powers there

680
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,960
are hardware based test test bits in

681
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,240
three ah fyt IOT lab they you get

682
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,480
practical data from that but you have

683
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:44,270
limited scale and the access to those

684
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,830
test bits are rather limited in the

685
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:48,560
sense that you can't really play with it

686
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:49,969
you have confined time in which you can

687
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,590
operate on them you can't really change

688
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:55,909
configuration and quickly check the data

689
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,410
so realistic simulation frameworks are

690
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:58,879
difficult to use here is the data from

691
00:34:57,410 --> 00:35:01,040
one of the papers which had been

692
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,500
recently submitted if you see Kuja is

693
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,300
the most dominant tool and it's 3 is

694
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:07,490
also another the second most dominant

695
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:11,450
tool but Kuja beats everyone else by a

696
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:15,350
big big number it's 63 person you see

697
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:17,569
the the data the graph on the right hand

698
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,400
side shows you how many of the

699
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:21,440
experiments had actually used Hardware

700
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,820
less than 40% of experiments have

701
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,270
actually used Hardware and 80% of those

702
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:32,300
experiments use less than 60 nodes so

703
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:34,520
not mu and mu if you see most of the

704
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,450
documents in a lot of working group

705
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:37,880
talks

706
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:39,649
scaling to thousands of nodes while

707
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,410
while while there are no practical

708
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:48,200
frameworks which can actually deliver on

709
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:50,470
that task so this work we had started

710
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,790
during ITF 96 it's called white fill and

711
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:56,899
this is basically how it operates you

712
00:35:52,790 --> 00:36:00,050
know you you have you have so you have

713
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:03,890
the realistic protocol stack quantity

714
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:05,270
right and then you have an s3 or only

715
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:07,580
plus plus right now a minute plus plus

716
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:10,630
is not integrated only the NS 3 is

717
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:13,880
integrated in this you can use real

718
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,860
Network stack in this and the same

719
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,850
network stack can be as it is migrated

720
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:21,230
to the hardware so the advantage is you

721
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,600
you you'll be able to experiment with

722
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:27,590
and it can scale as well it can scale to

723
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:31,520
find it nodes on on a regular laptop it

724
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:34,160
supports an s3 as of now but it can

725
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:36,740
support ideal air ideal air is a is the

726
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,839
context in which in which you can

727
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:40,549
actually have configurations which can

728
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:43,880
be shared to everyone else you have

729
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,650
deterministic models where the same

730
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:46,880
thing can happen over and over again and

731
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:51,560
you can share the configuration to

732
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,810
someone else question a vision yeah I

733
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:56,299
have a general question from the

734
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:57,799
previous slide the statistics that you

735
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:02,060
have shown over there in that pie chart

736
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:04,220
so the small amount of coordinate

737
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:07,450
percentage percentage for coordinate I

738
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:10,220
mean is it because of its quali

739
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:13,129
qualitative reason or is it because of

740
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,359
prohibitive cost and I well I don't know

741
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,950
about that because the paper doesn't

742
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,300
talk about it this is the data from the

743
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:19,700
paper that have known what I want to

744
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:21,680
know emboss factor have you have you

745
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:23,930
evaluated quality in terms of its

746
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,379
properties the the offerings that it

747
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:30,770
gives or is it only that academicians do

748
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:32,270
not use it much because of that so

749
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,660
whether that kind of an analysis has

750
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:36,050
been done

751
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:37,640
so especially you asking specifically in

752
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:40,220
context of cornet cornet we have not

753
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:43,850
evaluated alright we have we have done

754
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:46,520
experiments in Kuja and s3 ohm net and

755
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:48,368
WS net as well because I am also ended

756
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,369
attached to University

757
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:55,299
and quality's a pain working for

758
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:57,190
anticipation I don't know where the

759
00:37:55,299 --> 00:37:59,279
quality is a paid it's a paid tool I

760
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:06,190
don't know I don't even know about that

761
00:37:59,279 --> 00:38:08,289
okay yeah so so this is what we have

762
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,420
essentially what we have is we have

763
00:38:08,289 --> 00:38:14,589
individual protocol stacks operating and

764
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:17,529
we have a virtual airline which operates

765
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:20,769
only the physical and Mac layer inside

766
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:22,539
the airline and it the the the network

767
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:24,098
stack whenever it delivers a packet it's

768
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:26,440
delivered to a corresponding virtual

769
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:27,549
node in the airline using a message

770
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,589
queue right now the message queue is

771
00:38:27,549 --> 00:38:33,640
implemented using abstract UNIX domain

772
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:36,038
sockets but the realism the wireless

773
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,049
realism that you get is from actually

774
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:39,489
the industry but the best part is that

775
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:41,049
you don't have to change your code or

776
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:43,180
you don't have to change your design to

777
00:38:41,049 --> 00:38:45,009
suit in s3 you can use the existing

778
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:49,419
protocol stack in context when is three

779
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:51,759
so that's a so quantity right and right

780
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:55,170
is already supported open thread support

781
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:58,509
is in progress it's it's still not there

782
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:03,420
every stack line here is an individual

783
00:38:58,509 --> 00:39:06,279
process so what we do essentially is

784
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,170
every stack line for example kontiki we

785
00:39:06,279 --> 00:39:10,210
have added support a platform support

786
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:12,160
for white fill it takes the packet from

787
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:13,809
quanta key and sends it to the NS three

788
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,469
corresponding virtual node in the NS

789
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:18,940
three and then it goes go on to the

790
00:39:17,469 --> 00:39:22,329
target node and then it comes back to

791
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:24,400
the stack line again so maximum 60,000

792
00:39:22,329 --> 00:39:26,499
nodes could be scale but we have

793
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,450
practically tested it for 1,500 nodes as

794
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:31,479
of now we don't have a machine that

795
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:35,680
powerful to run 60,000 nodes but anyways

796
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:37,239
we have ran it for 1,500 node at max the

797
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,910
airline stack line and communication

798
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,380
line are all decoupled such that the new

799
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,469
new new stacks could easily be added

800
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,589
here we have planned to add sapphire as

801
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:50,229
well in the near future it already we

802
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:54,578
have tested Interop between quantity and

803
00:39:50,229 --> 00:39:55,749
right in the in this platform so this is

804
00:39:54,579 --> 00:39:57,489
how it looks you know there are a lot of

805
00:39:55,749 --> 00:39:59,169
configuration that has to be input in

806
00:39:57,489 --> 00:40:01,750
this but what we are trying to do is

807
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:05,350
trying to synergize or

808
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:07,330
we are trying to give all this common

809
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:10,299
configuration to the whiteford core and

810
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:13,210
then let the white coat give you the

811
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:14,440
results of the OEM is same across all

812
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:17,200
the stack lines so even if you use

813
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:20,140
quantity alright your onm is the same

814
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:25,299
the the the white fill integrates with

815
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:26,770
all the oils for individual stacks so

816
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:28,960
case to be one so this has been one of

817
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:30,820
the most important draft that we have

818
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,880
been working in roll most of the data

819
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:36,070
that we have we have gathered for this

820
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,930
particular work has been has been taken

821
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:39,520
using this framework without this

822
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:41,200
framework we wouldn't have been possible

823
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,390
to you know get Candice get the kind of

824
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,370
results for the first time we were able

825
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:47,859
to test inter up between riot and

826
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,859
quantity at scale and we found lot of

827
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,810
issues with the primary issue been that

828
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:54,730
the DAO aggregation is not handled in

829
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,730
quantity so there is some messaging that

830
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,620
needs to be handled so it's not handled

831
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:01,210
we reported that arc welder

832
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,270
fragmentation issue on write mailing

833
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,460
list this was discussed like any year

834
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:08,230
year-and-a-half before basically

835
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:11,050
essentially we could read Interop at

836
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,990
scale network convergence time for three

837
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:16,240
hundred nodes quantity nodes in Kuja it

838
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:19,029
reports less than twenty seconds if you

839
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,520
use Kuja but but if you try to do the

840
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:24,280
same thing with why white field or with

841
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,950
realistic hard with real hardware the

842
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,360
convergence time is in minutes so there

843
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,970
is clearly a major difference between

844
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:33,670
what you see in the simulation platforms

845
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:35,529
versus what you really get control over

846
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:37,420
it was very different so the control

847
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,370
over it when you test it with Kucha is

848
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:41,470
very different you get very little

849
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:43,270
control control over it because the very

850
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,490
less losses the interference is less

851
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:50,560
then our interference model but those

852
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:52,169
are not realistic case two we have NP de

853
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,790
which which showed the impact of

854
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:56,740
optimized value in validation on overall

855
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:58,630
network the actual numbers with Kooza

856
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,160
were really really nice but we couldn't

857
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:04,150
report that we had to report some

858
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:05,920
realistic data so so our numbers were

859
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:10,000
what much much different from what Kuja

860
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,860
could have actually produced neighbor

861
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,530
management policy which the draft which

862
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:15,340
we have here in albuquerque expired but

863
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:17,530
yeah

864
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:19,810
so we we showcased we already had

865
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,500
presented our performance data last time

866
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:22,660
in a week

867
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,210
it's about the impact of neighbor cash

868
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:27,520
policy on the overall network

869
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,560
stabilization how stable your network

870
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,290
will run if we have limited neighbor

871
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:35,320
cash size the minimal fragment draft

872
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:38,050
again we had presented this in in in in

873
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:40,540
L wig as well as six low before it shows

874
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:41,890
the impact of a two 2.15 dot for single

875
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:45,490
channel mode of operation on fragment

876
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:47,259
forwarding so all this data all the data

877
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:48,669
that I am talking of is available with

878
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:51,010
the detailed configurations and

879
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,170
observations and the raw data on the on

880
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:55,480
the same whiteford frame for github so

881
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:58,750
there's another interesting piece of

882
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,060
work which started last year in called

883
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,710
as IOT bench it's a community effort to

884
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:06,100
better evaluate and compare low-power

885
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:08,200
wireless network the principles of AIT

886
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:12,279
bench and while Whitefield are more or

887
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:14,680
less similar so basically we did the aim

888
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,540
is that the developers the implementers

889
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:18,279
should be able to share their

890
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,140
configurations share their observations

891
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:22,750
and it should the data should be

892
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:24,790
reproducible IOT bench provides an

893
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:26,380
excellent conceptual framework it

894
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,670
clearly abstracts what are the

895
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:29,370
configurations that are required the

896
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:32,260
performance metrics eventually and

897
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,880
Whitefield in the und going forward we

898
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:38,830
will try to use lot of recommendations

899
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,900
from this work that's that's it if

900
00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:43,240
anyone is interested here is the details

901
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:46,240
of the framework it's it's completely

902
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:58,330
open it's a GPL license and it's

903
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:59,950
completely driven from so I found this

904
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:03,130
presentation and the whole work very

905
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:06,279
useful my question is actually to our ad

906
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:12,820
serration do you think this is something

907
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:15,670
we could publicize with the within the

908
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:17,290
IOT block that Steve writes because I

909
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:19,960
think this has implications across

910
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,540
several working groups so based on this

911
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:24,580
kind of more real-world simulations we

912
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,580
had these these these troughs which were

913
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:28,819
then affecting these working groups kind

914
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,060
of showing that why

915
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:37,670
having realistic implementations in the

916
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:39,500
ITF is is our way of working a solution

917
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:41,900
I think I can do even better we can go

918
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:44,420
on IETF durog blog if you want right so

919
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:46,070
we can I can like introduce you to Greg

920
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:48,470
we can probably write something we've

921
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:51,260
done this before we've done something

922
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:54,290
for lp1 like we wrote like an article

923
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:56,720
like I sat down and with Pascal and Alex

924
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:58,700
and wrote something so if you're

925
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,709
interested like you know I'll talk to

926
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,540
Greg and we can figure out how we want

927
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:04,690
to write about it

928
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,790
ok so it goes an idea or

929
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:11,630
I have one more question in the context

930
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:14,360
if the time permits so is one thing that

931
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,750
we had been thinking is is it is it

932
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:20,150
possible for us to give the benchmark

933
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:21,950
configurations as part of IIT of draft

934
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:23,450
and say that you know these are the

935
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:28,490
benchmark configurations that one should

936
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:30,680
test if one needs to assure like there's

937
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,660
been like lot of drafts like I

938
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:34,790
especially like no earlier in the idea

939
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,830
of which had like test vectors directly

940
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:39,080
in the RFC's like so I think there's

941
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,920
like pre-existing stuff for that so I

942
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,060
don't see why not

943
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,380
I like that you can publish this like

944
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:46,910
configuration kind of thing I don't see

945
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,800
why it should be an issue but a blog

946
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,569
entry would be just as good I think but

947
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,980
if you can publish it and we can

948
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:54,320
reference it somehow it should be ok too

949
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:55,700
and it's pretty much permanent as well

950
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,800
so I think it's like a really good

951
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,950
vehicle for this thanks boys for

952
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:06,620
soliciting it thank you thank you very

953
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:07,529
much thank you sorry before very where

954
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:10,638
are the blue sheet

955
00:46:07,530 --> 00:46:10,639
[Music]

956
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:23,289
okay this session ends and thank you for

957
00:46:18,130 --> 00:46:27,089
coming and thank you for coming and have

958
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:27,089
a nice evening and the week ahead
