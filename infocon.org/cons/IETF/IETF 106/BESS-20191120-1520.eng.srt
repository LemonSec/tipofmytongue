1
00:00:26,009 --> 00:00:36,820
maybe let's wait about two more minutes

2
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:39,700
because yeah I don't want to very

3
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:41,410
relaxed because I think next time never

4
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,719
got more people there as well yeah it's

5
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:45,730
as soon as it's easier yeah a lot of

6
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,460
lots of American people on the cover

7
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:52,390
yeah yeah it's a really long trip

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,649
especially the East Coast

9
00:00:52,390 --> 00:01:00,449
yeah some people from her survive around

10
00:00:55,649 --> 00:01:00,449
twenty-five hours yeah it's crazy

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:22,810
or else for us we need to go twist 20 up

12
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,610
so it would be far far everybody I know

13
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:29,560
we've done one in Australia a really

14
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:51,899
long time should get one of those direct

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:51,899
flights your mother used to get this

16
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:02,280
it's not expensive yes there's some very

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,279
environmentally friendly

18
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:35,750
yeah hey guys it's time to start this is

19
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:43,310
a second session of best working group

20
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:46,250
in Singapore so this is a not well you

21
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:49,090
probably seen it multiple times already

22
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:52,160
this week but probably say that

23
00:02:49,090 --> 00:03:00,200
everything you say is gone just a

24
00:02:52,160 --> 00:03:02,780
contribution to the atf community blue

25
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,790
sheets are circulating please ensure

26
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:10,549
that we are coming back to us at the end

27
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:14,810
of a meeting this is our agenda for

28
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:17,540
today and if you have any complain

29
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:25,120
please raise it now otherwise we will

30
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:25,120
start so sandy Joseph your speaker

31
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:47,268
okay good afternoon

32
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:51,800
and I'm sunny exam from DTE this

33
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:55,190
presentation is for EVPs fair over use

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:58,459
case and the you we will use PFT for

35
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:59,420
this use case in this structure we have

36
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:04,430
Co sir

37
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:10,700
Yuba and Gregg so at first let's see

38
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:14,269
this problem statement and as you will

39
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:18,769
see we'd like to monitor the link

40
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:22,700
between p1 and C we know that in the

41
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:26,780
normal situation we suppose that say e

42
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:29,870
is motorhome the to true piece so only

43
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:36,679
one p will be like today STF and for

44
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:39,620
world the BD b om flow so when in case

45
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,889
of the link between p1 and the sea

46
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:47,810
filled and between the EF and the say he

47
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:51,650
failed we know that's the second PE in

48
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:56,180
this figure with me suppose it's p2 p2

49
00:04:51,650 --> 00:05:00,080
will take the charge of the forwarding

50
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:04,630
BAM packet after it being elected SDF

51
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:10,700
but we know that before it is elected is

52
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:14,599
DF we have the time period for the PDP

53
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:19,849
signaling so p1 will send us a PDP

54
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:24,139
packet to all the other piece and people

55
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:28,400
then started the PDF PDF the DFO

56
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:34,610
election function so it takes time so in

57
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:37,669
order to improve the pump akator lost we

58
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,200
would like to use the mechanism dividing

59
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:45,070
up see 5 8 8 4 and we also use the

60
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,240
subcommittee finding the exist heater

61
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,680
working group structure

62
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:57,900
Yoona PLC peeping to appeal the decision

63
00:05:52,680 --> 00:06:00,990
between PDF and the DF so the follow is

64
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,880
a procedure that can be used to build

65
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,900
this PFD station between p2 and p1 in

66
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,969
this figure

67
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:16,020
it means the B D F and DF so people will

68
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:22,830
stand as a request we have this request

69
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:25,409
- P - D F and P 1 will acknowledge H and

70
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,639
the build of the session between two

71
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:34,500
peas so P 2 will monitor the link

72
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:38,400
between P 1 and C then D F in this

73
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:41,009
figure is p1 will send a periodical we

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,659
have the packet to p2 to indicate that

75
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:51,330
the link between p1 and C is works

76
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:53,090
normal but in fact the link between p1

77
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:57,719
and SAE failed

78
00:06:53,090 --> 00:07:01,590
p1 will send the PFD packet away State

79
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:05,039
said set it to an amine down to p2 so p2

80
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:09,090
will know that as the link between p1

81
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:14,460
and say he has failed so p2 will elect

82
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:18,960
it itself to be DF o quickly and send is

83
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:22,320
a BAM package and also if there's

84
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,960
something wrong with the p1 and p1

85
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,389
cannot stand as a periodical we have the

86
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:34,008
packet to p2 p2 can also know the the

87
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:38,250
situation from the PFD piratical

88
00:07:34,009 --> 00:07:41,370
detection time the PFD detection time so

89
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:44,159
people will also notice that there are

90
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:47,909
something wrong with p1 and the p2 can

91
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:54,419
also elected itself to be EF and the

92
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:56,789
forward of the bomb package and so this

93
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:59,820
job has been presented in progress

94
00:07:56,789 --> 00:08:04,289
meeting and that we receive some comes

95
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:06,039
from Ali so it's very useful for us

96
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:09,998
so we add more

97
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:14,919
detail about this solution to hint to

98
00:08:09,999 --> 00:08:17,770
make it more clear so we know that the

99
00:08:14,919 --> 00:08:23,080
TF will send a periodical we have the

100
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:26,438
packet to the PDF so in the default in

101
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:30,099
default the PFD multiplayer it means

102
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:34,000
that a bill has relationship with the

103
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:37,889
detection time so the default value is 3

104
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:41,919
but if because this this value can be

105
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:44,829
configured so if this value has said has

106
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,430
been said too small for example you say

107
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:52,899
data to one so one PFD pact lost may

108
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:55,750
lead to the PFD switch over so in in a

109
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:59,440
previous slides only one we have the

110
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:03,190
packet lost her will lead to the P true

111
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,880
elected itself to PDF so the in this

112
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:11,500
situation may be P 1 is workers normal

113
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:15,250
now then two PS will off elected itself

114
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:19,870
SDF and forwarding a duplicate flows so

115
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:23,500
this must be our attention be paid more

116
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:27,190
attention to not to configure this where

117
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:31,149
you choose more and in terms of the

118
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:34,420
behavior changes situation because some

119
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:37,060
may be will add some other router which

120
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,740
can be come the new PDF joins the

121
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:45,699
network the older PDF in this figure we

122
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,250
serve results its p2p to shoot a people

123
00:09:45,699 --> 00:09:53,170
is no longer the PDF anymore

124
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:55,839
so people should must send us a PFD

125
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:59,709
packet which is which says data instead

126
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:05,550
it said to admin down to p1 to remove

127
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:08,199
make p1 to remove the PFD station so the

128
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:12,389
previous P of the station has no longer

129
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:17,109
any more so and one the new BDF for

130
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:19,980
Senator PFD requests the two DF a new bf

131
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:25,950
decision will be built for it so

132
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,950
that's all the solution any comments

133
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,489
Montgomery sir from Cisco so these BFD

134
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,700
sessions are multi-hop BFD between p1

135
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:38,800
and p2 yes it really what would happen

136
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,959
if there is any issue between these hops

137
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,370
and your BFD session goes down will both

138
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,279
of them be active as a DF now and

139
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:50,640
causing duplicate traffic you means the

140
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:57,250
the first situation Oh

141
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:00,640
duplicate the DF yeah yes but yes yeah

142
00:10:57,250 --> 00:11:04,300
that's the worst Q's uses for it so you

143
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,339
must pay attention to the value you must

144
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:09,189
sit through the detection time to our

145
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:11,980
reasonable value MP because we know that

146
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:15,760
PFT session will be broken down due to

147
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,920
some reasons but the first one is why

148
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,089
you'll see was a PFD packet which data

149
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:25,689
is sitting down and the second is you

150
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:28,930
have not received receive the PFD packet

151
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,420
of ours for a period of time so as the

152
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:33,609
period of time it means detection time

153
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:36,459
if you set is the detection ham too

154
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:39,370
small you will also lead to this

155
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:42,430
situation yet you break hated packets

156
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,410
for you prohibit DF but if you keep

157
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:48,040
timer will it not be almost similar as

158
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:50,490
BGP it draws your route type for if es

159
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,310
is down like are we really going to get

160
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:57,970
anything much out of it using this

161
00:11:53,310 --> 00:12:00,310
multi-hop PFD just but how would be of

162
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:06,040
the can be used in region but these days

163
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:07,180
means the point-to-point Greg Merson

164
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,150
City

165
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,870
well first you don't have to have Monty

166
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,930
Hall DF D you can use

167
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:19,779
MPLS OSP and then we'll be over tunnel

168
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:22,680
so and you can construct your LSP over

169
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:26,170
more secure domain of your network so

170
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,160
meaning to minimize yes again you're

171
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,890
right

172
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,439
there is no way to differentiate where

173
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,730
the path fails or the node fails that's

174
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,839
challenge but the

175
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:40,420
the challenge with there any OEM default

176
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:43,480
failure management so because we don't

177
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:47,110
differentiate between death knell

178
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:51,100
failure and notable but you can have

179
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:57,310
some operational considerations that to

180
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:59,050
make it that more secure more stable one

181
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:01,839
one question speaking as working on

182
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:07,719
member so do you have one BFD session

183
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:10,510
pair yes yes the Contra build a Cisco I

184
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,880
just have a quick a quick comment there

185
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:16,480
is a working working group document that

186
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,920
addresses the F fast recovery so I would

187
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,570
I would maybe invite you just to read

188
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:25,709
that and see how it can be extended or

189
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:32,589
how BFD can be incorporated into that

190
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:35,518
okay okay Robin Nokia so I understand

191
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:40,449
this is to speed up the DF election

192
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:45,010
convergence but in any case in this

193
00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:47,709
diagram for p3 you still rely on BGP to

194
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,110
actually flush the max or or switch the

195
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:52,899
max to the other P right yes so overall

196
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:55,449
for for unicast traffic you are not

197
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:58,930
getting much out of this for BOM traffic

198
00:13:55,449 --> 00:14:02,290
yeah you can get some you know better

199
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:05,019
convergence yes because we think it may

200
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:08,019
take some more time for PT PA the word

201
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:10,240
Huysmans for it yes so we introduce the

202
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,699
data frame detection function for yet

203
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:21,610
yeah it sure it'll bring but coming from

204
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:25,019
p3 you still rely on BGP yeah huh so

205
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,230
couple of comments on the multi helper P

206
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:31,240
sorry

207
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:35,500
Himanshu from Siena so yeah I think that

208
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,269
the problem scope is it does exist

209
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,170
because if you are relying on the

210
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:43,990
withdrawal after yes route type 4 it

211
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:46,839
will take some time for the bill to kick

212
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,330
on the DF election and all that

213
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:55,210
so if you have a BFD on what I have are

214
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:58,210
pbft it can expedite that election with

215
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:59,920
respect to x BFD you always have to keep

216
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,140
a little bit longer time because you

217
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,240
need to have the IGP he'll like he was

218
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:06,699
saying if you have an intermediate nodes

219
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,270
that fail your multi-hop IPP every would

220
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:13,870
fail as well but that's always the

221
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:17,620
hierarchical fault timers that you have

222
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:20,530
to keep you how to let the IP FRR and

223
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:25,120
other stuff to to take care of that I

224
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:27,880
think the second point I have is instead

225
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:32,130
of doing this LSP ping to bootstrap the

226
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:35,890
BFD maybe yes route type 4 is a way to

227
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:39,490
pass the discriminator between this

228
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:41,560
multi her peers so that you can then the

229
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,870
B do the BFD session or maybe even

230
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:47,410
seamless BFT if you can use those

231
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:50,190
discriminators to instead of doing the

232
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:54,490
explicit unless beeping for bootstrap

233
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:57,790
feu seamless be a fatigue p2r in this

234
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:01,000
figure the PDF must ascend the pure

235
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:04,719
raadhika single SPF de package to detect

236
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:09,190
if the link between p1 and the see he

237
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:11,860
has Knox normal so it depends on the PE

238
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:17,380
to send the periodical right

239
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:19,510
the periodically from the p2 so if p2 is

240
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,550
configured as artists and as a tech

241
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:30,069
eater for example we send the packet or

242
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:33,670
every 60 seconds as takes a long time

243
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:37,120
right so we use the normal PFD station

244
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:45,280
to detect the fader it's looks more fast

245
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:47,940
right yeah from Cisco so I had the same

246
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,560
thought like hooray he just said

247
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,220
conceivably if we have a PFD session

248
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:57,699
between p1 and p3 yin would that help

249
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:01,140
like it's the PFD like you see to p1

250
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:03,550
link goes down then you can convey

251
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:07,359
fact that it went down faster through

252
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:10,178
BFD through to p3 and thereby you would

253
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:12,399
get some speed up as compared to the

254
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:15,400
mass Phaedra so that they're outside p3

255
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,089
will be switched to p2 faster would that

256
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:21,760
work yeah pay for yourself if the

257
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:24,819
session is set between as beautifu

258
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,020
treating p1 and p2 so but as the

259
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:29,350
monitors

260
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:32,799
tyrita is the link between p1 c so with

261
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:34,809
allegra to detect as a fader fast as

262
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,030
soon as fast no no I understand what I'm

263
00:17:34,809 --> 00:17:41,260
saying is if you were to have a BF

264
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:43,928
decision between P 1 and P P 3 if you

265
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,540
have already a PFD station for it yes

266
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,640
and the patio discriminator may be

267
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:52,750
different because we know that we know

268
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,510
the subtly defining European are

269
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,910
speaking to starter the PFD station

270
00:17:55,510 --> 00:18:00,100
under the discriminator will be

271
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:03,280
different from the other PFD station

272
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:05,199
between p1 and p2 so it means different

273
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
things yeah

274
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,870
so you will not confuse with it yeah I

275
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:14,918
can talk to your flame oh thank you

276
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:18,549
a cylinder Cisco Systems you could use

277
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,620
both the I GPS advertise III I don't

278
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,299
know what you said about seamless PFD

279
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:26,110
but that seems like it is a better

280
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:29,860
solution and both the I GPS include the

281
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:38,020
add address an advertisement of the

282
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:43,240
discriminator maybe Marissa T there is a

283
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:46,660
problem with the seamless BFD because

284
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:49,809
seamless BFD you don't have expectation

285
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:52,240
of the guaranteed failure time you are

286
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:54,340
dependent on the round-trip time and

287
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,410
because if round-trip time will be

288
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:58,649
changing that might affect your

289
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:02,169
basically you will get false negative

290
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:04,480
okay so the positive about methods that

291
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:06,970
asynchronously independent set theoretic

292
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,440
messages you can have a guarantee of

293
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,440
when you do failure detection

294
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:27,270
and you recommend so from a working a

295
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:30,000
point of view I would tend to encourage

296
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,200
you also to look at vdf recovery graph

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,270
to see if it's enough oh if we need

298
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:39,270
something else to add but we need to

299
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:43,670
find a common solution and not multiple

300
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:43,670
solution to address on this problem

301
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:17,350
and so the second foreign fishing is for

302
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:22,080
as a v6 inter-domain solution Philippian

303
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:26,290
service we have closer sofa under Greg

304
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,889
so let me see this figure it's our

305
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:33,280
normal situation in the future Network

306
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:38,650
because we have not used as a v6 in our

307
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:42,370
network now but it may be not a longer

308
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:47,800
hang and made him more time for it so if

309
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:51,939
we deploy different as functions in

310
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:56,230
different areas it's a normal situation

311
00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,940
king should work because such as in the

312
00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:04,470
s1 which deploy is our v6 on me and we

313
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:08,260
deploy some pureeing as true only and

314
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:11,920
for example miss suppose that the SPR

315
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:16,150
one can support Assad mini six and as I

316
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:21,070
am curious but as we are true only

317
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:24,660
support SMP RS and how to's teaching the

318
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:30,939
true Network at us to work together so

319
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:34,000
we find that if we hence we can sir

320
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:38,320
salute give the solution for it from the

321
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,600
signaling controlling and we can get as

322
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,439
a result from the day happening so let's

323
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,649
see the second learning controlling so

324
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:53,230
we support such it would be like to the

325
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:57,580
word highs root from c1 to c2 so when

326
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:01,990
the root received by SPR one is a BR one

327
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:04,899
shooter assigned and special MPR's label

328
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:06,790
for the prefix received from P we know

329
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:10,030
that's the other word highest function

330
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:14,710
for procedure for it right so and the

331
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:16,730
one SPR to received the the special

332
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:20,210
label and it well may

333
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:24,109
treaty is the normal and advertising the

334
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:28,749
English to network and so as well and

335
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:33,739
the say to will receive the packet

336
00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:36,859
disable the route so and for the for the

337
00:22:33,739 --> 00:22:42,619
other direction we know that F we'd like

338
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:47,320
to stand as a route from c2 to c1 so as

339
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:52,100
we are true we are science label from

340
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:57,369
sorry SP are to be assigned as a normal

341
00:22:52,100 --> 00:23:01,428
able but SP are one will Edward has this

342
00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:06,049
prefix to be one and associated with the

343
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:08,690
special asabi success ID so once the

344
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:14,389
contra playing finishes advertisement

345
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:17,899
that cesar data bring so if I pick it

346
00:23:14,389 --> 00:23:21,889
data flow packet received from SP are

347
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:28,479
one from p1 the direction from p1

348
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:32,869
direction so SPI one will recognize

349
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:37,940
special si T so and Maori colonized it

350
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:41,959
should be replaced with the book with an

351
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:46,730
level label stack and forward it to SBR

352
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:50,239
to and in the reverse direction the one

353
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:54,320
s PR one received the Emperor's packet

354
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:57,679
we know that it means the packet is

355
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,859
encapsulated with some top level which

356
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:04,039
is assigned by SP or one spra will

357
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:09,350
recognize the special table and then

358
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:13,669
replace me know or we should call it we

359
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:14,539
remove the label and encapsulator the

360
00:24:13,669 --> 00:24:18,169
packet irwins

361
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:22,039
ipv6 and maybe they are something s are

362
00:24:18,169 --> 00:24:26,179
etching it so and then s BR one still is

363
00:24:22,039 --> 00:24:28,999
a packet to s1 so then in the true

364
00:24:26,179 --> 00:24:30,230
direction the flow will be only be

365
00:24:28,999 --> 00:24:33,200
treated

366
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:36,650
SP r1 and the no hanging or the errors

367
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,340
such as p1 s PR one should know this

368
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,720
function because this function has local

369
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:46,820
significance and butter the flow will be

370
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:49,910
forwarded and normal and received as a

371
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:52,700
destination so it will it can reserve

372
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:57,320
the the highbreed networking

373
00:24:52,700 --> 00:25:01,190
interconnection issue so so that's all

374
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:09,770
the how I wanted to say today and any

375
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:11,090
comments of a Nokia is this intended to

376
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:17,000
be also used for

377
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:18,949
evpn yes cows abuse of individual seems

378
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,380
to imply that the procedures are the

379
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:25,220
same but in evpn there are some

380
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:28,580
specifics like the anything we use the

381
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:32,090
argument part of the the said for things

382
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:34,490
like e3 or four years is filtering so

383
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:36,949
you know I think you should include

384
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:41,900
procedures for that so we should

385
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:46,520
consider of that yeah hi Kate

386
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,480
ontological Cisco there is a draft draft

387
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:51,020
Agarwal

388
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:53,690
spring s our MPs are MPLS and SRB six

389
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:57,400
interworking which you reference in your

390
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:57,400
document as well yes

391
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:03,290
not just the interworking between sr

392
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,500
MPLS and a service 6 but also in across

393
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:09,139
islands in a different format so could

394
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,840
move clarify what smooth being added or

395
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:15,050
specified here from the procedures yes

396
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,510
we saw that draft and we think that that

397
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:19,940
doctor gives the general consideration

398
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:22,810
officer have reason that working or

399
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:25,880
working right so when this job is

400
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:31,370
inverted hill yeah yeah we specify the

401
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:33,590
detail of this issue so i think it has a

402
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:36,729
relationship between the two drops I

403
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:41,060
don't know we focus on most it helps

404
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:45,370
yeah ok sure I think we can take this

405
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:45,370
offline but ok ok thank you

406
00:26:50,230 --> 00:27:09,290
who's the next thank you good afternoon

407
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:12,770
my name is Jorge Robin nokia this draft

408
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:14,450
talks about some very small extensions

409
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,230
for split horizon filtering and

410
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:18,770
multihoming

411
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:22,250
if you can multihoming the what do we

412
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:25,670
mean by a spree horizon filtering well

413
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:28,580
in evpn multihoming split horizon is

414
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:30,290
basically the mechanism that is avoiding

415
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:32,810
loops when you have all active

416
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,139
multihoming for instance if you look at

417
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:39,790
the left hand side of this slide and you

418
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:42,500
have an all active Ethernet segment

419
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:46,129
connected to c2 when you send BOM

420
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:49,790
traffic from C to a for instance to p1

421
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:54,200
and p1 floods that the traffic goes back

422
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:55,970
to p2 to if p2 is the DF you know we

423
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,780
want to really avoid the traffic coming

424
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,150
back to the C so the mechanisms to avoid

425
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,940
that coming back to the sea and to avoid

426
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:07,160
the loop is what we know as the split

427
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,070
horizon mechanism there are two ways of

428
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:13,910
doing it the first one is the ESI

429
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:16,460
label-based split horizon type and the

430
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:19,310
second one is what we know as local bias

431
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:23,000
split horizon type so the first one

432
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:26,179
relies on an ESI label in other words 1

433
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,710
c2 again since traffic BOM traffic to p1

434
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:32,270
p1 needs to insert and an ESI label at

435
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,150
the bottom of the stack that is

436
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:38,180
identifying the source ESI so when that

437
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:40,100
gets to p2 based on that ESI level p2

438
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:44,480
can filter and avoid sending the traffic

439
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:47,870
back to c2 now when you deal with IP

440
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,200
tunnels where there are no labels like

441
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:54,320
for instance we expand or MD GRE there

442
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,810
is no labels that you can insert in the

443
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,620
data path so in that case we use this

444
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:02,570
local biased

445
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:05,570
local bias basically refers to the fact

446
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,260
that we in the same situation when c2

447
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:11,539
sends bound traffic to p1 p1 will

448
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:15,350
forward locally to all the local

449
00:29:11,539 --> 00:29:17,960
Ethernet segments and when p1 sends the

450
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,120
bump travel to p2 p2 will actually

451
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,730
filter traffic to all the local segments

452
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,428
that are shared with p1 that is local

453
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,960
bias now in the traffic we have a table

454
00:29:25,429 --> 00:29:31,399
with all the different encapsulation

455
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:34,429
supported by a VPN the default split

456
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:38,479
horizon type and whether they support

457
00:29:34,429 --> 00:29:39,890
you know either type and in some cases

458
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,520
there is there is no choice there is

459
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:43,640
only one one way of doing it but in some

460
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,500
encapsulations

461
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:48,799
you actually have the choice because you

462
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:53,120
can support both types so the idea with

463
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,600
this draft is to add some very very

464
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,969
small extension and in this way

465
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,918
basically we signal the split horizon

466
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:03,770
type that we want to use and give an

467
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:06,440
Ethernet segment the idea is that all

468
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,510
the keys in the same Ethernet segment

469
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:11,539
will agree on the same split horizon

470
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:15,799
type and if they disagree they fall back

471
00:30:11,539 --> 00:30:19,850
to the default type and what have we

472
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,760
added in the new revision in a02 we

473
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:26,779
added as Harvey six support so in SRV

474
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:28,870
six so if you look at the SR basic

475
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:31,370
services draft the speak horizon

476
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:34,250
filtering is based based on something

477
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:38,719
equivalent to the si label that goes

478
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:40,850
into the argument of the CID the idea is

479
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,529
that obviously it's an IP encapsulation

480
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,600
so you have the choice of using local

481
00:30:42,529 --> 00:30:46,190
wires and in some cases you may want to

482
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,010
do that because you want to save some

483
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:51,289
you know extra look-up on the argument

484
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:54,620
of the set so that's why we added this

485
00:30:51,289 --> 00:30:57,110
we also some fixed some some small

486
00:30:54,620 --> 00:31:00,379
things and typos and basically what we

487
00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:02,539
want next is to request a working group

488
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,970
adoption of course to get more feedback

489
00:31:02,539 --> 00:31:06,559
and uh but yeah we we think the the

490
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:12,190
document is ready for working group

491
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,190
adoption any question

492
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:44,529
who has read the document okay thank you

493
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:47,919
thanks good afternoon

494
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:50,880
I'll be presenting a a draft covering

495
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:56,940
EVP and vws seamless integration with

496
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,940
legacy VP WS on behalf of my co-authors

497
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,260
so just to give some some background

498
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,260
information

499
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:12,399
RFC 85/60 addresses the seamless

500
00:32:07,779 --> 00:32:15,519
integration of e VPN with VP LS it has

501
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:17,590
some some exclusions some gaps so it

502
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,750
does not apply obviously by definition

503
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:26,379
to VP WS and explicitly in that draft in

504
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:30,010
in section 2.6 the the interoperability

505
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:35,049
of VPLS with with a VPN for all active

506
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:36,549
load balancing mode is is excluded so a

507
00:32:35,049 --> 00:32:40,929
second item of background there is

508
00:32:36,549 --> 00:32:42,879
another draft it's an ID addressing

509
00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:47,769
essentially the EVP integration with

510
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,570
VPLS in all active mode so this is so

511
00:32:47,769 --> 00:32:52,330
that draft was written specifically to

512
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:54,309
address the gap the all active gap that

513
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:57,519
I listed in the second bullet of 85/60

514
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,100
and saw the remains essentially they

515
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,820
still the the first bullet the gap for

516
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:06,969
VP WS and the goal of this draft is to

517
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:12,120
address sorry that EVP and VB WS

518
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:12,120
interrupt for both LD P and B to be ad

519
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,479
so the

520
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,928
Lucian representing we define

521
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,169
essentially a hybrid P so this is a P

522
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:30,720
that supports both evpn and legacy VP WS

523
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:32,190
and we defined then also a legacy P so

524
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,650
these are PS that we are trying to

525
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:42,480
interoperate with that's suppose that

526
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:43,830
that support only l DP and bgp ad so as

527
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,940
part of this solution essentially the

528
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:49,439
hybrid P so this is the EBP incapable p

529
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:54,480
advertises in in a discovery phase

530
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:57,809
advertises both all EVP and routes and l

531
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,830
DP and bgp ad and point information that

532
00:33:57,809 --> 00:34:03,750
it knows of locally and then obviously

533
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,678
this hybrid PE is going to be capable to

534
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,850
receive and process the remote

535
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,780
information discovered from all of the

536
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:15,359
remote legacy bees obviously also the

537
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:18,330
evpn bees

538
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,340
so the idea behind this this draft is

539
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,739
that all of the logic for seamless

540
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,679
integration Reds that resides on the

541
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:28,739
hybrid bees so the underlying principle

542
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:32,429
is that the legacy P so basically in in

543
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:36,359
blue here requires essentially as close

544
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:37,710
to zero touch as possible and we define

545
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,359
in this draft then basically very

546
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:44,760
similar 285 285 60 a preference of VP WS

547
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:48,600
over the legacy servers via del DP or

548
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:50,340
BGP ad for bringing up sessions and as

549
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:52,980
part of that then the legacy pseudo are

550
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,899
that matches this new EVP in vpw a

551
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:04,680
segment is kept admin down or

552
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:07,259
operationally down so how does the

553
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,899
migration from legacy - EVP and VP WS or

554
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:11,670
or even FX e happen

555
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,460
essentially it's it's it's as

556
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,609
straightforward as you would expect from

557
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:20,400
a starting point of two legacy or two PS

558
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:25,470
that support only legacy pseudo R's LDPR

559
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:29,200
bgp ad we then go to a to a p1 that now

560
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:31,990
is a hybrid P supports DB pn DVP anafi

561
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,020
and as such when you configure a VPN on

562
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,598
this legacy I'm sorry on this hybrid be

563
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:40,420
the in addition to the LDP or BGP ad

564
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,329
routes then the VPN routes are going to

565
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:46,890
be advertised and that's that's

566
00:35:43,329 --> 00:35:46,890
represented here essentially in green

567
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:54,700
after that as part of the basically the

568
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:59,109
final stage of the migration the the p2

569
00:35:54,700 --> 00:36:02,649
then enables the DVP anafi and since

570
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:04,750
evpn is preferred in this case the

571
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:07,420
legacy pseudo are in blue is is brought

572
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:10,329
and min down which will result in either

573
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:12,630
label withdraws or sudo i status down or

574
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,950
status TLV I think in bgp ID and

575
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:22,960
essentially now the the unconfigured the

576
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:25,720
legacy pseudo are as possible as far as

577
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,030
multihoming goes so i won't go into the

578
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,618
draft actually address is the full set

579
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:35,109
of a VP VPN load balancing single active

580
00:36:32,619 --> 00:36:36,430
port active and all active I think

581
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,560
really the only interesting use case

582
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:40,750
that I'm going to present today is all

583
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,250
active because single active and port

584
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:46,180
active are actually quite

585
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:50,890
straightforward so for port offer for

586
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:53,319
all active sorry for a p3 running sudo a

587
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,970
redundancy so represented here when in

588
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:59,290
the the solid blue line and the dotted

589
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:02,618
blue line pe2 can actually leverage the

590
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:05,800
existence of this blue dotted line to

591
00:37:02,619 --> 00:37:07,180
forward traffic in this in the left to

592
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,220
right direction so from from the sea

593
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:14,589
into the core the only caveat is

594
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:17,859
obviously the reverse path traffic so p3

595
00:37:14,589 --> 00:37:22,230
being a legacy B will only be sending

596
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:22,230
the traffic over the active sued or

597
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,920
there

598
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:30,440
one small caveat or one small gotcha to

599
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,920
the scheme the scheme I I described

600
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,050
before

601
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:35,810
so if you look back essentially on the

602
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:37,580
right side at p3 there's a red flow

603
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:41,839
that's arriving on the back up pseudo

604
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:44,089
are at the e3 if p3 doesn't actually

605
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,560
support this position on that back up

606
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:49,430
sewer and we have seen inflamation

607
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:53,950
implementations that do not this draft

608
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:57,919
then presents essentially a scheme to to

609
00:37:53,950 --> 00:38:00,500
to mimic that asymmetric forwarding from

610
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,950
the previous slide by essentially having

611
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:05,810
PE one whose EVP unaware and has an

612
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:10,848
active pseudo are in an active session 2

613
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:12,920
PE 3 have PE 1 share what we called

614
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:16,220
essentially an alias to our label over

615
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:20,510
to PE 2 to share the session between p1

616
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:23,930
and p3 with be doing this in in in such

617
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:27,070
a way that p2 can then use the p3 next

618
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:34,580
stop and the p3 label for sending the

619
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:37,000
the left or right c2 core traffic and

620
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,000
that's it

621
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:48,960
Corcoran nokia yeah so it would be good

622
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,810
to have some feedback on the mailing

623
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,090
list about these two solutions for for

624
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,670
me I also know at least two

625
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:59,610
implementations of different vendors

626
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,240
that support you know receiving traffic

627
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:06,110
on the on the back absolute wire label

628
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:09,629
so you know obviously if there are some

629
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:12,480
implementations and and you know there

630
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:14,370
are some standard documents that say

631
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,010
that you shouldn't do that for some

632
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:18,960
reason obviously we need to look at the

633
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:21,780
other solution but if this is a

634
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,540
perfectly good solution and as you know

635
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:26,760
widely supported actually solves they

636
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,040
they they issue in a very elegant way

637
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:31,650
and and and also avoid some of the

638
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,900
issues of the other solution in the

639
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:35,580
other solution you actually get traffic

640
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:37,470
from two different nodes with the same

641
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:40,710
label and that can actually bring up a

642
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:43,709
lot of potential issues and besides you

643
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:45,960
you know you got things like stats are

644
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,600
curious and stuff like that when it to

645
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,700
the wire basis and all that is is broken

646
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:55,160
with that model so it will be nice to

647
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:55,160
get feedback on their mailing list sure

648
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:05,509
this is from juniper I have the same

649
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,880
comments regarding support ps3 active

650
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:11,370
backup like I using a racing label for

651
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,580
point-to-point pseudo I I do not think

652
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,529
it's protocol limitation to have a two

653
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:22,230
different pseudo wire from PS Reis

654
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:25,650
perspective to using post p1 and p2 if

655
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:29,970
you want to do the active stem by IP one

656
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:32,430
and a p2 so I feel like we probably

657
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,980
shouldn't burden with just any the

658
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:39,060
protocol to add aliasing label for

659
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:45,060
point-to-point a pseudo I so similar yes

660
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:48,779
thanks I ball from Poway I have a

661
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:51,509
comment that should we consider whether

662
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,910
it was about the money home in PE is

663
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:56,819
different

664
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:59,670
dancing and another is a hybrid is what

665
00:40:56,819 --> 00:41:03,839
sorry why is the one money humming peo

666
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:07,950
why is ligase legacy Diablo and another

667
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,469
is a hybrid - what do you mean p1 hybrid

668
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:14,399
and PE - legacy yeah we do not address

669
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:16,739
that okay I think neither can your new

670
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,640
carburetor whether we should consider it

671
00:41:16,739 --> 00:41:26,999
or not okay

672
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:29,749
okay I'll take a note thank you when you

673
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:29,749
should be the next one

674
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:52,670
hello my name is when my name is when

675
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:58,010
I'm from a juniper today I'm gonna talk

676
00:41:52,670 --> 00:42:01,270
about evpn and BGP based layer 2 VPNs

677
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:06,950
seamless integration they have on a casa

678
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:09,350
on the list here so agenda for this

679
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:11,689
presentation is the first week gonna

680
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:14,930
cover in seamless integration for

681
00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:18,590
point-to-point repeatable Yasuda y PT

682
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:22,190
EVP MVP WS and a BGP based pseudo wire

683
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:24,280
and I'm gonna cover how to support

684
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,620
single home the seamless integration

685
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:30,790
port active single active and all active

686
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:35,589
and the second agenda is talk about

687
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:37,850
extension today's existing EVP NV PWS

688
00:42:35,590 --> 00:42:41,330
multi-point to multi-point seamless

689
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:43,940
integration is extension current ifc

690
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:47,990
does not cover the hybrid or the

691
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,770
composite PE see him doing active active

692
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:54,649
multi-homing so this is just extension

693
00:42:51,770 --> 00:43:00,470
to the existing ifc for active active

694
00:42:54,650 --> 00:43:02,780
support so base the layer 2 VPN support

695
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,390
different type of payroll for when we

696
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,390
talk about seamless a integration it is

697
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:11,540
for the payroll is Ethernet frame so

698
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:17,319
just want to make it this career it's

699
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:22,870
just for Ethernet pay Road and so I'm

700
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:26,360
here you see lack CPE layer 2 VPN and as

701
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,640
the blue and I called a composite PE

702
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:33,940
basically they support both the control

703
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:38,540
and signaling for bgp based layer 2 VPN

704
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:40,970
and also a VPN vp that race layer 2 VPN

705
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:46,190
so the key to do the seamless

706
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:50,839
integration is three things if if we

707
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:52,850
have legacy repeatable is running

708
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:55,910
doing the seamless integration there's

709
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:58,730
no update of after can definitely cannot

710
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:01,819
update lacks a piece running in the

711
00:43:58,730 --> 00:44:05,410
system and but a foot a composite PE

712
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:09,640
they were run both control pram

713
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:12,470
signaling process whether it is a

714
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:15,740
support pack or compatibility they run

715
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:17,930
BGP based the layer 2 VPN control branch

716
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:21,229
ignoring and also at the same time

717
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:23,149
running EVP MVP W based Signori no

718
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:25,820
change to the control pram for the core

719
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:28,790
on both sides a hybrid P need to do the

720
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:32,240
posts and so it's always backward

721
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:34,810
compatibility if there is that legacy PE

722
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:39,379
we were established pseudo wire with

723
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:41,870
traditional repeatable s control and

724
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:46,610
data prem procedures if the other side

725
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:50,240
and running evpn so evpn only take a

726
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:54,110
high preference the pseudo YB p WS will

727
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,540
be established with IEP MVP the Ria's so

728
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:59,180
basically it just three point never

729
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:02,440
upgrade no appropriate for relax a PE

730
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:06,190
and composite our hybrid P whatever

731
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,620
always do both control and signaling and

732
00:45:06,190 --> 00:45:17,590
if both support its a VPN take

733
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:21,170
preference so that's and so this is a

734
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:23,210
explain like in the situation in the

735
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:25,520
what is done in the control pram what is

736
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:28,250
done in the forwarding plan forwarding

737
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,230
plan it's always the same but control

738
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:37,280
plan we need to run those protocol in

739
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:41,450
the composite P so for support stimulus

740
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,990
a integration under composite piece we

741
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:48,589
do support active standby all port

742
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:50,660
active basically what's the difference

743
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,660
between active stem bar and a port

744
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:57,500
active is is how C is connected to the

745
00:45:53,660 --> 00:46:00,140
motor home the P input active they are

746
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:04,630
using the log interface so this is a

747
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:07,750
help customer the service provider

748
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:10,570
if they are doing the migration one

749
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:14,770
natural Ethernet at a time so they

750
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:18,910
migrate one region at a time but after

751
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:20,890
they you know cross one side when it has

752
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:23,740
not upgraded they are doing the

753
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:26,230
tradition of the PWS but when the first

754
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:28,899
side is my gray they can just upgrade a

755
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:31,840
Cee to do the luck they do not have to

756
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:35,140
do a second migration to upgrade to see

757
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:38,680
from a separate physical interface to a

758
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:42,720
log interface so this is a shortened a

759
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:46,839
migration cycle right so this helps and

760
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,779
it can also go directly to the active

761
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:53,830
active but in the active active case

762
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:56,770
since the Lex API layer to be PNP they

763
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:59,440
do not know how to do active active they

764
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:02,830
only support active stem by so traffic

765
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,620
from Malak say PE to the composite PE is

766
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:09,040
only it will only choose the daf-2 for

767
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:14,460
the traffic my sister composite PE they

768
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:17,259
do active active so we can have a

769
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:19,690
symmetric forwarding going on here so

770
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:23,620
it's showing here but it's possible it's

771
00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:26,140
just also saved one face of migration

772
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:32,200
the composite PE can go directly to

773
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:36,250
active active so as a topic and a

774
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,580
covering this talk is active active

775
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:43,030
support for point multi point pseudo Y

776
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:46,029
and so the challenge for that as

777
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:48,130
traditionally is V POS only can support

778
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,860
active standby there's a couple

779
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,700
challenge for their V POS does not not

780
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,380
like the evpn they have a label

781
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:58,509
indicators to the bomb traffic they do

782
00:47:56,380 --> 00:48:04,120
not support spree horizon right so

783
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:07,600
that's trouble for from point of thumb

784
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:10,180
traffic perspective but with seamless

785
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:13,410
integration we do have advantage because

786
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:17,589
the composite PE they are running a VPN

787
00:48:13,410 --> 00:48:18,339
okay they understand a VPN they do EVP

788
00:48:17,590 --> 00:48:21,910
em

789
00:48:18,339 --> 00:48:24,729
procedures so this helped us overcome

790
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:27,308
the limitation in the VPLS cannot do

791
00:48:24,729 --> 00:48:29,348
bomb traffic like a support bomb like

792
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:32,469
how to avoid a looping or duplicate

793
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:36,189
traffic so the composite PE they can

794
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:40,150
using the e BPM process sings in the in

795
00:48:36,189 --> 00:48:43,149
a hybrid or compose a PE they share the

796
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:46,329
same Mack forwarding table so they can

797
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:49,359
use in the evpn procedure the ESI label

798
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:52,150
everything like it just no change no

799
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:56,170
change is the existing evpn process to

800
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:59,170
overcome the VPS limitation one is a

801
00:48:56,170 --> 00:49:02,799
layer 2 looping for BOM traffic the

802
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:06,219
second is duplicate a bum bum traffic so

803
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:08,410
so this problem is solvable Bom

804
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:10,599
so what else is the challenge you to

805
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:13,839
learn active active while the other side

806
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:18,009
is the VP OS is that Mac flip-flopping

807
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:21,099
because C is connected a composite PE

808
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:23,499
using the lag interface so depending on

809
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:25,959
a hash algorithm the same math can be

810
00:49:23,499 --> 00:49:26,769
show learn it up and learn on ap1 and

811
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:30,098
ap2

812
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:32,859
so because PE can learn the same Mac on

813
00:49:30,099 --> 00:49:35,709
both pseudo I so this is a another

814
00:49:32,859 --> 00:49:41,049
challenge to support a VPS active-active

815
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:44,739
but there is a one very common procedure

816
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:48,699
is called a pseudo eye Mac painting with

817
00:49:44,739 --> 00:49:50,829
that we can ping this Mac even though in

818
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:53,259
the course data plan and learning for VP

819
00:49:50,829 --> 00:49:56,709
OS we can paint a Mac to one particular

820
00:49:53,259 --> 00:49:59,130
PE whichever it comes first and at that

821
00:49:56,709 --> 00:50:02,828
particular Mac will be ours ping er to

822
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:07,059
to one of the P let's say its first is

823
00:50:02,829 --> 00:50:11,019
coming from p2 so VPS were sink c1 smack

824
00:50:07,059 --> 00:50:13,809
is always accessed by the p p2 even

825
00:50:11,019 --> 00:50:16,178
though later he'll under Mac from PU and

826
00:50:13,809 --> 00:50:17,979
it will do to the Mac pinning on the

827
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:20,199
pseudo while feature they will never

828
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:23,558
have a flip-flop or Mac painting going

829
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:26,979
back and of course of course it will in

830
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:30,160
order to do this let's say p2 is an and

831
00:50:26,979 --> 00:50:32,009
EF R I supposed today so how we can make

832
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:37,200
sure we can afford a try

833
00:50:32,010 --> 00:50:39,480
to the PT so this is a also existing

834
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,259
control plane protocol help us solve the

835
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:46,080
problem because we can advertise vit P

836
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,550
was the to this to PE even though they

837
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,890
might have home to see one

838
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:52,040
they can't advertise to different VI D

839
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:56,339
for the instance VAD

840
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:59,520
so this way both p1 and ap2 can extract

841
00:50:56,340 --> 00:51:02,280
the unica has no unique as traffic so

842
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,150
depending on what you have a P V PSP is

843
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:09,060
how they learned a Mac so the traffic

844
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:12,360
for both no unicast and a bomb traffic

845
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,330
are symmetric in this and advantage for

846
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:18,600
that it does not need any folding plan

847
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:23,520
change basically we pretty much you can

848
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:27,870
use existing feature for VPS and the

849
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:31,770
seamless EVP MVPs integration so as a

850
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:35,220
last one is what happen if that node

851
00:51:31,770 --> 00:51:39,840
failure access link FIRREA we we need to

852
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:44,339
flush the VPS PE to have it real and the

853
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:47,280
same see when smack so this is a trigger

854
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:51,480
against through Mac flush mechanism like

855
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:55,320
for VPS we have this forwarding bit when

856
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,780
it changed from 1 to 0 signal to the VPS

857
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:00,330
PE they were automatically refresh the

858
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:04,410
Mac so they can relearn the Mac say

859
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:08,340
before I learn from p2 if c1 Peters link

860
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:13,259
fail they can relearned Mac from PE 1 so

861
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:15,840
this overcome it's a it's just used a

862
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,840
control pram process to its advantage

863
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:24,180
for VPS P and a support active active

864
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:28,080
for VPS P so that's all so like I think

865
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:30,270
the VP WS point a point as I mentioned

866
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:34,190
in the beginning it's the three things

867
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:37,140
for Bako compability we can now upgrade

868
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:40,830
lakh CPE we need to do tobacco

869
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:43,680
comparability and EVP MVP WS always take

870
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:45,600
precedence so this three principle can

871
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,140
be applied to most of the tree

872
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:54,270
you know point-to-point pseudo wire -

873
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:57,509
EVP MVP WS seamless integration and so

874
00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:01,230
like to seek comments and if it's needed

875
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:03,390
or we can even though this right now the

876
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:08,220
draft first version only cover the layer

877
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:09,750
- based v pw s - EVP MVP double seamless

878
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,160
integration but the principle is the

879
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:16,560
same for point-to-point yeah I went look

880
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:18,270
on the other Cisco so I do have some

881
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:21,810
comments on this draft but I'm gonna

882
00:53:18,270 --> 00:53:23,430
keep it short here - for comments so the

883
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:27,029
first is a preface to the chairs in the

884
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:29,450
working group so we are aware there's

885
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:32,250
complimentary drafts trying to address

886
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:34,529
essentially a very similar problem and

887
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:38,970
we have discussed the need for unified

888
00:53:34,530 --> 00:53:42,090
approach so when this draft

889
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:46,680
it addresses basically only BGP ad not

890
00:53:42,090 --> 00:53:48,720
LD P so and I think we've spoken out

891
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:50,310
about this before I think it's you've

892
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,089
mentioned it's it's specifically meant

893
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,680
to be BGP - BGP basically but didn't be

894
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:57,630
like the approach of ignoring LDP I

895
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:02,190
think makes it a little bit incomplete

896
00:53:57,630 --> 00:54:07,770
in terms of interrupts so my second

897
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:09,660
point is I won't address Vee pls pls all

898
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:13,110
active in this draft

899
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:15,750
I would so in my mind keeping VP WS and

900
00:54:13,110 --> 00:54:21,900
VPLS separate seems like a better a

901
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:23,550
better classification so as as a side

902
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:28,590
note the Mac the Mac pinning you

903
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:31,320
described for VPLS that's that's

904
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:34,110
actually not part of 6624 and it's not

905
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:39,480
as prevalent or as standard as as you

906
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:42,030
would imagine so I think if if the VPLS

907
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,870
stays in this in in this draft or a

908
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:47,190
common draft I think we'd have to add

909
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:51,529
essentially support for the Mac pinning

910
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:55,020
into a requirement of the VPLS solution

911
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:56,490
because I think that no the Mac pinning

912
00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:00,029
makes it a little bit inoperable for

913
00:54:56,490 --> 00:55:02,008
some vendors and lastly

914
00:55:00,029 --> 00:55:05,309
in the draft itself so you don't haven't

915
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:07,109
really spoken to it here but in the

916
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:08,490
draft itself you mentioned and we've

917
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:12,089
discussed about this one I'm not too

918
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:14,939
worried in order to find a match for

919
00:55:12,089 --> 00:55:15,990
interrupt you discuss how the DVD and a

920
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:20,700
CID on the Evi

921
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:23,279
route on e VI a deer out and the BGP adv

922
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:26,339
Eid need to match in order to set up

923
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:31,410
that that interrupts that's not true

924
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:35,970
because as I said mica for combos appear

925
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:38,819
they are just execute BGP based control

926
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:41,730
branch signaling and also EVP MVP

927
00:55:38,819 --> 00:55:45,660
tabrets as controller and Signori they

928
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:49,109
are totally independent this is as I as

929
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:51,359
I show up in this diagram here at the

930
00:55:49,109 --> 00:55:53,339
little circle here this is the control

931
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,348
plan they're just totally independent

932
00:55:53,339 --> 00:55:58,470
they just advertise their own control

933
00:55:55,349 --> 00:56:00,599
friend signaling and how its it is

934
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:04,200
configure whether they use the same VI

935
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:06,269
ID or BPW instanceid it's really the

936
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:08,210
provisioning it's how you provision this

937
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:11,339
it's the implementation dependent

938
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:14,609
whether you want to do but they are two

939
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:17,640
separate control plan entities before

940
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:20,098
the hybrid composite PE only in the 14th

941
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,470
there is only one they have to either go

942
00:56:20,099 --> 00:56:25,650
with the traditional way to establish

943
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:32,519
the pseudo ID basically in really what's

944
00:56:25,650 --> 00:56:36,509
matter is the label right yes yes yes if

945
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:38,939
it's I can edit the text if if it is a

946
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:41,220
confusing I did not make clear in the

947
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:43,309
text but the intention is it's very

948
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:45,899
implementation dependent and for the

949
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:48,920
provisioning model you use yeah I don't

950
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:52,410
know in emphasis on one day as a

951
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,210
regarding the VP WS yeah I agree there

952
00:56:52,410 --> 00:56:56,160
is a different way to do it there is a

953
00:56:54,210 --> 00:57:00,450
forwarding way there is a control pram

954
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:03,509
way as we presented here is I think it's

955
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:06,359
a lightweight it it's another way to

956
00:57:03,509 --> 00:57:09,269
achieve seamless integration with EBP

957
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:11,220
MVP the reverse active active I agree

958
00:57:09,269 --> 00:57:13,299
there is a different way to achieve that

959
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:16,509
so

960
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:19,690
hybl from Holly now for this page it

961
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:23,200
says that we may use a Mac pinning to

962
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:26,080
avoid a flip-flop yeah so I think having

963
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:28,180
me consider other you may probably may

964
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,370
have a better method to resolve it

965
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,040
I don't know but I think of having me

966
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:40,930
discuss about this but you should

967
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:43,240
discuss offline this as an option yeah

968
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,100
and we think it's lightweight it because

969
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,870
there's not involved forwarding change

970
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,630
yeah

971
00:57:45,870 --> 00:57:52,259
another common in Dutch for some general

972
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:56,050
the with hockey if I have it may use the

973
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:58,420
PWB down see before so we think I think

974
00:57:56,050 --> 00:58:01,900
that's a family meal awesome we miss

975
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:04,900
Carson arrow that's why we TLP use a

976
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:06,490
pure redundancy how what's the about of

977
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:09,930
the chapel kinda like on your plan I

978
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:09,930
didn't get this point

979
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:21,370
javelin say for some summoners there are

980
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:25,810
several there are we happy have a user

981
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:36,190
she have you dance it before yeah so the

982
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:37,150
water don't say so I think we consider

983
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:43,090
that's how

984
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:46,800
what's up out of this I assume seamless

985
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:49,180
VPS integration the existing IFC covers

986
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:52,180
active stem but that's why I did not

987
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,399
hear this is only in extension to what

988
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,580
it has not covered in the existing I've

989
00:58:54,400 --> 00:59:00,070
see so I did not repeat if VP that we

990
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:03,910
are doing active stem by it should we

991
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:06,220
should support women consider data when

992
00:59:03,910 --> 00:59:09,609
we talk he use a custom bias to the

993
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:12,009
water dancer but why we want to see

994
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:14,620
cider the money home inside yield money

995
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:17,560
all right here how to do I think we may

996
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:20,640
consider that so you mean why we want to

997
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:23,080
support active active yeah because if

998
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:25,450
automatical for the service provider is

999
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,350
to provide active active service right

1000
00:59:25,450 --> 00:59:28,660
so

1001
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:31,060
they can save one migration phase

1002
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:34,330
because otherwise they have to wait

1003
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:36,910
until all the piece in a network to be

1004
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:39,700
upgrade to the hybrid or composite P

1005
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:43,299
then they can support active active here

1006
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:46,660
when you are upgrade p1 and p2 they can

1007
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:50,590
just go right to the active active see

1008
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:53,140
Lac interface and p1 active active when

1009
00:59:50,590 --> 00:59:55,990
they upgrade the VP SP which may be

1010
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:58,629
another natural area they do not need to

1011
00:59:55,990 --> 01:00:01,000
go back to the first Metro to say all

1012
00:59:58,630 --> 01:00:03,930
right now the second metro area also to

1013
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:05,740
evpn let me go back there touch their

1014
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:08,049
configuration and as a qualification

1015
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:09,850
required right so that's the main

1016
01:00:08,050 --> 01:00:12,880
purpose if the ultimate goal is to

1017
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:14,529
support active active could you just

1018
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,600
continue this discussion on the list I

1019
01:00:14,530 --> 01:00:20,230
will just let how I do a very short

1020
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:23,250
comment very very short yeah we can all

1021
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:26,530
flying if you still have questions yeah

1022
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:28,870
yeah I'm very short I just wanted to

1023
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:31,600
highlight that with this Mac pinning

1024
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:34,690
solution you also get a load balancing

1025
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:36,490
on their right to left direction right

1026
01:00:34,690 --> 01:00:39,010
because some if you have multiple max

1027
01:00:36,490 --> 01:00:41,500
behind a c1 some max will be pinned to

1028
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:43,660
one to the wire and other max to the

1029
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:46,960
other to the wire so it's actually a

1030
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:50,680
very simple and efficient solution yes

1031
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:55,120
thank you thank you okay thank you who

1032
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:56,770
has had both of the documents okay I

1033
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:59,109
will really encourage the working group

1034
01:00:56,770 --> 01:01:02,020
to eat both of them because we need to

1035
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:04,630
find a single solution so you need to

1036
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:07,600
find an agreement and I would Ted and I

1037
01:01:04,630 --> 01:01:11,770
think my coaches are agreeing with what

1038
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:12,940
who look on higher said VPLS and the PWS

1039
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:21,390
we can attach them in two different

1040
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:24,130
documents to see what's in your one

1041
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:27,609
there is a third option which is to

1042
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:29,530
write an 85 60 base and basically fill

1043
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:32,830
all the gaps that we have with seamless

1044
01:01:29,530 --> 01:01:34,600
integration including MVP LS and MVP WS

1045
01:01:32,830 --> 01:01:37,990
that's another option I don't have that

1046
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:40,029
so yeah of course that's if we can avoid

1047
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:50,470
up so yeah but we can

1048
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:53,170
discuss offline thank you just coming

1049
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:58,049
back to your point regarding the pure

1050
01:01:53,170 --> 01:02:02,050
VRS integration RFC do you see any

1051
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:05,170
missing point apart from this activity

1052
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:11,010
or any errors that we could have in visa

1053
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:11,010
RFC that could also justify a risky no

1054
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:17,380
no I mean the main thing is selectively

1055
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:21,130
assume main gap and I heard in the past

1056
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:23,410
some of the paragraphs and text can be

1057
01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:26,950
clarified so we could also take the

1058
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:28,750
opportunity to yeah if you can just give

1059
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:31,480
us a full picture of what could be

1060
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:33,340
improved maybe we can justify now a risk

1061
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:35,830
but again I don't have a strong opinion

1062
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:37,450
if if people prefer to have two separate

1063
01:02:35,830 --> 01:02:40,360
documents that's that's okay too

1064
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:42,700
yes so for point a point unlike a

1065
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:45,370
point-to-multipoint they do not have a

1066
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:49,600
concern complicity for dealing with the

1067
01:02:45,370 --> 01:02:52,029
palm traffic looping or duplicate a palm

1068
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,500
traffic for point-to-point service no

1069
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:55,690
matter what type of lacks a

1070
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:58,810
point-to-point service it is it's pretty

1071
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:01,750
much the same you have to support

1072
01:02:58,810 --> 01:03:04,750
backward compatibility and evpn always

1073
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:06,760
take proceedings if both types first

1074
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:09,370
types of signaling is there so it's

1075
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,240
always much we need to switch to be all

1076
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:15,250
right okay sorry

1077
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:17,919
yeah all right so yeah so here is a just

1078
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:20,830
quick quick update for the extending

1079
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,130
optimized ingress replication for a VPN

1080
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:28,150
we presented like maybe two ITF back

1081
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:31,630
okay so what has changed there is no

1082
01:03:28,150 --> 01:03:34,150
change on the draft front and juniper

1083
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:38,790
has implemented this feature and has

1084
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:41,590
shipped in early part of this year and

1085
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:44,620
just a quick summarize for this feature

1086
01:03:41,590 --> 01:03:50,020
this feature is based upon the optimized

1087
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:53,470
ingress replication so it inherent order

1088
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,860
good benefit for optimized the ingress

1089
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:55,930
report

1090
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,910
occasion use a diagram leaf spine

1091
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,549
topology for example I only draw one

1092
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:03,940
spine here you could have a many more

1093
01:04:00,550 --> 01:04:06,400
spine and you can do load balancing but

1094
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:10,180
just for simplicity illustrate the

1095
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:13,030
benefit it has is say on a leaf one have

1096
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:16,120
a receiver for example receive a mattock

1097
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:18,790
Hasbro I need to send two odd leaf just

1098
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:20,140
presumably behind oddly if there's an

1099
01:04:18,790 --> 01:04:23,890
interesting listener

1100
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:28,870
so without optimized ingress replication

1101
01:04:23,890 --> 01:04:30,759
for EVP and leaf one would send six copy

1102
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:33,640
of the same logic has flowed to the

1103
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:36,370
spine was optimized ingress replication

1104
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,339
they only need to send a 1-1 car page

1105
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:42,130
and then the replicator which is a spine

1106
01:04:39,340 --> 01:04:45,310
they replicate the traffic to the rest

1107
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:49,990
of a ollie if a system replication Leafs

1108
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:51,790
okay so and and also so a pen was saving

1109
01:04:49,990 --> 01:04:55,120
uplink then we're saving and also

1110
01:04:51,790 --> 01:04:58,090
alleviate burden of a I leave to

1111
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,910
replicate our traffic imagine you have

1112
01:04:58,090 --> 01:05:03,400
and the leaf is over two hundred three

1113
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:06,399
hundred you have two replicas so many

1114
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:08,380
copies right so so this is a definite

1115
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:11,380
benefit for optimized ingress

1116
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:14,350
replication but in order to on top of

1117
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:18,660
that in order to support modern homing

1118
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:18,660
which is a very common case in the leaf

1119
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:24,189
because the doing the assistant

1120
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,010
replication replicator has to decapitate

1121
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:29,350
packets and then encapsulate the packets

1122
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,840
again so in order to support motor

1123
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:34,690
homing you have to whether it's a be

1124
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:37,480
excellent or EBP an MPI is in case we

1125
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:41,080
want to do ESI in case for some reason

1126
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:44,170
people still want to using ESI labels

1127
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:46,569
pre horizon label for for multi-homing

1128
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:50,860
support so it's this require assistant

1129
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:55,300
replicator to retain the relief once IP

1130
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:58,240
edges or the horizon label so this is a

1131
01:05:55,300 --> 01:06:00,340
very much complicated AR replicated

1132
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:03,970
function implementation even if it's

1133
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:06,770
doable some commercial chipset is not

1134
01:06:03,970 --> 01:06:08,779
even achievable so this

1135
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:12,500
the solution is to address the mother

1136
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:17,440
home scenario so extended relief is

1137
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:20,210
doing the using the regular normal

1138
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,240
standard procedure to replicate a

1139
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:26,750
traffic to the to its peer when I

1140
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:31,479
compete the rescue during the goes to

1141
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:36,350
the leaf spine to do the replication so

1142
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:39,560
that's just a quick summarization and so

1143
01:06:36,350 --> 01:06:42,339
we would like seek walk group walking

1144
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:46,490
group adoption if there's any comments

1145
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:51,770
we will address so okay who has read the

1146
01:06:46,490 --> 01:07:02,660
document who thinks it could be ready

1147
01:06:51,770 --> 01:07:06,140
okay so I have a question yeah okay this

1148
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:10,759
is directed to the chairs is the goal of

1149
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:14,299
these drafts for interworking to be IPR

1150
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:15,670
free or is that a non goal look I mean

1151
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:19,220
so point can you can you say it again

1152
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:30,080
certainly are you looking for an IPR

1153
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:34,029
free solution or is that a non goal do

1154
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:34,029
we care i I don't know honesty

1155
01:07:58,220 --> 01:08:14,080
Wow you're short when okay

1156
01:08:09,950 --> 01:08:17,420
there is no yang in this presentation

1157
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:23,569
and despite the e of enhance there's no

1158
01:08:17,420 --> 01:08:27,649
evpn what we're looking at here is an

1159
01:08:23,569 --> 01:08:37,490
idea for defining something we call a

1160
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:42,229
BGP LS filter to offer a way of building

1161
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:46,880
a control plane for enhanced VPNs and

1162
01:08:42,229 --> 01:08:48,819
network slicing so what is what is this

1163
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:53,300
stuff we're talking about well there's a

1164
01:08:48,819 --> 01:08:57,939
working group draft in T's describing

1165
01:08:53,300 --> 01:09:04,580
enhanced VPNs and essentially they are

1166
01:08:57,939 --> 01:09:05,589
VPNs with a little bit more required by

1167
01:09:04,580 --> 01:09:14,029
the user

1168
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:18,350
- sorry I'm just fight this so I can

1169
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:21,939
stand up yes the user requires a little

1170
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:27,290
bit more from the VPN in terms of

1171
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:32,929
latency delay jitter resiliency

1172
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:35,330
requirements so it looks otherwise like

1173
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:40,010
a VPN and so it's natural to build on

1174
01:09:35,330 --> 01:09:45,890
the VPN technologies and what we're

1175
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:50,930
trying to do is manage the underlay - to

1176
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:53,870
provide those VPN services so our

1177
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:57,350
approach is a generalization of SRT

1178
01:09:53,870 --> 01:10:02,599
policy supporting all the good

1179
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:05,680
connectivity types and integrating with

1180
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:11,140
the with bgp evpn

1181
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:14,050
and kind of building the quality

1182
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:22,150
behaviors are on top of coloring

1183
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:27,420
mechanisms so the approach requires some

1184
01:10:22,150 --> 01:10:30,849
kind of centralized view as as rté does

1185
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:38,920
so that you can do the optimizations in

1186
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:41,770
a central controller and build takers

1187
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:45,660
information to that the traffic matrix

1188
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:49,120
for the VPNs the properties that are

1189
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:51,160
required by the VPN and information

1190
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:54,400
about what they're in the network

1191
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:59,559
already which you would get out using

1192
01:10:54,400 --> 01:11:02,530
BGP LS given that the network controller

1193
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:08,110
can and have a look at what's available

1194
01:11:02,530 --> 01:11:12,269
and make some decisions and assign to

1195
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:16,509
the P routers bandwidth that will be

1196
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:23,170
identified or associated with DHCP code

1197
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:27,370
points or adjacency Syd's having having

1198
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:30,790
done that each each enhanced VPN gets a

1199
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:33,970
subset of these underlay resources and

1200
01:11:30,790 --> 01:11:37,510
that subset we we are calling that BGP

1201
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:39,940
LS filter so BGP LS presents the whole

1202
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:43,420
topology you can then filter that

1203
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:49,419
topology into a set of resources that

1204
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:51,310
are assigned to a VPN the pease have a

1205
01:11:49,420 --> 01:11:54,460
complete view of the underlay

1206
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:56,830
of course but they're also told about

1207
01:11:54,460 --> 01:12:00,730
the BG pls filter and so they have a

1208
01:11:56,830 --> 01:12:03,850
filter on that underlay and we encode

1209
01:12:00,730 --> 01:12:08,769
that with a new attribute and and push

1210
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:10,810
it self bound to the Pease you can apply

1211
01:12:08,770 --> 01:12:13,990
this in all sorts of granularities so

1212
01:12:10,810 --> 01:12:17,230
you could you could do it for all pls in

1213
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:23,219
a single VPN or a set of peas in the VPN

1214
01:12:17,230 --> 01:12:23,219
or an individual PE

1215
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:31,990
otherwise it's kind of like standard VPN

1216
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:41,630
tools using pushing the BGP LS filter

1217
01:12:31,990 --> 01:12:44,210
around with BGP so we think that this WG

1218
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:47,000
pls filter integrates really easily with

1219
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:50,320
the existing VPN support and that's what

1220
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:54,110
we really want because we want to move

1221
01:12:50,320 --> 01:12:58,009
incrementally from existing VPNs into

1222
01:12:54,110 --> 01:13:00,679
enhanced VPNs we want to be able to

1223
01:12:58,010 --> 01:13:04,160
support into a s we want to support the

1224
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:06,800
I GPS and don't want to have to do

1225
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:12,380
significant new invention I think

1226
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:14,960
largely because we're lazy we get

1227
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:19,040
everything that the traditional VPN

1228
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:23,830
scaling out of this so that the per VPN

1229
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:27,920
information is kept out of the core and

1230
01:13:23,830 --> 01:13:29,809
non enhanced VPNs just don't get this

1231
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:35,150
filter information and just go on

1232
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:39,920
operating as usual and sharing resources

1233
01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:44,120
in the core so the key to this is the

1234
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:47,270
BGP LS filter providing a view of the

1235
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:50,660
connectivity between the p's for a

1236
01:13:47,270 --> 01:13:51,950
particular VPN or for a set of VPNs and

1237
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:55,150
that's where we sort of come into

1238
01:13:51,950 --> 01:13:58,429
slicing in the concept of slicing your

1239
01:13:55,150 --> 01:14:02,150
partitioning the core resources and

1240
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:07,730
using them for a class of services which

1241
01:14:02,150 --> 01:14:10,580
may be multiple VPNs you need multiple

1242
01:14:07,730 --> 01:14:13,429
paths between between peers to give

1243
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:18,800
resiliency and to give maybe different

1244
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:23,450
qualities of service we're tagging the

1245
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:26,240
filter with the artis of the VPNs for

1246
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:30,410
the PS that support it so that makes the

1247
01:14:26,240 --> 01:14:36,800
import work and then when you send a

1248
01:14:30,410 --> 01:14:41,750
packet you select the path to the

1249
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:44,179
USPD from that Ellis filter you add the

1250
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:48,770
segment routing information into the

1251
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:50,690
header or place the packet onto the

1252
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:54,820
right LSP depending on what your

1253
01:14:50,690 --> 01:14:57,919
forwarding plane is and you can use any

1254
01:14:54,820 --> 01:15:03,710
computation tool or engine you want for

1255
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:05,809
that the underlay network may appear

1256
01:15:03,710 --> 01:15:09,679
pieces of the underlying network may

1257
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:11,809
appear in multiple bgp LS filters and

1258
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:13,550
that's all according to what the central

1259
01:15:11,809 --> 01:15:16,909
controller has done how its looked at

1260
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:21,380
the the resources but it means that you

1261
01:15:16,909 --> 01:15:28,269
need an athlean SFA with different IDs

1262
01:15:21,380 --> 01:15:33,829
for each filter so we need a new BG pls

1263
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:37,130
attribute so he's just a pictorial thing

1264
01:15:33,829 --> 01:15:40,190
based apology you might split it in into

1265
01:15:37,130 --> 01:15:43,400
different filters according to what

1266
01:15:40,190 --> 01:15:46,969
connectivity you want and what the core

1267
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:51,379
network is able to produce and deliver

1268
01:15:46,969 --> 01:15:54,469
for you I I think you see this picture

1269
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,909
in virtual networking and and all sorts

1270
01:15:54,469 --> 01:16:01,520
of different ways of slicing core

1271
01:15:55,909 --> 01:16:07,250
resources shouldn't be a new idea the

1272
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:13,099
filter app attribute we assume that a PE

1273
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:15,500
may support multiple eg P LS filters so

1274
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:18,409
it can be in all sorts of different one

1275
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:22,579
PE can give access to multiple VPNs of

1276
01:16:18,409 --> 01:16:25,670
different types and the filter may

1277
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:34,610
change over time as nodes get added or

1278
01:16:25,670 --> 01:16:35,190
removed and as the core changes the

1279
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:36,929
field

1280
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:41,089
the way we've defined it is that the BG

1281
01:16:36,930 --> 01:16:45,150
pls filter may contain multiple updates

1282
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:48,989
and that those updates may arrive in any

1283
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:52,739
order and that they make it into leaved

1284
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:55,589
so that's just this is the the

1285
01:16:52,739 --> 01:16:56,610
assumption that there is no assumption I

1286
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:58,890
guess

1287
01:16:56,610 --> 01:17:01,589
so this requires that we have a filter

1288
01:16:58,890 --> 01:17:03,630
identifier and a version number and a

1289
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:07,320
filter type and a number of fragments

1290
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:10,170
and an identifier of the current

1291
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:13,790
fragment that's sort of business as

1292
01:17:10,170 --> 01:17:17,640
usual and then you can also include a

1293
01:17:13,790 --> 01:17:21,570
code point in there too

1294
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:27,239
to indicate what dscp code point you

1295
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:29,820
would use for packets in that filter you

1296
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:31,980
can't actually use the BGP Els filter

1297
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:33,690
until it's fully established so that's

1298
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:39,120
why you need to know how many fragments

1299
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:42,629
are coming and you can only use a

1300
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:50,130
network resource guess what if it's

1301
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:57,840
active the under you can interrupt me or

1302
01:17:50,130 --> 01:18:00,150
even okay the the under later Paula G is

1303
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:02,910
in a sense the union of all bgp LS

1304
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:05,540
filters plus I guess anything that the

1305
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:08,660
central controller has held back for

1306
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:08,660
rainy days

1307
01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:19,190
when say anything more about that I

1308
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:22,880
think you have to close soon you want to

1309
01:18:19,190 --> 01:18:25,849
have questions last slide thank you

1310
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,290
we're going to check back with the with

1311
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,610
the framework to make sure we're

1312
01:18:27,290 --> 01:18:30,980
actually addressing the right theme

1313
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:33,250
there are a number of data plane and

1314
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:37,129
control plane drafts out there for

1315
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:40,520
enhanced VPN we've been meeting with

1316
01:18:37,130 --> 01:18:43,070
those authors already this week and we

1317
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:46,970
think we're aligned but we need some to

1318
01:18:43,070 --> 01:18:48,849
do some iteration on the draft so this

1319
01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:51,050
may be our thuggin all to you but just

1320
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:53,090
curiosity you've talked a lot about

1321
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:56,120
filters and you've talked a lot about

1322
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:59,150
the attribute could you first provide me

1323
01:18:56,120 --> 01:19:02,900
a very specific description of what you

1324
01:18:59,150 --> 01:19:05,719
mean by attribute there are a lot of bgp

1325
01:19:02,900 --> 01:19:09,530
attributes I assumed you meant of each

1326
01:19:05,720 --> 01:19:11,810
pls attribute within all the components

1327
01:19:09,530 --> 01:19:14,330
attributes am I correct in my assumption

1328
01:19:11,810 --> 01:19:19,340
second will you be combining this with

1329
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:22,100
flowspec search announced at your first

1330
01:19:19,340 --> 01:19:24,950
question yes B GPRS attribute sorry I

1331
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:29,420
was sloppy in answer to your second

1332
01:19:24,950 --> 01:19:31,940
question maybe it seems like a natural

1333
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:34,700
case which case we have some other I

1334
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:36,290
have some other concerns but you need to

1335
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:41,540
determine whether you're going to do

1336
01:19:36,290 --> 01:19:42,860
them maybe or not before I only days for

1337
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,900
thinking about that but thank you for

1338
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:48,920
raising it and we will huddle and make

1339
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:53,450
it work the reason is if if you missed

1340
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:56,960
the BGP meeting on Monday we will be

1341
01:19:53,450 --> 01:19:59,179
doing l2 version to a flowspec I think

1342
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:02,290
that was what the operators have so if

1343
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:05,030
you're going into that area please do

1344
01:20:02,290 --> 01:20:10,580
expeditiously consider your your your

1345
01:20:05,030 --> 01:20:14,750
brain trust and go on hi Kate

1346
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:18,050
ontological Cisco so BGP a list as we

1347
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:20,060
have today is a northbound thing so

1348
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:22,340
going from the network nodes to a

1349
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:24,800
controller and I believe in this

1350
01:20:22,340 --> 01:20:26,930
proposal what you are what you're

1351
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:29,240
looking for is our southbound is like a

1352
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:33,470
provisioning

1353
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:36,460
so yeah I would suggest I would suggest

1354
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:39,940
if we could consider having a separate

1355
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:42,590
officially we could still use a lot of

1356
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:45,559
the TLV score points and everything

1357
01:20:42,590 --> 01:20:49,700
defined for BG pls we have another

1358
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:53,350
officially defined for using the same in

1359
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:56,929
in LS V R so I would recommend if it's

1360
01:20:53,350 --> 01:20:59,090
possible to not mix it up with BG pls

1361
01:20:56,930 --> 01:21:01,280
and have a separate I mean something

1362
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:04,430
like s our policy is a fee for example

1363
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:11,420
yeah yeah probably right

1364
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:14,570
oh no it's definitely speaking as

1365
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:16,580
individual so you it's really similar to

1366
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:18,530
a military topology framework that you

1367
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:21,740
want to build and you want to push

1368
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:24,590
topologies to note and then reclassify

1369
01:21:21,740 --> 01:21:27,050
on each node to find V right topology

1370
01:21:24,590 --> 01:21:29,210
you need to forward on yeah it's very

1371
01:21:27,050 --> 01:21:32,180
similar I'm shying away from multi

1372
01:21:29,210 --> 01:21:36,200
topology because that's not necessarily

1373
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:39,680
going to scale to the order that we want

1374
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:41,360
but it comes yet similar yeah okay so do

1375
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:44,660
you confirm that on each node you need

1376
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:47,059
to for example look at the DHCP to find

1377
01:21:44,660 --> 01:21:49,519
out on which topology you need to flood

1378
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:50,990
all is it always leveraging on signal

1379
01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:59,120
well things so ingress is pushing

1380
01:21:50,990 --> 01:22:03,410
everything so the only the edge nodes

1381
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:07,519
are seeing the stuff right VPN behavior

1382
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:10,639
the tor nodes have to know what to how

1383
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,590
to forward based on if they're using SR

1384
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:14,840
they need to know how to forward SR if

1385
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:17,240
they're using DHCP they need to know how

1386
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:18,860
to forward on that but that's that

1387
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:22,400
should be business as usual

1388
01:22:18,860 --> 01:22:24,259
hmm okay and my les comment an area I

1389
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:26,269
think I already did this comment by

1390
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:30,860
email to you I'm really worried about

1391
01:22:26,270 --> 01:22:32,780
visa version number which is tied to the

1392
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:34,940
full topology so each time you have a

1393
01:22:32,780 --> 01:22:37,519
topology event you have to push back

1394
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:39,349
everything so you're slowing down the

1395
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:41,260
conversion time compared to having a

1396
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:46,060
sequence number on

1397
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:47,800
piece of the pierogi yes and I'm

1398
01:22:46,060 --> 01:22:49,840
probably glossed over it too much but

1399
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,900
the fact that we can fragment the

1400
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:57,130
message is that we can push down means

1401
01:22:52,900 --> 01:23:00,549
we can do updates okay I'm gonna cut the

1402
01:22:57,130 --> 01:23:03,820
line off after Jeff we're Mandrax nokia

1403
01:23:00,550 --> 01:23:06,310
so the goal here is to distribute let's

1404
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:08,740
say that let's say separate topologies

1405
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:11,400
in the dedicated VPNs in a distributed

1406
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:16,840
manner in order to do distributed te

1407
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:18,849
kind of use case right yeah so the

1408
01:23:16,840 --> 01:23:20,410
question I have is given that you get

1409
01:23:18,850 --> 01:23:22,660
from a controller you push it back down

1410
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:25,420
how are you going to do bandwidth based

1411
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:28,269
use cases let like with using segment

1412
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:32,620
routing so the what's pushing down is

1413
01:23:28,270 --> 01:23:34,960
your by us but so is your bandwidth to

1414
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:38,410
do with as you like and you cannot share

1415
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:41,680
it that's right you have no one to share

1416
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:43,330
it with okay but sometimes certain links

1417
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,970
can be shared between all those

1418
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:48,730
different yes simple so are you are you

1419
01:23:45,970 --> 01:23:51,310
is this solution basically saying you

1420
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:53,469
have really dedicated infrastructure

1421
01:23:51,310 --> 01:23:53,980
only for that VPN no I think you can do

1422
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:56,110
both

1423
01:23:53,980 --> 01:24:00,309
so yes okay but then if you do bandwidth

1424
01:23:56,110 --> 01:24:03,570
use case right so knowing that way this

1425
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:06,010
exclusion so cut that that if the

1426
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:07,420
controller has looked at the link and

1427
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:09,880
said the link has dropped this much

1428
01:24:07,420 --> 01:24:12,730
bandwidth I partition that bandwidth and

1429
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:14,680
I give that link with only a smidgen of

1430
01:24:12,730 --> 01:24:16,839
bandwidth to you and I give the same

1431
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:19,180
link with a different piece of piece of

1432
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:21,580
the total bandwidth to somebody else and

1433
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:24,130
they are operating they believe that

1434
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:26,290
they own that link with that little bit

1435
01:24:24,130 --> 01:24:27,910
of bandwidth and all he dead bandwidth

1436
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:30,910
is available to that VP after that

1437
01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:33,430
person yes and it can not be shared it

1438
01:24:30,910 --> 01:24:35,349
can't be shared with that bandwidth has

1439
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:37,480
been given to them come sure how are you

1440
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:39,340
going to in a distributed way figure out

1441
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:42,580
that that link which is used by multiple

1442
01:24:39,340 --> 01:24:44,230
pease how are they going to relate the

1443
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:46,510
bandwidth for all these V at the same

1444
01:24:44,230 --> 01:24:47,919
VPN going to the same link which is

1445
01:24:46,510 --> 01:24:50,130
shared for that topology how are you

1446
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:54,640
going to do that in a distributed manner

1447
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:55,930
with Simon routing well certainly

1448
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:59,020
so you have to lead you need to go a

1449
01:24:55,930 --> 01:25:00,760
role you have to go to you have to go to

1450
01:24:59,020 --> 01:25:03,910
a controller but it's a controller for

1451
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:05,860
that slice not a controller for the

1452
01:25:03,910 --> 01:25:07,960
horrifying disease that you distribute

1453
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:09,849
the information we are out of time we

1454
01:25:07,960 --> 01:25:11,860
don't really but you actually need a

1455
01:25:09,850 --> 01:25:14,020
controller to the bandwidth so there is

1456
01:25:11,860 --> 01:25:16,480
a there is a problem in this solution

1457
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:18,610
you should go really really fast with

1458
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:23,950
the two last comments because yeah

1459
01:25:18,610 --> 01:25:27,130
so let's because just five minutes we

1460
01:25:23,950 --> 01:25:30,510
touch him from China Mobile in fact he

1461
01:25:27,130 --> 01:25:34,510
have asked them most of my question the

1462
01:25:30,510 --> 01:25:36,430
state your name yeah it is that for

1463
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:40,750
operator how can we use this bonus

1464
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:43,870
function what water it can provided so

1465
01:25:40,750 --> 01:25:47,020
the what an operator can sell with if

1466
01:25:43,870 --> 01:25:49,120
they have this service is a vacant send

1467
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:53,440
a VPN to an enterprise where that VPN

1468
01:25:49,120 --> 01:25:57,280
has brought additional service level

1469
01:25:53,440 --> 01:26:01,210
commitments like latency like resiliency

1470
01:25:57,280 --> 01:26:03,700
or the operator can sell a service to

1471
01:26:01,210 --> 01:26:06,750
another division of the operator for

1472
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:09,639
example a wireless division as a slice

1473
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:13,750
what's the difference between this way

1474
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:16,120
and the current between the current VPN

1475
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:19,410
is a connectivity service offering

1476
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:22,920
bandwidth end of story

1477
01:26:19,410 --> 01:26:24,160
please continue this discussion of fine

1478
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:26,770
yeah

1479
01:26:24,160 --> 01:26:29,580
really fast yeah defect comments one I

1480
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:32,410
would question DCP forwarding at all

1481
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:35,019
using color gives you association

1482
01:26:32,410 --> 01:26:36,340
between next hop caller and then the

1483
01:26:35,020 --> 01:26:38,830
first if lookup which makes it

1484
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:40,150
straightforward and easy lack of

1485
01:26:38,830 --> 01:26:41,860
feedback in BGP

1486
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:43,690
it's a problem in general I would like

1487
01:26:41,860 --> 01:26:45,849
to see how you would address it because

1488
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:47,349
you create an intended State but then

1489
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:49,320
you don't know what the resources

1490
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:53,560
actually have been allocated and

1491
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:56,049
operational state so you're stuck with

1492
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:58,660
BGP can only withdraw right there's

1493
01:26:56,050 --> 01:27:00,910
nothing between so I'm not sure I'm

1494
01:26:58,660 --> 01:27:02,950
getting that we should huddle afterwards

1495
01:27:00,910 --> 01:27:04,000
the difference between your intended

1496
01:27:02,950 --> 01:27:06,160
States or what you are trying to

1497
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:08,050
configure than operational stage should

1498
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:10,320
be retrieve somehow and BGP doesn't give

1499
01:27:08,050 --> 01:27:10,320
you that

1500
01:27:11,030 --> 01:27:21,750
[Music]

1501
01:27:13,310 --> 01:27:23,520
yes it doesn't ventually such a in

1502
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:25,530
theory you have just three minutes free

1503
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:29,670
remaining before the end of a meeting

1504
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:33,769
but I feel there should be a break mine

1505
01:27:29,670 --> 01:27:33,770
should be short presentation or check or

1506
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:43,710
yes so so hi I am Satya Monty from Cisco

1507
01:27:40,950 --> 01:27:47,489
and this is on behalf of all my

1508
01:27:43,710 --> 01:27:50,010
co-authors so this one we presented to

1509
01:27:47,489 --> 01:27:51,929
three IITs ago and there was some

1510
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:54,170
discussion so we incorporated that

1511
01:27:51,930 --> 01:27:54,170
feedback

1512
01:27:56,450 --> 01:28:05,030
so this yeah so this is some related

1513
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:07,849
evpn multicast work I just put them

1514
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:11,250
which I thought was important for this

1515
01:28:07,850 --> 01:28:12,540
so the first one is the IGMP MLD proxy I

1516
01:28:11,250 --> 01:28:15,540
believe it's going for working group

1517
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:17,700
last call so and the second one is the

1518
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:20,219
per multicast flow DF election these two

1519
01:28:17,700 --> 01:28:22,019
drafts together probably account for 85

1520
01:28:20,219 --> 01:28:25,770
to 90 percent of the multicast cases for

1521
01:28:22,020 --> 01:28:27,480
the EVP on the last two one is the

1522
01:28:25,770 --> 01:28:30,420
optimized ingress replication in nvo

1523
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:33,179
networks and the other one is the boom

1524
01:28:30,420 --> 01:28:35,550
procedure of dead drafts so this draft

1525
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:38,100
is relevant for the remaining cases

1526
01:28:35,550 --> 01:28:41,160
which is like the bomb traffic in using

1527
01:28:38,100 --> 01:28:44,489
ingress replication then bridge Romans

1528
01:28:41,160 --> 01:28:47,010
with no IGMP ml deep in proxy and the

1529
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:50,009
other one is the beauties with no oh a

1530
01:28:47,010 --> 01:28:52,730
samurai are peace and most of it is

1531
01:28:50,010 --> 01:28:56,989
taken from the feedback that was

1532
01:28:52,730 --> 01:29:03,839
discussed in I think in after London IDF

1533
01:28:56,989 --> 01:29:05,669
so one of the other things that was told

1534
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:08,130
to us is to make it informational

1535
01:29:05,670 --> 01:29:11,520
because it need not be a standard so we

1536
01:29:08,130 --> 01:29:14,580
made it an informational draft so the

1537
01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:17,850
main thing here is as you can see there

1538
01:29:14,580 --> 01:29:19,559
are usually there are two redundancy

1539
01:29:17,850 --> 01:29:21,490
peas but in some cases we have seen up

1540
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:23,980
to four

1541
01:29:21,490 --> 01:29:26,410
so the main idea is you don't need to

1542
01:29:23,980 --> 01:29:30,160
send multicast traffic to people who do

1543
01:29:26,410 --> 01:29:32,530
not need it right so in this case as

1544
01:29:30,160 --> 01:29:35,440
I've shown here this P 2 and P 4 they

1545
01:29:32,530 --> 01:29:37,750
are the designated forwarder and

1546
01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:41,740
non-designated forwarder and the others

1547
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:43,090
P 1 and P 3 assuming the conditions that

1548
01:29:41,740 --> 01:29:45,429
I showed in the previous slide they

1549
01:29:43,090 --> 01:29:48,280
exist or the whole then we don't need to

1550
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:52,600
keep them the multicast traffic so

1551
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:55,090
that's what I've shown and last time

1552
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:58,240
when we presented the use case was from

1553
01:29:55,090 --> 01:30:02,170
a DCI perspective but the draft

1554
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:05,650
mentioned about Pease and C so to

1555
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:08,470
clarify that I have put two slides so as

1556
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:11,379
you can see the solution is is very

1557
01:30:08,470 --> 01:30:13,540
general it's like it can either qualify

1558
01:30:11,380 --> 01:30:19,150
for peas or DC I it doesn't really

1559
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:22,210
matter okay so this I already said that

1560
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:25,000
DCI 2 and DC I for they only need to

1561
01:30:22,210 --> 01:30:27,760
send their inclusive multicast routes so

1562
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:32,620
one thing here is this is from the

1563
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:34,930
framework RFC so what it says is if we

1564
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:38,800
have a set of series that are multi-home

1565
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:40,480
to the same set of peas then to get good

1566
01:30:38,800 --> 01:30:43,510
entropy we need for load balancing

1567
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:46,089
purposes right what we do is we take the

1568
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:48,610
es into consideration inside that HRW

1569
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:53,710
hash function so as to get a good spread

1570
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:56,559
and some of this the English is written

1571
01:30:53,710 --> 01:30:58,660
by John so but for this one

1572
01:30:56,560 --> 01:31:00,850
for this particular case we do not

1573
01:30:58,660 --> 01:31:05,290
really want the es to creep into the

1574
01:31:00,850 --> 01:31:10,020
equation why because we want for both

1575
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:14,710
this s1 and s2 the DF should be

1576
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:17,590
unequivocally the same same DF say same

1577
01:31:14,710 --> 01:31:21,850
same DCI which means that we can set the

1578
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:25,270
es to 0 and then irrespective of the es

1579
01:31:21,850 --> 01:31:29,350
they will all map to the same DCI or the

1580
01:31:25,270 --> 01:31:32,140
P so that's one thing I think I missed

1581
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:33,900
writing that in the draft but in the

1582
01:31:32,140 --> 01:31:37,430
next version we'll do it

1583
01:31:33,900 --> 01:31:40,230
and that can be done probably by a knob

1584
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:41,910
and I think that's it's the interests

1585
01:31:40,230 --> 01:31:44,879
case is already covered so we don't have

1586
01:31:41,910 --> 01:31:47,450
to go into that yeah that's that's my

1587
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:54,330
presentation

1588
01:31:47,450 --> 01:32:00,389
any comments okay so which is yen thank

1589
01:31:54,330 --> 01:32:03,440
you and see you in a Vancouver of the

1590
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,440
blue sheets anywhere please

1591
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:08,579
[Music]

1592
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:35,580
I have some
