1
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,759
nice okay folks we're gonna start if

2
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:41,170
you're at the back of the room chatting

3
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:43,239
then come in or go out or whichever okay

4
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,460
so this is the lake working group just

5
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:47,890
our first meeting as a working group my

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:52,629
name is Steven Farrell and I'm Ally

7
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:57,070
short tonight so we're here to help we

8
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:58,870
have those slides we have them to people

9
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:05,040
taking notes and etherpad

10
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:09,280
and jabber scribe there's the note well

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,000
here's the agenda anybody want to bash

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,320
the agenda so just to explain I think

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,840
John's presentation is probably the

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,339
media space and here it comes in kind of

15
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,960
two parts he's got about six or seven

16
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,659
slides the beginning just kind of

17
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,949
providing context and background if you

18
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:28,930
can kind of just keep it to clarifying

19
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,140
questions for that bitch that'll be

20
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,549
great

21
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,500
and then there's one slide that says

22
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,659
this question just before we get there

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,000
we'll do a home to see if the people in

24
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:38,799
the room would like to adopt that draft

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,270
confirm the list obviously later and

26
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,250
then we can go on and discuss the

27
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,090
details of the requirements and comments

28
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:50,140
people have on them that's okay so any

29
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:52,090
other agenda bashing I think Michael

30
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:53,890
Richardson had to be in the LMO working

31
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,700
group so militias gonna just present a

32
00:01:53,890 --> 00:02:01,710
couple slides he gave us is that all

33
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,710
good in that case John

34
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:16,730
now I would see what happened so I hit

35
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:18,950
this button so this is a presentation on

36
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:23,149
the lightweight a cape Oscar

37
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:25,988
requirements draft it's now in version 3

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:37,250
it has been updated twice since the last

39
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:39,319
ITF is the boss so what is Lake and this

40
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:41,930
presentation wasn't been asked to not to

41
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,179
try to not repeat these discussions from

42
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:47,390
the SEC Dispatch in Tremont to the both

43
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,110
Surrey will be quite little about radio

44
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,540
protocols background lake is about

45
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:56,030
specifying a lightweight authentication

46
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,548
key protocol for Oh score and light

47
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:00,500
weight is really the important thing

48
00:02:58,549 --> 00:03:03,530
here if we don't do it lightweight it

49
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,099
will not work well for six days and

50
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:08,480
orowan

51
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:12,980
and then we have failed requirements for

52
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,130
light weight is following what is comes

53
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:22,100
to constrained by environments defined

54
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:25,600
in RFC 72 8 what we need to discuss here

55
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:29,090
is how do these constraint environment

56
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,440
apply to an aka and especially which

57
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:35,239
radio technologies which type of devices

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:37,840
so this is not in news this is the first

59
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,880
working group session but it's not a new

60
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,040
subject and has been discussed in ace it

61
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:47,359
has been discussed in six - dispatch

62
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,429
interim there was a both and has also

63
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:56,329
been discussed in other group for

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:04:01,190
example extension a in six thick dish so

65
00:03:56,329 --> 00:04:05,000
the requirement dropped we have added a

66
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:08,510
lot more material for basically the

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,060
different required areas of requirements

68
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:16,070
we also try to make the requirements

69
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:18,709
more strict and more specific steel

70
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,649
things to do but I think

71
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:23,180
this is a good start recovering basic I

72
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:29,929
think we're covering the areas that

73
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:33,740
should be covered and think there is

74
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:36,280
this sixth type of things we go through

75
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,660
them there will not be a much

76
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:40,609
lightweight is very important to radio

77
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,560
technology but that will not be repeated

78
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:47,840
here

79
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,860
so first the lake is an key exchange for

80
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,109
off score

81
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,830
what does that mean means that it needs

82
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,990
to provide what horse core needs so if

83
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,180
you don't know that Oscar is a security

84
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:06,050
protocol for co-op Oscar needs a master

85
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:08,479
secret and that should have good

86
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,639
properties oscar already have he

87
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,860
exchanged without if a Hellman

88
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:18,410
so this aka should provide PFS Oscar

89
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,900
also need sender IDs which is

90
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:25,669
identifying the end points and then

91
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:28,370
Oscar needs some cozy algorithm's core

92
00:05:25,669 --> 00:05:34,880
is built on cozy as need Cosell great

93
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:38,720
stop rate then take a shall use Siebel

94
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:42,020
co-op and cozy what this boils down to

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,960
is that it should not add too much code

96
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,639
and complexity to implementation then

97
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,580
because I just clarify when you say that

98
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,870
Oscar needs cozy algorithms to use that

99
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,180
just means it needs to know which ones

100
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:57,050
to use yes exactly

101
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,300
needs an identifier or something yeah

102
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:05,000
and I think the current version of this

103
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:08,509
requirements documents have too much

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,270
shell there will be further discussion

105
00:06:08,509 --> 00:06:13,250
should be which which of the D so really

106
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:19,370
should the may be some or maybe

107
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:23,750
depending on the trade-offs JK should be

108
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:25,909
able to this one is the Oscars and IDs

109
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,760
if I remember correctly that's the way

110
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:31,129
to associate the security context it's

111
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,619
of the Oscar

112
00:06:31,129 --> 00:06:37,039
yeah yeah so there's two in different

113
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:41,539
directions yeah I mean similar to the

114
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:46,009
connection IDs so you're yeah should

115
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:49,058
support the same transport co-op and

116
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:51,800
Lake to not spend time duplicating

117
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:54,709
functionality that is always already

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,379
available in coop such as packet loss

119
00:06:54,709 --> 00:07:01,550
reordering the application fragmentation

120
00:06:57,379 --> 00:07:04,069
and dollar service protection wait hi so

121
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,459
maybe it's on the following slides I'll

122
00:07:04,069 --> 00:07:09,619
ask anyway so is it on purpose that it

123
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:11,629
doesn't say how is how's the key

124
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:17,689
exchange authenticated are you planning

125
00:07:11,629 --> 00:07:27,139
to support our PKS PSK certificates yes

126
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:29,269
I coming to that on later slides next

127
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,739
type of properties is authentication

128
00:07:29,269 --> 00:07:36,289
credentials and crypto properties and we

129
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:38,209
believe that it should support mutual

130
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:42,199
authentication I think is a requirement

131
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:44,899
for IOT we think the aka needs to

132
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:51,199
support PSK or PKM public key

133
00:07:44,899 --> 00:07:54,649
certificates there's been a request on

134
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,319
the list that it should take a should

135
00:07:54,649 --> 00:08:00,639
support different public key credentials

136
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:02,869
for different endpoints ie one endpoint

137
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,360
authenticate with a certificate and the

138
00:08:02,869 --> 00:08:08,419
other with a or PK I think it was

139
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,729
Michael Richardson has also come up in

140
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:16,789
discussion earlier should also support

141
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:22,159
any are UT ways to identify these

142
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:25,550
credentials this yes this list the list

143
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:27,979
of what is currently available in ku has

144
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,539
been discussed and is on the way of

145
00:08:27,979 --> 00:08:35,000
being designed for kausi a Kay should

146
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:39,558
support shall support identity

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,880
protection definitely here for for

148
00:08:39,558 --> 00:08:45,579
public keys late

149
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,250
with different protection for for

150
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:51,220
practical reasons for the initiator and

151
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,860
the sponsor it would be good if they

152
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,460
gave supported identity protection for

153
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,220
PSK is come with a lot of trade-offs so

154
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,350
it might not be worth it in them which

155
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,590
occur pointed out on the list today and

156
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:12,220
I that is part of the discussion later

157
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:15,520
today the occasion support negotiation

158
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,610
yeah this is honest um I was wondering

159
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:21,100
about one aspect that came up in CFR Qi

160
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:23,560
not too long ago namely the use of

161
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,410
password based strong as a authenticated

162
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:29,829
key exchanges which people they are also

163
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:32,530
proposed as a need for IOT environments

164
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,240
and I was it didn't came up in at least

165
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:37,780
and I thought it was supposed to be an

166
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:44,340
intentional omission or I don't know it

167
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:47,470
has not come up in these discussions the

168
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:50,020
use cases we have seen in six stations

169
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,860
or not it has not been a requirement I

170
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:58,360
think it's mainly used for maybe home

171
00:09:52,860 --> 00:10:00,730
deployments so it's for further

172
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:03,700
discussion if you if you think that

173
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:06,610
should be included it's not included in

174
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:10,180
the requirement document right now Tara

175
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:13,420
Harkins are the public keys in these

176
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:16,180
certificates and the trusted are PRK are

177
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:19,209
they like a certified diffie-hellman key

178
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:21,670
or certified signature key do you can

179
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:23,530
well though well can you do a like

180
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,660
without doing a DSA for instance could

181
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:29,230
you do it with just a few almonds yeah I

182
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:33,430
think so and yeah and that's also that's

183
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:38,230
for further that is in the discussion at

184
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:42,689
the end I think yeah take it okay I

185
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:42,690
think that's requirement

186
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:47,460
you might repeat what Richard said off

187
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:50,260
the mic or Richard could do that I guess

188
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,360
is Richard burns I just said it is

189
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,569
possible to in fact to build aches that

190
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,740
only use the H keys and that's nuts like

191
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,980
yeah yeah

192
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,680
I think more using if you have monkeys

193
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:04,930
probably come from limiting message size

194
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,790
that rather than requirement that

195
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:12,969
somebody only has that and can only use

196
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:18,130
that they K needs to be support

197
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:23,650
negotiation of algorithm's core and for

198
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:26,410
the a K has been pointed out people

199
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:30,760
wants to be able to change algorithm in

200
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:32,430
the lifetime of their devices and the

201
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:36,240
negotiation selection should be

202
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:44,310
protected against downgrade attacks by

203
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:49,090
many new models more crypto properties

204
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:53,439
compromise of the long term keys we need

205
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:55,780
to protect against should come an

206
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,610
attacker compromising the long term kiss

207
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,220
you not be able to compromise past

208
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:05,320
session key so-called perfect forward

209
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,660
secrecy should also protect against

210
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,090
passive attacker compromising future

211
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:13,900
keys it should be forced to be active at

212
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,470
least they ke should provide keep

213
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,980
compromised impersonation so if you take

214
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:22,090
the initiators key issue no cable to the

215
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,540
attacker should not be able to

216
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:29,350
authenticate the responder towards the

217
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:32,680
initiator and then they should provide

218
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,080
about against miss panty attacks and

219
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:39,489
reflection attacks such as the selfie

220
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:41,470
attack okay this is a little nitpicky

221
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:44,530
but I noticed this in the document too

222
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,000
and I should have commented um so on the

223
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:47,319
selfie attack actually had two variants

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
right one was a straight up reflection

225
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:52,840
attack and the other was when you have

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:55,360
multiple endpoints with on the same the

227
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,040
same key material um you know they're

228
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,290
both actors client and server like so

229
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:05,110
are you saying both or just one only to

230
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,990
Paul T right now there has been no

231
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:10,570
suggestion to expand this to multiple

232
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,970
parties having the PS case the two party

233
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:15,040
tsk yeah to my knowledge the only way to

234
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:16,630
fix that attack is to have asymmetry

235
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,740
between the client and server role for

236
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:27,490
the key I think you can have rules you

237
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:31,330
could forbid the simultaneous connection

238
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:34,090
or you could check that the reflected

239
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:37,510
messages are not the same as I say that

240
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,540
that's what I'm saying so the on the the

241
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:42,970
something paper right describes a

242
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,800
setting in which you have two settings

243
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,480
right one in which you are reflected

244
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,849
back to yourself and then which you have

245
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,590
two endpoints each of which can act as

246
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:52,120
client and server the same key say you

247
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:54,010
have like a VPN gateway that's got

248
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,130
concert across two to two boxes right

249
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:58,480
and so on so you're right the thief or

250
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,610
the reflection attack you can stop that

251
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,140
by comparing by comparing someone that

252
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,080
one of the one of the not only random

253
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,060
values but for the for the sir crossing

254
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,380
attack you actually have to have as far

255
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:11,619
as I understand it I'm something

256
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,910
different because you can't get on to

257
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,230
separate out the key material client

258
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,939
server and not let people act

259
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,930
simultaneously anyway it's like we

260
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,770
talked about it but like it's probably

261
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:23,140
worth flushing metal bar yeah it should

262
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:28,300
be friend he predict against all serious

263
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:30,819
attacks we need to flesh out that so I

264
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,290
was actually going to say the same thing

265
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:34,090
as I could said because protecting

266
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,380
against all kinds of selfie attacks you

267
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,980
would need some kind of strong

268
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,510
identities and maybe it might be worth

269
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:42,730
saying that we are protecting against

270
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:45,370
this specific kind of selfie attacks and

271
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,770
we are only considering two-party

272
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:51,400
communication even though two parties is

273
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,260
a group of two so if you're not going to

274
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,090
allow parallel sessions and so on it

275
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:58,390
should be explicitly in the requirements

276
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,980
document at the beginning for the

277
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:01,300
benefit of folks that are removed if

278
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,640
you're speaking at the mic you just

279
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:06,180
speak your name and remain teenager

280
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,180
since I'm saying

281
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:16,740
the next type of requirement is on

282
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:20,079
application data there's been

283
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:22,840
requirements put perform 60s among

284
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:27,390
others to transfer application data in

285
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:30,610
the protocol for exam for example

286
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:32,650
authorization tokens this could also be

287
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,810
transferred outside of the protocol but

288
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:38,310
transferring them in this protocol give

289
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:41,939
benefits even if it's not protected and

290
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:44,709
for later messages it might be protected

291
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:47,740
so example this type of application data

292
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:50,980
is authorization information that has PA

293
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:54,100
proof of possession tokens authorization

294
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:59,580
vultures could also be certificate

295
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:02,520
enrollment request and there's been

296
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:06,010
requests from academia to have the

297
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:08,560
strict requirements for this so you can

298
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,990
verify in formal verification saying if

299
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:17,140
any protocol fulfills these requirements

300
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:18,670
or not it sounds like you have some

301
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,230
discussions later but this is actually

302
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:21,640
quite it seems like quite a subtle point

303
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:23,560
to describe is a key requirement is

304
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,960
right exactly how it specially bound in

305
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,949
you know cetera right is it like in

306
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,470
particular just part of the protocol

307
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,480
transcript in like as a so-so probably

308
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:34,590
have to like really define I something

309
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:41,890
like carrying it is easy um it's it's

310
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:44,770
carrying a safe weight sorry yeah then

311
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:48,880
light weight light weight is a big

312
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:51,610
discussion in itself but as the both and

313
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
SEC dispatch interim focused very

314
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:56,020
heavily on

315
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:02,850
lightweight ready protocols we are not

316
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:06,550
repeating that as now main things that

317
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:08,440
may be main highlights of what life it

318
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:12,129
should mean is that it should have a few

319
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:15,340
round trips few messages if you increase

320
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:19,680
it to more messages it takes

321
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,679
in some cases it increases the latency

322
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,680
significantly

323
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:31,029
and two of the radio technologies that

324
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:35,139
has as a need for a lightweight aks

325
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:40,059
lauraball and 66 Laura Vaughn has very

326
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:43,449
small frames and then it also depends

327
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:45,940
what kind of things do you put in them

328
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,749
except the vacay a number that was

329
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:54,460
mentioned for Laura one was 54 bytes for

330
00:17:49,749 --> 00:17:57,639
payload 60 is a bit more complicated

331
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,269
than the amount of payload depends on

332
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:03,360
the amount of hops estimates for five

333
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:09,399
hopes are similar to Laura bond around

334
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:14,799
54 bytes but that decreases for each

335
00:18:09,399 --> 00:18:18,729
hope you want to support now the

336
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:23,139
requirement is processing memory and

337
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:26,289
especially code size yes

338
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:28,449
so from the jabber Julian Catalano says

339
00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:37,929
actually Laura one can go down to 11

340
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:40,299
bytes u.s. regulation yeah yeah so 54

341
00:18:37,929 --> 00:18:43,899
bytes is not the lowest Laura Boehm

342
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:47,139
I don't know if it's possible to support

343
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:49,149
11 there's these are just example of

344
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:50,889
constrain right away there is Laura bond

345
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:53,768
can be even more constrained you have

346
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:55,330
six folks that have eight byte there's

347
00:18:53,769 --> 00:18:58,059
probably audio radio technologies

348
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:04,749
current and future that will also be

349
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:07,710
more or less constrained but did they

350
00:19:04,749 --> 00:19:10,659
drop the requirements draft has

351
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:12,580
substantially expanded this and try to

352
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:15,720
put down the information from that was

353
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:18,549
discussed in the buff and six dispar

354
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,200
Richard is reference so I think you may

355
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,110
be able to be a bit more specific on

356
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:25,330
that first one I think all the

357
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:27,580
candidates one might imagine plugging in

358
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:31,269
here are basically three message

359
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:32,918
protocols so I think focusing the work

360
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,159
here on like a one and a half hour tt

361
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:36,340
sort of framework would be it seems like

362
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:40,090
it

363
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:44,620
all constraints me I think messages here

364
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:48,399
more applied to lower layer messages

365
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:51,729
softer fragmentation whenever which

366
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,590
might happen on different layers boy so

367
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:56,440
three message protocols work fine when

368
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,240
the lower layer is reliable a bit more

369
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:00,730
tricky to implement when the lower layer

370
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,700
is UDP or something so unless you're

371
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:06,909
going to say it's TCP or something

372
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:08,320
reliable I am not sure if we can just

373
00:20:06,909 --> 00:20:15,669
put the number three there

374
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:17,320
I mean details one two is three are in

375
00:20:15,669 --> 00:20:18,159
can do three messages I think any you

376
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,570
can as long as you have reasonable

377
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,480
assumptions about retransmitted

378
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:28,230
knowledge mate you can do it in three no

379
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,200
somos it can you talk to the mic please

380
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:34,539
so you will do the retransmission and

381
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,159
acknowledgement that at the layer of the

382
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:37,750
key exchange then yeah sure

383
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,429
so basically I mean if you look at the

384
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,140
details one for details one to design

385
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:46,059
you can see this or basically on

386
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:47,679
basically the the the person transmitted

387
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:49,149
last rise that drives right drives the

388
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,649
transmission except for like I said for

389
00:20:49,149 --> 00:20:52,629
the last light which is just a tail and

390
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,699
then the and so like and then the

391
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:56,020
thermistor protocol the server basically

392
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,159
the server basically view transmits

393
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,240
until it receives the until receives a

394
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:01,990
client's message and then it just stops

395
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,190
I didn't I didn't say it's not a pain

396
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,490
I'm just saying you don't need it only

397
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:10,000
solicit acts right um so um I mean like

398
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:12,779
I mean I mean you can do it on about

399
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:15,309
things good about I'm just as possible I

400
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:16,240
think you know in this requirements talk

401
00:21:15,309 --> 00:21:22,299
when you could make a distinction

402
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:24,279
between like a clear round trips like in

403
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,470
other context I say application they're

404
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:28,600
round trips and like transport round

405
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,360
trips like I think we probably agree

406
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,149
that like one and a half hour TT at the

407
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,969
logical ache layer is probably worth

408
00:21:34,149 --> 00:21:40,658
welcome sorry even if that requires more

409
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:45,220
machinery underneath you on that I agree

410
00:21:40,659 --> 00:21:47,380
with Richard well it is

411
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,900
Elizabeth just worried about the

412
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:54,190
requirement for three or four messages

413
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:58,059
in IPSec American group in eye coercion

414
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:59,710
one we had three messages exchanges and

415
00:21:58,059 --> 00:22:01,480
it was a real pain because the

416
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:03,730
retransmission logic was to be switched

417
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:06,580
from initiated to responder for the

418
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:09,100
first message and for I question two

419
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:12,100
it was switched for the logic said all

420
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:14,260
the exchanges must have an even number

421
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:18,908
of messages for unreliable protocol it

422
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:23,919
simplifies implementations a lot yeah I

423
00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:27,280
think this is can be a topic for

424
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,929
discussion I think so far I heard what

425
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,830
we have heard from six stitches that

426
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:35,140
they prefer three for example but there

427
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:38,559
are there are trade-offs different also

428
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:47,440
are the trade-offs then that for example

429
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:49,570
P is K hiding and this motion mature

430
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,909
cutoff just regarding the sixties

431
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,860
requirement what you said about three

432
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:56,559
pass we discussed essentially that it

433
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:58,959
would be more preferable to sometimes to

434
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,760
have a four pass protocol if it wouldn't

435
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,919
require fragmentation than a three pass

436
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:19,750
protocol and one message would get

437
00:23:02,919 --> 00:23:23,740
fragmented into into two frames the last

438
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:26,799
slide on a gave frequency how often is

439
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,190
the aka going to run which was a

440
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:31,960
discussion topic on the list I don't

441
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:35,440
remember who raised the question but

442
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:39,490
that's a good question I think it's hard

443
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:44,919
to give an exact answer for all devices

444
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:47,799
in use cases for for the most extreme

445
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:50,350
use cases running a defilement is

446
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,799
probably to have a in the B to start

447
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:57,549
with they are out of scope for Lake as

448
00:23:53,799 --> 00:24:00,129
far as I see it then you can use score

449
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:03,139
without a K

450
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:08,270
typically you will run the gay ones

451
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:11,720
during bootstrapping but then you might

452
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:13,400
you will probably run it more some of

453
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,770
these devices are not very stable they

454
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:20,060
will reboot and then you typically run

455
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:24,310
them depending on how how much you can

456
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:27,020
save in persistent storage Thomas had

457
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:28,520
this an exam I mentioned that before

458
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:33,020
specifically if you care about

459
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,940
efficiency and for example taking the

460
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:36,980
issue of the recovery and how often you

461
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:41,060
run into inter count is obviously

462
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:43,700
important so for example devices that

463
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:46,760
don't have persistent storage is often

464
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:48,470
very difficult because where does the

465
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:50,600
code actually reside right that's

466
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:52,340
hopefully on a persistent storage it

467
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,240
doesn't get sucked in from from the

468
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,520
network and also this when you think

469
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,820
about the impact the key compromise and

470
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,129
that's those recommendations where and

471
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:06,050
you don't mention them explicitly here

472
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:09,560
but which one you mean but they often

473
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:11,300
take into account existing work for

474
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,250
example in web browsers in other in

475
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,780
other environments where their

476
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:16,250
communication situation is somewhat

477
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,590
different also the assumptions about

478
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:21,470
where keys are stored for example in a

479
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:24,320
in a browser cache etc are also

480
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:25,790
different so those need to be looked at

481
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,740
before of a grain of salt

482
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:30,050
I believe so how does just as a reminder

483
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:31,340
before you came in I asked people to try

484
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,720
and stick to clarifying questions until

485
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,100
after this slide I'm gonna do an

486
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,520
adoption Carl and then have this kind of

487
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,760
discussion

488
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:41,540
you didn't you hadn't come in that good

489
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:43,190
when you said but we've time so I'm not

490
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:46,970
yeah I don't know I don't think we need

491
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:49,580
to be strict we do have time so I mean

492
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:51,830
where did this third point on this is

493
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:55,220
obviously a sort of security requirement

494
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:58,669
that we struggle with in MLS as well so

495
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:01,160
on in terms of forward secrecy key

496
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:03,200
compen keep my key compromise namely in

497
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:05,870
terms on internet that is compromised at

498
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,250
point T and for data before point T then

499
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,300
it suffice is simply too rash to the

500
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,040
keys it's not necessary diffie-hellman

501
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,500
is change the diffie-hellman changes

502
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:15,590
required for doing pcs up

503
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:18,310
got my security however on when I say

504
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,310
mr. deverel with that because on if

505
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:25,250
unless you're doing basically um unless

506
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:26,419
unless you're unless you're doing like

507
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,950
continuing registering with the same

508
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,230
condition as president a new connection

509
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,150
you don't actually get pcs because he's

510
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,850
compromised the Fen occasion he's vices

511
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:36,200
to put to to uh screw things up so um I

512
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:37,820
think actually I'm not entirely sure

513
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:40,190
this last this last point is correct

514
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:41,629
um Richard can pull me elaborate more

515
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,610
but I know it was quite an issue yeah I

516
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:45,590
was just gonna say that you know this

517
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:49,399
this is a requirement on the aq that

518
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,570
it's going to need a little bit of but

519
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,210
it's going to need a little bit of

520
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,770
precision because it's just framing us

521
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:57,020
in terms of like existing or send the

522
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,879
existing technology yeah we're gonna

523
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,950
need to distinguish rather we need like

524
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,900
a session resumption thing something

525
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,030
that's like session resumption in TOS or

526
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,980
something that's like key update in TLS

527
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:11,139
that just hash ratchets forward or

528
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:13,400
something that's like pcs updates in MLS

529
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:15,080
right because those are fairly different

530
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,490
shapes in the protocol and so

531
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,080
understanding which of those ends up as

532
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,560
a requirement in this is going to be

533
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,300
important as I understand it Oh score

534
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,010
already supports effectively hash

535
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,620
ratcheting um though I'm trying to

536
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,390
resign and may not be a traction but it

537
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,379
doesn't say I guess because does think

538
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:32,150
this is a master key I guess you

539
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,740
actually rush it forward is it a ratchet

540
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,090
or is it like as like more like session

541
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:42,830
recite some more like one two session

542
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:44,000
assumption remember as a reminder if you

543
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:48,860
can say your name and you got a mic

544
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,130
that'll be great yeah

545
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,530
so in the in the reboot scenario we

546
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,920
probably have just assumed that there is

547
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:02,500
no state to fall back on so then a

548
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:07,760
hashing solution probably does not work

549
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:09,260
but that's a very good good thing I

550
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,540
don't remember what the requirements

551
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:15,230
documents assess it might be have to be

552
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,980
formulated in more norm diffie-hellman

553
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,980
terms

554
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:24,800
requirements cited here for be a

555
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,199
scientist and uncie is recommendation

556
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:32,029
requirements for

557
00:28:26,199 --> 00:28:34,849
IPSec which they don't remember if it

558
00:28:32,029 --> 00:28:37,999
BSI or ANSI but for IPSec they recommend

559
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:42,769
doing it if Hellman every hour that's

560
00:28:37,999 --> 00:28:44,979
not doable for constraint IOT but

561
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:47,959
probably the constraint IOT should

562
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:50,569
protect their keys they should do the

563
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:53,659
fireman or retching more often than

564
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:55,489
their time 10-year life cycle right so

565
00:28:53,659 --> 00:28:58,999
this actually I think is like quite an

566
00:28:55,489 --> 00:29:01,969
important point which is that um because

567
00:28:58,999 --> 00:29:06,469
we're also trying to minimize on you

568
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:10,519
know bandwidth and computation if the

569
00:29:06,469 --> 00:29:12,859
purpose is having pcs or or or DL memory

570
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,299
refresh in any case then what you really

571
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:16,218
need is saying smells much more like

572
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:17,418
tail a session resumption because you

573
00:29:16,219 --> 00:29:18,979
want to do just that if you helmet but

574
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:21,229
you don't want to incur the RPK

575
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:23,079
authentication cost the the signature or

576
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:25,459
the set of the second diffie-hellman um

577
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:27,139
or I guess third if you hum in but you

578
00:29:25,459 --> 00:29:29,659
go I baby that's right I'm gonna like a

579
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:31,188
signal type to be the same type protocol

580
00:29:29,659 --> 00:29:34,219
right has basically three four key

581
00:29:31,189 --> 00:29:35,509
operations as opposed to one and so if

582
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:36,799
what you want to do is keep you fresh

583
00:29:35,509 --> 00:29:38,659
but you're not concerned about you

584
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,219
aren't going with us right so um so I

585
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,469
think they're definitely a sharp in this

586
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:44,569
point if we think if we if we think I

587
00:29:42,469 --> 00:29:46,279
sort of read this is background material

588
00:29:44,569 --> 00:29:47,418
in terms of like on this because the

589
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:49,009
questions are frequency often come up in

590
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:50,329
there like how why does it really have

591
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:51,889
to be because you didn't like once a

592
00:29:50,329 --> 00:29:53,299
year so who cares right but if this is

593
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:54,738
actually a set of requirements that it's

594
00:29:53,299 --> 00:29:56,899
like no you have to support like you

595
00:29:54,739 --> 00:29:58,189
know refresh you know running it in the

596
00:29:56,899 --> 00:29:59,718
egg every every two hours or every day

597
00:29:58,189 --> 00:30:01,399
or whatever it is then actually it

598
00:29:59,719 --> 00:30:03,109
becomes quite important to have to

599
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,008
bootstrap for me from the boots jump

600
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:06,589
from the full public key authentication

601
00:30:04,009 --> 00:30:07,999
into a kind of presumption mode we only

602
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:10,609
do a few elements so like that's a

603
00:30:07,999 --> 00:30:13,569
requirement five to sharpen up yeah so

604
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:15,859
this would be this would be a full

605
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:17,769
authentication this could be definitive

606
00:30:15,859 --> 00:30:23,629
so by a resumption

607
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:26,749
good mood so I'm wondering if if we can

608
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:29,389
have this possibility where the server

609
00:30:26,749 --> 00:30:31,789
or one of the parties can decide on how

610
00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:34,399
frequently this is done if if the server

611
00:30:31,789 --> 00:30:36,759
for example knows information about the

612
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,770
device whether you know it's

613
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:41,780
battery-operated and cannot do

614
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:45,139
Kirra fresh let's say more than once

615
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:47,178
once a day or once in a week it can

616
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,510
choose and then then the other side has

617
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:56,240
to kind of follow that yeah that's a

618
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:59,330
good point that if there is that

619
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:05,330
definitely needs to be agreed somehow

620
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:07,939
either in band or auto bania but or what

621
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:10,010
I was thinking is one party is the one

622
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,110
that decides how frequently this is done

623
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:13,520
you know at least in my mind it would be

624
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:15,439
this over that decides how how

625
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:17,600
frequently this update is done based on

626
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:22,850
information it has about the flying

627
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:24,919
device yeah but I don't know the co

628
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:29,080
absorber might be the constrain one so

629
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:43,340
it's I don't know it's lying server is

630
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:46,610
but one of the notes yes giving it to

631
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,990
Ricky it's actually you say some pretty

632
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:50,780
does IPSec in one hour

633
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:52,250
that's very frequently I think more

634
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,710
common is eight hours in VPN

635
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:57,800
environments and this is not VPN this is

636
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:59,540
very low bandwidth low base account I

637
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:02,030
would expect them to do

638
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,170
Ricky very seldom be like like a once a

639
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,970
week or something like that and they'll

640
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,340
be have to do about what are we

641
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:12,320
protecting against I mean if you are

642
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:14,780
sending ten packets during the week what

643
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,300
is the you know the benefit for attacker

644
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:19,460
to actually be able to decrypt those and

645
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:24,020
the next question is that in some cases

646
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:25,640
the keys are that required we know so of

647
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:28,100
course one of the benefits there is to

648
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:29,929
do frequent Ricky's is that if one of

649
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:32,389
the device is stolen and the case is

650
00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:34,040
extracted from the device but then we

651
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,400
intended a rekeying is much more

652
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:39,409
expensive than such 24 because you have

653
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,490
to talk to each other if you have to

654
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,370
wake up every device in the network

655
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,950
change the key so it's not that easy

656
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:47,780
thing and in for example IPSec we

657
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,010
decided so that we actually be hey Mike

658
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,510
person want to be had all of this you

659
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,950
know we have to do Ricky every eight

660
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,690
hours we have to do this and we chose

661
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,580
negotiate it and then we these are the

662
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:57,980
actually completely because we

663
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:59,689
don't need to do that either range has

664
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,700
their own policy they decided to do

665
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,169
Ricky they can imitate Ricky whenever

666
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,389
they eat and if they might have a

667
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:06,889
completely different policy so one in

668
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:09,709
Mike said that okay I do it every hour

669
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:11,360
because I I could do that the other one

670
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:14,480
says okay I do it after the four

671
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,549
gigabytes and whichever you know reaches

672
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,019
first he's called the unfortunate anyway

673
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:20,029
the one who has all of our policies

674
00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,230
contain forces anyway so that's going to

675
00:33:20,029 --> 00:33:23,690
be a similar kind of things would be

676
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:26,330
used here yeah that's a good point

677
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:28,370
and not meaning that this is taking as a

678
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:30,769
counter example to many IOT devices

679
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:33,229
today that use a PS k don't dude if they

680
00:33:30,769 --> 00:33:36,950
have mind Eddie use that PS k for for

681
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:39,649
ten years until the battery dies so I

682
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:42,259
agree with that oh maybe we shouldn't

683
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:44,649
set the time but rather one side can

684
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:48,230
offer and other side can always reject

685
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:53,350
yeah and in the policy my top P time it

686
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:53,350
might be number of encrypted data also

687
00:33:54,850 --> 00:34:04,009
so lightweight aka reduces the network

688
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:07,000
formation time for for example six dish

689
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:10,790
we have a lot of typically deploy a

690
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:15,918
number of devices and they all want to

691
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:19,210
connect at the same time when they

692
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:25,969
reboot you want to have them too quickly

693
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:29,119
reestablish security yeah and keep

694
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:32,750
renewal we already spoken about I think

695
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,500
that this summary of the requirements

696
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:39,469
document as it is today there's still a

697
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:41,319
lot of discussed and to specify better

698
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:43,759
but I think it's a good start

699
00:34:41,319 --> 00:34:47,000
ok thanks thanks John you can sit down

700
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,339
from it or not or whichever you like for

701
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,869
a minute yes so we're planning to do is

702
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,279
just find out how many people have read

703
00:34:50,869 --> 00:34:55,639
this see if there's a sense in the room

704
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:57,079
that we want to adopt this ask a couple

705
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,599
questions about process do we want to

706
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:01,010
use github issues that kind of thing and

707
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,690
then kind of have out the actual

708
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:04,640
substantive requirements discussion and

709
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,410
so on so is that ok I could you want it

710
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,100
yeah

711
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:11,020
think so um before we do that are you

712
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,400
know yeah are you taking Holmes to think

713
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,840
maybe like some come some predicate

714
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,860
questions before you do that or do you

715
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:21,100
want a discussion on the topic of

716
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:22,390
adoption yeah so I think I guess um so I

717
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,589
think this is a concern I agree with

718
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:28,779
John I think and I guess um I think that

719
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:30,520
the the the process question I think it

720
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,290
is like because we're not publishing RFC

721
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,150
we're gonna have to at some point where

722
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:35,770
were like hey this is like done um and

723
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:39,270
then we're like turning to do a

724
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:42,970
selection process right on so um like um

725
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:43,900
so I think the the the question then is

726
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,859
like what the home for adoption means

727
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,080
and hundred-dollar means the

728
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,280
conventional thing which is that um you

729
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,150
know this is we're taking this audience

730
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,440
you can store the becomes a working

731
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,700
document and we work on it for a while

732
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,840
and at some point the future we're gonna

733
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,520
have like a discussion about is this

734
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,920
done enough to destruction process then

735
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:58,270
like let's adopt I'm in favor if it if

736
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,720
the honey is hey this is like really a

737
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:03,460
selection process that um so um can you

738
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:05,439
repeat the one you don't like if the if

739
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:06,430
the humming for is oh this is done

740
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,590
enough to start doing a selection

741
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:11,049
process then I'm not in favor of that um

742
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:13,180
so um but like I said I think it's a go

743
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:14,950
starting if the hum is let's take it on

744
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,569
as a working document and then refine it

745
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:18,129
for a while and then decide we're ready

746
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:23,440
to select then on playing board things

747
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:24,730
yeah we're in your happy mode yes yeah

748
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,350
so it's the first one the one that

749
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:30,430
Becker likes okay so any other questions

750
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:32,319
about that before we're so we're gonna

751
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:33,310
have a home just if first actually I

752
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:40,240
backed out how many people have read

753
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:42,480
this document including previous

754
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:44,529
versions is that good anymore

755
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,430
okay so there's about a dozen or so

756
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:51,730
great so we have a home to say do we

757
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:53,740
think this is ready to adopt as a indem

758
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:55,120
that's with the cavity of the backer had

759
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:56,470
that we're gonna work on it and then do

760
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,720
a working a bass call type thing later

761
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,819
before we do funny selection I wanted

762
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,540
add we had two more of on Jabbar thank

763
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,420
you so the question will be do we want

764
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,890
to adopt those drafts to be home yes

765
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,550
then he'll know so if you want to adopt

766
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:16,509
this Taft

767
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:18,070
please home now thank you if you think

768
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,180
we should not adopt yeah don't tell us

769
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:22,360
how many Jeffery

770
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:25,930
plus three in jabber

771
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:32,550
thank you if you think we should not

772
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:32,549
adopt this draft please home now and

773
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,990
nothing in Jabra I can see that great

774
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,060
sound silent from back here yeah me too

775
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:41,229
that's great because I've got a little

776
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:42,910
way we would have had to panic because

777
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,280
what we'd be doing for the rest of the

778
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:48,279
day and great so we're gonna do that

779
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,690
how do people want to handle kind of

780
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,640
issue tracking or not know that we just

781
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,980
uses mailing lists or do people want to

782
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,569
do other things like with github and

783
00:37:53,980 --> 00:38:05,920
issues please give us your thoughts

784
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:08,860
I would like github okay

785
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,520
and and so to use the issue tracking in

786
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:14,980
github yeah I would at least prefer if

787
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,450
we had issues recorded and get out so I

788
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:18,670
could like pull up a list of what's

789
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:19,839
outstanding I mean as far as discussion

790
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,440
of issues I'm happy to have that on the

791
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:25,990
mailing list or and github or whatever

792
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:30,280
okay so will will cause that to happen

793
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:32,020
or find somebody's do it for us I think

794
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,940
that's the only process e type thing for

795
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:36,540
now so now I guess the question is the

796
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,860
discussion of the actual requirements so

797
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,290
John has a couple more slides unless

798
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:42,370
we've gotten some mail from echo

799
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,990
recently so there's probably a couple

800
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:47,700
topics to bring up so we'd like to have

801
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:47,700
this question of those now please

802
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,370
remember now is it in the next year 45

803
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:55,090
minutes yeah yeah mister let him finish

804
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:57,100
the slides first

805
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:58,540
so are there any ground rules we want to

806
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:02,860
set up as we're teeing up the topics

807
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:05,080
about how to field questions free answer

808
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,280
is no is what I mean that's I I think

809
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,279
the answer is no but I'm not quite sure

810
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,510
what your question was I'm just asking

811
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,070
because we talked about clarifying

812
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:14,650
questions we did not really kind of

813
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:21,960
follow that so go for a free-for-all

814
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:27,250
yeah yep so these are discussion topics

815
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:30,460
mostly from Kartik poster on the list in

816
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:32,720
different one about static D H

817
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:37,550
requirements then

818
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:41,000
Khattak posted a review on different

819
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:44,630
security properties the echo poster

820
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,369
review today or at least comments these

821
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:48,829
discussion topics has not been updated

822
00:39:46,369 --> 00:39:59,180
to cover that but I think we have time

823
00:39:48,829 --> 00:40:02,510
for to discuss yeah yeah so one

824
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:06,910
discussion is shall we use static

825
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:12,260
diffie-hellman key sand and then how

826
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:14,299
this was something me and Joran started

827
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,710
and working on in the ad hoc document

828
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,790
before summer

829
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:22,730
we then Karthik posted on the list that

830
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:26,140
this is independently that this is a

831
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:30,230
good idea and for the latest version of

832
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:34,549
Ed hoc we included that arrow keys used

833
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:39,920
her as reference it's but it's not

834
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:43,520
essential for the discussion and the

835
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:48,130
reason by both we and Karthik think that

836
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,170
static diffie-hellman keys should be

837
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:53,770
it's more a solution but why it should

838
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:57,560
be considered is that it significantly

839
00:40:53,770 --> 00:41:01,730
reduces it can reduce their overhead

840
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:05,420
when you use a symmetric keys and this

841
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:08,750
is especially when you use or PK the

842
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:12,490
relative differences between signature a

843
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:15,800
K and the static diffie-hellman a K is

844
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:18,348
substantial so here as an example this

845
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:24,140
are the examples from the ED hook

846
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:28,579
document so here is here is the RPK

847
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:30,680
with signature and here is the RPK with

848
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:32,839
static diffie-hellman keys and you

849
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:39,970
almost get down to what you get with a

850
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:39,970
PS k are you assuming CCM 18 here

851
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,950
not heed hook is using that but this

852
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,530
doesn't assume anything well I I guess

853
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,810
um

854
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:55,310
right on I think so I think I think I

855
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:59,290
think there is um there's a

856
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:59,290
consideration here which is that the

857
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,140
certainly in tell us and I think in

858
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:08,390
deadlock as well on the negotiation is

859
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:15,049
partly protected via the signature over

860
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:16,850
the transcript and um and so the on and

861
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,010
and so an attacker can't downgrade your

862
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:22,190
symmetric-key symmetric keys however in

863
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:24,500
this mode the only signature protection

864
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:27,980
is provided by these by the symmetric

865
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:31,820
cipher suite and so and so basically in

866
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:34,940
um so if you're using CCM a you only had

867
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:39,080
a 64 bits of security against NC

868
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:41,390
downgrade right and so on and so it

869
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:44,150
seems like basically and thats protest

870
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,460
less than a shoo-in on in this engine as

871
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:47,780
I say because because um because the way

872
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:50,870
a tax design is really would be in TLS

873
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,280
like I say on but um I don't sure so I

874
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:53,509
guess I'm nitpicking because I think you

875
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,430
Office Lee get you obviously guess is

876
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,690
the actual advantage with if you Almon

877
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:58,100
that you do it they do over a person

878
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:00,470
issues I'm not sure it's quite as large

879
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,210
as this um because I think I think you I

880
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:05,330
think you'd want to use like a like a

881
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:09,010
like a 20 octet or 32 octet Mac rather

882
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:11,180
than simply they ate out at Mac only

883
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:13,730
storage for the transfer transcript Mac

884
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:17,509
on the on I think where that actually

885
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:18,920
brings me to I think is is um is the

886
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,470
bigger point which what the requirement

887
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:24,250
looks like which is which is what is the

888
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:27,319
sort of guarantee that the

889
00:43:24,250 --> 00:43:30,980
this RUC guarantee the see you see or CR

890
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:32,750
Garrett or CK guarantees of the of the

891
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,700
eight versus the guarantees of the of

892
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:40,250
the transport protocol yep I think

893
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:43,160
bigger max can be discussed in general

894
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:47,180
also for any PS camel do you want the

895
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,609
same length of Mac in the authentication

896
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:50,810
as you want in the not doing that I'm

897
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:52,610
concerned about that as well yeah I

898
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:57,259
think I think basically that

899
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:59,060
um having an ache were the only security

900
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:03,800
for the anti downgrade is provided by

901
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:06,220
the it's provided by the but by that by

902
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,600
the channel but application security

903
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:10,580
transport gives you a Streamy weekend

904
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,720
young great defense right because it

905
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,730
means that you're basically it's only

906
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,180
the strong is the integrity check on the

907
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:20,300
on the on the record layer whereas

908
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:21,259
whereas if you have a arm whereas you

909
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,880
have either's injury the entire

910
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:24,230
transcript or you have a strong knock of

911
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,400
the entire transcript then you're strong

912
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:27,020
even if you're extraordinarily weak

913
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,730
record layer and I guess Michael here

914
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:30,740
right as a magic imagine you had like a

915
00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:32,870
record layer were like no integrity um

916
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:34,879
or you had one with you know 32 bits of

917
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:36,710
into a check so now you have a million

918
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:39,610
generator all in there are in the PSK

919
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,660
case um whereas you would in our PJs

920
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:44,290
again assuming it's only sign the whole

921
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:47,750
transport I think does yeah it might be

922
00:44:44,290 --> 00:44:49,970
might be reason to allow different Mac

923
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:53,930
sizes in the different but it's also I

924
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:58,689
think I said 54 before where I think 45

925
00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:01,640
is the number in close to the available

926
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,280
payload size in both Laura bond and six

927
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:08,990
dish with five hopes so it might be if

928
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:11,210
you go to 16 bit if byte Mac in the PSK

929
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:12,950
you you need to change to fruit 2 frames

930
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:15,560
then the question is is that it were

931
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,970
yeah yeah I think my guess yeah I mean

932
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:20,450
so I guess also important distinguish

933
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:24,049
between the the transport level Mac and

934
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:25,910
the eighth level Mac right so um so some

935
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:28,520
some protocols like like I mean I think

936
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:29,990
like so so it's it's it's quite possible

937
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,420
say look we're just gonna absorb an

938
00:45:29,990 --> 00:45:34,009
extra an extra Mac only in the handshake

939
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,260
messages but we're not gonna it in every

940
00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:37,760
message I mean it and so like one

941
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:38,930
advantage that is then you can have you

942
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,280
can have extraordinary just Brit

943
00:45:38,930 --> 00:45:41,870
security security value for the

944
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:44,870
handshake in for that for the transport

945
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:46,370
layers yeah so is that issue captured

946
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:48,080
somewhere in one of the male's that

947
00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,299
somebody's enter in the document um I

948
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:54,350
think I don't think so cuz like on isn't

949
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:55,850
because not cuz I didn't but I mean the

950
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,440
document is any count great right dozen

951
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:59,060
really define me hunger it is and so now

952
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:03,350
probably so probably that so I can find

953
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:04,759
a file an issue when this is sure to

954
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:06,380
clarify what any down really means

955
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:09,110
because actually it's actually it's um

956
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,210
subtle so I did note in my comments the

957
00:46:09,110 --> 00:46:14,930
a downgrade on doesn't apply to this

958
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:16,100
annotation scheme because obviously is

959
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:18,319
what printing you from down being

960
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,610
downright in the first place but so it's

961
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:21,980
like just important to like clarify what

962
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,620
a downgrade means um and and and what it

963
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,520
defends against want those not Terro I

964
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:41,089
don't know did you cover that in a

965
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:43,640
minutes Troy yeah so basically with

966
00:46:41,090 --> 00:46:45,800
static definite Hammond as I already

967
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:51,770
said the signature is basically changed

968
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:55,400
to connect and there is numbers

969
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:57,710
different ways of formatting this the

970
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,790
messages and doing iteration

971
00:46:57,710 --> 00:47:07,250
that's not important for them

972
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:09,650
requirement discussions but I think the

973
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,950
important discussion here should we work

974
00:47:09,650 --> 00:47:16,700
on a solution that supports static

975
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:20,299
diffie-hellman keys especially for his K

976
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:25,250
for all K and my feeling and the feeling

977
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:28,610
from Karthik is yes we should I think

978
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:31,280
the solution needs to be chaotic system

979
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:34,640
was that maybe we can only do static

980
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:37,040
diffie-hellman key I think that in some

981
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:39,589
theoretical sense that would be good but

982
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,320
I think we we will probably need to

983
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:47,360
support PSK six dishes today built on

984
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:50,390
PSK signature x.509 signature is

985
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:53,000
typically based on signature keys I

986
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:55,700
don't know if all see a support if you

987
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,350
have mom start to give Helen well I I

988
00:47:55,700 --> 00:48:04,220
agree I think we should I think I think

989
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:06,080
it was somebody else know what I was

990
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:08,209
gonna say it's like I wonder if if like

991
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:10,310
there's an underlying extensibility

992
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:12,380
requirement and there's there's some

993
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:14,870
semi static drafts in TLS working group

994
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:16,790
right now that are basically taking

995
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,850
advantage of the extensibility that TLS

996
00:48:16,790 --> 00:48:20,810
has in the signature types and in the

997
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:23,000
public key type so you

998
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:25,880
put in certificates to make it very

999
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,170
quite seamless how you can take what was

1000
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:30,740
originally a signature based protocol

1001
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:34,640
and swap out signatures for us sending

1002
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:36,080
static max so a though that was gonna I

1003
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:37,879
was have a general comment about

1004
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,650
extensibility but it seems like ensuring

1005
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:42,110
we have extensibility in signature types

1006
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:46,520
and public key types might solve this

1007
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:47,810
problem for us I think that's probably

1008
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,130
true I was gonna saying different

1009
00:48:47,810 --> 00:48:51,710
they're not necessarily conflicting

1010
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,750
which is um I think we clearly are gonna

1011
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,890
need to have both city I we really need

1012
00:48:53,750 --> 00:48:56,360
is a signature store works just get away

1013
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:00,910
too many cases people not gonna have to

1014
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:06,020
feel my keys right and and I don't think

1015
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:07,339
and and I think like it'd be good to

1016
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,590
support actually filmin I think would be

1017
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:11,210
egg okay I mean like you know we got

1018
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,560
like like you know six months ago

1019
00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:13,880
instead heard of this we like work

1020
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,600
talking a sexy feel min so like we

1021
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,010
thought it was good enough that's

1022
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:18,350
integer so but maybe it's not like a

1023
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:19,550
hard worker but obviously if I'm we're

1024
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:20,660
gonna have to obviously the size issue

1025
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,890
or earlier but obviously cuz you're

1026
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:23,330
substantial size advantage so it's worth

1027
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:26,120
be it'd be really good to be able to

1028
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:30,590
support it on the on I don't think I

1029
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:32,390
don't I think so and I don't think it

1030
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:35,740
makes sense to only so yeah I think that

1031
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:37,089
they'll be good as will support it the

1032
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:42,680
RPK

1033
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:47,600
say um yeah I think we should support

1034
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,399
one like this is correct so yeah so it

1035
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,650
seems to be I think the whole

1036
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:56,540
requirements is probably to support PSK

1037
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:57,280
and the certificates with signatures

1038
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,350
them

1039
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,890
static development kids come from

1040
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:08,860
requirements to try to optimize the

1041
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:08,859
message overhead as much as possible

1042
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:17,270
then second bullet here is how much

1043
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:20,410
flexibility in using different types of

1044
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:25,370
public key credentials we should allow

1045
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:29,870
and what our requirements for that has

1046
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:32,540
been requirement Mitchell Michael

1047
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:33,750
Richardson has expressed expressed that

1048
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,109
he he

1049
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:42,810
mode like the solution to support mixed

1050
00:50:37,109 --> 00:50:44,069
or PK certificate authentication so one

1051
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,590
party attempt gauge with his

1052
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:54,780
certificates one party attends with the

1053
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:56,820
or PK I had picture that earlier if you

1054
00:50:54,780 --> 00:51:02,460
believe done that static development

1055
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:05,810
Keys will be used with or decay and you

1056
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:09,450
would probably also want to support

1057
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:12,299
signature in one direction and static

1058
00:51:09,450 --> 00:51:17,669
development keys in the other direction

1059
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:29,630
well that's more what follows if you use

1060
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:32,849
that in different keys no comment then

1061
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:36,660
second part here of the discussion item

1062
00:51:32,849 --> 00:51:40,650
is raised by was raised by Karthik

1063
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:46,069
couple of weeks ago he commented on the

1064
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:53,130
protection of the PS PS ki-10 to fire

1065
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:56,520
and in his comment he took current ad

1066
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:59,960
hoc draft as an example where the PS k

1067
00:51:56,520 --> 00:52:02,970
identifier is revealed not

1068
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:08,580
confidentiality protected in message 1

1069
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:10,348
pls do the same thing and the question

1070
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:15,930
here what should the requirements about

1071
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:21,500
this be so but Celtic suggested was to

1072
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:25,980
move the ID identifier for the PS k to

1073
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:30,300
message 3 then you can hide it against

1074
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:32,910
the active attackers but you run into

1075
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,010
other problems might which might be

1076
00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:38,759
worse than the confidential of the PS k

1077
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:40,650
identifier so if you only if you the

1078
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:44,160
protocol seriously by Karthik

1079
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:46,950
then at the end here of message 3 / TV

1080
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:49,609
is not authenticated then you need

1081
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:52,740
to add more messages other aka or

1082
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:54,390
application layer and if you do that

1083
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:57,750
then you don't really have a free

1084
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:59,129
message protocol anymore okay I'm

1085
00:52:57,750 --> 00:53:04,470
assuming you've another slide on this

1086
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:08,760
what do you another slide on this yeah

1087
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,558
following up but yeah yeah well I'm

1088
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,730
sensing I'm saying I may be getting

1089
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,930
ahead of you but I'm sensing your

1090
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:18,809
recommendation is we do not do this

1091
00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:22,859
that's mine yeah I think it needs I

1092
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:24,930
think that should probably for practical

1093
00:53:22,859 --> 00:53:28,348
it would be good to have but for

1094
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:31,740
practical reasons probably it will stay

1095
00:53:28,349 --> 00:53:34,410
as it would be good to have yeah yeah um

1096
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:35,910
I think I think my concern is it is it

1097
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:38,040
distorts the product like it distorts

1098
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,779
the protocol quite a bit and it makes it

1099
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:43,770
hard as you say but you got three forms

1100
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,569
of protocol also means that um that as

1101
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:48,630
you that on some things you might want

1102
00:53:45,569 --> 00:53:50,400
to do um so you alluded earlier the idea

1103
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:54,750
of having application data carried along

1104
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:59,940
with these messages on and in in in in

1105
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:01,109
your in sorry can you can you go back to

1106
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,950
this either one of them any of the

1107
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:06,808
public key verticals yeah perfect um so

1108
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,118
in this protocol right anything you

1109
00:54:06,809 --> 00:54:11,760
anything that V sends to you in message

1110
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:15,720
to is a fennec aidid so at 0 v RT t

1111
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,579
traffic however in but in and and that

1112
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:20,939
would also be true if you had the PS k

1113
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:22,950
in if you the PS k identity in in in in

1114
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:24,480
a message one but now in this case that

1115
00:54:22,950 --> 00:54:26,578
is not true and i have a protocol like

1116
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,960
while we despair it like like under late

1117
00:54:26,579 --> 00:54:29,400
like security security properties

1118
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,020
depending on where you stuff the PS k

1119
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,670
and so I think that like just like like

1120
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:33,990
unless we have like you know we're

1121
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:35,250
attached to do requirements so if

1122
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:36,509
someone comes to us and says you know

1123
00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:37,380
sick petitioner whatever says we

1124
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,180
obviously have to have this property

1125
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:40,559
well we've gotten pretty far like in the

1126
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:42,210
IETF or that reckoning this property and

1127
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,160
I think like this is like gonna make our

1128
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,569
lives pretty miserable so I'm not in

1129
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,109
favor unless someone comes and says hard

1130
00:54:45,569 --> 00:54:50,940
wiring for their application yeah I

1131
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:53,759
agree I don't think we should expand

1132
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:56,819
this to full message party for this

1133
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,430
reason if there's any other reasons to

1134
00:54:56,819 --> 00:55:05,770
expand it then this can be discussed but

1135
00:55:00,430 --> 00:55:10,029
right now I don't think so the next

1136
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:14,310
slide is so this is following up Celtx

1137
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:16,510
and review of the requirement draft

1138
00:55:14,310 --> 00:55:19,650
couple of days ago I think it was

1139
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:22,870
beginning probably Monday this week and

1140
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:28,500
he suggested that the requirement

1141
00:55:22,870 --> 00:55:32,380
dropped described the desirous gold of

1142
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:37,480
identifying information in in general

1143
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:40,810
and he suggested four different levels

1144
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:42,490
where level serie would be all

1145
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:45,480
identifying information should be

1146
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:51,700
protect against passive network

1147
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:54,040
adversary's one is information from one

1148
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:58,020
device should be protected from active

1149
00:55:54,040 --> 00:56:00,730
network attackers and to both by

1150
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:07,450
information from both devices active

1151
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:10,720
attackers and identify information must

1152
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:15,669
be deniable repudiate 11 if the peer is

1153
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:20,529
malicious and yeah going back to I think

1154
00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:26,200
it's good to clarify this stricter I'm

1155
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:29,740
not sure this protocol should we will

1156
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:32,740
reach even zero based on the discussion

1157
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,959
here with the PSK that is in depending

1158
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:37,839
on what you count us identifiable

1159
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,870
information but in general the PSK

1160
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:42,220
identifier would be identifiable

1161
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:46,720
information

1162
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:49,600
if you send there what kind of algorithm

1163
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:53,980
support that might be identifiable

1164
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:57,549
information if you use if you send

1165
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:59,680
sender IDs or TLS connection IDs then

1166
00:56:57,550 --> 00:57:06,490
whatever number you put there might be

1167
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:09,700
identifiable information so I I think

1168
00:57:06,490 --> 00:57:13,990
already zero here might be too strong I

1169
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:16,750
I agree I agree and I don't actually

1170
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:19,330
stand point three that seems like

1171
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:21,310
actually that seems like actually quite

1172
00:57:19,330 --> 00:57:22,900
a strong property in it I don't think

1173
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:26,500
any signature based scheme meets that

1174
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:27,460
property so I mean the um that the

1175
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:29,920
diffie-hellman basically means do of

1176
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,330
course because Yuka because either so I

1177
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,430
can for the transcript the inertia games

1178
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:35,650
do not so I I I do this hierarchies

1179
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:37,060
quite weird um my impression is that

1180
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:38,350
like essentially every ITF protocol this

1181
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,310
is every ITF a Kenny because ever

1182
00:57:38,350 --> 00:57:41,470
designed has this into the same

1183
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:42,490
properties here well except for tails

1184
00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:45,730
one to which I have even worse

1185
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:46,990
properties so I think like we've got a

1186
00:57:45,730 --> 00:57:49,030
consensus about like what these don't

1187
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:50,109
look like which is to say um we don't

1188
00:57:49,030 --> 00:57:51,940
worry too much about finger printing of

1189
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:53,830
the initial messages and we tried it and

1190
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:55,119
we try to do the protection of the

1191
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:56,380
entities the way you described the

1192
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:58,900
described in your document which is to

1193
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:00,700
say that the initiators identity the

1194
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:02,050
funders entities secure as passive

1195
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:03,220
attack attackers the initiators against

1196
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,350
active attackers I think that's where I

1197
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,549
set of trade-offs and I think yes what

1198
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:09,690
your document says so I think like I'm

1199
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:12,730
not sure we have the big a ginger yeah

1200
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:16,240
what I get agree with with Kathy is that

1201
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:19,810
we should document the requirements or

1202
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:22,180
properties that we want in more clear

1203
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:25,770
way I agree with a cure that you should

1204
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:28,660
not probably not choose some of these

1205
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:30,640
these are good better come with this

1206
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,250
properties come with trade-offs that

1207
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,730
goes probably against the lightweight

1208
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:39,250
Ness I think the main main thing we want

1209
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:41,859
to achieve here is like less we don't

1210
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:46,590
want to create the most theoretical

1211
00:58:41,859 --> 00:58:52,660
secure protocol it should definitely be

1212
00:58:46,590 --> 00:58:56,440
very secure but we don't I think this

1213
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:59,640
might go too far or for practical

1214
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:03,070
reasons for example I protecting the

1215
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:06,069
identifier of the PSK comes with a lot

1216
00:59:03,070 --> 00:59:13,690
of other trade-offs in message number of

1217
00:59:06,070 --> 00:59:17,800
messages then third part of this

1218
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:23,230
discussion is security properties and

1219
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:25,420
properties of the application data we go

1220
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,230
to request on the next slide comes

1221
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,990
application data what

1222
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:32,420
request from academia to try to specify

1223
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,720
the security property of this in

1224
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:37,850
requirements growth better so any

1225
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:40,819
solution documents could be for many

1226
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:45,790
formerly analyzed and checked if they

1227
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:45,790
meet the requirement document or not

1228
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:55,930
then Karthik this Monday he sent list

1229
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:58,549
with the request requirement document

1230
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:01,040
contain a lot of security properties

1231
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:03,080
Khattak came with suggestion how they

1232
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,880
should be made more strict and

1233
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:09,950
clarification and some small changes

1234
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:14,119
first so this is taking probiotics mail

1235
01:00:09,950 --> 01:00:19,279
so PFS against key compromised categoric

1236
01:00:14,119 --> 01:00:21,859
against what material and we won't loss

1237
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,320
of the long term key from the initiator

1238
01:00:21,859 --> 01:00:26,810
and their sponsor loss of the thermal

1239
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:31,490
key initiate to respond so bad

1240
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:36,440
RN g and i would say definitely the

1241
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:39,250
first probably not the second and the

1242
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:42,920
third but i don't know if you can easily

1243
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:48,380
if you very easily can get protection

1244
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:49,490
against the bad oranjee sure but yeah

1245
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:51,970
they say this is like car thieves

1246
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:56,299
advertisement for it if a helmet

1247
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:59,799
so um one as you say we are your any

1248
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:02,030
sensible protocol already have um to is

1249
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:05,690
like super hard it basically requires

1250
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:06,830
having basically typically do it is with

1251
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,010
these diffie-hellman protocols where you

1252
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:11,600
say like it the that you listen it's not

1253
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:13,609
a key and therefore and they're in there

1254
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,868
for mo keys compromised that's like

1255
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:16,400
their environment so that's like

1256
01:01:14,869 --> 01:01:17,840
sensible like where the static is like

1257
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:19,400
stored in some little box if i'm what

1258
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:21,530
keys not but it like these environments

1259
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:22,460
is like the same like they're used in

1260
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:25,670
memory so I'm not really worried about

1261
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:27,890
it on the I mean not worried about it

1262
01:01:25,670 --> 01:01:29,240
like like beyond like the you know I

1263
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:31,009
think I'm worried about it but I mean

1264
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:32,359
like I'm not where I don't understand

1265
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:33,740
this a Nereo in these environments where

1266
01:01:32,359 --> 01:01:35,180
like you lose the ephemeral key but not

1267
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:37,970
the static keys other ones much more

1268
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:40,069
likely um the bad rng on the good news

1269
01:01:37,970 --> 01:01:41,089
is we already have a fix for that which

1270
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:43,849
I think would is

1271
01:01:41,089 --> 01:01:45,799
um which is the CFR GT after hardening

1272
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:47,749
randomness and that totally compatible

1273
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:49,609
with the signature based protocols so

1274
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:51,649
but the good news it's not it's a

1275
01:01:49,609 --> 01:01:53,299
compatible protocol change so I think we

1276
01:01:51,650 --> 01:01:55,429
don't need I think we should just like I

1277
01:01:53,299 --> 01:01:56,630
think we should stick with number one is

1278
01:01:55,429 --> 01:01:58,969
obviously requirement number two we

1279
01:01:56,630 --> 01:02:01,039
should nothing about um as a requirement

1280
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:02,719
and number three um like when we finally

1281
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:04,429
get around to writing the protocol it

1282
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:07,669
should like say why don't you just use

1283
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:09,079
that that's it for yeah Chris would just

1284
01:02:07,669 --> 01:02:11,239
to expand on the the basic idea of the

1285
01:02:09,079 --> 01:02:12,949
CFD draft is you take the long term

1286
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:14,359
private key of the responder in this

1287
01:02:12,949 --> 01:02:15,890
particular case and you compute a

1288
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:17,630
function of it you mix that with the

1289
01:02:15,890 --> 01:02:19,459
output from your RNG and then the

1290
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:22,219
security of the like your reminisce is

1291
01:02:19,459 --> 01:02:23,959
the minimum of your bad energy or your

1292
01:02:22,219 --> 01:02:25,369
private key so if your private key is

1293
01:02:23,959 --> 01:02:27,890
exposed and your bad energy everything's

1294
01:02:25,369 --> 01:02:29,269
over everything's bad but if you have

1295
01:02:27,890 --> 01:02:31,699
better energy and you're probably key is

1296
01:02:29,269 --> 01:02:33,678
fine it's always well so I would just

1297
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:36,499
take a look at that draft and it's easy

1298
01:02:33,679 --> 01:02:38,839
to do it's compatible yeah seems like

1299
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:39,769
it's compatible with any solution

1300
01:02:38,839 --> 01:02:41,679
protocol list

1301
01:02:39,769 --> 01:02:49,129
yes it's very protocol agnostic yeah

1302
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:50,539
quite honestly it the first two it

1303
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:53,209
depends a little bit of course on how

1304
01:02:50,539 --> 01:02:56,239
you implement these type of things in

1305
01:02:53,209 --> 01:03:00,379
currently what I've seen people doing

1306
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:03,919
more and more is to separate out the key

1307
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:08,539
exchange implementation from the way how

1308
01:03:03,919 --> 01:03:11,179
you handle the the key storage and so if

1309
01:03:08,539 --> 01:03:13,609
you can properly protect the long-term

1310
01:03:11,179 --> 01:03:16,880
key you will already have two things in

1311
01:03:13,609 --> 01:03:18,259
place to to do the the protection of the

1312
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:21,289
ephemeral key because you just make

1313
01:03:18,259 --> 01:03:23,089
calls and then basically use the keys

1314
01:03:21,289 --> 01:03:25,549
kind of a big keys that's what we're

1315
01:03:23,089 --> 01:03:27,650
doing MPLS we actually separate it those

1316
01:03:25,549 --> 01:03:29,719
out you can actually look how how this

1317
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:32,779
is done in our code I haven't done a

1318
01:03:29,719 --> 01:03:34,489
survey on some of the other embedded

1319
01:03:32,779 --> 01:03:36,319
implementations if they actually allow

1320
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:39,619
you to do the same or where they gloss

1321
01:03:36,319 --> 01:03:41,749
over that issue it was a fairly

1322
01:03:39,619 --> 01:03:44,569
substantial change in a way how you how

1323
01:03:41,749 --> 01:03:46,339
we did the API is but it may be if

1324
01:03:44,569 --> 01:03:48,409
someone has some spare cycles some

1325
01:03:46,339 --> 01:03:50,150
researchers here in the group they could

1326
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:54,049
actually take a look at this it would be

1327
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,100
really interesting to to see how this is

1328
01:03:54,049 --> 01:03:56,509
done and how

1329
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,680
actually make some recommendations to

1330
01:03:56,510 --> 01:03:59,960
improve it like those would be

1331
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,450
practicals in in terms of what people

1332
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:04,280
deployed today and it just as a question

1333
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:06,680
when you did that work where there are

1334
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:08,180
any changes you wish would have been

1335
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:11,919
made to protocols to make that better or

1336
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,919
easier or is it all just implementation

1337
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,839
that wasn't that wasn't really anything

1338
01:04:21,710 --> 01:04:25,550
we like we used that obviously we've

1339
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,170
here less so we didn't had to do any

1340
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:28,730
changes on TLS it was just the

1341
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:31,820
implementation on the way how we pass

1342
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:33,710
around the keys and there obviously if

1343
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:37,550
you want to take into account not just

1344
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:39,740
as software use or a software storage of

1345
01:04:37,550 --> 01:04:41,840
the key like in pure lean software

1346
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:45,080
handling but rather cryptographic

1347
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:49,130
modules then those typically use

1348
01:04:45,080 --> 01:04:50,779
different api's and so used making the

1349
01:04:49,130 --> 01:04:53,830
API to work with all these different

1350
01:04:50,780 --> 01:05:01,460
designs was a little bit tedious but

1351
01:04:53,830 --> 01:05:06,350
yeah yeah seems to be agreement here to

1352
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:23,270
do one not focus on two and reference

1353
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:26,960
the CFR G document for tree then here

1354
01:05:23,270 --> 01:05:29,710
was a request from academia to specify

1355
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:38,230
more clearly their properties of

1356
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:42,380
application data here is suggested

1357
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:44,720
formally requirement for the 80 but that

1358
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:49,610
also this depends a little bit on how

1359
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:53,529
many messages the solution has if you

1360
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:57,470
have a typical three party protocol like

1361
01:05:53,530 --> 01:06:00,800
Sigma I then you get the first matches

1362
01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:03,350
is completely unprotected second message

1363
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:05,360
is confidentiality and integrity

1364
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:08,839
protecting against that passive attacker

1365
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:11,869
and what you can put the message tree

1366
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:14,779
is confidentially integrity protected

1367
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:19,119
and you know who the other party's this

1368
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:25,119
can maybe be specified more clearly acre

1369
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:31,249
yessir doesn't doesn't sound quite right

1370
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:32,749
I think a g2 has confidentiality it gets

1371
01:06:31,249 --> 01:06:34,879
the passive attacker but integrity

1372
01:06:32,749 --> 01:06:39,919
against an active attacker because at

1373
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:42,279
least in Sigma I the g2 is GOI is a

1374
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:44,779
vente cated a message to and therefore

1375
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:47,630
assuming that assuming the client is an

1376
01:06:44,779 --> 01:06:49,940
initiator on you know got the proper GTX

1377
01:06:47,630 --> 01:06:51,349
then there's and then he has integrity

1378
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:53,989
for the data that came from the server

1379
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:59,210
yep um other than that I believe you're

1380
01:06:53,989 --> 01:07:01,190
correct yeah okay yeah this seems like

1381
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:03,049
this seems like like right otherwise

1382
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:06,289
yeah

1383
01:07:03,049 --> 01:07:08,450
but basically this this is for a three

1384
01:07:06,289 --> 01:07:11,450
for three message protocol if you take

1385
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:15,348
Sigma or for example then you get

1386
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:17,299
unprotected unprotected to tree here if

1387
01:07:15,349 --> 01:07:20,839
you take Karthik's protocol and add

1388
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:25,609
something then you get unprotected to

1389
01:07:20,839 --> 01:07:30,859
and then the three day and yeah he's in

1390
01:07:25,609 --> 01:07:32,690
my yeah but I think yeah is the

1391
01:07:30,859 --> 01:07:35,989
authorization request does it contain

1392
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:37,999
just is it kind of only at here please

1393
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:40,069
give me or is there please give me and

1394
01:07:37,999 --> 01:07:42,618
here's a nonce here's some other stuff

1395
01:07:40,069 --> 01:07:44,989
like what's what's in the authorization

1396
01:07:42,619 --> 01:07:46,579
because I think because I'm looking at

1397
01:07:44,989 --> 01:07:48,969
this through sort of like the eyes of

1398
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:51,259
ours and I noticed like the whole dens

1399
01:07:48,969 --> 01:07:54,469
the information you carry in each of

1400
01:07:51,259 --> 01:07:56,539
those tends to be quite important from

1401
01:07:54,469 --> 01:07:58,759
for overall security is not just a-- if

1402
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:01,009
you think about the authorized and that

1403
01:07:58,759 --> 01:08:02,630
the ex doctor request it's not just or

1404
01:08:01,009 --> 01:08:07,910
give me an access token is there's more

1405
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:13,059
than that yeah is that just an example

1406
01:08:07,910 --> 01:08:15,920
how you do would send a certificate

1407
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:19,549
requesting security protocol I think

1408
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:22,489
what sixties want to do is to send the

1409
01:08:19,549 --> 01:08:25,210
token containing

1410
01:08:22,488 --> 01:08:32,839
the actual keys for you to use in the

1411
01:08:25,210 --> 01:08:38,330
security a.k that correct so this is not

1412
01:08:32,839 --> 01:08:43,028
a loss like authorization token this is

1413
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:46,278
just some resembling some token in in

1414
01:08:43,029 --> 01:08:50,089
request one with actual key to use in a

1415
01:08:46,279 --> 01:08:52,130
ki has been discussed so this is a

1416
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:55,100
profile of brewski that we've been

1417
01:08:52,130 --> 01:08:56,330
discussing and this is a profile of

1418
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,390
brewski anonymity as we've been

1419
01:08:56,330 --> 01:09:02,120
discussing and essentially in 81 we

1420
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:06,529
discussed the sending of the voucher

1421
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:13,399
request and getting back the router is

1422
01:09:06,529 --> 01:09:15,710
in 82 essentially so yeah I think this

1423
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:18,108
needs what type of information people

1424
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:22,250
want to send in different messages

1425
01:09:18,109 --> 01:09:26,660
should be discussed simplest it's

1426
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:30,229
completely independent of the aka but I

1427
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:32,469
think in in some cases you want to send

1428
01:09:30,229 --> 01:09:36,169
the key to use in the aka in a

1429
01:09:32,469 --> 01:09:40,040
authorization token the might also be

1430
01:09:36,170 --> 01:09:41,899
sir so that the authorization token when

1431
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:44,060
you use that you want to reuse some of

1432
01:09:41,899 --> 01:09:48,309
the randomness from the a K for example

1433
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:52,219
to save overhead so there yeah so they

1434
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:54,640
um they might not be completely it's

1435
01:09:52,219 --> 01:09:58,580
important that whatever you send in a

1436
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,580
application data does not violate the

1437
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:07,790
security properties of the aka so this

1438
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:12,710
needs to be clarified yeah that actually

1439
01:10:07,790 --> 01:10:18,440
brings up an important point when about

1440
01:10:12,710 --> 01:10:21,020
Petra key separation that the that uh so

1441
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:23,540
I mean the second message especially

1442
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,070
right you want to use different keys to

1443
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:28,850
and safer at the application data and

1444
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:31,280
and safer the contributor so I mean I

1445
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:32,840
think I'm not sure I'll think about how

1446
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:34,309
to document this um this is a nice or

1447
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,530
struggle with as you remember a lot

1448
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:38,139
until us how

1449
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:39,579
write this down but um and and did you

1450
01:10:38,139 --> 01:10:41,920
get it right because of nestea entirely

1451
01:10:39,579 --> 01:10:43,239
but um so I think but trying to like

1452
01:10:41,920 --> 01:10:45,039
there's a lot hidden under the under

1453
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,848
those last two polar points and so we

1454
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,849
should probably figure how to document

1455
01:10:45,849 --> 01:10:50,559
those better yeah I think in typically

1456
01:10:48,849 --> 01:10:53,170
what you send me messages would be

1457
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:55,780
protected completely independent of the

1458
01:10:53,170 --> 01:10:59,139
aka in message too

1459
01:10:55,780 --> 01:11:01,059
I agree it makes sense to a different

1460
01:10:59,139 --> 01:11:04,059
key but that would probably also lead to

1461
01:11:01,059 --> 01:11:06,789
to max which we might not want to have

1462
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:08,260
and then it might not be right yeah I

1463
01:11:06,789 --> 01:11:17,550
think we're going to talk about like

1464
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:21,250
what kind of like CK guarantees yeah I

1465
01:11:17,550 --> 01:11:23,469
think that's it for this discussion I

1466
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:24,880
don't know if there any other discussion

1467
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:29,380
topics that people want to have

1468
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:31,929
otherwise it okay we have we have like

1469
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:34,360
20 minutes so I've got the 61 object

1470
01:11:31,929 --> 01:11:35,380
five minutes remote five minutes maybe

1471
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:36,759
to talk about whether we want to have

1472
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:38,770
inter meetings and stuff like that and

1473
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:41,380
so I think we have like time now to

1474
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:43,539
bring up other issues yeah I think I

1475
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,099
think that one thing that um I think

1476
01:11:43,539 --> 01:11:47,500
we're gonna need to spend time on is

1477
01:11:45,099 --> 01:11:50,949
like trying to sharpen up the sort of

1478
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:56,619
like frontier what's possible um I mean

1479
01:11:50,949 --> 01:11:58,329
like the you know I mean as a little

1480
01:11:56,619 --> 01:12:00,699
discomfort with a sort of like as small

1481
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:02,110
as possible I mean if he I mean a wall

1482
01:12:00,699 --> 01:12:02,949
it is true obviously everybody costs

1483
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,659
they're like we know there were cliffs

1484
01:12:02,949 --> 01:12:06,070
and like try and understand like you

1485
01:12:04,659 --> 01:12:08,679
know what where those clothes are a

1486
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:10,539
little bit of hope because like I just

1487
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:11,829
think like I don't want to do like we're

1488
01:12:10,539 --> 01:12:12,909
seeing this in quick right now is like

1489
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:14,199
you know he's like it's a lot of

1490
01:12:12,909 --> 01:12:15,670
fighting about like how much screwing

1491
01:12:14,199 --> 01:12:16,989
around to do at the very end and I sure

1492
01:12:15,670 --> 01:12:18,429
don't want to be like it were you boss

1493
01:12:16,989 --> 01:12:19,780
call and have like a shard of the

1494
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:21,610
basically someone says well like I like

1495
01:12:19,780 --> 01:12:23,619
I can remember like you know what want

1496
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:25,119
yeah like you know the Chartered risky

1497
01:12:23,619 --> 01:12:26,619
tells us oh my god we got like recycle

1498
01:12:25,119 --> 01:12:28,780
so um I was trying to get a sense of

1499
01:12:26,619 --> 01:12:30,789
like we're the you know like I think I

1500
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,869
think we spent a little the minister

1501
01:12:30,789 --> 01:12:33,099
work the working group so it's great but

1502
01:12:31,869 --> 01:12:34,900
I mean like doesn't I'm trying like

1503
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:42,119
document week like what the requirements

1504
01:12:34,900 --> 01:12:44,230
meeting practice I wasn't clear what

1505
01:12:42,119 --> 01:12:46,329
what's the what's the action following

1506
01:12:44,230 --> 01:12:48,369
from yeah actually I think the action is

1507
01:12:46,329 --> 01:12:49,509
and this was my review a little bit is

1508
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:50,889
that we really

1509
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:55,500
we need to figure out how to like

1510
01:12:50,889 --> 01:12:55,500
sharpen up the size requirements that's

1511
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,610
somewhere else is something I expressed

1512
01:12:57,909 --> 01:13:02,679
a little bit earlier I think that I'm

1513
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:03,909
not totally sure exactly what the form

1514
01:13:02,679 --> 01:13:05,710
this needs to take but I feel like there

1515
01:13:03,909 --> 01:13:08,230
is there should be some requirements in

1516
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:10,119
here around extensibility right clearly

1517
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:13,089
we need certain fourth degree of cipher

1518
01:13:10,119 --> 01:13:16,360
agility at the very minimum meaning some

1519
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:18,280
other forms of extensibility but invite

1520
01:13:16,360 --> 01:13:19,659
I'll try and think about how to put that

1521
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:21,730
more precisely and then send some

1522
01:13:19,659 --> 01:13:23,799
feedback to the list but yeah glad to

1523
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:26,320
think about your what the authors thank

1524
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:28,989
you spell yeah that should be added if

1525
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:33,849
it's not they should be possible to add

1526
01:13:28,989 --> 01:13:36,848
new algorithm a be new ways to

1527
01:13:33,849 --> 01:13:40,210
authenticate may be news ways to

1528
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:42,699
identify credentials and and so on yeah

1529
01:13:40,210 --> 01:13:44,349
an interesting thought experiment might

1530
01:13:42,699 --> 01:13:47,259
be this take question that came up

1531
01:13:44,349 --> 01:13:49,150
earlier like it might be that in an

1532
01:13:47,260 --> 01:13:51,130
initial version of whatever or whatever

1533
01:13:49,150 --> 01:13:53,619
okay we come up with here we don't have

1534
01:13:51,130 --> 01:13:54,539
a baked flavor to it but it might be

1535
01:13:53,619 --> 01:13:56,739
nice if there was sufficient

1536
01:13:54,539 --> 01:13:57,670
extensibility in there that a Paik could

1537
01:13:56,739 --> 01:14:01,928
be fit in later

1538
01:13:57,670 --> 01:14:04,420
mmm I'm not quite sure how to express

1539
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:06,090
that in like requirements language yeah

1540
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:09,579
no that's a good point

1541
01:14:06,090 --> 01:14:11,980
concerning Akers comment I think right

1542
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:13,570
now the document does not it has a lot

1543
01:14:11,980 --> 01:14:16,558
of discussion about the radio protocols

1544
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:20,849
it does not have numbers but I think

1545
01:14:16,559 --> 01:14:23,349
there are numbers that could be put in

1546
01:14:20,849 --> 01:14:26,949
numbers that was discussed during the

1547
01:14:23,349 --> 01:14:32,469
both presentations for example we are

1548
01:14:26,949 --> 01:14:34,719
born if I remember correctly there you

1549
01:14:32,469 --> 01:14:36,670
have to make assumption what kind of

1550
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,199
transport protocols you have in and what

1551
01:14:36,670 --> 01:14:41,409
options you have in these and so on but

1552
01:14:38,199 --> 01:14:47,320
I think number 45 came up something like

1553
01:14:41,409 --> 01:14:50,768
45 maybe was 47 for a single message I

1554
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:54,789
think there are similar numbers for six

1555
01:14:50,769 --> 01:14:56,769
dish if you assume five hopes which

1556
01:14:54,789 --> 01:14:59,559
might be a good assumption

1557
01:14:56,769 --> 01:15:01,719
you should probably discuss but there

1558
01:14:59,559 --> 01:15:03,790
the number of bytes available for the

1559
01:15:01,719 --> 01:15:06,910
body decreases for

1560
01:15:03,790 --> 01:15:10,890
if you have more hopes it increases if

1561
01:15:06,910 --> 01:15:14,680
you have fewer hopes MB IOT is more

1562
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:18,100
flexible then you don't have a very

1563
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:24,000
fixed frame size so but everybody choose

1564
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:33,490
save saves energy and latency and

1565
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:34,540
creates less lost messages so we do have

1566
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:37,719
a few more minutes if there are any

1567
01:15:34,540 --> 01:15:41,160
other topics people want to bring up on

1568
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:50,290
the requirements document right now or

1569
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:52,840
seems like not from the jabber

1570
01:15:50,290 --> 01:15:55,300
yerens has John one question from both

1571
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,280
Karthik and Acker was if post quantum is

1572
01:15:55,300 --> 01:16:06,100
a requirement is this a good time to

1573
01:15:57,280 --> 01:16:09,460
discuss that and yeah my view and your

1574
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:12,310
answer would be posted to them to the

1575
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:15,640
list is that it should be possible to

1576
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:18,730
extend it to post quantum in the future

1577
01:16:15,640 --> 01:16:23,490
I don't think the focus right now in

1578
01:16:18,730 --> 01:16:23,490
Lake should be post Kentucky exchange

1579
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:30,250
yeah I mean III I agree with you I think

1580
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,650
you know we've spent a lot of time like

1581
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:34,600
um you know screwing around with like

1582
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:37,719
like trying to reason out post quantum

1583
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:40,120
and like you know we're nowhere near I

1584
01:16:37,720 --> 01:16:41,200
mean I think I mean certainly there's

1585
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:43,420
two questions where one is post one on

1586
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:45,040
key change one's post content occasion I

1587
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:47,350
don't think we're ready for either of

1588
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:48,730
them um I think this you know I think as

1589
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:50,230
Richard was indicating what we need use

1590
01:16:48,730 --> 01:16:51,849
a suitable amount of sensibility so that

1591
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:57,160
if like if and when we want to do that

1592
01:16:51,850 --> 01:16:59,830
work we can do great thanks John so the

1593
01:16:57,160 --> 01:17:03,940
fish is gonna present on behalf of

1594
01:16:59,830 --> 01:17:09,070
Michael who's gonna be answer I don't

1595
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:11,679
know yeah so these requirements have

1596
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:13,509
been brought up over and over again so

1597
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:15,400
I'll just go quickly I think John

1598
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:17,229
mentioned them already quite a few times

1599
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,459
during his presentations

1600
01:17:17,229 --> 01:17:20,499
there shouldn't be anything

1601
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:22,539
controversial so there is this document

1602
01:17:20,499 --> 01:17:25,449
in the 60s working group that specify

1603
01:17:22,539 --> 01:17:26,949
that we call a zero touch drawing this

1604
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:30,549
specifies essentially in a draw

1605
01:17:26,949 --> 01:17:32,949
enrollment solution for six dish that is

1606
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:35,409
the document is a profile of

1607
01:17:32,949 --> 01:17:37,178
brueski of constraint voter and

1608
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:41,549
constrained voucher documents in anima

1609
01:17:37,179 --> 01:17:45,539
and and also the ESP over coop s

1610
01:17:41,550 --> 01:17:48,880
document in in ace

1611
01:17:45,539 --> 01:17:51,909
we essentially here wanted to minimize

1612
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,190
the overhead what what goes over the

1613
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:56,228
wire during the exchange

1614
01:17:54,190 --> 01:18:04,659
so we've been discussing these

1615
01:17:56,229 --> 01:18:07,659
requirements and essentially um on the

1616
01:18:04,659 --> 01:18:10,360
first slide inside i'm doesn't wish to

1617
01:18:07,659 --> 01:18:12,159
have detail s frame overhead and this

1618
01:18:10,360 --> 01:18:14,880
frame does that refer to the record

1619
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:19,119
layer or regulatory morass that

1620
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:21,579
michaelis I'm not sure Michael did these

1621
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:24,670
slides I think if he refers to the

1622
01:18:21,579 --> 01:18:26,709
message overhead of TLS but we would

1623
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:28,630
need to confirm with him so I'm just

1624
01:18:26,709 --> 01:18:30,789
presenting on behalf of him yeah because

1625
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:32,289
the ACE for example that the ACE

1626
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:34,478
document that you point out that's

1627
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:38,228
obviously intentionally designed to have

1628
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:40,269
ESP over co-op s and so if you don't

1629
01:18:38,229 --> 01:18:42,249
like the TLS then maybe you then maybe

1630
01:18:40,269 --> 01:18:48,909
Michael should have not picked ace work

1631
01:18:42,249 --> 01:18:51,519
but yeah make sense so a couple of

1632
01:18:48,909 --> 01:18:53,558
requirements there that being brought up

1633
01:18:51,519 --> 01:18:55,209
on the list before essentially we would

1634
01:18:53,559 --> 01:18:59,050
like to send certificates by reference

1635
01:18:55,209 --> 01:19:01,360
rather than by value over the wire we

1636
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:03,820
would like the two peers in the run in

1637
01:19:01,360 --> 01:19:05,320
the a cron to be authenticated by

1638
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:08,079
different types of credentials for

1639
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:10,090
instance someone use case that we

1640
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:12,340
discussed is server being identified by

1641
01:19:10,090 --> 01:19:15,729
an RP k and the client being an

1642
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:18,070
identified by its ID of ID which is a

1643
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:23,769
certificate that it uses to enroll into

1644
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:26,679
an your domain yes I'm not quite sure on

1645
01:19:23,769 --> 01:19:29,530
following the second half of that second

1646
01:19:26,679 --> 01:19:31,090
bullet so you say sir identified by our

1647
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,199
PK which is base enter client

1648
01:19:31,090 --> 01:19:33,520
which these you Center clients you can

1649
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:35,888
print about requests what does that mean

1650
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:38,409
so it means that essentially the client

1651
01:19:35,889 --> 01:19:41,260
needs to receive the RPK over the wire

1652
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:43,750
okay yeah and okay that it doesn't have

1653
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:45,570
it initially because it discovers this

1654
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:48,400
net the new net for the new domain on

1655
01:19:45,570 --> 01:19:51,809
dynamically I see okay the RPK is

1656
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:55,769
carried is carried of the wire on what

1657
01:19:51,810 --> 01:19:59,889
75 20 or something right okay thanks so

1658
01:19:55,770 --> 01:20:02,969
and so that means the client so so I

1659
01:19:59,889 --> 01:20:13,440
guess then how does the client

1660
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:13,440
authenticate the RPK I'm not sure okay

1661
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:19,719
this is a salient question because on

1662
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:21,250
because if their way if they complain

1663
01:20:19,719 --> 01:20:23,800
authentication no I'm sorry

1664
01:20:21,250 --> 01:20:25,570
yeah obviously there is a third party

1665
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:27,880
involved the authorization service that

1666
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:30,460
certifies of this RPK so essentially in

1667
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:32,830
the voucher request that client sends

1668
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:35,590
onward to the authorization service it

1669
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:38,050
includes the RPK that it received okay

1670
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:39,760
so and then there is an exchange coming

1671
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:42,639
from the authorization service where the

1672
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:45,580
authorization service vouches for this

1673
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,929
RPK to the client right i guess but

1674
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:48,670
again i guess then I want to push back

1675
01:20:46,929 --> 01:20:50,110
on this then I want to push back on this

1676
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:53,199
requirement because it seems to me that

1677
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:56,440
a better design would be for the server

1678
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:58,089
to send a digest I why does it why

1679
01:20:56,440 --> 01:21:01,860
doesn't it what is that what like my

1680
01:20:58,090 --> 01:21:04,989
point is like is like why um like is

1681
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:06,790
that instead of having the server send

1682
01:21:04,989 --> 01:21:09,218
the client the RPK there's a client then

1683
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:10,810
asks some Oracle is it gets a one bit

1684
01:21:09,219 --> 01:21:13,210
response back wouldn't be better to have

1685
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:14,199
these servers in the client identifier

1686
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:15,550
for the RPK

1687
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:18,820
and the server called the Oracle and

1688
01:21:15,550 --> 01:21:20,409
gets the RPK back yes so much would be I

1689
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:24,000
mean this is a profile of brewski this

1690
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:26,799
is how they've done it okay yeah okay

1691
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:29,260
okay okay I'm just but I think it's

1692
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,090
relevant okay okay well but separately

1693
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,170
but it's like you know to put which were

1694
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,000
trying to save plates on the wire at

1695
01:21:32,170 --> 01:21:35,290
this interface like this is like not out

1696
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:41,469
this like this is like you know be just

1697
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:44,250
burn 32r tasks right so understand the

1698
01:21:41,469 --> 01:21:44,250
last thing that you said

1699
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:48,199
I think one thing to recognize is that

1700
01:21:46,190 --> 01:21:49,879
like I don't know exactly what sort of

1701
01:21:48,199 --> 01:21:51,080
network topology have in mind but in

1702
01:21:49,880 --> 01:21:52,880
some of these apologies they're gonna

1703
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:55,010
have this what this air interface which

1704
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:55,969
has which is extremely low bandwidth and

1705
01:21:55,010 --> 01:21:57,199
they're gonna have I don't know how

1706
01:21:55,969 --> 01:21:58,790
you're talking to that the server you

1707
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,619
did about your request for but if that's

1708
01:21:58,790 --> 01:22:03,260
not over the same your interface um if

1709
01:22:00,619 --> 01:22:05,000
it's like over a wire um then you want

1710
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:07,489
to move data from the urn or face onto

1711
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,909
the wire and so this is this RPK is 32

1712
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:14,089
cats or so right and so um you know if

1713
01:22:10,909 --> 01:22:16,940
as soon as that's 55 509 and so on and

1714
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:19,580
so if your if your your interface to the

1715
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:20,540
voucher server on is like faster than

1716
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:22,519
what you want to do is you want to how

1717
01:22:20,540 --> 01:22:23,929
to identify or hear your server give you

1718
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:29,119
the RPK so you just save those ready to

1719
01:22:23,929 --> 01:22:33,770
our tests go ahead can you go to the

1720
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:36,290
previous slide so this third draft in

1721
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:39,500
the list are you sure it's ESP and not

1722
01:22:36,290 --> 01:22:41,300
ESD so is it encapsulated security

1723
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:43,130
payload or enrollment over secure

1724
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:47,060
transport because I'm confused those

1725
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:49,730
acronyms refer to different things so

1726
01:22:47,060 --> 01:22:52,219
someone done in the audience says it's

1727
01:22:49,730 --> 01:22:56,059
it's s so that draft is incorrect that

1728
01:22:52,219 --> 01:22:58,699
that kind of confused me what would help

1729
01:22:56,060 --> 01:23:00,739
here is for you to say that our

1730
01:22:58,699 --> 01:23:03,769
requirement is that that they a ke

1731
01:23:00,739 --> 01:23:05,869
should support where the client has

1732
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:07,760
device certificates and the server has

1733
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:10,159
RP case so kind of having this high

1734
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:14,360
level because otherwise I was confused

1735
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:17,598
with just the first two slides yeah this

1736
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:20,239
is saying we start to start that the

1737
01:23:17,599 --> 01:23:23,389
client has devised certificate or a to

1738
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:26,209
do one AR certificate and server has our

1739
01:23:23,389 --> 01:23:28,820
PK and then we want a ke to magically

1740
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:30,849
give a session keys perhaps that's a

1741
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:34,580
easier way to frame the requirement

1742
01:23:30,849 --> 01:23:36,619
second I'm not sure we should get too

1743
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:40,159
much influenced by this requirement when

1744
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:42,519
we are designing our ake a ke but that's

1745
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:51,638
just my opinion

1746
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:54,230
okay great okay so a couple of questions

1747
01:23:51,639 --> 01:23:56,150
in terms of the draft adoption will

1748
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,929
confirm the list do people prefer to get

1749
01:23:56,150 --> 01:23:59,299
another revision

1750
01:23:56,930 --> 01:24:03,050
the draft before we do that call for

1751
01:23:59,300 --> 01:24:04,430
adoption or just go ahead and do it just

1752
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:11,540
go ahead and do this what people are

1753
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:15,860
saying great as well yeah we've got a

1754
01:24:11,540 --> 01:24:17,180
check and do people want to you know in

1755
01:24:15,860 --> 01:24:18,320
terms of working on this we're gonna use

1756
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:20,420
github an issue tracker the issue

1757
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,880
tracker there and so on is do people

1758
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:28,910
have a preference for virtual interim

1759
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:32,660
meetings or what yes virtual in are

1760
01:24:28,910 --> 01:24:34,400
between now and I 107 so yes that you

1761
01:24:32,660 --> 01:24:37,280
would attend or yes as an ad you think

1762
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:40,610
it's a great at it no hat yes I think

1763
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:45,559
it's a great idea okay so any other

1764
01:24:40,610 --> 01:24:48,009
people seem to so when I would naturally

1765
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:50,480
think kind of like maybe January ish but

1766
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:53,180
so from chapter we progressed a lot

1767
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:55,759
today have one in December urine and Jim

1768
01:24:53,180 --> 01:24:57,800
+1 to be Italian during January and

1769
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:59,390
February yeah

1770
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:02,270
so we've suggestions there for December

1771
01:24:59,390 --> 01:25:04,910
January February month and the same bar

1772
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:06,320
might be a base ambitious because in

1773
01:25:04,910 --> 01:25:08,240
terms of people getting home from here

1774
01:25:06,320 --> 01:25:10,580
and doing stuff and actually making

1775
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:12,860
progress I mean I think I'd like to try

1776
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:15,080
and like open issues and get hope and

1777
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:16,339
then close a few easy ones hopefully and

1778
01:25:15,080 --> 01:25:17,660
then have an interim about the things

1779
01:25:16,340 --> 01:25:19,760
that are we're talking about would I

1780
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:24,650
think be what I would suggest so that

1781
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:27,530
would be more January than December I'm

1782
01:25:24,650 --> 01:25:28,610
seeing the room temperature here is warm

1783
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:30,040
so people are falling asleep or

1784
01:25:28,610 --> 01:25:32,360
something good which is good

1785
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:34,340
roman deal you might I propose that we

1786
01:25:32,360 --> 01:25:36,920
load up get we commit to load up github

1787
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:39,200
by early December we can chew on it

1788
01:25:36,920 --> 01:25:44,210
maybe you start talking me January late

1789
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:45,740
January for the virtual yeah you're only

1790
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:49,580
suggesting to make a doodle see if
