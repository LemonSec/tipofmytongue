1
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:25,419
you know it takes a while for the video

2
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:30,610
to Arizona provisionally yeah like just

3
00:00:25,420 --> 00:01:09,789
instead of it canvas then we just

4
00:00:30,610 --> 00:01:12,789
colored okay hello everyone welcome to

5
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:19,299

somewhere please make sure that you sign

10
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:38,369
them up we need jabber scribes so any

11
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,369
volunteers

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:53,650
hello people wake up okay so I would

13
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:56,610
like to do it but yeah also there's

14
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:00,390
either part it's helpful and if you

15
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:04,960
helped write the minutes it's like

16
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,550
collaborative effort so this is the deep

17
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,369
sea open so there are two chairs

18
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:11,100
this is pennyvos and I'm talkin grass

19
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,110
grow

20
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:16,390
okay so what we have for the agenda

21
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:19,840
today administrivia this is they think

22
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,380
I'm going to write now after that we're

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,610
going quit the problem statement of

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:30,519
Muccino current extensions for HPV 6

25
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:33,190
after that two presentations from Ian

26
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,170
please be gentle on him so he's in

27
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:39,910
Europe and it's like 3 a.m. for him so

28
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:44,679
he assured us that his coffee is strong

29
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:49,780
and good but you never know and finally

30
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:53,019
we have the last topic oh sorry the

31
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,040
second topic that Ian will be talking

32
00:02:53,019 --> 00:03:01,209
about is prefix delegate in Korea so so

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,870
this is a new material and finally we

34
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:08,500
have a discussion about advancing hep-2

35
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:10,680
to full standard so team will be running

36
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,680
the show

37
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:20,190
okay so what's the document status

38
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:24,130
we have several the number of drafts is

39
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:29,410
decreasing which is good but still there

40
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:32,049
are some some new appearances so the

41
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,990
first one and visit yank so this is

42
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:37,300
something that's on agenda today

43
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:41,140
maka sang it's still going through the

44
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:45,640
last call Bernie and I will

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:48,700
talk about wrapping this up in couple

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:51,190
days but there is still time to to share

47
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:53,679
your comments so if you have some time

48
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,310
please read it it's it's a short draft I

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,250
mean it's like twelve or fourteen pages

50
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:04,630
so the next one a problem statement of

51
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:07,810
Emory this is only a non-agenda the next

52
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,299
draft bitch-slapped quadrant this is

53
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:13,530
something that's also in the school so

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:17,410
again these show your comments and

55
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:20,680
finally the last relative drafts of this

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:26,230
is to individual the preface delegating

57
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:29,790
really it's on the agenda and I think

58
00:04:26,230 --> 00:05:17,230
that's it regarding administrivia so

59
00:04:29,790 --> 00:05:20,190
let's go with some reason doesn't like

60
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,190
to do it sometimes

61
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:42,590
okay now it's working isn't it yeah okay

62
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,590
now it should be okay

63
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:48,659
hello everyone my name is linghu

64
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,660
franching Ohio University today I'm

65
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:53,370
going to talk about to the update on

66
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:58,620
problem statement of multi requirements

67
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:01,110
extensions for the HTTP basics first

68
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:04,470
let's have a quick recap of this

69
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,500
document we introduced them multi

70
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:11,040
requirement extensions for dhcpv6 in

71
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:16,080
IETF 98 in Chicago for the first term

72
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:18,420
and the ITF 104 in program pract we

73
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,500
presently do this work and the community

74
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:25,830
can see related Deborah and Bernie to me

75
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:29,670
and some other people as Melanie's to

76
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,250
keep valuable comments on this document

77
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,190
and we up-to-date updating the two

78
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:42,210
versions to solve the open issues before

79
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:45,780
IETF 106 the main changes society of 104

80
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:48,320
includes in figure 1 the general the

81
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,030
general th the comodo we modify the

82
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:54,090
message processing functions into

83
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:57,349
message overlaying functions for dhcp

84
00:06:54,090 --> 00:07:02,369
relays and we modify the your the

85
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,840
general model by adding external

86
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:07,010
entities and inputs

87
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:13,280
I mean section for point to point for

88
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:15,890
way in the previous version way say with

89
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:19,890
basic server strategy general to random

90
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:22,680
justice but in this version the current

91
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:25,260
will say currently the server's

92
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,940
assigning addresses prefix and there's

93
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:33,420
some some other configuration options to

94
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:36,780
the to Thea configure the policies and

95
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:39,660
we will move the 16th section four point

96
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,460
two point five the extension principles

97
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,920
and explain rates

98
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,270
it's contained in the introduction and

99
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,400
we talked about enforcing local policies

100
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:54,719
as use cases using more generic

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:57,599
languages in Section five this is a

102
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,620
original DHCP general model and which

103
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:04,410
includes message messages options and

104
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,740
the messaging processing functions and

105
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:12,060
adjust generation mechanisms and when

106
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:14,430
modify it in the new old version and

107
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,800
this is a modified reg state each a new

108
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:24,630
model and we add external inputs and

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:29,400
videos in this version and to make it

110
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:34,970
more general and clearer and for HTTP

111
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:38,880
for messaging extension we can not only

112
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:41,690
define the ODST messages to in which

113
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:45,180
these functionalities but also we can

114
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:50,070
extend the new messages to enhance its

115
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:53,160
security for option extension we can fix

116
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:57,080
a few basics allows defined me almost no

117
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:03,260
options to just meet parameters between

118
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:08,490
the HTM it is and also we can define

119
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:12,140
define new option also the options can

120
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:17,910
make him may come from may come from

121
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:21,210
external inputs for example I've seen 74

122
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:26,910
37 defines and defines the various

123
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:30,480
options to to exchange authorization and

124
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:37,860
identification information between DHCP

125
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:40,230
relay and DHCP server on next stop next

126
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,240
steps and we believe this strategy is

127
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,670
ready for working group last score and

128
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,400
the other issues are relatively in

129
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:52,770
manner and thanks for listening any

130
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:55,699
questions comments or concerns just as a

131
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:57,769
reminder this is an informational

132
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:06,560
yeah yeah this is an informational

133
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:08,269
document yeah suresh krisshnan so I I

134
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,888
read the draft it looks like more like a

135
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:12,970
survey than a problem statement like

136
00:10:09,889 --> 00:10:14,649
what did he mean by problem statement

137
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:20,990
[Applause]

138
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:25,850
well waste as IP IP address is closely

139
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:29,360
to the manageability privacy protections

140
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:32,990
and surveys security and traceability of

141
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:37,730
the networks and we summarize the passe

142
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:40,699
by extension points of dhcpv6 to to

143
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,639
present i'm overview of the the

144
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,290
extensions right like and that's why

145
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,540
it's it's look more like a survey of

146
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:49,129
like you know existing mechanisms in

147
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,019
like specific implementations then a

148
00:10:49,129 --> 00:10:53,709
problem statement for something so I

149
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:57,249
think the name is like a bit misleading

150
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,869
yeah it's three volts it's a good point

151
00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:02,480
Suresh I think originally the problem

152
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:06,079
was you know they wanted a way to

153
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:09,259
generate addresses with semantics in

154
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,149
them right and and maybe I want to go

155
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:14,389
back maybe some of that got lost

156
00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:17,420
okay and so it it's a question of that

157
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:20,779
do we you know do we add that back in if

158
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,370
it's not clear or should we just change

159
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,680
the title to make it more of a survey

160
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:26,000
yeah I think like a change that Idol is

161
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,459
like a better thing because I couldn't

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,610
really see specific problem statement

163
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:33,979
anywhere in the past so I think you know

164
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,680
it is a general mechanism so it probably

165
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:38,480
would be better to just make it at you

166
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,689
know here's a survey of mechanisms that

167
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,809
exist or something that's good thanks

168
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,809
thank you

169
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,110
any other comments okay thank you

170
00:12:10,829 --> 00:12:19,399
okay so the next one is the precincts

171
00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:19,399
young so young and now it's your turn

172
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,799
[Music]

173
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:47,329
Ian are you out there we're not hearing

174
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,290
you we see you what about now oh yes

175
00:12:47,329 --> 00:12:51,800
there we go

176
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:55,849
excellent okay so that's working okay is

177
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:59,269
it yes yes good good

178
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,440
so I've got a couple of things for you

179
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:05,029
first one is an update to the gang

180
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,370
dhcpv6 data model transit we've had

181
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:09,459
kicking around sir there's probably

182
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:12,200
coming into his fourth you know actually

183
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:14,469
can you move on to the first the next

184
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,470
slide please

185
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:26,180
so I think the last times presented was

186
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:27,529
back in IETF 104 and the message then

187
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,709
was that it was kind of languishing a

188
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:32,089
little bit due to a lot of their

189
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:35,119
existing co-authors having moved on to

190
00:13:32,089 --> 00:13:36,829
other things and and also the general

191
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,740
size at the task that we were trying to

192
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:42,140
tackle I'm pleased to announce that this

193
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:45,560
is no longer the case so and Michael

194
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,189
from ISC joined us after the call for

195
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,510
new authors at ATF when I fought and I

196
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:55,420
think we've got the thing very much back

197
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:55,420
on the rails as a result of that I

198
00:13:55,510 --> 00:14:00,110
wouldn't call it quite a ground-up

199
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:02,209
rewrite that we've got but pretty much

200
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,980
all the content in there is new I mean

201
00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,500
we've really ated all of the model

202
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,220
structures the Scopes that's in there a

203
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:13,310
lot of moving outs of unnecessary parts

204
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,690
and a lot of refocusing really on just

205
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:19,069
you know what are the important thing is

206
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:20,839
of building a an extensible set of

207
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,880
models and coming up with guidelines and

208
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,519
rules for how those the extensions can't

209
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,880
be done so that we can leave for

210
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,920
subsequent work any you know adding new

211
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,320
functionality and things and and

212
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,279
modeling the rest of the protocol

213
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,649
depending on what people find to be

214
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:41,240
relevant and you know I wanted to put

215
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:43,480
the effort into doing can we go into the

216
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,480
next slide

217
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:51,780
so what I propose and what we ended up

218
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:53,880
doing was basically refocusing on just

219
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:57,689
getting a decent model that covers

220
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,090
what's in 84 15 the boil the ocean

221
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:01,410
problem of that we originally set

222
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,360
ourselves and I think what he

223
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:05,640
dramatically underestimated what was

224
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,320
going to be possible of trying to model

225
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:11,400
kind of the the state of the art of the

226
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:14,790
protocol yeah the resulting work was

227
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:17,340
just was just too huge refocusing on 84

228
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:19,920
15 has given us something which is much

229
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:22,020
much easier to work with I think they're

230
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,349
much much easier to read and unholy for

231
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,360
people to review as well we've also

232
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,650
managed to do this in a way that I don't

233
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,760
think we've ended up with too much

234
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:34,290
duplication of functionality and

235
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,460
duplication in the models as well so

236
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,079
we've got quite a good you reuse

237
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,630
mechanism which I'll I'll come on so on

238
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:48,270
later slides could we go to the next one

239
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:51,840
please so strangely enough we kind of

240
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:55,050
overlooked how this model or the models

241
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:57,720
would interface and in to work with

242
00:15:55,050 --> 00:16:00,449
other existing gang models and you know

243
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:03,240
particularly around IETF AI interfaces

244
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:04,230
sorry I don't know quite how we managed

245
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,200
to do that but there we are

246
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:09,660
so we've restructured this to use the

247
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:12,840
existing interfaces tree that ITF in

248
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,880
interfaces provides us with and then we

249
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,770
take this and add in the functionality

250
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,780
that we need on top of the already

251
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:22,579
existing interface rich that that

252
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,930
provides what this then means is that

253
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:27,060
for every interface that you wish to

254
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,189
provide configuration for it kind of

255
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:31,829
gives you a structure in which that can

256
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:34,140
all be built and and you know it makes

257
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:36,510
it for a much better into working well

258
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,510
with what's already there and I think it

259
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,610
lacks just a lot more sense as well and

260
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:44,400
we'd also overlooked any data about any

261
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:45,660
state data and timer data which again

262
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,490
seems to be a fairly glaring omission

263
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:51,839
now that I came back and looked at it so

264
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,790
that's fixed as well we removed a lot of

265
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,350
the stuff that was done in features in

266
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,000
the path of one thing that we have less

267
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,529
left and I think the only existing

268
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,839
remaining feature actually is

269
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:03,959
prefix delegation is obviously not every

270
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,159
client has that and we've also gone back

271
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,529
and and cleaned up a lot of the

272
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:11,809
notification stuff that's wasn't really

273
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,809
working either next slide please

274
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:17,490
the server has probably had more

275
00:17:16,138 --> 00:17:19,258
reworking than anything else because

276
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:21,929
that one we was really starting to

277
00:17:19,259 --> 00:17:24,179
spiral out of control into the size of

278
00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:28,379
what some the model and the amount that

279
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:30,059
we were trying to do it there so a lot

280
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:32,309
of the things that we've decided that

281
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,610
were really implementation specific

282
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:37,950
we've now just shifted out of the sole

283
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,889
model because really there's no

284
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:42,120
realistic way that you can try and cover

285
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:43,979
things that are going to please every

286
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,668
implementation in there so you know the

287
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:50,370
best solution there was just not to try

288
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:53,159
we also think a lot of the value of of

289
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,549
having a common model here is around and

290
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,769
where a lot of your investment in

291
00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:00,779
building network-wide configurations and

292
00:17:58,769 --> 00:18:03,090
you know the time that goes into that is

293
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:05,460
actually around client configuration and

294
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,899
orde-lees configuration pools the

295
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,629
network objects and you know the other

296
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:12,090
things around that and so we kind of

297
00:18:09,629 --> 00:18:14,459
said a relief if that stuff can be built

298
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:16,230
and that can be transferable between

299
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,090
different implementations then that's

300
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,269
that's a much higher value than saying

301
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:23,279
it we wonder model is also transferable

302
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:27,179
for implementation specific

303
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,649
functionality as well so I think we you

304
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,809
know that's how we decided to structure

305
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:33,768
it but I'll talk about that a little bit

306
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,769
further in a second

307
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,149
yeah so anything around things like

308
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:41,189
database backends interface

309
00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,959
configuration we shifted this out

310
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,419
there's no exists in the appendix

311
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,820
I'm guessing or mented into a particular

312
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:51,840
container which is provided for exactly

313
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,168
this purpose as it's necessary next

314
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,168
slide please

315
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:59,659
the same thing thought process went

316
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,840
behind the client class selection

317
00:18:59,659 --> 00:19:05,220
process as well so Michael did some

318
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,350
digging into I forget how many

319
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,360
implementations it was but it was

320
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,129
probably about five or something I he

321
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,260
looked into and found that whilst

322
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,730
the way that we classify incoming

323
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:18,100
messages so that we can give them the

324
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,750
right options the right select addresses

325
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:22,659
from the right port and things this is a

326
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,630
common problem that needs to be solved

327
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,760
there's a lot of variance in how this is

328
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:32,350
configured this is how it's described

329
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,960
and and also kind of the idea behind how

330
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:37,030
its structured so once again we thought

331
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,030
that the best thing to do here was just

332
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:44,590
to take that functionality out of the

333
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,290
main model and provide a example set of

334
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,939
this which we've moved into an appendix

335
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,320
and show how this would into work and

336
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:51,940
show how you could you know take either

337
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:55,230
the bond model that we have there or

338
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:58,560
your users basis for building your own

339
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:58,560
next slide please

340
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:04,600
another thing that really was spiraling

341
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:07,000
out of control in the original model

342
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,189
that we had although the version 8 model

343
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,480
was the modeling of DHCP options I mean

344
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,950
I think we're up to one hundred and

345
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,540
thirteen hundred and forty now or

346
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:18,070
something like that with a few omissions

347
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:19,810
in there and originally we've taken this

348
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:22,330
this idea of saying well we can you know

349
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:24,010
from a modeling perspective the the

350
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:26,230
structure of a DHCP option makes it

351
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,390
fairly trivial although somewhat

352
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,520
labor-intensive to to model these things

353
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:32,470
so we tried to do this we tried to model

354
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,970
every option that was out there we then

355
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:34,990
tied ourselves in a different knot of

356
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,000
saying well how do you deal with

357
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,670
variance of implementations how do you

358
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,410
deal with the fact that some options are

359
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:42,640
only relevant for clients some are

360
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:45,700
relevant for relays that are relevant

361
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,490
for survey servers or pretty much any

362
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,920
permutation of of those as well

363
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,300
and we ended up with a rather nasty set

364
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,550
of features and things that did you know

365
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,550
it just the the more the options went in

366
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:58,360
there the the uglier the whole thing got

367
00:20:56,550 --> 00:21:00,370
it was also going to make it very

368
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:04,449
difficult to maintain and you know every

369
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:07,500
time a new option gets ratified then we

370
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:10,480
end up with an out-of-date model so we

371
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,550
kind of went back to that and have cut

372
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,650
the scope of those options down to just

373
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:21,159
the relevant ones which exist in 84 15

374
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:23,740
we use an identity mechanism to define

375
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:25,420
what whether it didn't with a client or

376
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:28,780
server or relay and

377
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:34,150
we augment the options based on what

378
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:35,590
that identity is as as is relevant what

379
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,300
this also actually if you can move on to

380
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:41,679
the next slide what this also does is

381
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,080
provides us with an easy way of making

382
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:48,250
it extensible so the format that we

383
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,199
defined in the 84 15 set of options we

384
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:54,370
also can do for really as many as

385
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,960
necessary and then the idea being that a

386
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:59,469
device which implements those particular

387
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:01,360
options can would obviously implement

388
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:02,920
the yang model that would support those

389
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,959
option to define the configuration of

390
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:07,090
those options and so those can be loaded

391
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,820
accordingly and then we get ourselves

392
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:12,340
out of the future mess so again we've

393
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,149
gone down the line of providing an

394
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:17,919
example of this we used our 330 319

395
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:20,770
because it's the first numeric set of

396
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,510
options that don't exist in 84 15 and

397
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:25,780
they're also nice and simple as well so

398
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:28,750
it was a good candidate for for an

399
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,070
example so we provide this yang module

400
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:32,170
in there we show how that can be

401
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:35,169
augmented into place

402
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:38,410
there's also 9 or 10 guidelines that are

403
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,530
in there which which describe how we're

404
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:43,120
doing the naming conventions how well a

405
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:45,190
bunch of different other things that

406
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,520
would hopefully make it pretty easy for

407
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,320
people in the future to follow the same

408
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,240
kind of format and come up with a set of

409
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:53,620
you know a yang module that will work

410
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,880
within this mechanism and would be

411
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:58,629
consistent with everything else that's

412
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,920
going on there as well so this for

413
00:22:58,630 --> 00:23:01,900
something we talked about previously but

414
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:05,770
is actually yeah we put into this

415
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:09,250
version as well and I think the last

416
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:13,930
slide 30 minutes for this seems a little

417
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:16,480
bit ambitious so yeah we think we've now

418
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:20,110
got everything's in 84 15 which is kind

419
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,210
of reset herself the scope to do one

420
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,540
thing that I would be interested in here

421
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:29,050
is for anyone who reviews or anyone

422
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:31,120
who's had a look at this is the scope

423
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,520
enough now I mean you know we've pared

424
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,659
it down so significantly have we gone

425
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,110
too far and you know if so what are the

426
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,270
the essential things that would

427
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,428
to go into here to give us you know this

428
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:45,799
framework and a basically fun

429
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:48,230
fundamental set of models that can be

430
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:51,379
used with a good you know a good way of

431
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:54,020
being able to give extensibility as

432
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:58,700
necessary in the future so I very

433
00:23:54,020 --> 00:24:00,200
interested in hearing about that the

434
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:02,179
amount of work that's gone into this has

435
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,960
been because there's been so much kind

436
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:07,400
of restructuring rebuilding rewriting

437
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,200
doubtless gremlins have crept in in here

438
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,460
as ever the time caught up with us and

439
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,230
so we were kind of rushing to get the

440
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,820
the thing out of the door before the

441
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:17,140
final deadline with that you know the

442
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,549
big change is in place so it needs

443
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:26,480
really more eyes on it from that respect

444
00:24:19,549 --> 00:24:28,910
as well yeah so I think that with this

445
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,910
version its it feel and that you know

446
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,410
the way that it's an is is just basking

447
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:36,020
basking better than what we had in the

448
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:37,549
past and from my perspective III think

449
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:41,150
that we we're getting to the stage where

450
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:43,629
you know it's ready to start so thinking

451
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:48,130
about a worker last call process for it

452
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:51,770
obviously subject reviews comments and

453
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:53,320
to get it there so that's everything

454
00:24:51,770 --> 00:25:00,080
I've got for you on this one

455
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:02,590
any comments and thanks again and thanks

456
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,510
for getting up very early for this

457
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:08,330
suresh krisshnan so one thing I noticed

458
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:10,879
like that seems wrong is the revision

459
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:12,530
handling for this so this version is

460
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,000
really not backward comparable although

461
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,399
one so I think you need to bump up the

462
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,520
revisions on the yang modules at the

463
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:27,350
minimum in the edges of the Youngs

464
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:28,970
modules themselves yeah so like all the

465
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:31,189
modules need to bump up because they're

466
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,679
in like 18:09 or something so I think

467
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,270
that needs to get bumped up other thing

468
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,880
that I think it looks good like I think

469
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:46,820
the cleanup like to limit the scope is a

470
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:50,230
good idea revolts and you foresee that

471
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:52,510
there might be a companion document that

472
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:56,950
does the remaining

473
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:58,929
options and or how do you see that sort

474
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:00,340
of you know I mean you you mentioned I

475
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:01,630
haven't looked at details but you

476
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,159
mentioned there were some naming

477
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:05,020
convention guidelines and things like

478
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:07,270
that but I'm just wondering you know

479
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:09,010
what you feel I mean it may be maybe

480
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:10,299
it's too early to really think about it

481
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,520
because we haven't gotten a base thing

482
00:26:10,299 --> 00:26:14,860
done but I think it is just a question

483
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,429
that I have is what we likely need to do

484
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:22,719
a follow on which we define the the rest

485
00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:24,640
of the options that are well I mean it

486
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,970
depends I think with with option

487
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:31,570
definitions there's a bunch of simple

488
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:32,860
options out there that really you know

489
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,960
they are exactly that they're just a

490
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:37,299
DHCP option implemented by the server

491
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,640
implemented by the clients and don't

492
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:41,950
specify any additional functionality

493
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,169
they did the 33-19 example are having

494
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:47,740
there is that you know is exactly like

495
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:49,240
that and so it's fairly easy in that

496
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:50,830
case to just say right let's just go and

497
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,660
define all of those things and you know

498
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:55,990
and make a module will cover all of

499
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:59,290
those but there's also a load of options

500
00:26:55,990 --> 00:27:01,390
that are related to you know in some

501
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:02,830
cases some fairly complicated additional

502
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:07,030
server functionality or client

503
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:09,699
functionality and just having the

504
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:11,350
options defined in there without having

505
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,900
the configuration to make that stuff

506
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:18,730
actually work I'm thinking about things

507
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:21,400
like come what's the course sorry it's

508
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,290
very early in the morning

509
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,150
lease query and stuff like that both of

510
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:26,980
these query it things you know there's

511
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:28,510
an option that's defined there but what

512
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:29,980
it's actually specifying is a bunch of

513
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,890
other configurational stuff that the

514
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:35,080
server would need to be able to handle

515
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:37,360
and so just defining the options

516
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:38,649
necessary for these query is not a lot

517
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,668
of use to you if you don't have the rest

518
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:44,559
of the stuff that's in there however I

519
00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:46,210
think it would be possible to totally

520
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,799
you know go through the option set and I

521
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:49,720
mean I've got lists that I've made of

522
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:52,660
where I've attempted to do this down you

523
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,309
know so yeah we could do a companion

524
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:57,250
document that just says here's all the

525
00:27:54,309 --> 00:28:01,928
low-hanging fruit but you know when it

526
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:04,179
comes to see the prefix delegate the

527
00:28:01,929 --> 00:28:06,160
least query and stuff like that it would

528
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,210
need a much much more

529
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:11,770
detailed look at how to do it okay so it

530
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:14,800
sounds like there's potentially a lot

531
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:20,680
more here if we were to model a big

532
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:22,330
protocol yeah but yeah I mean I think

533
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:24,010
though that you know we are in a place

534
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:25,510
that or this does put us in a place

535
00:28:24,010 --> 00:28:27,340
whereby we've got a good you know a

536
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:30,670
solid framework that we can extend in

537
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,720
that way you know with with some of

538
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:33,670
these things it just comes down to

539
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:36,280
whether anyone's interested enough to

540
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,660
actually be I want to do the work around

541
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,360
here

542
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,640
I think you're right though you know

543
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:44,800
maybe something that defined the 7277

544
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,500
you know generic option formats that

545
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,270
would be useful in previous versions of

546
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:51,070
the module I think we've tackled that

547
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:54,370
anyway so you know taking the thing and

548
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:56,470
wrapping it inside the format that we're

549
00:28:54,370 --> 00:29:00,399
now decide that we're now using four

550
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,870
options would be easy to do likewise the

551
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,640
older options yeah I mean all of this

552
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:07,419
could be put together in a company draft

553
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,220
no problem well it may be that you know

554
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:13,420
there'll be lots of drafts because one

555
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:15,400
may cover the lease query and you know

556
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,900
there's there's the the purely sort of

557
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:18,940
data options and then there's the

558
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,340
options that add new functionality right

559
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:23,140
and so I think we have to look at how we

560
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,659
would handle that you know cuz I think

561
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:27,460
something like you know I mean we could

562
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:30,070
maybe bundle all the lease query you

563
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:32,560
know the the active the bulk and stuff

564
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:34,990
into one document maybe we'll have to

565
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:37,750
figure that out at some point yeah you

566
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,720
know this don't do ask you there's also

567
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:42,040
the question whether we really need to

568
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,380
specify all the options I mean so on

569
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,820
solver options our protocol options and

570
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:48,490
they are generated by the server and

571
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:51,870
they are not explicitly configured so

572
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:54,400
like you brought up the lease query so

573
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,159
the basically query there is nothing

574
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,690
clearly no option value that you have

575
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:00,850
specified in the server side this is

576
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:02,620
just a configuration of you enable or

577
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:06,760
disable the feature and this is nobody

578
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:08,229
to option it's never an option in which

579
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:11,290
the the lease query information is

580
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,180
transported it's not one that I've read

581
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,889
for many many years and I forget what

582
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:17,290
the contents of it are but I mean though

583
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,940
that as Bernie says you know that I

584
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,450
think there's two kinds of options here

585
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,820
the

586
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,529
there's ones that are just here's a for

587
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,939
Matt here's a dataset and you know you

588
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:26,289
implement it or you don't

589
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:28,860
and there's things that require much

590
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,700
more back in configuration on there and

591
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,309
you know I mean if we can just divide

592
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:35,470
the things up and then produce you know

593
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:37,120
the relevant module to that as I say I

594
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:44,799
mean it's it's labor-intensive but it's

595
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:47,439
it's it's easy to do okay okay

596
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:58,149
are there people willing to review this

597
00:30:47,440 --> 00:31:01,570
document we have one hand out there okay

598
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:04,389
well that's better than nothing but you

599
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,059
know do take a look and send your

600
00:31:04,389 --> 00:31:10,649
comments to the authors so that they can

601
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:14,350
do these cleanups and get help with that

602
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:16,268
and you know we'll keep working away at

603
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:21,219
this it is a it is a big challenge

604
00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:29,399
it is a big task they do this it's not

605
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:29,399
as trivial as a okay so it seems that

606
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:38,470
review to come up and I suppose then it

607
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:40,059
would be what an updated version couple

608
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:45,070
weeks from now and Daniel we can go with

609
00:31:40,059 --> 00:31:48,190
less cold right I mean two weeks sounds

610
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,840
ambitious but you know as I say I mean I

611
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:52,269
think you know we're in a pretty good

612
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,949
place with it now so you know it's just

613
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,100
really the final work to get over the

614
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:56,100
line

615
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:34,140
okay so a prefix delegating relay draft

616
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:36,889
so the first things first I actually

617
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,800
submitted the 0 2 version of this

618
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:43,470
probably about an hour ago

619
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,919
yeah apologies for this at the 0 1 went

620
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:48,510
out and there were there were one or two

621
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:50,400
things that we said that we would

622
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:53,550
incorporate on there based on an early

623
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,990
review comments that weren't telling

624
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:57,570
there particularly the document status

625
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,940
has now been changed to informational it

626
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:01,980
was previously standards track that was

627
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,440
a comment from Alexandre Petrescu I

628
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,050
think come after zero zero is released

629
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,340
so apologies for the late update on

630
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:11,190
there it was just a case of trying to

631
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:12,740
make sure that we had the the things in

632
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,460
there that we said we didn't coorporate

633
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:22,470
can you go to the first slide please

634
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:24,890
okay so a 90 f-104 McCarroll Abrahamson

635
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:27,660
did a presentation in v6 ops about

636
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:30,900
operational problems that we as dr.

637
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:33,300
telecom have seen with deploying v6 and

638
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,880
one of the things that we mentioned on

639
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:41,399
there was the trouble that we've seen

640
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:44,790
with a prefix delegation with when you

641
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,680
have a separated relay function so in

642
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,139
our particular case and i think this is

643
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:52,920
a reasonably common case you have your

644
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:54,990
client you have a DHCP relay which is

645
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:58,080
also the first layer 3 hop in the

646
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:59,760
network however it is just a relay it

647
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,790
doesn't also implement the DHCP server

648
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:08,760
function that's a centralized function

649
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:11,969
elsewhere in the network because the

650
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,640
term delegating route requesting routes

651
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:16,709
our relay these are all kind of reserved

652
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,620
terms and well understood to what they

653
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:21,150
they mean and what they define we've

654
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,940
actually taken a new term in there to

655
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:26,520
decide to describe this device which

656
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:28,260
we're calling a delegating relay just to

657
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,250
differentiate it from other things out

658
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:35,400
there next slide please

659
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:38,489
just one thing this is Bernie yeah I

660
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,000
mean in in like a DOCSIS Network the

661
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:41,250
Delhi

662
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,540
in relay would be the cmts for example

663
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:50,870
and I think in a morass network it's the

664
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:53,969
beer ad right well the beer as one is I

665
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,918
suppose it depends here really I mean

666
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:57,660
I've seen B and G based networks that

667
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:59,190
implement you know both the relay

668
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:01,049
function and the server functionality

669
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,800
and that's not what we're talking about

670
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:07,230
here okay but I've seen other ones which

671
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,260
will do a relay and you know we'll

672
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,760
forward to a centralized server and I've

673
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,100
certainly seen the problems in this case

674
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,980
as well so they would fall under what

675
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:19,650
I'm calling a delegating relay here we

676
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,630
came up with the term really on the

677
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,360
basis is just either working the the

678
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:25,830
permutations of relevant words here and

679
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,800
you know to find one that didn't already

680
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:31,049
exist although I think it seems

681
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,080
descriptive of what the task is you know

682
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:35,400
the function that's being performed if

683
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,049
there's any suggestions for a better

684
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:39,150
name then you know I'm happy to hear

685
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,220
those no I wasn't trying to suggest that

686
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:43,260
because cmts does a lot more but that's

687
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,959
one of the functions that performs is

688
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,800
acting as a delegating router it's a

689
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,780
delegating delegating yeah okay so so

690
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,610
you know that's that's one of the things

691
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,530
where we in the setup for the document

692
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:57,270
that we define is we're not interested

693
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,770
in that particular function because as

694
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,480
far as I'm aware

695
00:35:58,770 --> 00:36:02,040
well actually I've never really worked

696
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,780
with those devices but I don't think

697
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,270
they have these problems because you

698
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,800
know the a lot of it arises from state

699
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,960
synchronization and when the functions

700
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,520
are co-located in a single device that

701
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:20,130
state synchronization is much less of a

702
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:21,900
problem okay so we've seen a bunch of

703
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:25,590
problems down down the years and these

704
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:28,290
things really there is not a major

705
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:30,300
vendors piece of hardware that we

706
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:35,970
haven't seen one kind of problem or

707
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:40,020
another in so these range for from the

708
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:42,029
relay implementing logic about what it

709
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:45,030
thinks the message flow should be and

710
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,620
then trying to make decisions based on

711
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:49,980
this logic about what should or should

712
00:36:46,620 --> 00:36:51,420
not be forwarded so did this basically

713
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,800
says hey here's a message that I think

714
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,600
is out of sequence there

715
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,940
for I've decided that this will not get

716
00:36:54,600 --> 00:37:02,730
relayed we've seen cases particularly

717
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,530
and alongside that whereby the relay

718
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:07,080
will then create it will generate a

719
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,930
message of its own and send it back to

720
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,490
the clients in this case it'll say come

721
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,490
up with something like a no binding

722
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:17,310
error code or something like this I've

723
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,479
been through the specs and I mean

724
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:21,029
correct me if I'm wrong but I'm not

725
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,310
aware of any case where there is a valid

726
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:27,450
message flow directly between the client

727
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:30,120
and the relay like this but anyway this

728
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:31,379
behavior you know that it can't be

729
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:32,910
correct because essentially what it's

730
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,390
done is blocked any messages coming

731
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,370
forward and also this information coming

732
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:41,759
from the client it's coming from the

733
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:43,589
relay to the client plays havoc with the

734
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,390
clients state machine as well and so you

735
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:47,390
get all kinds of unwanted stuff at that

736
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:52,049
end

737
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:53,310
lots of PD State on reboot so I think

738
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,840
this is fairly well known but if you've

739
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:57,090
got a large number of clients on there

740
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,220
and no permanent storage or no mechanism

741
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:01,710
for rebuilding that cable the relay

742
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:03,810
comes back up again and everything has

743
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:05,040
to be rebuilt from scratch and your

744
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,270
black hole in traffic while that's

745
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,490
taking place multiple PD leases is

746
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,009
something that is very close to our

747
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:15,500
heart we've done a lot of and the way

748
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:20,760
that this is handled by different

749
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:21,960
devices is well all over the place so

750
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,110
that's something that we wanted to try

751
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,200
and kind of bring together we've also

752
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:30,570
seen some things about when duplicate

753
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,060
Mac's are seen between two different

754
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:37,470
devices or devices moved from one port

755
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:39,690
to another and the behavior around what

756
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:44,129
the relay does in that case is it's also

757
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:45,750
unpredictable so the idea with this

758
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:47,310
draft was really just to say these are

759
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,040
the operational problems that we've

760
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:53,840
encountered out there enumerate those

761
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:56,990
and provide a set of requirements that

762
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,160
should enable us to solve those problems

763
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,569
you know one of the one of the things

764
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,670
that we've fallen foul of is when we've

765
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:05,400
discussed these problems with with the

766
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:06,029
vendors the respective vendors we've got

767
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,789
nothing to point

768
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:10,139
to say this is how this is how this

769
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:12,089
should be done this is the you know the

770
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:13,559
required behavior here so that that was

771
00:39:12,089 --> 00:39:14,389
really the problem of trying to fix with

772
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,669
this draft

773
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:24,809
next slide please so yeah I mentioned

774
00:39:20,669 --> 00:39:30,449
about this in the intro 84 15 and 36 33

775
00:39:24,809 --> 00:39:32,329
before that both name-checked the the

776
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:35,939
architecture that I'm talking about here

777
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:37,769
but it's very very thin on talking about

778
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:41,239
how this is going to be done so this

779
00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:44,549
this this point here that's been made on

780
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:46,019
the redistribution of protocols include

781
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:50,849
the routing protocol all or whatever

782
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:52,249
else yeah that's absolutely true but we

783
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,419
actually declared this part of the

784
00:39:52,249 --> 00:39:55,769
functionality to be out of scope because

785
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:58,709
you know there's many ways that this can

786
00:39:55,769 --> 00:40:00,209
be tackled and it's not really what

787
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:02,788
we're interested in here is much more

788
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:05,638
the interface between the client and the

789
00:40:02,789 --> 00:40:08,039
relay and also the relays forwarding and

790
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:12,419
processing of messages towards the

791
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:13,709
server so you know I think there is

792
00:40:12,419 --> 00:40:16,859
space for this one and it's kind of you

793
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:21,678
know an omission from 184 15 covers at

794
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:21,679
the moment next slide please

795
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:27,959
so the way that we structured this and

796
00:40:25,349 --> 00:40:31,009
in the 0-2 update we now have an

797
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:34,649
informational draft but we took the RFC

798
00:40:31,009 --> 00:40:38,459
1784 type approach the requirements that

799
00:40:34,649 --> 00:40:42,779
we've had in here do use 21 120 119

800
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:47,158
language but we have a description in

801
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:50,429
the early on the document that kind of

802
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:52,799
explains why this is done it's lifted

803
00:40:50,429 --> 00:40:54,479
straight from 1784 and you know my

804
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:56,929
thinking was if it was so if it worked

805
00:40:54,479 --> 00:41:00,899
then then hopefully it will work now

806
00:40:56,929 --> 00:41:04,769
we've divided the requirements into four

807
00:41:00,899 --> 00:41:06,239
different categories I don't with in

808
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:07,709
this presentation actually go through

809
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:11,069
what each of those requirements are

810
00:41:07,709 --> 00:41:13,379
because please read a draft for this but

811
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:16,019
we're talking about things like message

812
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:18,328
forwarding and and trying to make that

813
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:20,549
as stupid as we possibly can do ie

814
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:22,619
if a relay gets a messy

815
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:24,210
a valid message then it should forward

816
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:27,230
it shouldn't you know try and

817
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:30,810
second-guess that should be done

818
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:33,480
handling of multiple prefixes permitting

819
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,850
these things to happen and also some

820
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:40,820
information about recent time and

821
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:44,400
maintenance that one's interesting and

822
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:48,840
we kind of there's a little bit of verb

823
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,140
I understand although it was kind of

824
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,760
before

825
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,319
my involvement with the idea I

826
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:55,350
understand that when prefix delegation

827
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:58,619
was originally defined there were some

828
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:59,970
concerns raised about the the idea that

829
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:01,890
effectively what we're doing here is

830
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:05,399
snooping that we're looking into the

831
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:07,560
timers onto there and and to some extent

832
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:09,690
you know I I don't want to write a

833
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,660
document that says you must snoop the

834
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,800
traffic however for lease and time and

835
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,430
maintenance I don't think there's

836
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:20,970
anything else that you can do but we use

837
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:25,460
deliberately loose language around this

838
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:27,569
to say that there the relay must

839
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,580
synchronize its timers must have a way

840
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:33,750
of synchronizing the time is based on

841
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,460
the reply messages that are sent the

842
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:39,930
time is innocent reply messages that are

843
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:43,770
sent by the server the routing as I said

844
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:44,640
the scope for this we keep fairly low

845
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,920
and I think there's only three

846
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:51,060
requirements that are in there this is

847
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:57,540
mainly about removing routes according

848
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:59,040
to the timers and I think we've got

849
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:00,930
something in there as well about about

850
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,910
holding the route even if the link goes

851
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:05,720
down so if you've got a link towards the

852
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:07,710
client you get a link down events then

853
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:09,540
essentially although the route cannot be

854
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:11,670
active because the link is down it

855
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,080
should not be deleted because it's still

856
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,940
alike you know once that link gets we

857
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,670
established if the if the timers haven't

858
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:20,180
expired then it's still valid so we've

859
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:23,270
got a requirement to know about that

860
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:26,850
service continuity is about really

861
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:28,350
maintaining police's across reboots that

862
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,569
comes down to either having some some

863
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:33,810
kind of permanent storage or possibly

864
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:39,090
implementing at least query mechanism

865
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:40,350
and yes and the operational things which

866
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,420
are basically being able to interact

867
00:43:40,350 --> 00:43:44,640
with the device then with the relay

868
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:47,280
device providing the user with interface

869
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,819
whereby they can check what's active

870
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:57,020
there and and clear or you know the demo

871
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:57,020
sir as required okay next slide please

872
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:03,840
yes I mean it's it's a fairly new draft

873
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:05,730
but it's not particularly it's not used

874
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,160
in the scheme of these things so it

875
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:09,270
would be great if we could get some

876
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,060
feedback on this I'm particularly

877
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:13,830
interested in other operators who are

878
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:17,009
using a similar kind of deployment

879
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:19,170
topology possibly other vendors to see

880
00:44:17,010 --> 00:44:21,960
whether we've first of all captured all

881
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:24,480
the problems that are in there and you

882
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,950
know and also whether we think the the

883
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:27,990
requirements that we defined in there

884
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:29,640
you know are enough to be able to cover

885
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:35,129
all of these different problems that

886
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:37,799
people see and yeah beyond that you will

887
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,210
be willing to make a call for adoption

888
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,520
in that well might be after this meeting

889
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:45,990
to moaners UNH I well um I have two

890
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,240
comments one is I really like this draft

891
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:49,680
we you know we're the hardest thing we

892
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,819
have finding is finding working real

893
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,080
agents as great as that's been

894
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,910
astounding runner up

895
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:56,370
they do all kinds of strange things like

896
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:58,109
you know don't know it's message types

897
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:59,490
it's sort of an adventure so I think

898
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:02,670
this will probably help the community

899
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:04,379
builder it use for real agents my only

900
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,930
other question was the draft name is

901
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,660
obviously prefix delegation and we see

902
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:11,549
the same problems with ia na s as well I

903
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,140
think you should specify the stuff that

904
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,400
matters about PD in here but I don't

905
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:17,009
know if you should change the name to

906
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,330
just that things real agents should do

907
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:23,520
and then have a couple of right I mean

908
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:27,660
this is an interesting common because I

909
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,180
mean many of the things well actually a

910
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,490
full disclosure I really don't have any

911
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:36,240
operational experience of using relays

912
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:39,779
with NIS and so if the problems are out

913
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:40,859
there I just don't know so yeah I mean

914
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:42,570
the ones I'm thinking about are those

915
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,850
generic message ones right it doesn't

916
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:46,690
matter what options inside of it you

917
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,609
know if it's not 14 is Pacific

918
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:50,410
of message that's pretty bad there was a

919
00:45:48,609 --> 00:45:51,700
it was all a couple of them I I don't

920
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,520
feel super strongly about it there's

921
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,770
something to think about okay I mean

922
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,819
I'll have a look at across that and you

923
00:45:56,770 --> 00:45:59,829
know see if there's something that we

924
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:03,060
can because it might be just as easy to

925
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:05,109
fix it as not yeah okay thanks very much

926
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:09,000
Eric line

927
00:46:05,109 --> 00:46:11,259
I think section 4.1 requirement G one a

928
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,609
delegating router must forward messages

929
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:14,260
bidirectionally between the client and

930
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:16,420
server without changing the contents of

931
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,270
the message and I'm wondering how does

932
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:21,369
that comport with sixty sixty seven

933
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,900
eighty eight the line ID option because

934
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:25,030
I think that gets inserted right it

935
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:26,290
doesn't get the the client request

936
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:30,190
doesn't get any capped and sent to a

937
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:36,310
server the relays encapsulate though it

938
00:46:30,190 --> 00:46:39,430
is encapsulation fair enough fair enough

939
00:46:36,310 --> 00:46:41,200
thanks hmm this is very volts and I

940
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:44,950
think that a lot of the issues also

941
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,930
existed in in the fourth with just

942
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,819
address assignment you know because they

943
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:50,710
were similar sort of problems and stuff

944
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:53,589
and I think there's also been a lot of

945
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,750
work by the sabe working group in sort

946
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:58,119
of defining how some of these

947
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:02,079
intermediate devices because they sabi

948
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:05,680
stuff is you know on switches and other

949
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:08,069
forwarding engines to assure that they

950
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,950
are only you know if they're monitoring

951
00:47:08,069 --> 00:47:14,800
and what devices are out there what

952
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:16,540
they're in their case it's address

953
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,859
assignment now previous application that

954
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:23,170
they're dealing with but you know if the

955
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:26,380
device the switch or router is is

956
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:28,390
monitoring addresses advice has they

957
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,310
have specified that fairly well so I

958
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:32,500
would encourage you maybe to look at

959
00:47:30,310 --> 00:47:34,240
that and see what they have to say about

960
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:36,520
some of these issues I mean having state

961
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:38,529
in multiple places it's always a bad

962
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,000
idea because it's easier to get out of

963
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,319
sync and we already have it in two

964
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,130
places right we have it in the server

965
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:46,960
and the client because the client s

966
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:49,560
state now when you throw another device

967
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,300
in in between their it gets even worse

968
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:56,910
so I mean in preparation for writing

969
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:58,839
this I did look into the Savi stuff and

970
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,490
originally when I was kind of thinking

971
00:47:58,839 --> 00:48:03,849
well what what would the contents of the

972
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,729
draft be um you know I thought well that

973
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:08,050
you know the specification of the

974
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:10,839
different state machines in the in the

975
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:14,770
way that Savi does was what was going to

976
00:48:10,839 --> 00:48:17,440
be necessary here however I'm looking at

977
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:21,790
that and thinking about it I I'm not

978
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:25,030
sure it's the right answer the reason

979
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:26,349
being that you know operationally I

980
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:28,450
think we have something that we can

981
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:30,640
treat as has been something like a black

982
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,200
box here you know we know what we're

983
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:33,400
putting in we know what we want to get

984
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,759
out we know what the behavior of this

985
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,319
thing should be savvy kind of goes much

986
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,569
further than this and says this is how

987
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:41,920
you're going to do all of that stuff and

988
00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:43,630
I'm not sure I mean certainly from an

989
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:45,609
operational perspective I'm not sure I

990
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:47,200
want to have to specify all of that and

991
00:48:45,609 --> 00:48:50,650
I'm not sure it necessarily does need to

992
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:52,480
be you know what was what we're sorely

993
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:55,480
missing was somewhere that I could point

994
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:59,069
to with vendors and say this is how it

995
00:48:55,480 --> 00:49:01,770
should behave and and how you do that I

996
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:04,240
really I'm not really that interested in

997
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:06,280
I've also had a similar discussion about

998
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,549
saying have you implemented savvy are

999
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:12,700
you willing to implement savvy and the

1000
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:14,170
answer there is pretty much a no in a

1001
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,970
you know if it's not already in

1002
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:18,670
existence then it's seen as something

1003
00:49:15,970 --> 00:49:22,089
which is a pretty high overhead for

1004
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:23,950
implementation and and you know so as I

1005
00:49:22,089 --> 00:49:26,259
was hoping or I'm hoping with this case

1006
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:31,598
that we can take this black box approach

1007
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:33,339
and it's going to be enough yeah

1008
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,980
certainly I think maybe that's the first

1009
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:39,069
step is to you know then if that doesn't

1010
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:44,680
succeed maybe we may have no partner

1011
00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:46,630
right would you agree though that trying

1012
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:48,819
this way you might be you know maybe

1013
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:52,420
enough in the first instance I mean I

1014
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:54,790
think I actually went looking at the you

1015
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:58,300
know docks of specifications quickly to

1016
00:49:54,790 --> 00:50:00,640
see did they ever spell out you know all

1017
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,130
of the stuff that the cmts has to do to

1018
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:05,348
to keep up its state and the answer is I

1019
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:07,900
couldn't find it now maybe you know

1020
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:10,119
maybe if I look harder I'll find it but

1021
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:12,700
I did not find it they do have a section

1022
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,130
which kind of says you know here

1023
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,689
some general guidelines and so you know

1024
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,760
I probably should point you to that

1025
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:20,400
that I found and it was kind of

1026
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:23,430
interesting because you know it even

1027
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:26,260
hinted that you know there's a lot of

1028
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:28,450
you know in this case it's it's home

1029
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:32,140
routers and stuff like that that only

1030
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:34,149
will support like one PD and so you know

1031
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:36,250
have seen multiple beauties and there is

1032
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,570
a problem and stuff and they said you

1033
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:39,880
know this is hopefully something that

1034
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:42,400
will will be resolved in the future that

1035
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,950
these devices will be more capable of

1036
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,720
dealing with multiple PD so it's it's

1037
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,339
you know I think that's some of the

1038
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:51,009
things that we have to put in here is

1039
00:50:48,339 --> 00:50:53,529
that these if you're gonna do this that

1040
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:55,210
you should be for you know you should be

1041
00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:57,839
capable of handling multiple prefix

1042
00:50:55,210 --> 00:51:03,310
allegations whether they're in one eye

1043
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:05,049
or multiple eye AP news and stuff right

1044
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:07,480
sorry further from the relays

1045
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:11,760
perspective you mean from the yeah from

1046
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:15,880
the delegating relays perspective right

1047
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,319
I'll have to I mean I think this I can't

1048
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,430
remember if we say this explicitly or

1049
00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:21,579
not I mean we certainly talk about

1050
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:24,339
things like restricting the number of

1051
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:26,440
prefixes that appliance can support but

1052
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:29,470
I can't and I think we say that it has

1053
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:30,790
it supports multiples actually I don't

1054
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:32,500
actually have the relative thing in

1055
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:34,180
front of me but I can certainly check it

1056
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:35,650
it's just I think it's just something we

1057
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,980
have to go and check to make sure that

1058
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,359
we cover that case and stuff because

1059
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,339
there's also I mean there's another

1060
00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:45,940
discussion that's happening in v6 ops

1061
00:51:42,339 --> 00:51:50,160
about how the CTE themselves need to

1062
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:52,900
behave especially in terms of the

1063
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:57,040
devices that are in the home or you know

1064
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:58,599
in in the end Network and you know

1065
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,450
making sure that the router

1066
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:03,520
advertisements are properly handled and

1067
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:05,589
things like that which is somewhat

1068
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,220
related to this because it's it's you

1069
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:12,040
know how the in this case it's really

1070
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:14,109
how the client from the DHCP server or

1071
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,140
you know the client in this case here

1072
00:52:14,109 --> 00:52:18,848
handles it but it's it's somewhat

1073
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,890
related to this whole problem of these

1074
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:27,010
devices are not acting in the best

1075
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:31,839
manner provide a good experience and

1076
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:35,080
user is there a discussion on that topic

1077
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:37,270
week we is there what language is there

1078
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:40,960
a discussion on that topic yes it's in

1079
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:46,420
it's in v6 ops who is it that has the

1080
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:50,650
draft is it Fernando Fernando yeah yeah

1081
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:55,540
okay yeah so he's got a draft there that

1082
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:57,730
talks about the CPEs it's themselves how

1083
00:52:55,540 --> 00:53:02,770
they handle stuff and that they need to

1084
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:06,700
handle it correctly yeah okay but then

1085
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:09,130
we don't have a topic a subject today no

1086
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:11,319
there's nothing okay I don't think I'll

1087
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,980
be in the v6 ops one when's that

1088
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:17,410
Thursday yeah we'd have to check the

1089
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:19,810
agenda to see when it's yeah two

1090
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:21,279
sessions if I'm not correctly right but

1091
00:53:19,810 --> 00:53:33,580
I've been given the time difference it

1092
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:36,340
requires too much yeah okay yeah no it's

1093
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:38,230
good work and I look forward to it

1094
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:39,490
progressing and we definitely you know

1095
00:53:38,230 --> 00:53:40,900
when you feel it's ready we should

1096
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:45,069
definitely I think you're a working

1097
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:48,490
group call for adoption okay okay so I

1098
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:49,690
have a question for Suresh so this is

1099
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:53,520
information about the comment is it

1100
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:59,650
allowed to use an automatic language I

1101
00:53:53,520 --> 00:54:02,080
know that's 7080 for dieter to make so

1102
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,880
it's generally frowned upon to do that

1103
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,509
like I don't think there's any

1104
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:10,270
straight-up prohibition for doing it but

1105
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:11,910
some people do think it's kind of an end

1106
00:54:10,270 --> 00:54:18,370
run around the system if people if

1107
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:21,790
tracked uses it so it's not so 7080 for

1108
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:24,310
kind of stuff like works yeah yeah does

1109
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:25,720
have a big section on how it's being

1110
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:33,430
used I think Tim you're one of the

1111
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:36,490
co-authors and I think you're using it

1112
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:37,640
the same way right use no I I cut cut

1113
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:43,459
the text progress oh yeah

1114
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:50,359
yeah so is informational the right

1115
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:54,589
target status for this I think so yes

1116
00:54:50,359 --> 00:54:59,029
but it could go either way really right

1117
00:54:54,589 --> 00:55:00,710
like but so the denominator text is

1118
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:02,029
really for interoperability so if you

1119
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,140
need is for interoperability I was just

1120
00:55:02,029 --> 00:55:05,059
say like you know switch to propose

1121
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:08,150
standard and let's get it done right so

1122
00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:09,650
that's what I would recommend if but if

1123
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,940
it's like more about like requirement

1124
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,470
levels not necessarily for

1125
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,960
interoperability we can go either way

1126
00:55:12,470 --> 00:55:17,149
but I would really recommend like

1127
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,140
switching to a standard strap but surely

1128
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:20,539
it's from the main thean

1129
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:22,098
interoperability draft isn't it I mean

1130
00:55:20,539 --> 00:55:25,190
it's it's so kinda how you interact with

1131
00:55:22,099 --> 00:55:29,660
clients and service that probably from

1132
00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:31,849
other vendors so ok I switch it like

1133
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,890
it's earlier done then later like no I

1134
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:35,539
don't want to do like an idea Colin and

1135
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:39,379
I use eval and then try to switch it

1136
00:55:35,539 --> 00:55:41,329
right ok I know it's something that

1137
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:43,789
comes up right like very frequently even

1138
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:46,160
though there's like no written guidance

1139
00:55:43,789 --> 00:55:47,329
so it's little bit flexible but I like

1140
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,769
I'm sure like you know you're going to

1141
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:57,650
have like three discuss on just the

1142
00:55:48,769 --> 00:56:00,769
language originally raised the point

1143
00:55:57,650 --> 00:56:02,390
about the target standard status for

1144
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:06,288
this but I can't recall what his

1145
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:11,749
rationale was for it is Alexandre in the

1146
00:56:06,289 --> 00:56:13,480
room no I don't think so no ok ok I

1147
00:56:11,749 --> 00:56:16,368
think I'll go back to alexandra on the

1148
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,049
mailing list then and and just make that

1149
00:56:16,369 --> 00:56:18,680
you know update you on this discussion

1150
00:56:18,049 --> 00:56:24,109
ok

1151
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:26,720
ok thanks right thanks ok so just a

1152
00:56:24,109 --> 00:56:29,839
comment so I looked at seventy eighty

1153
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:35,749
four and there's the section that only

1154
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:39,078
looks like it says that unlike other

1155
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:42,589
IETF documents the keywords must must

1156
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:45,319
not and so on in this document are not

1157
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:47,900
used at this describing one tonight and

1158
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:50,400
your document says that they are used

1159
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:53,460
okay

1160
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,440
I've made this okay well look I mean if

1161
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:57,630
we're going to take it back to you know

1162
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,860
in the in the 0-3 update then if we're

1163
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,270
going to go back to stand a strike on

1164
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:06,240
there then hopefully it's an honest you

1165
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:07,170
yeah yeah okay thank you very much I

1166
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:23,189
think that's everything from me this

1167
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:24,300
morning hi I'm Tim oh noes UNH ah I'm

1168
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:27,210
going to talk a little bit today about

1169
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:30,870
advancing on the dhcpv6 center to an

1170
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:33,990
Internet standard or full standard the

1171
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:35,759
DHCP Charter has a third I'd a minute

1172
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,040
that is about issuing an update to the

1173
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,540
DHCP base specification after so much

1174
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:41,210
time to advance it to an Internet

1175
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,130
standard and that's what this is about

1176
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:48,110
so a couple things just housekeeping

1177
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:50,490
stuff this is all from RFC 60 410

1178
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:53,340
they're really four bullet points under

1179
00:57:50,490 --> 00:57:55,830
there are two independent interoperable

1180
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,360
implementations in this case right that

1181
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,880
spec actually has three different types

1182
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,440
of right it's got a server relay which

1183
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:03,480
we just talked about on a client so we'd

1184
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:05,580
have to find several implementations for

1185
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,620
all of those no errata to the

1186
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:11,430
specification no unused features in the

1187
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:15,900
specification and no IPR on any of the

1188
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:18,299
things in it so currently 84 or 15

1189
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,770
there's no rodda's on it yet and there's

1190
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:21,570
no it doesn't update anything it's not

1191
00:58:19,770 --> 00:58:22,860
been updated by anything at this point

1192
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:25,980
so it doesn't have any of those and it

1193
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:27,960
doesn't have any IPR on it yet so all

1194
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:30,600
those are check boxes for all of those

1195
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:33,000
features which leaves us with a couple

1196
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:33,900
of to-do items demonstrate

1197
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:36,480
interoperability of

1198
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,040
to clients and servers and I mess this

1199
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,860
up there should be relays on there to

1200
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,090
come comma relays so we got to find a

1201
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:43,530
couple of different implementations

1202
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:45,330
which I'll talk about some ideas we have

1203
00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:48,000
in a next slide about that and then we

1204
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:50,819
need to confirm all the features in 84

1205
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,080
15 are useful and nothing should be

1206
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:55,170
removed we went through some of this

1207
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,870
when we went from when we merged 33 15

1208
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:58,920
and 36 33 we removed some with features

1209
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,900
and there's a couple more we should

1210
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:03,470
probably talk about as a group before we

1211
00:59:00,900 --> 00:59:03,470
move it over

1212
00:59:03,609 --> 00:59:09,098
so the first to solve the first problem

1213
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:11,740
the UNH Iowa would like to host a

1214
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:13,090
virtual plug fests for DHCP people who

1215
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:15,040
are interested in doing this I say

1216
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:16,510
virtual you know the advantage of being

1217
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,910
part of the universities we have a lot

1218
00:59:16,510 --> 00:59:21,010
of students who want to learn things so

1219
00:59:18,910 --> 00:59:23,140
we were thinking about taking a week in

1220
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:24,910
particular we're looking at the week of

1221
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:29,440
spring break nothing says spring break

1222
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:30,700
like dhcpv6 a lot of our students work

1223
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,130
the whole week that week so it would be

1224
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,779
a good week for us to do it so we say

1225
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,430
virtual because a lot of the plugfest we

1226
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:37,750
do we require people to be on site we

1227
00:59:36,430 --> 00:59:40,270
don't think this one is going to require

1228
00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:42,220
people to be there on site obviously if

1229
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:43,300
a group of people want to come on site

1230
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,589
and they all want to work through the

1231
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,690
issue be more than happy to have them

1232
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:48,790
there but in this case we were thinking

1233
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:50,230
virtual we're gonna do it for free in

1234
00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:51,250
this case because we think you know we

1235
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:53,500
want the students to gain the experience

1236
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:58,570
we can get our hands on the individual

1237
00:59:53,500 --> 01:00:00,940
clients servers relay agents all of

1238
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:02,710
those things whatever test plane we come

1239
01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:04,690
up with we're gonna use as the basis for

1240
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,820
the v6 ready one that'll come out there

1241
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:09,250
currently is a v6 ready one for the

1242
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:10,930
older specs we have to update it so we

1243
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:12,510
would use whatever we find from this and

1244
01:00:10,930 --> 01:00:15,129
ship it off to the ready logo committee

1245
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:16,630
as an extra anything we find that

1246
01:00:15,130 --> 01:00:18,640
doesn't work obviously we would report

1247
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,260
back to the DHCP Group saying hey we

1248
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:23,080
found these features work fine these

1249
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:23,470
things didn't work so well stuff like

1250
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:24,848
that

1251
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:27,368
in particular we would really focus

1252
01:00:24,849 --> 01:00:29,230
around the updates between the old stuff

1253
01:00:27,369 --> 01:00:31,210
and the new stuff I think there's old

1254
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:32,500
stuff and 3315 that might not work but I

1255
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:34,930
don't think it'll be as interesting as

1256
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:38,980
the update stuff that didn't make it

1257
01:00:34,930 --> 01:00:40,419
through also during the plugfest we'll

1258
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:42,849
see if there's any features that no one

1259
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:44,530
has implemented at all we report back

1260
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:45,700
any of that if we don't see any support

1261
01:00:44,530 --> 01:00:51,369
in any of the implementations for

1262
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:53,169
certain things we report those back this

1263
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:58,000
is a more generic question about that

1264
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:59,380
so unused features you know is there

1265
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,470
anything it's in the spec that anyone's

1266
01:00:59,380 --> 01:01:05,170
aware of that you know isn't used that

1267
01:01:02,470 --> 01:01:07,450
one you know I put IATA here this comes

1268
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:09,010
up all the time I don't know if people

1269
01:01:07,450 --> 01:01:11,980
find it useful we should remove it

1270
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:13,150
should we just leave it in there I think

1271
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,960
now would be the time to discuss it

1272
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:19,030
again people when I talk about it

1273
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:21,880
okay so the optional reason why we kept

1274
01:01:19,030 --> 01:01:25,120
ITA is to make it easier for other

1275
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:27,040
implementations to decline in compliance

1276
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,020
with this I think it's markers

1277
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,050
deprecated so the new implementations

1278
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:35,200
don't have to implement this right I my

1279
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:36,850
thing is I don't I've not seen in all of

1280
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:40,629
our tests and I've never seen a client

1281
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:42,819
ask for 130 volts I thought Windows

1282
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:44,410
client said I don't they may not today

1283
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:46,840
but they did at one point I think they

1284
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:49,509
did at one point my last survey of them

1285
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,770
I did not see any but I will say I'm you

1286
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:52,330
know maybe there's bits you can twiddle

1287
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,490
to make that happen it doesn't do it by

1288
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:55,660
default for sure I don't I don't know if

1289
01:01:54,490 --> 01:01:58,089
there's something in the registry or

1290
01:01:55,660 --> 01:02:02,200
some configuration you can turn it on

1291
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:03,580
that I won't come to but I you know I we

1292
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:04,990
haven't seen any at the lab but that

1293
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:06,340
doesn't mean they don't exist I just I'm

1294
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:11,890
just not aware of any deployments that

1295
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:13,630
are heavily using those yeah to remove a

1296
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:20,500
feature we'd have to republish the

1297
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:22,900
document yes yes if we removed yes you

1298
01:02:20,500 --> 01:02:29,000
have to republish it I guess yeah hadn't

1299
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:30,470
thought about that yeah um we

1300
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,030
we'll post all the stuff about the

1301
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:33,500
virtual bloodfest you know the main

1302
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:35,030
thing we want will have a registration

1303
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,630
page for people to be able to register

1304
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:39,619
to but we really want people's code

1305
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:41,810
however we can get it whether it's on a

1306
01:02:39,619 --> 01:02:42,980
VM on a dock or whatever it is if you

1307
01:02:41,810 --> 01:02:45,799
can get us code for your DHCP

1308
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:46,970
implementation that's doing 80 for 15 we

1309
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:49,070
have lots of eager students who would

1310
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:51,169
love to work with that stuff so um well

1311
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:56,740
I'll keep the DHCP list updated with the

1312
01:02:51,170 --> 01:03:00,619
details of it when when do you think the

1313
01:02:56,740 --> 01:03:04,939
ipv6 ready logo stuff will be in here

1314
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:06,890
guy asked me this I think if I had to

1315
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:09,830
guess I would guess May they do their

1316
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:11,810
major releases in November in May so my

1317
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:15,348
guess is we would be aiming from a time

1318
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:17,000
frame I haven't talked to the other labs

1319
01:03:15,349 --> 01:03:18,170
about this but I don't think it'll be a

1320
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,790
problem since we have a background it's

1321
01:03:18,170 --> 01:03:22,040
not like we're making something new so I

1322
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:25,509
think this is just updating yeah so I

1323
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:25,509
don't think this will be a major problem

1324
01:03:32,830 --> 01:03:44,720
that's cool and that should help us

1325
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:48,080
greatly Suresh do you have any comments

1326
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:53,089
about the process where there's anything

1327
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:54,348
more we have to do already yeah so

1328
01:03:53,089 --> 01:03:55,759
description so I really hope we don't

1329
01:03:54,349 --> 01:03:59,150
have to remove this so it's like a

1330
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:01,250
easier process that way so there is a

1331
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:03,050
status change process that we have in

1332
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:05,900
place like I kind of got it down pat

1333
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:08,180
because I got rid of ipv5 and v7 and so

1334
01:04:05,900 --> 01:04:10,490
on so I know like how to do this process

1335
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:13,279
like and here it is here so if he gets

1336
01:04:10,490 --> 01:04:14,598
on next then he has to do that too but I

1337
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,210
think that's an easier process then

1338
01:04:14,599 --> 01:04:18,170
doing the document through the whole

1339
01:04:16,210 --> 01:04:19,820
last call process right because

1340
01:04:18,170 --> 01:04:22,010
everything opens up so you cannot just

1341
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:23,630
say my idea of last calling dis change

1342
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:24,830
right like yeah the whole document comes

1343
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:27,890
out people are going to come up with

1344
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:30,529
things so I I think really like you know

1345
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:32,089
if like you know some implementation

1346
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:33,710
implements this I'll just keep it and

1347
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:35,830
then go on right even if it's like not

1348
01:04:33,710 --> 01:04:38,270
widely used if it's at least implemented

1349
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:40,790
we have a case to just keep it on and

1350
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:42,470
move on right and I don't think it's

1351
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:45,170
like significantly different from

1352
01:04:42,470 --> 01:04:46,549
i na to like have like too much extra

1353
01:04:45,170 --> 01:04:49,819
code like just hanging around there for

1354
01:04:46,550 --> 01:04:51,109
that so I would just say like you know

1355
01:04:49,819 --> 01:04:55,160
go for the standard status change

1356
01:04:51,109 --> 01:04:57,020
process if possible and March is like if

1357
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:59,060
he write because it could be there in my

1358
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,079
term or the next ad stuff so like we

1359
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:06,970
have to figure out like you know how the

1360
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:06,970
reports come on okay thank you

1361
01:05:08,740 --> 01:05:18,259
so that brings us to the end of the

1362
01:05:12,890 --> 01:05:21,170
agenda I think you know just as a quick

1363
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:23,210
summary the problem statement draft

1364
01:05:21,170 --> 01:05:26,900
we're gonna you're going to change the

1365
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:30,010
title I think you want to leave the name

1366
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:34,010
you know the document ID itself the same

1367
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:36,170
you know the draft title or not the

1368
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:39,619
title the draft name I guess isn't

1369
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:42,020
waiting to say leave that the same and

1370
01:05:39,619 --> 01:05:43,910
once that's done and if there's any

1371
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:46,310
other comments that you've received or

1372
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:47,720
whatever we can you know hopefully

1373
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:52,270
initially then working to the blast call

1374
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:57,140
for that document the yang model we need

1375
01:05:52,270 --> 01:06:04,069
reviewers as Ian requested so anybody

1376
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:08,060
that can please do so for the dhcpv6

1377
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:12,040
prefix delegation stuff in was going to

1378
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:14,560
look at the 2119 language stuff and

1379
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:17,540
maybe there's a few edits that he's got

1380
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:21,230
to do still and then hopefully we can do

1381
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:28,339
a working group call for adoption and

1382
01:06:21,230 --> 01:06:29,359
for the advancing 84 15 we're gonna you

1383
01:06:28,339 --> 01:06:31,190
know look out for the plugfest

1384
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:34,549
information the virtual club fests and

1385
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:36,140
hopefully people will submit the their

1386
01:06:34,550 --> 01:06:38,510
implementation so that we can get

1387
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:41,299
sufficient coverage in that testing you

1388
01:06:38,510 --> 01:06:43,700
know they they I mean they they really

1389
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:47,240
should be 84 or 15 implementations not

1390
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48,828
like 33:15 3633 implementations so

1391
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:51,529
that's one of the key things that I

1392
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:53,990
think we have to make sure that they

1393
01:06:51,530 --> 01:06:56,090
adhere to that I you know I don't know

1394
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:57,620
if there's any I mean that may be

1395
01:06:56,090 --> 01:07:00,560
we want to think about is there any sort

1396
01:06:57,620 --> 01:07:02,960
of tests to sort of confirm that you

1397
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:07,970
know somebody saying it you know maybe

1398
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:10,820
something about 70 RC 75 50 handling of

1399
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:12,169
multiple yeah the main one we're gonna

1400
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:15,080
mess around with it's really easy to

1401
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:17,210
tell is the t1 and t2 timers because you

1402
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:25,310
have to match them up since that's the

1403
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:29,390
that'll give it away really really ok

1404
01:07:25,310 --> 01:07:35,470
great well thanks everybody

1405
01:07:29,390 --> 01:07:35,470
anybody have any last comments okay

1406
01:07:42,520 --> 01:07:55,450
France is a bomb so we got discussion

1407
01:07:47,650 --> 01:08:03,140
about feature in disappeared from

1408
01:07:55,450 --> 01:08:07,299
response expect which wants to cry

1409
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:12,020
firewood to should put in its response

1410
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:19,089
France sounds to copy sir client address

1411
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:25,010
when firms in front to acknowledge a

1412
01:08:19,089 --> 01:08:29,089
packet it seems a good idea because they

1413
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:36,200
see PV for specification it's sign out

1414
01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:41,170
about this and it seems at least some

1415
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:48,439
people believe it's it was a good idea

1416
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:54,399
program is draft will Experian in 12 so

1417
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:56,410
7 years ago I don't know why it it was

1418
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:01,729
experienced

1419
01:08:56,410 --> 01:09:04,269
I this is basically provides me before I

1420
01:09:01,729 --> 01:09:06,858
joined HC but my understanding is that

1421
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:08,589
the major driving force behind this was

1422
01:09:06,859 --> 01:09:11,589
David Hawkins and

1423
01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:17,830
he changed jobs and so basically they

1424
01:09:11,589 --> 01:09:20,019
drop diet so I don't know what to do

1425
01:09:17,830 --> 01:09:27,309
perhaps we should discuss about it in

1426
01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:29,020
the Middle East I guess if you want to

1427
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:31,270
pick up the draft and can try to

1428
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:33,640
continue it that would be something to

1429
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:35,050
do you know we'd probably have to know

1430
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:36,850
we'd have to go through the working

1431
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:39,660
group adoption call again and stuff like

1432
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:43,420
that because it is kind of a long-dead

1433
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:45,399
document now so you know you might you

1434
01:09:43,420 --> 01:09:48,040
might want if you want to pick it up and

1435
01:09:45,399 --> 01:09:52,269
you think it's useful and important work

1436
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:53,019
you take a look at me not so much would

1437
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:57,340
it be okay

1438
01:09:53,020 --> 01:10:02,200
I mean the zero six expired in 2020

1439
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:04,480
twelve I personally don't mind like just

1440
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:05,769
having the draft like and try to because

1441
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:07,240
I got working of last call you're gonna

1442
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:08,860
find out but it's up to you like very

1443
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:11,410
gonna find out if their support for it

1444
01:10:08,860 --> 01:10:13,360
or not right and if it's something

1445
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:15,490
simple like might be like just filing an

1446
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:17,469
errata might be like a thing saying hey

1447
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:18,910
this is like some kind of clarification

1448
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:23,050
on the original doc and then we can go

1449
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:24,670
from there too but either way like I'm

1450
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:27,010
okay like I don't want to like put too

1451
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:28,750
much process here so if we can just

1452
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:31,450
drive it and add like Francis as the

1453
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:33,370
editor and and keep moving I'm okay okay

1454
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:37,090
so this is like if he wants to be the

1455
01:10:33,370 --> 01:10:41,910
editor but yeah okay so it is this is

1456
01:10:37,090 --> 01:10:41,910
like three pages of the actual text

1457
01:10:51,170 --> 01:11:03,390
and I assume you also have no issue with

1458
01:10:55,500 --> 01:11:09,510
us adopting the the prefix delegating

1459
01:11:03,390 --> 01:11:10,650
