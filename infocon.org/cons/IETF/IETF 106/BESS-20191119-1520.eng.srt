00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:49,599
sitting with us as the shepherds waiting

84
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:54,639
for reviews and for us to push the

85
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,099
button to request publication there's an

86
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,930
action on early to update the ethernet

87
00:06:57,099 --> 00:07:07,560
of the evpn virtual Ethernet segment

88
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:12,400
draft the gmpm LD we MLD proxy this is

89
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,860
we're expecting an update imminently we

90
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,068
provided a review to the authors of the

91
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:22,900
fast trail overdraft I think we're still

92
00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:26,550
waiting for responsible minute yeah the

93
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,859
MSD PSA interoperation drafter and VPN

94
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:33,520
i'm currently reviewing that for my

95
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:37,750
shepherds review the one procedure

96
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,030
updates we need to argue this whether

97
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:48,610
you've provided maori view maybe last

98
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:52,568
weekend and the evpn reference DF has

99
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,729
just passed working group last call and

100
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:56,830
we have a long list of drafts that we

101
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:58,330
believe are already for any authors have

102
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,539
indicated they think are ready for

103
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,529
working group last call and we will set

104
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:04,210
up a schedule

105
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:06,940
following this IETF to get those

106
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,799
processed as well so we know some of the

107
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,690
authors have been quite eager to to get

108
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,940
on with that and and we are doing our

109
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:18,219
best to to get through the through the

110
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:20,680
list don't any of you forgot bets any

111
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:28,120
updates on on those from any of the

112
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:29,620
authors in the room Hey thank you and

113
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,289
this this slide just summarizes some

114
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,469
working group document updates so the

115
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:39,819
first one is the EVP and multicast flow

116
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:42,190
DF election so we're waiting for waiting

117
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:45,130
on an RJ MP proxy a draft to move

118
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,440
forward and we're expecting this to be

119
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,160
ready for working for a score by the

120
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,160
next ITF

121
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,760
the service training draft is currently

122
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,920
parked

123
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:06,630
although the authors may want to revive

124
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:09,120
that in future and the evpn fast DF

125
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,250
recovery draft though so there's an

126
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,710
existing implementation but the draft

127
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:18,060
has expired and we need to get that

128
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:23,100
updated as soon as as possible so we can

129
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:25,050
request for working with law school we

130
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,460
adopted some new working group documents

131
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:33,709
including SRP six services the the me

132
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:38,130
BPO and I said see my crush draft

133
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:47,130
Ethiopian virtual hub and em VPN

134
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:50,220
seamless interoperability okay and we

135
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,960
have a number of documents that the

136
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,210
authors of indicated and we believe is

137
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:57,180
probably ready for us to run a work and

138
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,620
group adoption poll or read through

139
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:15,719
these but you can you can see these on

140
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:18,210
the side okay so regarding if you hit

141
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,470
all updates that we are requiring from

142
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,480
the office

143
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,400
so sometimes it's working sometimes it's

144
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:27,420
not working we are really expecting to

145
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:30,630
get in between updates for all the

146
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,640
editors of working group documents so we

147
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,580
can track if there is something going

148
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,300
wrong or if you are blocked and if we

149
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:43,860
can probably help in any way yeah so

150
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,930
young models are really the one which

151
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:52,470
are yeah harassing really slowly

152
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:55,829
right this is Mancha from Siena both for

153
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:59,760
l2 VPN any VPN right yang model size you

154
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:02,580
say we did not make any progress in the

155
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,260
last six months but we are we are

156
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:06,510
planning to finish it up as soon as

157
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:09,060
possible there are very few things left

158
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:11,850
I mean obvious when you are at the last

159
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,349
stage the newer things crop up people

160
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:16,650
want different things in it and we

161
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:18,930
recognize the Nate's and a couple of

162
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:22,560
items that we need to so we'll have to

163
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,880
gather all the other co-authors and get

164
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,339
it done before right after this meaning

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,010
okay do you need any help from our side

166
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,320
like a setting up interim meeting or

167
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:37,680
whatever to try to speed up the work or

168
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,900
do you handle it on your side sorry I

169
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,140
didn't get it can you repeat my point is

170
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,290
do you need any help from an outsider

171
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,090
no we at the moment we don't need any

172
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:50,520
help I think we got a good handle on

173
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,270
what we have to do with respect to the

174
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:57,420
updates but yeah if we do need we will

175
00:11:54,270 --> 00:12:05,100
reach out to you for for any help we

176
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:06,900
need okay thanks just interrupt if there

177
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,050
are actually anyone who is planning on

178
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,060
implementation EVP and camp model if

179
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:17,790
someone actually say that it's going to

180
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:21,569
be useful I mean because the topic came

181
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,790
up on open config cleese and there's

182
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:31,020
going to be some effort to build one so

183
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:33,689
would be good to know what spinner man

184
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,329
comin up from Cisco so I have a question

185
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,880
about MVP and yang we have not been able

186
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:41,190
to get any input from the author so do

187
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,020
we need it to be taken over by someone

188
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:47,670
else in the working group or how do we

189
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:49,620
want to make progress if you really feel

190
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,719
is that your comments are not addressed

191
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:53,910
yes we can find someone else a cuvette

192
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:56,880
at least from the last two IETF I don't

193
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:59,610
see much of traction are much of email

194
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,830
response as well so okay I didn't get

195
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,930
any input whether they really need help

196
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:06,540
or they're not able to progress what is

197
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,329
stopping so I don't it's kind of one-way

198
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:11,490
communication right now okay we can

199
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:13,730
discuss of trying to see which way to

200
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,730
proceed

201
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,699
[Music]

202
00:13:25,529 --> 00:13:29,370
yes I think you're up first

203
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:56,060
right okay good afternoon folks so I'll

204
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:59,329
be talking on behalf of proxy draft

205
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,400
author and we had a working group last

206
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:03,500
call I think two weeks back two or three

207
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,949
weeks back when working group last call

208
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:10,220
passed for this document and thanks to

209
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,770
her he had pretty good comment and one

210
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,100
of the comment was about one field in

211
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:18,500
the NLRA of route type eight and after

212
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,420
having multiple discussion among authors

213
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,800
we don't see that there is any real use

214
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:26,900
case for that particular field so we had

215
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,300
couple of half sons and there is one

216
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,550
proposal which I would like to bring to

217
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,660
the working group and see the feedback

218
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:37,550
from the room as well and the scope of

219
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,459
this change will be limited to

220
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:44,329
multihoming peers and majority of the I

221
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:45,920
think deployment are cases where most

222
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:48,880
probably you will have same vendor

223
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:54,530
multihoming peers and these routes are

224
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:57,950
scoped within same ESI so right now the

225
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:59,780
NLRA looks like in the left side and it

226
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:03,470
has there is something called as a leaf

227
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:06,260
sync sequence number and this route is

228
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:08,960
nothing but IGMP leave and we don't

229
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:12,200
think that there is any use case where

230
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:15,290
we have to send IGMP leave sequence

231
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,410
number and we did speak to a couple of

232
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,180
vendors who have implementation and none

233
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,270
of them find any real use case for

234
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:26,660
sequence number to be used so one of the

235
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:29,990
proposal is to to keep it clean remove

236
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:32,480
that complete four bytes from the NLRA

237
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:36,140
and NLRA will look something like in the

238
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,580
right side since there are already

239
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:42,740
existing running code in the field who

240
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:46,550
might be using the old version of NLRA

241
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:48,680
so one of the proposal was to in the BGP

242
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,949
we would accept both both of the routes

243
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,739
so it it might come with NLRA what is

244
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,530
the new value let's say that it is X and

245
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,080
it might come with X plus 4 bytes as

246
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:13,160
well if it is implemented in the older

247
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:19,910
version any questions feedback chance

248
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:22,579
cutter wouldn't it be a little less

249
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,890
intrusive to just make that field

250
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:28,280
reserved instead of having to variant in

251
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:32,180
codings that the implementations have to

252
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:35,329
support so there are already I think two

253
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:37,670
variations of implementation today one

254
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:41,650
of that is without sequence number and

255
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:41,650
one of that is with sequence number and

256
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:56,900
so we already have the worst case in the

257
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:59,720
field is what you're saying okay I just

258
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:02,300
want to bring up Micah for this work

259
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,540
group consideration the sequence number

260
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:11,020
is part of key for BGP and an eye for

261
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:13,879
type six a type eight evpn routes so I

262
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,099
would request to support backward

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,589
compatibility because this is something

264
00:17:16,099 --> 00:17:22,429
we cannot take lightly this is not part

265
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:29,179
of attribute for tenon I this is BGP key

266
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:32,540
so if we support have lens with without

267
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:35,900
this sequence number as a key you know

268
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:38,629
it seems to me like in order to achieve

269
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:41,420
this the key has to be consistent for

270
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:44,330
people to support sequence number as a

271
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:48,350
part of key this has to be there and an

272
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:51,230
eye has this has been there defined like

273
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:53,810
this for past three years so backward

274
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:56,350
compatibility that's a problem to take

275
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:59,919
it out it's a key it's not a attributes

276
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,409
so if we suppose

277
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:06,310
this boss I need to be defined which

278
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,130
means route type a same route we'll have

279
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:20,679
a two different formats how we solve

280
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:23,380
this issue here Jeff has so I'm going to

281
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:26,020
build and the other two points made for

282
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,970
slightly different reasons I spend a

283
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:30,580
large portion my day job dealing with

284
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,080
BGP incremental deployment issues of the

285
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:34,929
negative consequences when you get it

286
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,800
wrong mmm-hmm the general rule set that

287
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:40,570
you're violating is that once a NL or I

288
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,659
type forgive at a fee Saffy's been

289
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:47,250
defined you can't change it because once

290
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,840
you've changed the key or the syntax the

291
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,740
reaction that the receiving pure and

292
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,020
receiving something it doesn't

293
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:54,520
understand for whatever reason you know

294
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:56,889
that when it's syntactically incorrect

295
00:18:54,520 --> 00:19:00,070
is to drop the session so what you are

296
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,470
showing up here is drop the session if

297
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:05,350
you want to make these things on a box

298
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:07,450
by a box change that's partially what

299
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,459
bgp capabilities are for you can get

300
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:10,870
variances that way you know and it's

301
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,700
like a patch situation if you really

302
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,280
want to it's not generally a good idea

303
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:18,430
because you then have to figure out how

304
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:21,610
this flows across the entire network my

305
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:23,320
recommendation would be the field it's

306
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:26,229
preserved even if it's considered

307
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,909
useless I would leave it to the experts

308
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,040
on EVP honest what that field should

309
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,720
contain but minimally though if since

310
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,330
it's a fixed byte value in the current

311
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,770
PD you know stick zeros in there or

312
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,840
whatever makes you happy if that's a

313
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:39,430
necessary thing there's already

314
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,669
precedent for that then like

315
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,980
multi-protocol bgp has a field that used

316
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:46,060
to be called SNP a it hasn't been used

317
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:47,890
for that since it was originally

318
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:50,350
specified and now on the update of the

319
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,570
spec it's just the magic zeroes value so

320
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:55,600
don't be afraid to waste space in the

321
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:58,300
NRI because the consequence is that what

322
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,800
you're doing is basically potentially

323
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:02,530
making the network unstable making it

324
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:05,950
drop sessions you know 10 thanks for

325
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:08,830
your input about the GPS and flap I

326
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:12,240
think one of the consideration was to

327
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,240
accept both of the key lengths

328
00:20:13,289 --> 00:20:16,889
unfortunately the problem is that it

329
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:19,860
fort to accept both of them you'd have

330
00:20:16,889 --> 00:20:21,418
to change the route type if you're

331
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:23,250
willing to define a basically a version

332
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:25,649
two of this route type and allow for the

333
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:27,990
procedures that do that that would be

334
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:29,250
acceptable but if you can't change the

335
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,230
existing one because you have code out

336
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:34,769
there that will treat in either

337
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:37,019
direction it is a syntax here I'm going

338
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:38,549
to offer a little bit of reading for you

339
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,700
know please check the minutes to pull up

340
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:44,519
the discussion point but attribute 128

341
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,309
for BGP was the thing that got deployed

342
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,110
that had two different formats two

343
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:51,870
different code bases all from my

344
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:54,979
employer and the negative consequence in

345
00:20:51,870 --> 00:21:03,689
that case was global internet outages

346
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:05,700
thanks for that Nokia I think we have an

347
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:08,970
issue no matter what because there are

348
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,870
two shipping implementations in the

349
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:16,830
field with different route key with or

350
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:18,268
without the sequence number so what i

351
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,340
would do i mean this presentation is

352
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,889
very good because it raises awareness of

353
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,199
the issue but i would also send an email

354
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:27,719
to the list so that you know other

355
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,679
vendors with potential implementations

356
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:34,500
can also say something about it and yeah

357
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:37,169
my preferences still would be to remove

358
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:42,090
something that has no use in the air in

359
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:43,980
the route thanks and about sending mail

360
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:46,740
to the list i think two weeks back i had

361
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,389
already sent email with these details

362
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,940
what is in the slide deck so though i

363
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:55,080
didn't receive any response yet in the

364
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,409
list so chris power is juniper networks

365
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,750
i mean it's good to raise awareness of

366
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:02,370
the issue but you know you're asking for

367
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,929
feedback from the working group but not

368
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:06,658
really supplying the information about

369
00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:08,669
the actual implementations right you've

370
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:11,639
sort of address presented this as if

371
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:14,850
it's a green you know this is the draft

372
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:17,519
zero 2 of this whereas they're shipping

373
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:20,059
implementations so it would really be

374
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,889
good to actually go into the details of

375
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,480
the backwards compatibility and say okay

376
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:26,279
there are multiple implementations doing

377
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,179
things differently and saying this would

378
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,559
be the impact of doing

379
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,809
this this would be impact of doing this

380
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,690
and really get him that detail as

381
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,249
opposed to sort of a hypothetical you

382
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:38,070
know oh if we're designing this from

383
00:22:35,249 --> 00:22:39,989
scratch what would it be so in your

384
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,059
email to the list it would be good to

385
00:22:39,989 --> 00:22:44,039
actually get into that level of detail

386
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,049
because you know someone's gonna be

387
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,139
unhappy with the final decision I

388
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:51,509
believe yeah sure thanks so maybe you

389
00:22:49,139 --> 00:22:59,789
can reply in the list I'll provide

390
00:22:51,509 --> 00:23:02,070
whatever details are needed q Patel

391
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:05,999
arcus I know you talked with me about

392
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:09,418
this and sorry if I was jet-lagged back

393
00:23:05,999 --> 00:23:11,969
then but if you wanna take that filled

394
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,330
out you have an existing implementations

395
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:16,499
and if they're doing a strict NLRA check

396
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:21,269
there's a chance you might bounce a

397
00:23:16,499 --> 00:23:23,099
session if you want to take the filled

398
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:25,049
out maybe you want to use some kind of a

399
00:23:23,099 --> 00:23:28,830
capability exchange to indicate the new

400
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:31,499
NLRA field or the size has been changed

401
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:33,299
I'm not sure if the implementations out

402
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:36,179
there are doing a strict checking on the

403
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,830
size which also brings a question is

404
00:23:36,179 --> 00:23:39,869
that do you really need to change at

405
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:46,039
this time or can you leave it as it as

406
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:46,039
it is and be done with it okay

407
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:58,560
well I hypo one from highway color we

408
00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:01,590
see we think that if you delete this

409
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,649
second number although it may be no some

410
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,679
not some news but it will you must

411
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:10,890
consider how to involve with other

412
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:14,160
vendors because some in some manner hi

413
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:19,980
were implementing information disease

414
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:21,060
and also many many many operators I want

415
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:23,250
to each here

416
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:27,060
many vendors who in Harper with each

417
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:28,950
other so so I think it is same input as

418
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,840
what I got from others that will have to

419
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:33,390
provide more details so in this light

420
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,360
Nick I didn't put all the text which was

421
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:38,540
supposed to be put in the draft itself

422
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,459
that how to handle these different cases

423
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:47,430
so those details maybe I'll send it in

424
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:51,360
the list very last comment yeah so

425
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:53,970
Sathya from Cisco so would it be less

426
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,580
intrusive if we just you know add a knob

427
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:59,490
as we discussed some minutes back so

428
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,919
clearly this routes are only for like

429
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,890
multi home PS right they don't need to

430
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:10,140
go to different years so maybe we can

431
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:11,940
consider that too okay thanks okay keep

432
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:15,830
discussing on the list because this is a

433
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:15,830
important issues that we have to solve

434
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:41,300
hi good afternoon

435
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:45,220
so just fairly quick updates this drafts

436
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:49,430
been discussed a few times before so not

437
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,190
significantly new so just a quick

438
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:55,430
reminder this is essentially a mobility

439
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,870
draft that details mobility procedures

440
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:00,040
and sequence number assignment

441
00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:01,489
procedures across various evpn IRB

442
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:03,710
scenarios

443
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:09,920
as well as duplicate address detection

444
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:13,490
procedures across these scenarios what's

445
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:16,190
changed since the last revision there's

446
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:20,380
basically one new section on mobility

447
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:24,140
convergence which essentially details

448
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:27,110
specific triggers where arc or nd probes

449
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:30,530
may be used to speed up mobility

450
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:33,530
convergence and it also kind of shows

451
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:36,379
how the fundamental idea within the

452
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:40,580
draft that is used for sequence number

453
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:48,920
inheritance may also be used for this

454
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:51,649
specific convergence scenarios so in

455
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:54,170
terms of overall status it's I mean it's

456
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,710
a fairly stable draft it's already has

457
00:26:54,170 --> 00:27:01,430
multiple implementations it is already

458
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:04,610
in the working group last call queue but

459
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:10,700
any other comments before the last call

460
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:13,540
happy to take them any any questions or

461
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,540
anything at this point

462
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:34,190
okay so this one's also been discussed a

463
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:38,200
few times before this is again just

464
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:42,440
recapping this is essentially defines

465
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:46,640
handling or usage for link bandwidth

466
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,010
attribute in route type 1 for unequal

467
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,300
load balancing of overlay unicast

468
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:56,080
traffic from remote piece based on ESI

469
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:59,000
bandwidth distribution as well as

470
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:02,570
defines usage of link bandwidth

471
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,200
attribute in route type phone for DF

472
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:11,200
election for the ESI in proportion to

473
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,200
the bandwidth distribution for that ESI

474
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:19,520
for the DF election part it essentially

475
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:22,879
defines how this how the link bandwidth

476
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:26,960
attribute is to be used for each of the

477
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:32,060
four odd DF election algorithms that are

478
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:34,700
defined today so no major updates since

479
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:36,620
last time I mean the last the last

480
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:40,790
update to the draft was essentially

481
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:47,840
addition of weighted HRW DF election

482
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:50,510
which is such as soft again from draft

483
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,929
perspective this is ready for last call

484
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:56,300
it's been fairly stable there was an AI

485
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,450
last time to kind of check on the

486
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:02,330
implementation status from Cisco side I

487
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:06,140
did check it has not been implemented

488
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:08,840
yet it is fairly close it's kind of like

489
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,180
in design but it's not it's not

490
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:12,980
implemented yet so I wanted to kind of

491
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:15,320
you know also check with any other

492
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:18,560
vendors anyone else who's aware of any

493
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:23,060
other implementations to let the authors

494
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:26,290
know that's it on this one any any

495
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,290
questions comments

496
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:54,440
okay

497
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:57,680
so PC control plane for evpn this is

498
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:01,520
this is a draft that was first presented

499
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,990
in Prague couple of ITX back since then

500
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,260
it has gone through a couple of

501
00:30:02,990 --> 00:30:10,910
revisions and couple of name changes

502
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:14,270
that I will cover just a recap without

503
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:17,000
going into all the details again it's

504
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:20,629
essentially defines a PC control plane

505
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:23,780
for Mac Mac IP and prefix learning the

506
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:27,040
main motivation behind this draft is

507
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:29,860
essentially to provide an alternative

508
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,870
control plane based alternative for

509
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:37,280
learning that is decoupled from data

510
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:40,580
plane traffic for simplicity and more

511
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:42,980
deterministic behavior as well as may I

512
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,720
mean the biggest sort of use case that

513
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,110
has been kind of detailed in the draft

514
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,120
is essentially how it simplifies a lot

515
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:53,419
of the learning and convergence

516
00:30:50,120 --> 00:31:00,100
scenarios particularly across a

517
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:03,610
multihoming lag based learning so

518
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:06,649
revisions since it was lost presented

519
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:10,790
there's a new use case that's been added

520
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:14,330
it's essentially it has extensions added

521
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:17,810
for a CD to be able to signal a desired

522
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:22,520
SLA to an EVP NP that's essentially

523
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:24,860
extends the existing Mac and Mac IP tlvs

524
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:29,420
that are defined in the drop two also

525
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:34,610
carry a desired SLA value to the PE and

526
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:38,510
the main idea there is essentially to to

527
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:41,570
enable any VPN or the set of E VPN pease

528
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,000
to be able to provide an SLA based

529
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:47,659
service to a c e which is essentially be

530
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:51,260
able to route or bridge traffic to that

531
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:56,830
c e on traffic engineered paths in order

532
00:31:51,260 --> 00:32:00,070
to meet the c requested SLA the other

533
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:03,789
changes that it's kind of gone through

534
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:07,299
3dl protocol that this draft is based on

535
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:08,619
as the underlying protocol has gone

536
00:32:07,299 --> 00:32:12,509
through some revisions

537
00:32:08,619 --> 00:32:15,988
it was L SOE earlier and now it's l 3d L

538
00:32:12,509 --> 00:32:18,460
so it basically incorporates changes

539
00:32:15,989 --> 00:32:20,799
that have that have happened in the base

540
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:25,350
protocol to be in sync with the latest l

541
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:30,299
3d inspect other than that it's

542
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:33,219
basically replaces these older versions

543
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:37,200
the first one was called EVP analyst OE

544
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:41,440
and the next one was called EVP NL 3dl

545
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,899
that the draft does also now explicitly

546
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,590
mentioned with the work happening on

547
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:50,228
lldp v2 that even though the craft is

548
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,928
currently based entirely on l3 dl there

549
00:32:50,229 --> 00:32:57,039
are future extensions possible to

550
00:32:52,929 --> 00:33:00,159
incorporate new underlying protocols

551
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,649
like L LD be v2 and and that is

552
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:08,200
inflected in the name change for the

553
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:13,658
draft as well overall status it is still

554
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:16,749
work-in-progress largely so yeah any any

555
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:24,849
input interest comments more than happy

556
00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:28,200
to collaborate and take feedback any

557
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:28,200
questions anything

558
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:56,040
[Music]

559
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:04,229
hello so I'll be providing an update on

560
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,310
on to draft the productive draft and the

561
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:10,830
single flow active load balancing draft

562
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:17,159
so what's changed since since the last

563
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:20,730
version in the last IETF is so we

564
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:23,159
received feedback to add a capability

565
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:29,659
bit for the port mode so that's been

566
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:32,909
added to the draft the section for

567
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:37,619
essentially was going over the the port

568
00:34:32,909 --> 00:34:39,960
active DF mode and what we did is we

569
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:44,220
expanded an entire section to address

570
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:47,520
essentially the the orthogonal of the

571
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:53,118
orthogonal T sorry of this new pivot and

572
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:57,270
the three existing DF election modes so

573
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,820
we added a section for essentially the

574
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:03,770
RFC 7432 DF election the modulo based

575
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:07,140
one with a change that we received I

576
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:11,790
figured it was on the alias or or at the

577
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:14,190
last IETF to to select a different bite

578
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:16,279
for the modulo operation or a different

579
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:19,200
set of bytes sorry just to get better

580
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,790
entropy as opposed to the prior version

581
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:27,029
where we were using the last byte of the

582
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:32,880
ESI and then also a section for HR W and

583
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:35,310
the press the preference based DF so the

584
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,880
next steps for this draft so we consider

585
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:42,330
this draft to now be amateur draft with

586
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,270
multi vendor support implementations and

587
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:52,049
adoptions in the field so this draft is

588
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:57,480
very much ready for for adoption any

589
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:59,010
question on this one actually I think

590
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,690
the biggest question is is there any

591
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,790
feedback that we received that we have

592
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:05,000
not addressed in this new version of the

593
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:05,000
draft

594
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:21,609
the second draft the changes we made to

595
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:23,440
the theater gateway product is to add or

596
00:36:21,609 --> 00:36:25,900
two to flesh out the backward

597
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:30,130
compatibility section so we clarified a

598
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:32,020
few things and expanded that section so

599
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,599
we went into more detail of the to ESS

600
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,790
solution and how this draft improves

601
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:40,329
upon that - ESI solution but we actually

602
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:41,890
went through all the steps of how this

603
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:46,900
can also be achieved with a - ESI

604
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:50,250
solution then based on some feedback we

605
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:54,160
also added a section addressing

606
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:57,040
essentially the route resolution of a of

607
00:36:54,160 --> 00:37:00,759
a remote PE that operates in strict 7432

608
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:06,420
mode because if you recall in the proto

609
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:10,780
draft essentially we're claiming a 1/3

610
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:13,810
1/3 load-balancing bit in the in the ESI

611
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,240
label extended community and remote Peas

612
00:37:13,810 --> 00:37:17,560
may not understand this this new bit and

613
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,189
they would essentially then operate in

614
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:24,730
all active mode so we addressed that in

615
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:26,740
this new section so the convergence the

616
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:29,800
and the mobility sections we already

617
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:32,229
addressed after the the last night or

618
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:36,700
two ATF's ago based on feedback we

619
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:38,770
received so this 0 5 version of draft if

620
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,060
you go over the diff I'm really sorry

621
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:42,099
about that but we switched from the

622
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:45,150
source for men are off to XML so there's

623
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:48,180
quite a bit of formatting noise in there

624
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,319
so the next steps for this one

625
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:53,129
essentially it's- it it is still a

626
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:56,380
working document so we do still welcome

627
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:58,660
comments and feedback but the document

628
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:09,760
would be ready to progress based on

629
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:12,430
based on feedback ok I still find a few

630
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,579
things quite confusing in the draft and

631
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,580
I can send you guys an email later but

632
00:38:15,579 --> 00:38:20,160
so one of the things is

633
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:24,740
the trophy is valid for pure layer two

634
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,950
and also for IRB on the ring piece and

635
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:31,680
at some point you talked about using our

636
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:35,910
probes when you have a Mac flush in one

637
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,910
of the peas but it isn't clear to me if

638
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,250
it works in the pure layer 2 scenario or

639
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,430
not because in that case you may not

640
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:48,210
even know that the ARP entries of the

641
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:50,250
connected hoses okay maybe we can talk

642
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:52,260
we can talk afterwards I'm not sure

643
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,050
which section that would be alright yeah

644
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:59,460
yeah I can I can let you know the other

645
00:38:55,050 --> 00:39:02,270
the other comment is so in the past I

646
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:04,890
suggested to use for the Mac flash

647
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:07,950
message the Mac mobility X in the

648
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,890
community and that it seems that you

649
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:13,740
guys added that but the still you're

650
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:16,200
calling it McFly text in the community

651
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:18,689
and in the Ayana section you are

652
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,129
requesting a value for it which is not

653
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:25,500
needed although at all yeah ok you know

654
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:41,120
yeah a few of those things that are we

655
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:41,120
can we can take offline shrink you Linda

656
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:05,620
okay good afternoon

657
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:08,200
okay so this time we got some comments

658
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:12,850
from the mailing list and also from IT

659
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:14,580
105 about this bgp usage or sd-1 this

660
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:18,210
time I'm primarily just goes through

661
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:23,470
different scenario how we use PGP to

662
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:27,370
scale sd1 so the purpose is really to

663
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:30,009
show to the other s deals or industry

664
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,140
places like for example map has this sd1

665
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,020
project they have lots of debates on how

666
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:38,940
to achieve some of this management on

667
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:44,130
the IPSec tunneling and using PGP

668
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:47,710
actually make it very very nice solution

669
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:51,430
so this it just shows them see for

670
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:54,400
example in this case you may have I'm

671
00:40:51,430 --> 00:40:57,759
just using one p1 CPE

672
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:02,340
SE p2 as an example if you two have

673
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:06,880
three attach routes and with the regular

674
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:10,750
PGP update you basically have the Browse

675
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:15,100
encoded in the allow I pass attribute

676
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:19,870
and using the tunneling cap to indicate

677
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:22,690
detailed property of the tunnel and true

678
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:27,640
that tunnel in cap today doesn't have

679
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:31,600
the IPSec properties encoded in IDR

680
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:35,680
there is a draft discussing how to weigh

681
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:39,009
at that particular IP sac so but the one

682
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,600
difference in IPSec is in a way that is

683
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:45,670
very different than our traditional

684
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:48,700
configuration and normally when you

685
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,400
configure IPSec which is always the

686
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:55,540
point-to-point protocol like for example

687
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:57,940
on the on the note c p2 when you

688
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,759
configure IPSec you usually have to

689
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:04,870
configure who's your remote end and who

690
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:08,240
see a remote subnet for example for the

691
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:11,868
CPE one you have a orange and

692
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,720
green subnets and you can create two

693
00:42:11,869 --> 00:42:18,290
separate IPSec tunnels one for the

694
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,939
orange one for the green and you could

695
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:26,210
also just create one tunnel like CP is 3

696
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:32,480
aggregating all the routes into into one

697
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:36,040
IPSec and in this example all the CPU 1

698
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,770
CP 2 and CP 3 are in their own

699
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,859
administrative domain and and also their

700
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:46,960
own route reflector and it is through

701
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:50,808
the wrong reflector that is to build the

702
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:54,109
IPSec tunnel information so that by

703
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:57,140
doing that we eliminate the need to go

704
00:42:54,109 --> 00:43:00,380
through the certificate process like in

705
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:03,170
the traditional IPSec 20 point you have

706
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,839
to basically configure them who's your

707
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,809
certificate and who's a remote and such

708
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,849
effect so when you receive a request you

709
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:13,670
can validate your certificate and then

710
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:16,720
be able to establish that so we assume

711
00:43:13,670 --> 00:43:20,359
in this in this sd1 case we have a

712
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,140
reflector at home and which has a policy

713
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:26,240
to to determine where this update is

714
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:29,328
forwarded to you couldn't have a network

715
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,990
consists of hundreds of nodes and its

716
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:36,790
route reflector basically sending it to

717
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:40,129
like CPU 1 and CP 3 another thing is

718
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:43,880
those routes attached to the CPEs

719
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:47,690
they are not routable in the underlay

720
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:51,220
when network and so it is very important

721
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:54,589
in a bgp update to include the next half

722
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:57,709
that with routable address so that

723
00:43:54,589 --> 00:44:00,558
remote end can establish actually

724
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:01,730
continue or can test whether this node

725
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:04,190
is reachable or not

726
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:09,710
so that's slightly different than our

727
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:12,380
traditional impairments VPN so that's

728
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:16,460
one example with aggregating all the

729
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:21,220
routes and so you only need to send one

730
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:21,220
BGP update to the reflector

731
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:30,980
so this example shows the fine grant

732
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:35,720
encryption meaning that for the three

733
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:38,270
different routes attached to CP 2 each

734
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,790
of them have their own IPSec tunnels

735
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:43,820
so with that you need to send three

736
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:47,810
different update so this shows that the

737
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:50,170
PGP apps like CP 2 was an update 1 with

738
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:54,110
the first route encoded in the and I

739
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:58,340
passed attribute and then IPSec property

740
00:44:54,110 --> 00:45:01,190
in the tunneling cap then there's an

741
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:04,820
update 2 and then that's updates 3 so

742
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:07,520
similarly you can allow the remote end

743
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,490
to aggregate all the routes or you can

744
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,090
do individually as seen the idea the

745
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:16,819
drive talks about remote local pairs

746
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:18,680
that configuration is very complicated

747
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:21,350
it works well when you just have two

748
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,680
nodes are talking to each other but when

749
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:29,029
you have multiple nodes they become a

750
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:31,100
really big mess so in this case we're

751
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:34,420
using PGP to update their own

752
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,620
information for example c p2 is the

753
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:39,800
authentication method whether it's a H

754
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:42,830
authentication or ESP authentication his

755
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:47,450
public key Rob reflector distributed to

756
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:52,630
the other cities which I in the scope to

757
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:55,189
be able to authorize to talk to the CPU

758
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:58,220
this is another example which has been

759
00:45:55,190 --> 00:46:01,550
discussed a lot in the math recently

760
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:05,810
they called application based

761
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:08,330
segmentation in s t1 so so for s t1 will

762
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:11,630
most people know that this SD one for

763
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:13,940
the traffic the past augmentation

764
00:46:11,630 --> 00:46:16,120
basically you can aggregate multiple

765
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:20,090
paths but there's two other

766
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:22,400
characteristics so and one of them is

767
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:26,030
based on forwarding based on application

768
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,730
ID instead of a destination so in this

769
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:32,930
example for the retail business for

770
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:35,690
example you could have red is the one

771
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:37,940
application for the payment system

772
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:39,740
so for payment system you can only talk

773
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:42,289
to the payment gateway you cannot

774
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:45,169
communicate with anybody else so that

775
00:46:42,289 --> 00:46:49,539
particular application only can go to

776
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:53,450
the payment gateway and for the purple

777
00:46:49,539 --> 00:46:59,770
applications and you can actually is any

778
00:46:53,450 --> 00:47:03,348
to any mash so the two cases assume that

779
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:07,089
this application actually have unique

780
00:47:03,349 --> 00:47:11,030
address then BGP can be used very nicely

781
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:15,190
we can send to update from CPE twos

782
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:18,410
perspective well update to show the red

783
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:21,530
apology like from CPE to the red

784
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:24,230
topology is only to payment gateway so

785
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:28,789
in the you have route attached to this

786
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:32,690
IP sacs are attached to this the route

787
00:47:28,789 --> 00:47:35,510
encoded in the past and now I pass

788
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:37,670
attribute and you have the tunnel to

789
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:41,329
describe that tunnel is only from

790
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:44,809
Gateway to you then for the purple one

791
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:46,369
you can have all the routes and then you

792
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:48,380
can indicate different tunnels with

793
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:52,160
different locations so that works pretty

794
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:54,680
well but there are some cases where like

795
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:58,098
the red application and the purple

796
00:47:54,680 --> 00:48:01,819
application actually coming from same IP

797
00:47:58,099 --> 00:48:04,099
address that can be problematic so that

798
00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:06,980
one actually I didn't address that in

799
00:48:04,099 --> 00:48:09,410
this document and if people know how to

800
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,869
do it and will come to this send it to

801
00:48:09,410 --> 00:48:17,960
mailing list give some suggestions on

802
00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:21,039
how to do it ok so this example shows

803
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,839
that just from CPE twos perspective

804
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:26,299
because IPSec tunnel is all point to

805
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,119
point so you need to establish all the

806
00:48:26,299 --> 00:48:31,700
pointer pointer nose so that's a lot of

807
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,069
configurations this is just one node and

808
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:36,439
then from all the cps

809
00:48:34,069 --> 00:48:41,509
any to each of them need to have this

810
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:42,920
basically stand and square problem this

811
00:48:41,510 --> 00:48:46,730
actually this scenario will been

812
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,530
discussed on the on the mailing list so

813
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:53,670
that it could be possible

814
00:48:49,530 --> 00:48:56,700
we may retreat IPSec as the transport

815
00:48:53,670 --> 00:49:00,120
tunnel meaning that connecting the nose

816
00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:05,040
together through the untrusted Network

817
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:08,549
and then the traffic can be routed

818
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:11,970
meaning that each of the CPE will

819
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:17,340
process the BGP update propagated by the

820
00:49:11,970 --> 00:49:20,129
route reflect reflector and based on the

821
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:22,530
BGP update it can build up the falling

822
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:24,950
table and then can route to the

823
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:27,900
destination so with this the number of

824
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:28,649
IPSec tunnels to be created and much

825
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,930
much less

826
00:49:28,650 --> 00:49:34,260
but then this introduced a new problem

827
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:39,330
which is the traffic engineering right

828
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:41,280
so for the path between CPU 1 to cp24

829
00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:44,580
you can have two different ways to reach

830
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:47,010
right so how do you engineer that so

831
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:49,590
that the past can be going through

832
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:54,780
deterministic method so that's one

833
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:57,840
things has to be considered that's it

834
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:02,010
this is just in addition to IT 105 we

835
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:05,790
describe the basics the sd1 how BGP use

836
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:09,030
it and this from well five to now we

837
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:12,150
added a more detailed packet walk

838
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:15,810
through the control signal what walks

839
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:19,140
through and so hopefully we can ask for

840
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:21,840
working group adoption and with the

841
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:25,589
working group adoption we can bring it

842
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:29,490
to other places like math or to show hey

843
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:31,320
IETF PGP actually is very good and you

844
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:34,229
don't have to bring Bend will do another

845
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,700
thing just use this to achieve what you

846
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:44,210
need that's it

847
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:44,210
any question who has read the document

848
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:52,970
ok few people maybe you have to

849
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:52,970
socialize a little bit your documents

850
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,770
request some feedback on the mailing

851
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,200
list

852
00:50:55,770 --> 00:51:00,060
ok I will do that and maybe I'll do one

853
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:02,490
by one I notice that if I send too much

854
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:07,200
information people ignore him

855
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:19,830
okay thank you very much I'm next

856
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:21,600
yeah okay guys so this draft is a kind

857
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:27,660
of follow-up of the discussion which

858
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:31,200
started in Montreal so there was a nish

859
00:51:27,660 --> 00:51:37,290
appointed on the mailing list it was a

860
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:42,379
thing back in June which was that

861
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:45,240
basically regarding the VPN unique sfe

862
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:48,570
so we have multiple RFC's dealing with

863
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:51,810
this so we have a 4364 dealing with a

864
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:56,190
VPN which form of ipv4 network we have

865
00:51:51,810 --> 00:52:00,090
the 46:59 which is dealing with VPN v6

866
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:03,630
over ipv4 or ipv6 network and we have

867
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:07,080
the 5549 which is dealing with VPN

868
00:52:03,630 --> 00:52:08,880
before over an ipv6 network and the

869
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:14,460
comment that was made on the mailing

870
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:17,400
list was that we 55:49 is bringing a

871
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:21,359
kind of inconsistency on how we are

872
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:25,380
including the next stop in via envy bgp

873
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:29,190
update so usually in the VPN service we

874
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:33,780
are encoding the next stop purely for

875
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:36,030
legacy reasons as a VPN IP address on it

876
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:38,640
has it doesn't have any value it doesn't

877
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:40,830
bring anything it's purely for legacy

878
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:44,580
purpose because at a certain point of

879
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:48,720
time it was required that the BGP next

880
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:51,359
stop to be from the same fsfe then we

881
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,529
then we preface again it's it's

882
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:54,270
completely useless

883
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:57,090
and it does not make sense but yeah

884
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:59,820
that's our only guess from a pure

885
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:02,010
standardization standpoint it works

886
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:05,700
there is no arm and it could work

887
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:10,020
because we have envy 5549 we have a

888
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:12,560
specific BGP capability which tells that

889
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:14,940
we are in a specific case so

890
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:16,130
specification from a pure specification

891
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:22,160
standpoint

892
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:26,030
it works however if we look at how the

893
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:28,970
industry is today so we have looked at

894
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:31,460
nine beach implementation that are

895
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:34,270
shipping now including all the major

896
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:39,020
vendors and what we have found is that

897
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:41,690
on this nine bgp codes we have seven of

898
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:44,750
them which are following a consistent

899
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:48,080
way of encoding the next step which

900
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:50,930
means that in the case of 5549 we are

901
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:53,779
including the next stop using a VPN IP

902
00:53:50,930 --> 00:53:59,299
address so we are consistent but not

903
00:53:53,780 --> 00:54:00,860
compliant with the 55:49 and we have two

904
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:03,350
codes that are not supporting the future

905
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:06,250
at all so no issue and we haven't found

906
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:12,560
yet any code which is compliant with

907
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:15,290
5549 so we have an issue from an

908
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,570
industry point of view the issue is not

909
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:19,990
an interoperability issue because maybe

910
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:23,420
by chance everyone is interoperable

911
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:26,209
because at least all the implementations

912
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:28,280
that we have seen are interoperable

913
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:31,580
because between each other because we

914
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:33,980
are using this VPN IP next up maybe by

915
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:36,560
chance but yeah it's working this way

916
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,080
the issue is now a kind of compliance

917
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:45,680
issue because all these implementations

918
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:50,529
are not compliant today to vrse so what

919
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:55,669
we would like to propose is to change

920
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:58,910
55:49 to accommodate the reality of the

921
00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:02,210
shipping code today and yeah the reality

922
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:04,549
of the deployments of course it's not a

923
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:08,630
trivial change to say that blindly we

924
00:55:04,550 --> 00:55:12,050
are moving to a regular IP address in

925
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,620
the next stop to to the VPN IP but yeah

926
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:20,900
this is mainly the spirit of ITF which

927
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:23,029
is mainly driven by running codes so we

928
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:27,150
really think that this is the way to do

929
00:55:23,030 --> 00:55:29,880
and the other point is of cool

930
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:32,460
we could get all this implementation to

931
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,280
move to compliance but what will be the

932
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:39,270
value of changing all the codes it will

933
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:41,730
be just pain for the customers it will

934
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:44,190
be pain for the vendors and also we will

935
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,960
possibly introduce bugs in with the

936
00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,570
implementations each time you have

937
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,360
touching your code possibly you will

938
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:54,960
introduce new bugs so it's purely a risk

939
00:55:51,360 --> 00:56:00,300
for customers without bringing any value

940
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:03,810
from an industry point of view backward

941
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:07,710
compatibility of course if we go to this

942
00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:09,930
straight change of changing the 55:49

943
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:15,180
there is no backward compatibility which

944
00:56:09,930 --> 00:56:18,089
means that if but it is unlikely vary

945
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:21,870
somewhere an implementation which is

946
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:23,970
compliant with 55:49 we will this

947
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:26,180
implementation will not be compliant

948
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:31,140
anymore and it will not be interoperable

949
00:56:26,180 --> 00:56:34,919
anymore but main question is do we are

950
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:39,089
we really creating any arm there are

951
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:43,020
three things first one is today there is

952
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:44,910
no possibility to mix an implementation

953
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:47,490
which is consistent with an

954
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,140
implementation which is compliant okay

955
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:56,100
because we don't have interoperability

956
00:56:49,140 --> 00:56:59,549
between between them so in case there is

957
00:56:56,100 --> 00:57:02,339
an existing deployment somewhere which

958
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:08,850
is using routers that are fully

959
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:10,830
compliant with 55:49 this deployment we

960
00:57:08,850 --> 00:57:14,400
will not really break anything because

961
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:18,090
it can keep living like this it will not

962
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,030
be compliant anymore but if the vendor

963
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:23,490
is not changing its implementation it's

964
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:26,190
not breaking any deployment of course if

965
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:29,220
we wants to get to come to the new

966
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:33,030
compliancy knob could be added of

967
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:35,819
something to enable future interrupt

968
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:38,190
with an additional vendor which is using

969
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:41,760
VAP next up

970
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:45,450
and for the existing real deployment

971
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:47,970
that we know that are using this VPN IP

972
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:51,990
address today there is no change at all

973
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:55,319
and this is really what we the spirit

974
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:59,430
that we want to are to share areas we

975
00:57:55,320 --> 00:58:04,200
want to have the less change in the code

976
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:05,580
widely in the industry as we can so it

977
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:08,689
seems that most of the implementation

978
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:12,660
today are using this VPN IP code

979
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:15,150
possibly yes there could be somewhere an

980
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:19,100
implementation which is fully compliant

981
00:58:15,150 --> 00:58:21,960
with 5549 but maybe it's just one or two

982
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,880
it may be easier to change this one

983
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:29,250
compared to the massive ones that are

984
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:32,700
already deployed today in addition to

985
00:58:29,250 --> 00:58:35,940
this in fact there is a very small thing

986
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:39,480
which is also missing in the 5549 is

987
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:42,300
that it does not address via safely 129

988
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:45,000
which is via VPN for multicast address

989
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:48,090
and we just also would like to add some

990
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,690
text that yeah see this a few ways will

991
00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:53,460
be exactly will use exactly the same

992
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:59,370
procedure as we do for front of ships

993
00:58:53,460 --> 00:59:02,790
and for so we really think that this is

994
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:05,279
a reasonable proposal because yeah first

995
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:07,950
that's really the spirit of ITF we show

996
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,330
them we are driven by running code so

997
00:59:07,950 --> 00:59:13,500
yeah it's a bit unusual here but we need

998
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:14,310
to accommodate the standard to the

999
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:18,960
reigning code

1000
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:21,360
of course if anyone has any feedback

1001
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:24,570
about existing implementations that are

1002
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:28,200
fully compliant with 5549 and deployed

1003
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:30,870
we will really be happy to hear about

1004
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,299
this because we need to focus not just

1005
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:35,910
on theory yes in theory this kind of

1006
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,550
implementation can exist that based on

1007
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:41,310
the feedback that we have it's really

1008
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:44,610
really unlikely so we need to focus on

1009
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:47,779
what is deployed compared to only early

1010
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:49,480
fury do you have a comment now Laura

1011
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:54,580
okay

1012
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:57,640
and what we want is really to create as

1013
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:59,950
less pain as we can especially for the

1014
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:06,279
customers and that are already using

1015
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:12,069
your so shipping code I have one last

1016
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:15,490
slide about the process 5549 is coming

1017
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:18,940
from software which is in via internet

1018
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:21,250
area so Evernote now in our domain but

1019
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:26,230
the VPN selphie are usually managed

1020
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:31,050
InBev in this so if of course the

1021
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:34,450
working group agree to go to a change of

1022
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:37,390
55:29 we would like to have this managed

1023
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:41,109
in best we have already engaged

1024
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:44,140
execution with martin and also with a

1025
01:00:41,109 --> 01:00:50,220
diesel from our own software on i think

1026
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:50,220
we have an almost an agreement on that

1027
01:00:54,330 --> 01:01:01,750
yeah and again in case we agree to

1028
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:05,200
continue with this kind of work what do

1029
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:07,600
we and if we agree to we spin on 5549

1030
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:10,839
what do we do with this document do we

1031
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,359
just forget it and we spin 55:49 oh do

1032
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:16,359
we keep it and progress it at the same

1033
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:19,210
times i've the new 55:49 just for estoy

1034
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:24,220
purpose yeah that's it

1035
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:27,280
no what okay so first I kind of agree

1036
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:30,520
with most of what you said I think it's

1037
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,280
a reasonable plan we probably should go

1038
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:38,020
ahead and do it the tricky issue is if

1039
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:41,040
there is a compliant implementation out

1040
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:44,109
there somewhere that we don't know of

1041
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:46,960
what situation do we actually put that

1042
01:01:44,109 --> 01:01:51,069
vendor in if we change the standard are

1043
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:55,050
underneath them so that say I would

1044
01:01:51,070 --> 01:01:58,540
actually seek some lawyer or whatever

1045
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:00,310
input on this or discuss it within the

1046
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:00,940
ITF leadership or something like that

1047
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:03,020
hmm

1048
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:05,150
we've been reluctant to do this

1049
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:09,170
thing before and I think we are done it

1050
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:12,890
once on the impeller side okay

1051
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:17,360
pituitary I can and also we need to be

1052
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:19,850
fairly sure that we done kind of all we

1053
01:02:17,360 --> 01:02:21,830
can to actually identify if there is

1054
01:02:19,850 --> 01:02:24,200
such and compliant implementation out

1055
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:25,279
there you know a little bit more work

1056
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:33,740
okay

1057
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:38,390
thank you for the feedback so far we I

1058
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:42,850
think is reasonable we sure at all he's

1059
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:42,850
a talker Lisa Walker okay thank you

1060
01:02:44,110 --> 01:02:55,940
master has ad thank you for that work I

1061
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:58,450
think it was needed I won't speak in the

1062
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:00,470
name of rank but we are fine with that

1063
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:05,710
progressing in best if they're working

1064
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:12,290
of decides to pursue that topic Laura

1065
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:14,810
I'm not aware of any habits of involving

1066
01:03:12,290 --> 01:03:17,240
lawyers in our decision process so I'm

1067
01:03:14,810 --> 01:03:21,109
not sure we can do that I'm willing to

1068
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:23,720
bring that to the iesg but involving

1069
01:03:21,109 --> 01:03:26,390
lawyers I'm not sure and and I have one

1070
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:30,250
question what form would would that take

1071
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:37,430
maybe I missed it is that abby's is the

1072
01:03:30,250 --> 01:03:39,590
55:49 visa so we can clearly other jobs

1073
01:03:37,430 --> 01:03:42,169
about eighteen fifty five forty nine

1074
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:46,160
when we do this we happen to change the

1075
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:52,730
technical content no so we wouldn't be

1076
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:55,009
doing something beneath anyone well if I

1077
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:57,530
have a compliant implementation and you

1078
01:03:55,010 --> 01:04:01,760
change the standard you actually changed

1079
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:04,940
my market situation quite a bit hope we

1080
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:06,980
agree there I'm not saying that it is

1081
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:09,020
the case but I say there is a potential

1082
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:11,869
case and that we should actually look

1083
01:04:09,020 --> 01:04:16,549
for and make sure that there is no

1084
01:04:11,869 --> 01:04:20,779
compliant implementation

1085
01:04:16,549 --> 01:04:23,269
hanging around somewhere hmm I don't

1086
01:04:20,779 --> 01:04:25,130
know about lawyers I just kinda I would

1087
01:04:23,269 --> 01:04:25,968
seek advice from the people that could

1088
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:31,759
advise me

1089
01:04:25,969 --> 01:04:34,579
that's nothing I'm saying and I think

1090
01:04:31,759 --> 01:04:39,499
you will actually release a new RFC with

1091
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:47,359
newer RC number so I think that's pretty

1092
01:04:39,499 --> 01:04:49,640
sure way of doing it also John John

1093
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,939
Scudder yeah thanks for the careful

1094
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:59,779
analysis it's pretty convincing I think

1095
01:04:52,939 --> 01:05:01,640
you should do it actually I mean I a few

1096
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:03,589
few weeks ago when when I first heard

1097
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:06,618
about this thing I was sort of like more

1098
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:10,069
in the position that I guess Lola finds

1099
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:11,329
himself in at this point I I find myself

1100
01:05:10,069 --> 01:05:13,910
convinced that you've already been

1101
01:05:11,329 --> 01:05:16,339
diligent enough and and as both Laura

1102
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:18,558
and Martin said you change the RFC

1103
01:05:16,339 --> 01:05:20,749
number you know old implementations are

1104
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:23,299
still compliant with 5549 new

1105
01:05:20,749 --> 01:05:29,928
implementations are an employment of

1106
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:32,859
55:14 anyways not be brick broken Marcus

1107
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:35,900
speaking as a coder and working group

1108
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:39,319
member I think this is a good work we

1109
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:41,719
should do it ASAP if you're too paranoid

1110
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:43,400
about any compliant implementations out

1111
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:45,529
here we could probably use the same

1112
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:48,049
office aathi and use new capability and

1113
01:05:45,529 --> 01:05:52,969
get done with it like how we did RFC

1114
01:05:48,049 --> 01:05:57,439
3107 we spent mm-hmm a conf Cisco I

1115
01:05:52,969 --> 01:05:59,709
think the fact that anybody that's

1116
01:05:57,439 --> 01:06:02,178
interrupting today would be broken and

1117
01:05:59,709 --> 01:06:04,339
the fact that we're doing it through a

1118
01:06:02,179 --> 01:06:07,009
biz document which will take a minimum

1119
01:06:04,339 --> 01:06:12,380
of a year that should be enough time for

1120
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:15,499
any nascent or implementations to be

1121
01:06:12,380 --> 01:06:18,140
discovered I don't I think this is much

1122
01:06:15,499 --> 01:06:21,439
to do about nothing the fact that we

1123
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:23,239
haven't found one just in you know the

1124
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:26,749
the survey that you you took off the

1125
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:29,150
time to do so I think I think this is I

1126
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:30,109
think this is kind of ridiculous you can

1127
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:34,089
change we

1128
01:06:30,109 --> 01:06:36,950
can change the standard anytime we want

1129
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:40,519
there's no you know as long as though as

1130
01:06:36,950 --> 01:06:42,529
long as we get consensus across the IETF

1131
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:46,220
yeah thank you

1132
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:48,529
I agree I'm here as the internet ad

1133
01:06:46,220 --> 01:06:50,359
responsible for software just for

1134
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:52,489
information software would be closed on

1135
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:57,410
this Friday so the job needs to be done

1136
01:06:52,489 --> 01:07:00,410
somewhere else okay John's got her one

1137
01:06:57,410 --> 01:07:02,180
thing I forgot to say before is actually

1138
01:07:00,410 --> 01:07:04,598
in terms of diligence and sort of

1139
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:07,460
hypothetical other implementations

1140
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:12,650
probably the most important thing is to

1141
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:15,910
get a new version out at least in you

1142
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:20,329
know some rough draft form that you know

1143
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:21,920
updates 5549 so that somebody i wonder

1144
01:07:20,329 --> 01:07:24,470
actually if you can even use an errata

1145
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:26,210
to indicate this basically what you

1146
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:27,980
don't what would be most embarrassing

1147
01:07:26,210 --> 01:07:32,989
right now is for someone to come along

1148
01:07:27,980 --> 01:07:35,089
find 5549 and implement it newly not

1149
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:40,359
very likely but it would be quite

1150
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:40,359
embarrassing hmm thank you

1151
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:50,509
okay because that would be us so sooner

1152

1153
01:07:50,509 --> 01:07:55,130
sounds like we we need to do need to

1154
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:56,419
move forward as I say Peter to prevent

1155
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,859
any problem as much as anything to

1156
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,190
prevent anybody else implementing

1157
01:07:57,859 --> 01:08:05,420
anything in the meantime that it's

1158
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:08,089
compliant but not consistent okay thank

1159
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:11,989
