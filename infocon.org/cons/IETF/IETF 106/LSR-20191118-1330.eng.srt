[Music]

8
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:28,630
- Mentos well we have to wait for those

9
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:28,630
we're gonna know

10
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:57,560
[Music]

11
00:03:39,890 --> 00:04:03,440
I wonder if you you have to clear the

12
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:29,120
cache or something I don't know I don't

13
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:31,190
know I did a refresh it's not a are we

14
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:40,640
had an upload of a new thing and it's

15
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:41,690
not refreshing this different way I can

16
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:47,409
get to the meat

17
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:47,410
[Music]

18
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:23,639
well at least we have some actually work

19
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,638
better

20
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:49,899
okay so this is the Ellis our working

21
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:52,799
group did you include a note well on

22
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:52,800
this I did not

23
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,970
[Music]

24
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,829
[Music]

25
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:31,890
do you know where to find it no I mean I

26
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:35,070
I usually do not well yeah I'm not well

27
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:35,070
there we are

28
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:50,320
alright so here we go they're required

29
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:53,500
well that puts on a slide still yeah so

30
00:06:50,320 --> 00:07:09,159
read all of this I think there's a short

31
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:15,970
version we could sing along okay as

32
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:19,270
everyone noted well just keep in mind

33
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:20,920
that if you know of any IPR that applies

34
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,859
to any of these drafts even if you're

35
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:28,150
not the offer or a contributor if you're

36
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,680
obliged by participating in the meeting

37
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:31,679
to let it be known

38
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:58,780
yeah I'll be good okay you're good okay

39
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:03,020
and I'll be able to do it yeah okay okay

40
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:06,349
welcome to Singapore everybody I'm gonna

41
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:11,210
go through the status here we don't have

42
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:13,430
any RFC's since Montreal but we have a

43
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,080
lot we have a lot of stuff there's the

44
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,720
Sigma grouting drafts are coming all is

45
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,150
part of a cluster so a lot of these are

46
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,940
already done are almost done the top two

47
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,520
are already approved in the bottom one

48
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:32,690
it is is is almost approved as well it's

49
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:34,189
in sewing off 48 state now these are

50
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:37,250
ones these are grafts that are on the

51
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:41,090
RFC queues with miss references the

52
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,990
tunnel end cap graph I mean the OSPF

53
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:48,080
tunnel aincrad graft it shares in I Anna

54
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:51,020
registry with the IDR tunnel red end cap

55
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,950
draft and that draft is finally moving

56
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:59,780
along and it's gotten through the

57
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:01,100
working group and it's and the chair the

58
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:05,270
Shepherd in the chairs I guess it's

59
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:09,800
waiting with Alvaro we got both two yang

60
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:13,610
models OSPF and is is are waiting on the

61
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:17,109
Miss reference to be a fee which is

62
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:23,450
waiting on the misstep referenced a ETF

63
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:29,600
MPLS now here we go we're almost done

64
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:33,920
with all these the bottom one is already

65
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,850
an IH bit is in the is iesg review

66
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,410
that's coming up on the 12:5 and OSPF

67
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:44,620
routing with cross address cross address

68
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,230
families traffic engineering tunnels

69
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:50,350
that is it's already an off 48 isn't it

70
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,120
yes so that's almost done as well and

71
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:55,040
then the other two are just waiting on

72
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,290
the RFC queue for

73
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,259
the RFC editors to get to it I'm sure

74
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:04,279
they will soon after this large cluster

75
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:09,680
of segments routing drafts these two

76
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:11,769
drafts the two multi-attribute OSPF and

77
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,138
is is encoding the two graphs for

78
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:24,970
handling application specific attributes

79
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:24,970
those are both in ad review and we have

80
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:32,380
publication I think we yeah we broke I

81
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:36,860
just requested publication on these so

82
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:39,310
we had one problem here that'd be when

83
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:45,220
we simplified these drafts and went to

84
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:48,709
prefix level entropy level

85
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:52,339
capability encoding we negated the need

86
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:53,989
for the bgp LS because we just used the

87
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:57,980
existing encodings from a different

88
00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:02,029
draft so we sort of consolidated the bgp

89
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:05,990
LS in both of those and that's a good

90
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:09,410
thing saves work for the for all of us

91
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:11,839
by having it the bgp LS included in ihe

92
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:14,319
p drafts and we're gonna try it if it's

93
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,209
simple you know it's a straightforward

94
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:19,550
change we're gonna do that with future

95
00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:25,489
LS our drafts as well include the bgp LS

96
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:28,279
in the draft and this is pretty much

97
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,420
both these are pretty much ready for a

98
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:33,579
working group last call

99
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:36,500
I think the invalid TLB handling I guess

100
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:39,229
there was one comment on the prefix

101
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:43,399
originator we got since I put the status

102
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:45,500
together that we need to handle and I

103
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,319
mean we're gonna I'm an offer on this

104
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:50,630
one as well and we'll talk about that

105
00:11:48,319 --> 00:11:53,389
offline get get it in and have the

106
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:56,149
working group review it and then go into

107
00:11:53,389 --> 00:11:58,579
last call the invalid TLB handling in is

108
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,949
is this is pretty much something that

109
00:11:58,579 --> 00:12:02,870
people had discussed between vendors and

110
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,339
it was needed for a long time

111
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,769
thanks to les for putting it together

112
00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:08,480
this should probably even though it was

113
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:10,519
it's only been a working group dog

114
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,649
come in for one ietf I think this should

115
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,680
go to a working group last call ASAP now

116
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:20,389
that we've got a good review from a

117
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:23,089
number of vendors and here flexible

118
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:25,060
algorithms we covered today all these

119
00:12:23,089 --> 00:12:32,899
yang models are going to be is covered

120
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:40,099
covered on Friday and update on the SRP

121
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:44,440
six is AI extensions today dynamic

122
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:47,870
flooding is covered today hierarchy

123
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:51,410
let's see Friday we're gonna have yang

124
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:56,720
model updates and then we have these two

125
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:58,699
I don't I know that they recently

126
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:02,930
covered I believe it was less less his

127
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:08,839
comments on IGP extensions for PC EP

128
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:14,719
security capability discovery using HP's

129
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:16,760
and the last one has been pretty quiet

130
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,399
I'm gonna have to check to see what

131
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:24,250
offers to see what their intention is

132
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:28,339
and if anybody's gonna implement it and

133
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:32,389
here's a number of non-working group

134
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:35,470
documents that the authors have asked in

135
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:39,380
various and sundry matters to have

136
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:41,360
adoption calls on you probably saw those

137
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:44,329
of you phone lists that we did start

138
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:47,930
some discussions on the third one SRV

139
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:50,510
six enhancements to SPF they correspond

140
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,550
you can map them directly to the is is

141
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,560
ones that it's already a working group

142
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,209
document but the rest of these we're

143
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,260
gonna kind of take them and what I'd

144
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:03,829
like people to do is the offers to

145
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:06,769
initiate just send the request to the

146
00:14:03,829 --> 00:14:08,569
list Chris and I discussed these we

147
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,730
think this is the best way for it send

148
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:14,870
the request for an adoption call to the

149
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:16,610
list and then we'll take a look at it

150
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,920
and do them in that order one thing we

151
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:22,160
don't get enough of is we don't get

152
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,699
enough discussion on the list you know

153
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,699
it seems like

154
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:28,640
one week after the ietf and the two

155
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:30,530
weeks leading up to the next IETF is

156
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,670
when we get you know 90% of the scut

157
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:37,250
discussion so it'd be good to get more

158
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:54,189
discussion on these drafts and do it on

159
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:54,190
LSR list that's it anything dad Alvaro

160
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,500
okay from your most productive working

161
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,870
group from like most productive working

162
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,590
I'll order that around eighty I just

163
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,540
want to ask the work who for a favor

164
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:13,910
many of these especially this slide is

165
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,260
about like ISS Perry so it'll raise it

166
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,990
in one protocol I'm gonna do it in the

167
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,110
other profile that's great I'm really

168
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:26,870
happy about that

169
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:28,040
if the functionality is different so

170
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:32,500
you're doing I don't know just to pick

171
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,420
on the first one reversed metric for SPF

172
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,310
because we'll reassess functionality is

173
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:40,160
different please highlight it somewhere

174
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:42,229
send an email to the list and and say

175
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,020
that so that when I review the draft I

176
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,430
don't have to ask you later why is this

177
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,620
different or why didn't you cover that

178
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:51,739
other functionality we're trying to do

179
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:53,300
parity you know it's nice that maybe the

180
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,490
same for Charlotte is there maybe it's

181
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,680
not possible maybe it's not needed

182
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,730
whatever please please do that and and

183
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,979
to everyone in the working group please

184
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,720
read everything all the documents just

185
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,890
because we're doing parity doesn't mean

186
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,120
that it's the same thing doesn't mean

187
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:07,520
that if you read the other document that

188
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:24,350
one that we do it now is the same or

189
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:26,600
better thank you okay so we were busy

190
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:29,630
with the laptops and stuff didn't give

191
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,740
anyone a chance to bash the agenda so

192
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,189
I'm gonna put that up on the screen for

193
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,190
a minute

194
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:49,620
or not okay so I were basically split

195
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,350
into two sessions we we organized it was

196
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:55,050
we left a little time in each day

197
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:56,340
because lately we've you know had a few

198
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:57,930
different contentious things we thought

199
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,840
we were done with that but which appear

200
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:05,970
to be back in that area with different

201
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:08,910
area abstraction TCB so we've got some

202
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,920
padding in this in this session and then

203
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,709
Friday we consolidated all the yang

204
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:20,190
models together and a few other

205
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:22,490
presentations if we have time we could

206
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:25,350
consider moving some of the Nanyang

207
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:32,160
presentations if people if the people

208
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:34,740
are here and ready if anybody has an

209
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,530
objection to that you know please speak

210
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:40,560
up you can do it at the time we try to

211
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:42,389
move it to other than that I don't I

212
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:50,429
don't have any other does anybody have

213
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:53,420
any agenda bashing well to do okay well

214
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:53,420
then Tony

215
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,060
[Music]

216
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,369
[Music]

217
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:26,050
however they get back to me that you

218
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:30,879
there was a different screen that

219
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:33,930
actually had good afternoon so update on

220
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:41,410
dynamic flooding next slide please

221
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:47,950
the clicker go here all right no changes

222
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:49,180
since last IETF part that I did want to

223
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,730
talk about is something of an

224
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,800
implementation report the Arista

225
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,880
networks implementation is now complete

226
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:02,350
this is shipped shipping gonna ship real

227
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:05,370
real soon now 4.20 3.1 F it was supposed

228
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,230
to ship November 8th we're slipping oops

229
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:11,620
all of our testing is complete all of

230
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:14,430
our bugs are known bugs are fixed we

231
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:21,879
have simulated up to 5,000 nodes and

232
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:24,580
it's tedious and it works quick static

233
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,940
demo for you this is a cut and paste off

234
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:30,520
of a working implementation basically we

235
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:34,030
have a CLI command that shows you all of

236
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:38,620
the nodes in the network and their index

237
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:40,300
assignment and then it shows you the

238
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,899
paths that the area leader has

239
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:46,149
distributed in debugging this is very

240
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:48,130
very tedious to work with so we added

241
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:50,440
another command that translates it and

242
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:54,700
host names for you so you can see all

243
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,670
the paths in the topology and that's

244
00:19:54,700 --> 00:20:04,780
about it it just works

245
00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:08,820
any questions okay and you can see all

246
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:08,820
the stuff in the link state database -

247
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,629
alright

248
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:14,710
turning now to hierarchical I have a

249
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:16,690
question yes sir

250
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:18,690
have you found anybody to do interrupt

251
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:24,320
testing with

252
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:28,649
I have no interrupts testing yet Chloe

253
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,249
is a seal and Emma Ellis our chair but

254
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:35,488
you are doing your implementation is the

255
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:39,599
centralized model right correct so you

256
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:41,700
have a proprietary algorithm so be hard

257
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,489
to do Interop testing with somebody else

258
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:46,649
not at all remember that the sense that

259
00:20:44,489 --> 00:20:49,349
the algorithm is only implemented by the

260
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:51,899
area leader and all the other to me all

261
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:53,668
of the other routers just follow so if

262
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:55,918
someone else has implemented even the

263
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,960
following portion we could interoperate

264
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:03,090
if they've also implemented the leader

265
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,590
we could just follow so so I was very

266
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:10,789
hopeful but I have not heard from anyone

267
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,789
yet all right call me maybe

268
00:21:12,149 --> 00:21:19,349
turning now to hierarchical is is

269
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:22,799
changes since last IETF we last time we

270
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:23,999
adopted so thank you very much and we

271
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,619
have changed the name of the draft

272
00:21:23,999 --> 00:21:31,769
accordingly we've added a few little

273
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:36,869
things nothing too major we changed the

274
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:38,940
area identifier TLV we wanted to be sure

275
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:42,470
to allow people to specify multiple

276
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:45,419
identifiers for a particular area and

277
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:47,190
this is important because sometimes you

278
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,080
need multiple identifiers if you are

279
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,690
like changing your area assignments

280
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,439
around and such so you want to be able

281
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:59,609
to enumerate multiple synonymous area

282
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:02,909
identifiers and we also changed it so

283
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:06,109
that we described the entire set of

284
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:10,200
areas that a particular router is is

285
00:22:06,109 --> 00:22:15,178
implementing in a single TLV so this

286
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:17,479
compresses TLV space just a bit we

287
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:20,940
clarified the adjacency formation rules

288
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:23,340
this was just trying to make things that

289
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,309
we all thought were motherhood and apple

290
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:30,689
pie very explicit known significant

291
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:32,190
changes there we observed that for land

292
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,399
PDUs we act

293
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:37,440
we need more MAC addresses and so we

294
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:41,428
added an eye on a request for more MAC

295
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,039
addresses we and that is all of the

296
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:47,549
changes for hierarchical is is any

297
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:47,820
comments or questions sure I've got yes

298
00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:50,340
sir

299
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:56,309
so when I when I sort of thought about

300
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:59,370
this I figured you would do one net as

301
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:01,769
it were and then like a you know longest

302
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,199
prefix match right so in other words

303
00:23:01,769 --> 00:23:07,799
that you divide the area you would

304
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:11,250
determine the levels area by each level

305
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:13,168
would have a shorter number of bits you

306
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:16,139
were one of the old timers who believes

307
00:23:13,169 --> 00:23:19,470
in hierarchical SNMP a allocation yeah

308
00:23:16,139 --> 00:23:22,379
or in cept by location and I came from

309
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,259
that school too however as of the last

310
00:23:22,379 --> 00:23:29,070
IETF we took a poll of the working group

311
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:30,710
and we came to the conclusion that we

312
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:34,889
are now in the minority

313
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:36,450
that's that's unfortunate well I mean

314
00:23:34,889 --> 00:23:38,189
the main reason I thought that it was

315
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:40,169
more natural was for just for debugging

316
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:42,029
right I mean it when you when you're

317
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:45,629
trying to operate this in a network and

318
00:23:42,029 --> 00:23:48,210
you just have you know I mean a tag for

319
00:23:45,629 --> 00:23:51,330
every level and then how do you know

320
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:53,519
what's related to what well that's why

321
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:56,639
we made it very very clear we now have a

322
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:59,070
tag for level and we have to be very

323
00:23:56,639 --> 00:24:03,299
careful about saying what the identifier

324
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:05,879
means at each level yes the hierarchy is

325
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:08,039
more explicit if you do it via n PSAPs

326
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:12,029
but again people don't want to do

327
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:14,940
hierarchical n SAP allocation so could I

328
00:24:12,029 --> 00:24:18,870
throw a comment in as well he's less

329
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,899
Ginsburg I don't know any deployment

330
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:27,418
that I've ever seen where people define

331
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:29,418
their nets in that manner and in fact I

332
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:32,279
you know I there are some well-known

333
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:35,429
mechanisms of assigning Nets that don't

334
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:37,200
follow hierarchy there's but there's no

335
00:24:35,429 --> 00:24:39,990
hierarchy in them at all right now right

336
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,809
there isn't they never system IDs and

337
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,180
the rest of it is an area level one area

338
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:47,190
and if your level two there is no area

339
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:49,620
right that's not strictly true there was

340
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,570
supposed to be hierarchy in the enzyme

341
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,229
allocation it just never ever got

342
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:58,790
deployed if you know 1p no longer really

343
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:02,040
matters so I mean I

344
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:04,860
this is reminiscing a bit but I mean I

345
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:08,210
first got involved with ISS and in the

346
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:11,699
OSI space and when I read the addressing

347
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:14,460
document I've forgotten the the ISO

348
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:16,920
number at the moment but it it hurt my

349
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:19,590
head so I don't blame people for not

350
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,270
heading in that direction well I mean I

351
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:24,270
guess I kind of assumed that we wouldn't

352
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:27,050
actually need to adhere necessarily to

353
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,850
like the ends apt allocations that were

354
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:31,770
created way back when but there's there

355
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:35,129
was be nothing wrong with actually using

356
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:36,360
the hierarchy of the bits right some

357
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:39,840
things hung together a little bit

358
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,510
cleaner you know I I'm I'm supporting

359
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,449
what Tony is saying I just because there

360
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:47,790
was something that we did discuss and I

361
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:49,410
just didn't think that based on

362
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:51,870
practical experience that from a

363
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:57,600
deployment standpoint that that would

364
00:25:51,870 --> 00:26:03,360
appeal to customers again we took a poll

365
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:05,429
in Montreal and in saps lost so Tony yes

366
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,219
I mean from someone who has never

367
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,560
implemented is ice from scratch the

368
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,470
reason you're debugging using mac

369
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,120
address is which seems kind of expensive

370
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,300
is because level and one and level to do

371
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:21,889
units you're just following the same

372
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:24,750
mechanism for D maxing yes exactly I

373
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:27,000
don't know how I missed that poll but

374
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:30,120
did we get a feel for how many people

375
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,960
hold where operators that said they

376
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:36,419
wanted that I don't recall us getting

377
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:39,000
into details in Montreal okay

378
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:41,700
there were a handful of hands for doing

379
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,040
explicit areas and like two hands for

380
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:50,010
doing n saps and I think it was you and

381
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:52,680
me so sorry AC was your question related

382
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:57,150
to the new Mac addresses for the for the

383
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,770
land videos yes yes okay so I think you

384
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,530
could just use the the packet

385
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:05,790
to do it but so I think the other reason

386
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:09,080
for that is for legacy routers they're

387
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:11,610
going to receive you use the existing

388
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:13,020
multicast MAC addresses they're going to

389
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:14,129
receive these PDS and they're going to

390
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,470
look at them and who knows what they're

391
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:18,480
going to do this was the same thing that

392
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,880
happened when we did the multi instance

393
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,580
draft we had that discussion we

394
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,620
eventually decided to use a separate Mac

395
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:37,139
multicast address so we followed the

396
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:37,949
same thing here any other comments very

397
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,460
good thank you

398
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:48,150
moving on next talk is about area

399
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:51,300
abstraction now renamed to area proxy so

400
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:53,280
we've had several changes the first and

401
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:57,659
most significant we've had a layer eight

402
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:59,639
interrupts non-maskable unreturnable not

403
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:03,810
discussable we're not allowed to

404
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:07,470
collaborate sorry about that it's not my

405
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:10,260
choice but it is what it is

406
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:12,930
we've made further simplifications to

407
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,790
the draft you may recall that one of the

408
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:17,190
things we were doing was we doing a heck

409
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:20,670
of a lot of tunneling we were tunneling

410
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:23,180
all of the the transit traffic we were

411
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:27,360
tying tunneling LSPs to get around

412
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:31,410
having layer two holes in on the inside

413
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,510
area we decided that that was just way

414
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:36,090
messy and it would be much simpler and

415
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,720
more straightforward if we simply said

416
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:43,820
all of the inside area routers ran l1 l2

417
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:47,070
and all of the tunneling needs go away

418
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,370
so this simplifies everything now the

419
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:53,879
entire area collapses to one layer two

420
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:57,600
node 1 level 2 node and everything

421
00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,870
becomes very straightforward we did add

422
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,699
a router capability for area proxy this

423
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,709
turns out to be very useful to ensure

424
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,060
that everybody inside the area is

425
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:11,610
synchronized we then advertise the area

426
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,990
proxy system ID to indicate that the

427
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,850
area

428
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:17,210
proxy function should be active within

429
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:20,270
the area we did a bunch of work to

430
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:22,420
expand the details of the text and we

431
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:26,870
are still seeking working group adoption

432
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:34,960
so and that's all the changes any

433
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:34,959
comments or questions alyssaginsburg I

434
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:44,960
so I have one comment I guess and one

435
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:47,379
question I find this and I say this with

436
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:50,780
all due respect I find this to be

437
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:52,520
someone hacky solution in terms of the

438
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:56,000
protocol it's it doesn't seem to me to

439
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,450
be very clean it I find it as

440
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,160
conceptually you're trying to run

441
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:05,240
another instance of the protocol inside

442
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:10,160
an existing instance in a way and it it

443
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:14,780
it depends upon defining this this proxy

444
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:17,090
system ID and making it consistent so

445
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,850
I'm not very comfortable with the draft

446
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,209
as is I'd like to see us have more

447
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:26,360
discussion about whether this is a good

448
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:28,520
solution to the problem space before we

449
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,870
just ask the question about working

450
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:36,860
group adoption that said I have one

451
00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:38,209
mechanical question which is are you I

452
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,449
don't believe you said anything in the

453
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:45,080
draft about consistency in other words

454
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,790
you you could have you've got a set of

455
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,360
l1 l2 notes that are going to

456
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:54,530
participate in this proxy area and they

457
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:58,550
all have to agree upon the the proxy ID

458
00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:02,360
for the area you didn't say anything

459
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:05,570
about how each of the notes decides what

460
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:08,270
they're going to propose as the proxy ID

461
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:10,520
and so I'm wondering what happens when

462
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:15,290
the area leader goes down does

463
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:17,750
everything flap so when the area leader

464
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:21,020
goes down presumably we have multiple

465
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:23,059
area leaders enabled and the multiple

466
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,280
area leaders should all be configured

467
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:27,500
with the same proxy system

468
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,320
my D anything else is a miss

469
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:33,350
configuration in our implementation it

470
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,419
already calls this out okay I I could be

471
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,959
wrong but I don't think that is pointed

472
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:40,730
out in the draft that you act that

473
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,340
everybody has to in order for this to

474
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:47,000
work without flapping that everybody has

475
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:48,740
to pick the same proxy ID I would if it

476
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,550
is missing I would be more than happy to

477
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,190
add that okay

478
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:53,840
please send mail yeah by the way I

479
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:57,140
appreciate you calling it a hack that's

480
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:59,780
fine the question only question in my

481
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:04,580
mind is is it the right hack yeah there

482
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,170
that's very so yeah we've got a couple

483
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:09,679
things but I just had some comments on

484
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:12,770
this in particular I'm still trying to

485
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:15,620
understand why we're not just using bgp

486
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:19,340
between is is instances in the data

487
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:21,709
center like i mean i think that that's

488
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:27,889
just a more sane way to do this right

489
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:29,540
okay well mmm so the reason we didn't go

490
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:33,200
down that path is that we didn't want

491
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:37,730
bgp involved this is supposed to be a

492
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,740
simple being based in network and not

493
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,130
trying to get autonomous systems

494
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:45,890
involved in this we just are trying to

495
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:51,550
make the IGP more scalable that is the

496
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:55,070
entire goal here so in that light you

497
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:57,350
why not run to iose I see instances with

498
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,780
redistribution so in other words what I

499
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:01,699
mean by that is instead of using bgp use

500
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:04,730
a second i sized instance to reduce

501
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:08,690
derby between data set or eyesight's

502
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:10,880
instances you very much could again you

503
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,500
get into some danger with mutual

504
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:19,630
redistribution there there are some

505
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:19,630
concerns with many people had about that

506
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,820
well I mean yeah I can see that but I

507
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,560
mean if I like thinking about it as an

508
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,110
operator I've got to get my policies

509
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:32,840
right so that I don't blow things up or

510
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:35,750
I have to try to debug this new protocol

511
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:37,129
thing which makes it kind of hard if

512
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:39,320
there are problems right there there's

513
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:41,630
and it's trying to make it easy

514
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:46,909
because configuration wise this is

515
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:49,280
actually easier than multi-instance okay

516
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:53,990
well those are my thoughts okay

517
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:57,170
appreciate it so we have it we have sort

518
00:33:53,990 --> 00:34:03,110
of this very similar work well let any

519
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:09,530
other questions on this all right thank

520
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:13,839
you okay so you want to wait on the one

521
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:13,840
we want to present first okay

522
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,599
[Music]

523
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:48,930
you need to record that will pop up in

524
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:49,230
the second tab any one thing there you

525
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:52,409
go

526
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:53,219
okay yeah hello everyone I'm Martin from

527
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:56,270
future

528
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:59,100
so today I'm going to talk about a tpz

529
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:02,580
which is sort of for a college joined

530
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:05,370
parent zone you can see that you have a

531
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,000
cool for Eagle group of people working

532
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:14,130
on this DDT for quite a few years I

533
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:21,920
think maybe we can see that 80 years so

534
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:25,830
we work on tdz starting from 2011 so TDC

535
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,040
basically we focus on a tune zone is a

536
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:32,759
blocker for area so in special case is a

537
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:40,290
entire area so in the beginning we

538
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:44,250
proposed solutions to virtualize zoom to

539
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:46,410
as a single pursuit of note so you can

540
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:52,440
see that in this picture there's only

541
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:55,580
just the any block of area so this area

542
00:35:52,440 --> 00:36:02,490
is AB just abstracted into a single note

543
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:05,970
so during the process of this ietf with

544
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:09,899
we can see from 2011 until now eight

545
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:12,919
years has gone so we proposed different

546
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,950
solutions so one solution is we abstract

547
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:22,560
tune into a single note we also proposed

548
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:27,210
a solution to abstract a zoom into is

549
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:31,380
ages fully connection so for these two

550
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:34,580
solutions we also proposed solutions to

551
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:38,730
make a smooth transition or migration

552
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:42,920
from zoom to a single node and also from

553
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:47,809
a zoom to it's ages for the connection

554
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:52,530
so during this process and we

555
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:55,619
have RFC RFC 2009

556
00:36:52,530 --> 00:37:01,040
so that's only contain a small pass

557
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:05,700
which is the solution for abstracting a

558
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:08,849
zoom into the ages for the connection

559
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,990
and also smooth transitions between a

560
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:15,390
June and is the food connections so for

561
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:19,979
this in the green in the green hat is

562
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:24,259
what we standardized in us OSPF we can

563
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:28,859
see that this is the only small piece of

564
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:32,250
cake for the whole PDT you walk so we

565
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:40,589
take us seven years from start 2011

566
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:42,599
through 2017 so we achieve RFC 2009 but

567
00:37:40,589 --> 00:37:45,630
we have a big chunk of cake

568
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:50,970
so do there it's right on there but it's

569
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:53,280
eight zero nine nine yeah and then we

570
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:57,450
have a Gaza a piece of works for example

571
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:02,280
our solutions which is we abstract a

572
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:08,058
zoom into a single node in OSPF and the

573
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:11,309
USS and also we the solution for smooth

574
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:16,849
smooth decoration from a zoom to a

575
00:38:11,309 --> 00:38:20,160
single node in ISS OCF and also smooth

576
00:38:16,849 --> 00:38:23,369
transitions from resume to its age it's

577
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,730
for the convention in in ISS so that's

578
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:36,780
it in the blue part those part is in the

579
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:40,500
current draft which is sse3 busy so here

580
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:45,150
we just put a little focus on the Somoza

581
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:50,069
migration between a zoom and a single

582
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:52,859
node so we can see that so originally we

583
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:55,829
have a flight network so we have a

584
00:38:52,859 --> 00:39:00,900
jungle in the cloud side which is backed

585
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:04,289
as cloud so we need to transfer

586
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:07,470
that is oom2 a single note so when we do

587
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:10,009
this kind of transfer so normally people

588
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:14,220
like a smooth transfer that means that

589
00:39:10,009 --> 00:39:17,039
we don't have we have a minimum traffic

590
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:21,569
interruptions so here we have a

591
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:24,990
solutions to achieve that because when

592
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:27,619
we do the standardization for us PFT

593
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:31,769
disease so we have implementation and

594
00:39:27,619 --> 00:39:35,369
then we can show that we can do the

595
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:39,058
smooth migration between a June and that

596
00:39:35,369 --> 00:39:42,660
zones ages for the carnation so King

597
00:39:39,059 --> 00:39:44,220
week and I know that we have for been

598
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:48,359
among traffic in the row in the

599
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:52,470
reference for that smooth migration so

600
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:55,380
for those a smooth migration the basic

601
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:59,129
idea can also be applied to the smooth

602
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:03,450
migration between a tune and a single

603
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:06,859
pursued a note so the PHA is that so we

604
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:09,538
do this smooth migration we can see that

605
00:40:06,859 --> 00:40:13,049
for the flight network will have a

606
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:15,960
connections for that June through the

607
00:40:13,049 --> 00:40:18,059
outside node which is a connect to the

608
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,539
tune so that's in the in the original

609
00:40:18,059 --> 00:40:24,210
book after we migrated to a single note

610
00:40:21,539 --> 00:40:26,880
so the connection is different so the

611
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:30,089
single note the big note will connect

612
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,880
through that blue line to those ages

613
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:35,880
note so we should have smooth transition

614
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,900
between the blue solid line and that

615
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:43,380
data up like fashion line so this is a

616
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:46,440
smooth transition the basic idea we can

617
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:47,099
also poro that one from the smooth

618
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:49,890
transition

619
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:53,309
we already implemented so that's a

620
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:58,950
roughly the amount of the most boost

621
00:40:53,309 --> 00:41:02,309
migration and then because we you see we

622
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:09,390
have a group of people working on the

623
00:41:02,309 --> 00:41:14,210
ITF side also in a background we put a

624
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:16,549
lot of effort there and then so here

625
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:19,280
this thing is a present to the those

626
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:23,300
Google people how should we move forward

627
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:27,050
so while my scene is that we have our

628
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:29,210
obstruction or IRA proxy so that's one

629
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,310
piece walk we can I don't know whether

630
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:35,600
he's a roof over that with that piece

631
00:41:31,310 --> 00:41:37,580
along and then we have this work so the

632
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:40,069
way you move I'll also separately well

633
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:47,060
so we merge together so that's the

634
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:51,860
question to all of us here so I wanted

635
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:53,660
to ask before this meeting and before

636
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,540
the is Toni pointed out some of the

637
00:41:53,660 --> 00:42:00,319
edicts and whatnot were passed down

638
00:41:56,540 --> 00:42:03,470
there was a people were working together

639
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:08,680
and we might I think you said that there

640
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:12,410
was a collaboration draft in github yeah

641
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,740
Toni for for a long time and then I we

642
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:21,379
have I do the hip hop and then we sailed

643
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:22,939
with Google people and then we have we

644
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,570
have a raft

645
00:42:22,940 --> 00:42:29,300
verges draft but because we have some

646
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:32,290
for some reason as Tony mentioned that

647
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:36,730
in his presentation there's eight

648
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:41,420
interruption the cooperation is a is

649
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:43,430
precluded right no so what I'm very

650
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:48,380
curious about is what state that

651
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:51,109
collaboration draft is in because what

652
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,390
stops us as a working group I mean first

653
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:56,180
of all assuming we even want to adopt

654
00:42:53,390 --> 00:43:00,049
this work right the the abstraction of

655
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:02,540
the area or zones if we did what stops

656
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:06,730
us from just as a working you're taking

657
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:09,220
the existing collaboration draft

658
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:11,290
working not as a working group I mean we

659
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:14,140
as a working group we don't care about

660
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:18,490
edicts right I mean if the work is

661
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:21,220
almost done yeah for me is a little

662
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,500
popularizing all sack so is this a

663
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:24,970
public is this a public repo that the

664
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,640
working group could take a look at could

665
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:30,700
you send a link to it yeah I think maybe

666
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,598
because we walk with Tommy for data in

667
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,730
the private shared github there so if we

668
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:37,420
weather move water with Tommy also need

669
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,520
the quarry right

670
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:44,079
so Tony Lee arista so Chris I'm sorry to

671
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,369
say that I don't think we made a heck of

672
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,640
a lot of progress on the collaboration

673
00:43:45,369 --> 00:43:52,089
anyway so well I think you're welcome to

674
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,270
look I don't have read or write access I

675
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:57,040
think anymore but I don't think that

676
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,329
there's a whole lot of value there above

677
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:04,300
and beyond the drafts that are already

678
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:05,320
out there okay hey hey I'm Jen and I

679
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:08,380
have two questions

680
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:12,520
first is like if I can work this zone as

681
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:17,470
a known pseudo node then how does this

682
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:20,069
this affect my LFA calculations and can

683
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:23,319
a node like in the diagram between our

684
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:26,470
two can it calculate some PQ node or the

685
00:44:23,319 --> 00:44:28,839
other via this zone or are there some

686
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:32,799
restriction that is actually not clear

687
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:35,859
in the draft and my second question is

688
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:40,599
how about P database you know if I have

689
00:44:35,859 --> 00:44:42,130
an LS p going across this zone so what

690
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:44,980
is the bandwidth this pseudo node will

691
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:48,790
propagate to the upstream yeah that's a

692
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:51,670
very good question so here we are

693
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:55,000
working on the on the IP side and the IP

694
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:57,069
layer so provide the abstraction so for

695
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:01,359
those canals else PE course assume

696
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:03,460
that's at a higher level so during this

697
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:08,410
process you see we work for this one

698
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:12,640
from 2011 to 2013 is a BS so we also

699
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:15,730
proposed our traps to talk about those

700
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:19,330
issues for example how we build LSP

701
00:45:15,730 --> 00:45:22,360
costumes and we have

702
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:25,390
some kind of draft proposed it but

703
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:30,280
because this one is autumn you can see

704
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:33,430
that we don't have much progress on this

705
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,980
assumed stuff so that part at the other

706
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:39,220
part for set happens via cross in tune

707
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,360
is stopped so after I think after this

708
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:44,259
one

709
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:47,110
standardized we can just make it better

710
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:51,490
draft life again I mean those job before

711
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:54,760
crossing the tomb in a in in the his

712
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:58,600
group or in MPLS group there's some drop

713
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:01,360
up there and how about my first question

714
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,069
yeah first of those kind is similar so

715
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,730
you design a Saturday and then we could

716
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,710
work on that one

717
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:08,110
if you are happy interesting and then we

718
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:10,120
can walk it together for resolve those

719
00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:11,860
tough issues I think these that one is

720
00:46:10,120 --> 00:46:16,470
also the tough is the very tough

721
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:16,470
question sort our problems thank you

722
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:35,770
it's you know it's unfortunate to have

723
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:39,520
two solutions I mean the drafts focus on

724
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:42,490
different aspects of the problem but

725
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:46,900
they are very similar yeah a great total

726
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:52,990
degree so it's it's uh it's unfortunate

727
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:56,220
I don't know precisely how to move

728
00:46:52,990 --> 00:47:03,000
forward with this if we can't merge

729
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:06,669
obviously yeah a simple question because

730
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,990
IETF is in public domain right I think

731
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:10,300
maybe those are law years or whatever

732
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:12,549
they proposal we cannot do any

733
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:16,470
corporation but I think from the IETF

734
00:47:12,550 --> 00:47:19,300
stem also after decima on the entities

735
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:24,819
entities I think there's some kind of

736
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:26,230
policies data from Ikea my understanding

737
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:29,440
is that because this is that we can

738
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:32,829
still cooperate in the public domain

739
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:37,089
right then because this is not those

740
00:47:32,829 --> 00:47:39,880
kind of on this technology is not long

741
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:42,459
to whatever export whatever imports

742
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:45,969
those stuff yeah the IDF is an open

743
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:49,140
organization yeah so the there I mean I

744
00:47:45,969 --> 00:47:51,400
can throw out a few things process wise

745
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,140
people don't always think about this

746
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:56,469
right but when a working group adopts a

747
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:58,239
document right it's no longer that under

748
00:47:56,469 --> 00:48:00,099
it's technically not really owned by the

749
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,499
author anymore it's owned by the working

750
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:04,150
group typically that's not an issue the

751
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:06,519
authors are happy and everything but

752
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,079
when they you know working group

753
00:48:06,519 --> 00:48:09,758
adoption is like the working group is

754
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,589
taking over ownership and then the

755
00:48:09,759 --> 00:48:13,690
author becomes sort of a shepherd of the

756
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:15,249
doctrine at that point and you generally

757
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:17,259
listen to the author's direction because

758
00:48:15,249 --> 00:48:22,118
they're the person who made you know

759
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:25,029
created this this work but you know even

760
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:26,650
if and this is totally hypothetical I'm

761
00:48:25,029 --> 00:48:29,140
not leaning towards anything but even if

762
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:32,019
we adopted for example to Tony's Drive

763
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:34,420
right it would no longer be of wristers

764
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:38,078
work it would be if we've now become the

765
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:40,299
IDF's work right that's outside of like

766
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,640
IPR claims I mean IPR claims are

767
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:45,369
different right now Tony might

768
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,969
immediately step down as author at that

769
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:52,059
point he's at the mic let's see

770
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:54,699
I'm just Tony Lee again so I think I

771
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:57,309
should clarify the layer 8 interrupt

772
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:58,859
context a little bit because I think it

773
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:01,719
will prevent us from causing problems

774
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:03,549
and I am NOT a lawyer I do not play one

775
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:06,119
on TV I don't know what I'm talking

776
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:09,788
about ok take it with a grain of salt

777
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,589
that said my understanding is that we

778
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:15,719
are not allowed to have a private

779
00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:16,900
conversation about technology whatsoever

780
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:20,049
ok

781
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:23,529
we can do anything we want inside this

782
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:25,930
room but we cannot step outside of this

783
00:49:23,529 --> 00:49:28,719
room and have a conversation we can have

784
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:32,948
a conversation on the mailing list but

785
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:34,660
we cannot go to lunch together ok

786
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:35,950
it's that simple

787
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:38,440
that that's actually a great

788
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:40,509
clarification because I I actually

789
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:42,009
misunderstood when I talked to you I

790
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:45,609
thought it was more restrictive than

791
00:49:42,009 --> 00:49:47,289
that so that I yeah so I think there's

792
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:50,098
more more than just you in this room

793
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:52,990
probably has been given similar

794
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:57,269
instructions I mean it's it's weird

795
00:49:52,990 --> 00:50:01,390
crazy stuff that I certainly hate but

796
00:49:57,269 --> 00:50:06,098
yet really Porsche energy anarchists is

797
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:14,098
the other routing ad in this room they

798
00:50:06,099 --> 00:50:16,420
should be no disrespect RL in the room

799
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:19,269
the problem is you're caught in this

800
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,519
conflict because you're cold yes that's

801
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:25,990
why I haven't actually said anything but

802
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:27,970
now that you brought it up I'm going to

803
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:31,269
say two things that I would say often

804
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:33,819
one is that I need to obviously recuse

805
00:50:31,269 --> 00:50:35,200
myself from any discussion of this draft

806
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:37,390
or whatever the working was going to do

807
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,319
with it because I'm one of the authors

808
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:43,720
with Ranma I'm sure you two can you know

809
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:47,170
deal with whatever and if you need any

810
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,689
help Martin or therefore can help you

811
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:53,829
with that there are statements that the

812
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:56,380
LLC put out last last year this year

813
00:50:53,829 --> 00:51:00,069
about precisely the open nature of the

814
00:50:56,380 --> 00:51:02,559
ATF and you know both what you guys said

815
00:51:00,069 --> 00:51:04,000
what 27 is actually what the statement

816
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,880
says meaning the ITF is an open

817
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,869
organization there's nothing that

818
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,640
according to the IETF legal team

819
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:14,589
precludes communication between

820
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,618
participants on mailing lists or an

821
00:51:14,589 --> 00:51:20,470
opera forums on all that stuff having

822
00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:21,910
said that I'm also not a lawyer and all

823
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:24,098
of you should talk to your own lawyers

824
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:26,558
right about what what you can do or

825
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:28,690
can't do or what you think you know the

826
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,869
other thing that I don't say too often

827
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:35,589
is that I'm going to agree with less in

828
00:51:31,869 --> 00:51:37,990
that I think that before we start

829
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:42,430
adopting stuff now I'm talking as a

830
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:43,868
working member we need to figure out you

831
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:46,868
know what is this something we do we

832
00:51:43,869 --> 00:51:47,859
need is this something we want what are

833
00:51:46,869 --> 00:51:50,200
the characteristics of what

834
00:51:47,859 --> 00:51:53,019
want and then we can go and say well we

835
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,629
have these two things this satisfies

836
00:51:53,019 --> 00:51:57,758
this or doesn't satisfy that and and go

837
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:01,029
from there that's my suggestion as a

838
00:51:57,759 --> 00:52:02,499
working group member but yes you're a

839
00:52:01,029 --> 00:52:04,690
complete way right now we don't have

840
00:52:02,499 --> 00:52:08,259
another arriving ad here but as I said

841
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:10,539
the chairs can get there were important

842
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:13,539
to to help whenever you need to they had

843
00:52:10,539 --> 00:52:17,019
all the confidence so I think I got

844
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:19,569
another clarification I think for for

845
00:52:17,019 --> 00:52:22,359
all the others for example me and Oprah

846
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:24,489
and a Richard well in future wait so

847
00:52:22,359 --> 00:52:28,150
future way is not only a little east so

848
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:33,220
this is a right you join us is not

849
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:35,890
island and it at least brandy again you

850
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:39,069
guys really get a get off layer hate and

851
00:52:35,890 --> 00:52:42,069
above the working group should decide

852
00:52:39,069 --> 00:52:45,700
whether to move forward in this subject

853
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:51,069
area if not this discussion is useless

854
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:54,038
right if if so then the other routing a

855
00:52:51,069 --> 00:53:00,940
Dean needs to give you some guidance on

856
00:52:54,039 --> 00:53:04,029
how to move forward - we must point

857
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,130
my lawyers were very explicit that they

858
00:53:04,029 --> 00:53:09,579
do not understand the difference and I

859
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:13,390
was cautioned and ordered do you not

860
00:53:09,579 --> 00:53:16,180
collaborate yeah but from a role

861
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:20,680
whatever future ways a lot on the US and

862
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:23,410
it at least I understand the facts I

863
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:26,919
also understand the lawyers yes who pays

864
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:29,470
my salary so so I think I think you know

865
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:30,849
I I was independently of a Randy said I

866
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:33,939
was thinking about this we should start

867
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:37,509
a discussion of the requirement of this

868
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:40,779
giving the pain it would you know for

869
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:43,059
other documents we'd set a lower bar for

870
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:46,390
adoption but from this one given the

871
00:53:43,059 --> 00:53:48,430
pain it's gonna cost us let's start a

872
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:51,879
discussion of the requirement and how

873
00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:55,960
much this actually saves us yeah III

874
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:59,440
think I'm sure that Tony you've got some

875
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:01,270
customer behind this request but I would

876
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,610
be very interested in here

877
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:09,460
from operators people that would be

878
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:11,710
deploying this right like yeah it would

879
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:16,990
be nice to know how much want there is

880
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:18,550
out there and again we don't like the

881
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:20,259
working group doesn't like spending time

882
00:54:18,550 --> 00:54:22,180
on this conflict that's why we want to

883
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:25,690
make sure that the requirement is strong

884
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:27,549
enough to justify what we're gonna you

885
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:29,350
know spending a lot of time in

886
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:44,740
discussions that we could be spending on

887
00:54:29,350 --> 00:55:20,890
technical solutions thank you Tony P

888
00:54:44,740 --> 00:55:23,350
here so just what we're getting it up I

889
00:55:20,890 --> 00:55:25,089
just want to say this draft isn't

890
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:28,810
exactly the same as the other ones but

891
00:55:25,090 --> 00:55:30,850
it solves a similar problem and it does

892
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:37,330
it without abstracting the area with

893
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:40,390
tunnels so ac said it all but let me

894
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:44,500
fill in the details okay all right so no

895
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:47,560
lowering relative simple stuff so we put

896
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,270
that stuff out I'm I try to keep it

897
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,850
relatively short people are interesting

898
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,050
I'm sure read the draft so I won't be

899
00:55:51,850 --> 00:55:54,730
slaughtering you with details I'll tell

900
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,990
you what the problem is and you know

901
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:58,119
what were the parameters that we were

902
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:59,950
solving and give very rough outline of

903
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:03,010
the solution which is actually you know

904
00:55:59,950 --> 00:56:04,390
embarassingly simple and then I hope for

905
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:05,980
some discussion on the mic and depending

906
00:56:04,390 --> 00:56:10,200
on that I may call for adoption or not

907
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:14,140
all right so um so what is the problem

908
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,160
the problem is that some very big

909
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,759
customer smiles

910
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:20,890
right they are mixing in eius eius

911
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:24,340
backbones the number of links and nodes

912
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:25,930
and even when you scale the

913
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:27,640
implementation very very well you start

914
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:29,470
to our heat actually heat basically

915
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:31,029
protocol limitations right in terms of

916
00:56:29,470 --> 00:56:33,069
like flooding grades how much can you

917
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:37,660
really put into eius eius and computer

918
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:40,630
over it so you know some possibilities

919
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:45,310
are too forklift the protocol you know

920
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:47,410
there's some suggestions here and the

921
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,650
other limitations that these customers

922
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:53,440
are heating is that i gps are kind is

923
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:55,750
one hall one hop multiple spokesmodel

924
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:57,250
right which limits them so the spokes

925
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,410
are good for excess so it's good to

926
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:00,910
scale an excess network that way but if

927
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:03,430
you really what you have is a backbone

928
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:05,200
that goes really really big then this

929
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:08,560
model is not particularly good for it

930
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,779
right because we we did not build areas

931
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,210
as transit just like BGP SAS is as

932
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,440
transit iGPS were built our heat

933
00:57:13,210 --> 00:57:16,420
actually different I'm just describing

934
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:17,950
the problem these people are heating

935
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:19,720
without passing any judgment right I

936
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:21,160
have a tool they try to fit it they try

937
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:27,009
to get something done they go like a

938
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:29,410
ain't working and the other trend that

939
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:31,060
we observe is that they start I mean

940
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:34,180
traditionally I GPS were built for

941
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:35,890
something which were relatively sparse

942
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:37,690
smashes and that's why we picked up the

943
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:39,700
Dykstra Dykstra behaved much better on

944
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:41,110
sparse stuff right bellman-ford is much

945
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:43,180
better on dense but you said like who's

946
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:45,810
gonna get dance yeah well guess what

947
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:48,040
customers are running dense clusters now

948
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:50,799
so they basically going to architecture

949
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,810
where things are more what you call

950
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,660
cliques or you know and some kind of

951
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:57,670
regular meshes and it is just tons of

952
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:01,810
links which loads computation flooding

953
00:57:57,670 --> 00:58:04,120
and so on and so on the other thing when

954
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:06,910
they started to play with areas was what

955
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:09,190
they didn't like is that if they start

956
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,980
to abstract pieces of the topology and

957
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:14,260
hides the topology then they lose path

958
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,880
diversity even if they're doing some

959
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,000
kind of hacks trying to transit through

960
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,620
these areas right you start to height l1

961
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,390
and then your forwarding starts to

962
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,190
follow strictly just l2 on the back on

963
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:28,330
so now where are all the l1 paths that

964
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:28,900
you have around so that now we did some

965
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,340
kind of thing

966
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:31,900
we saw the stuff for the last couple of

967
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,600
years did a couple of thinking tossed a

968
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:36,910
lot of things around and then the

969
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:40,240
customer of course will not accept any

970
00:58:36,910 --> 00:58:43,240
solution right they have lots of other

971
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:46,180
properties which are anything from

972
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:50,379
technical to political and operational

973
00:58:46,180 --> 00:58:52,569
anything in between right so what they

974
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:54,310
basically wanted is scale me the

975
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,930
backbone without triggering the control

976
00:58:54,310 --> 00:58:57,580
plane scale limitations that's really

977
00:58:55,930 --> 00:59:00,310
what they wanted right somehow remove

978
00:58:57,580 --> 00:59:02,970
the control plane scale limitation give

979
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:06,040
me much more scale on the backbone and

980
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,540
they want many more smaller boxes which

981
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:09,940
kind of aggravates the problem also

982
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,470
leads to the dense masses they go like I

983
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:13,330
don't want these huge boxes which look

984
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:15,129
like a single box I want more and more

985
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:17,380
like small boxes I'm slapping together

986
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,570
but then I need a lot of links in

987
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:22,140
between them so I'm hitting even faster

988
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:25,660
this control plane limitations and then

989
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,180
yes seriously no please do not for cliff

990
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:32,500
the protocol we love you all but flag

991
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:33,970
days are something we hate you know from

992
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,380
you no longer operational experience

993
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:38,020
they give me something but now have to

994
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:45,700
forklift the protocol Tony yep you mean

995
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:47,020
like grift but see so we I have not here

996
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,580
to talk about great but I can tell you

997
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:50,080
how reflux into the stuff actually I

998
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:53,470
won't tell you you'll figure out in a

999
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:55,779
couple of years okay I don't have to be

1000
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:56,950
right now I just have to be I have to be

1001
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:59,380
able to a couple of years to tell you

1002
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,600
where beer I told you so ok now alright

1003
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:05,350
so but no rift is neither here or there

1004
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:06,520
I'm not talking about rift so they also

1005
01:00:05,350 --> 01:00:08,740
wanted a very simple robust

1006
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,960
configuration so please do not allowed

1007
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:12,069
me with a hugely complicated operational

1008
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:14,440
model where I have to provision

1009
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:16,750
everything just though okay and then go

1010
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:19,810
look for troubles no proprietor

1011
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:21,130
solutions okay and and they didn't want

1012
01:00:19,810 --> 01:00:23,049
any kind of centralized point of

1013
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:24,460
failures right so just do please not

1014
01:00:23,050 --> 01:00:26,050
build me something where you want

1015
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,490
something centralized where you store

1016
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,380
some states and they think and blow up

1017
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:31,600
and next thing will be reinventing NSR

1018
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:32,560
so okay so it has to be fully

1019
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,990
distributed solution

1020
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:38,650
yeah we like them they extremely robust

1021
01:00:34,990 --> 01:00:41,529
and then what they also wanted was well

1022
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:42,580
but at the end if you scaled it up I

1023
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:45,340
still want my

1024
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,080
optimal traffic engineering like yeah

1025
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,760
well that's hard again right you won't

1026
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,440
it abstract but then you want the food

1027
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,270
thing to do all the optimal path

1028
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,950
selection like okay everything's

1029
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:55,780
impossible so let's go and graph through

1030
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:57,310
a lot of different solutions and the TTC

1031
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:59,980
stop was around and so on

1032
01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:02,830
right all right so what's the outline of

1033
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:05,620
the solution so place somewhere in this

1034
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:08,980
directions people were poking around

1035
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:10,980
here but basically having look at a lot

1036
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:13,750
of things and play it and tossed up

1037
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:17,680
flood reflection which is really a knock

1038
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:20,770
off of route reflection seems to meet

1039
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,379
the bill actually surprisingly well with

1040
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:25,300
all these impossible requirements so

1041
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:27,130
basically what do you do is you pick

1042
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:31,120
three colors right three colors are good

1043
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:34,210
so you take a piece of the backbone and

1044
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:37,330
you make it in l1 right so this is this

1045
01:01:34,210 --> 01:01:39,880
red box and outside are the l2 guys so

1046
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:42,490
the l2 is blue but now instead of

1047
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,160
sticking every thing into l1 l2 which

1048
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,870
blows out your l2 scale again you just

1049
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:49,299
pick up a bunch of notes and made them

1050
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:52,270
reflectors so they're in the blue and

1051
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:55,170
the thin lines are tunnels because now

1052
01:01:52,270 --> 01:01:58,570
those l2 nodes are not necessarily

1053
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:00,940
directly connected right so you pick up

1054
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:03,820
some kind of tunneling who cares

1055
01:02:00,940 --> 01:02:06,280
and you flood over those tunnels so

1056
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:09,420
you've L to flooding topology starts to

1057
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:12,250
look like multiple stars so that has

1058
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,490
much better scaling properties that full

1059
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:16,930
meshes it gives you see redundancy it

1060
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:19,209
doesn't give you any single point of

1061
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:24,089
failures because this is colorful still

1062
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:24,090
fully distributed you know is is and

1063
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:29,740
I'll talk about that stuff later now so

1064
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:32,649
how do we transition through this thing

1065
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:35,620
so the guys on the l2 on the outside

1066
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:37,600
they see those two stars so if you kind

1067
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:40,150
of naive all the forwarding we go

1068
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:42,069
through these tunnels like da so first

1069
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:45,130
you like you're out you go forward

1070
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:47,830
tunnels these l2 tunnels could be okay

1071
01:02:45,130 --> 01:02:49,450
or not but then everything kind of

1072
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:51,069
bunches out in those tunnels and these

1073
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:55,180
rail reflections become like forwarding

1074
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:56,260
choke points like yeah great you scaled

1075
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,520
up you

1076
01:02:56,260 --> 01:03:00,190
control blame but you just killed my

1077
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:02,440
data plane and if this some of his l1

1078
01:03:00,190 --> 01:03:04,360
topology somewhere outside of this l2

1079
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,340
path the capacity will never get

1080
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:08,890
utilized so you lose all the path

1081
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:12,460
diversity of you know underlying Network

1082
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:16,299
like now I know that doesn't help well

1083
01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:19,630
so you have to change the SPF on the

1084
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:22,420
incoming leaves and what they basically

1085
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:24,010
do is underneath you don't have to do

1086
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:26,950
that but I described the simplest

1087
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:29,650
possible solution the orange colors are

1088
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:31,930
or l1 forwarding tunnels which are

1089
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:35,080
invisible to the l2 outside so you still

1090
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:37,839
have full mesh in the l1 right and the

1091
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:40,150
guys on the edges when the l2 traffic

1092
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,310
comes in they basically shortcut through

1093
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:43,000
this l1 tunnels that's actually fairly

1094
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:45,600
simple

1095
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,200
SPF modification so they look whether

1096
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:54,580
the l2 route that they compute goes

1097
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:56,470
through a flat repeater what we call we

1098
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,240
call them reflectors flood flood

1099
01:03:56,470 --> 01:04:00,100
reflectors which hinge language a couple

1100
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,939
of times so the flood reflector

1101
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:06,100
adjacency if this is so then you don't

1102
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,780
use it or you there's a couple of

1103
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,330
solutions but basically you don't use

1104
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:13,660
that for forwarding you shortcut to your

1105
01:04:10,330 --> 01:04:15,580
exit through the l1 and you can also

1106
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:19,000
shortcut these things so I'm not showing

1107
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:20,680
it here but the blue leaves the client

1108
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:22,300
reflects for clients connector also have

1109
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,950
a direct link and then you forward along

1110
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:24,460
this direct link that works just fine

1111
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:27,250
Tony

1112
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:31,420
yeah so there's really two parts to this

1113
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:33,760
there's the flow reflector to reduce the

1114
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:38,290
flooding in l2 yeah but you could have

1115
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:40,330
done what Tony a bog two and got rid of

1116
01:04:38,290 --> 01:04:43,720
the tunnels and just made everything in

1117
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:45,580
the L 1 and L 1 l 2 no there's even a

1118
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:47,200
clever solution you're pretty good Ralph

1119
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,490
I mentioned this stuff but you could

1120
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,439
have done that without doing the time

1121
01:04:48,490 --> 01:04:52,060
you can do something even more smarter

1122
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:54,190
than that but you have to read and think

1123
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:56,230
about it ok so this is the simplest

1124
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:59,650
simplest variant it works like a charm

1125
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,720
for practical purposes ok now the nice

1126
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:04,900
thing is that what you're really lifting

1127
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:08,770
are only those leaves and the reflectors

1128
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,690
and the configuration in most extreme

1129
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:12,210
case

1130
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:15,030
is just local indoor interface on this

1131
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:17,160
tunneling interface right and the people

1132
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:19,950
and the l2 people outside are completely

1133
01:05:17,160 --> 01:05:22,020
oblivious of towards going on and most

1134
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:24,058
of these l1 nodes you don't have to lift

1135
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:26,819
them either right so you really have a

1136
01:05:24,059 --> 01:05:28,980
minimal lift and you can do it partially

1137
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:31,770
because that will also work it some of

1138
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:33,780
these people are not even even client so

1139
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:38,579
that's the outline of the solution right

1140
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:39,990
so what we put on is now you don't want

1141
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,849
to miss configure this thing in a sense

1142
01:05:39,990 --> 01:05:44,038
that you start to build really weird

1143
01:05:41,849 --> 01:05:46,020
stuff with so that has been done with

1144
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:49,650
BGP route reflectors and led to a lot of

1145
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:52,859
problems so we stuck this indication

1146
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:54,270
which cluster ID are you on the iih and

1147
01:05:52,859 --> 01:05:56,098
whether you apply on the reflector

1148
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:59,549
I have very strict adjacency forming

1149
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:01,470
glue rules we killed off route reflex

1150
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:05,910
flood reflect or hierarchies route

1151
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:07,709
reflect hierarchies are a beautiful

1152
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:10,140
thing to behold if you run operational

1153
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:11,970
into problems with them we also kill to

1154
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:13,589
what people tend to do is in the same

1155
01:06:11,970 --> 01:06:16,049
cluster to build horizontal link between

1156
01:06:13,589 --> 01:06:18,779
reflectors but those are relatively

1157
01:06:16,049 --> 01:06:20,339
simple rules that we can argue about I

1158
01:06:18,779 --> 01:06:21,569
mean if people want to draw work on the

1159
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:24,000
draft and they feel strongly we should

1160
01:06:21,569 --> 01:06:27,240
have a hierarchy well it can be made to

1161
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,940
work right what what we had was people

1162
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:32,189
asking us for the maximum simplicity

1163
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:33,930
like no foolproof almost impossible to

1164
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,819
me it's configured that's where we were

1165
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,470
leaning towards so I am saying this

1166
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:41,308
orange I want tunnel mesh is optional

1167
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:45,359
that's more advanced discussion so

1168
01:06:41,309 --> 01:06:47,579
what's the big deal well you only have

1169
01:06:45,359 --> 01:06:50,578
to lift the flood reflectors and the

1170
01:06:47,579 --> 01:06:53,220
clients okay and they actually only need

1171
01:06:50,579 --> 01:06:55,529
local configuration knobs because you

1172
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:58,470
don't really even well so we also put

1173
01:06:55,529 --> 01:07:00,000
the discovery the cluster discovery not

1174
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:01,859
only know ia cheese but we also

1175
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,690
advertise it on the links so you can

1176
01:07:01,859 --> 01:07:05,970
figure out you know who what is the

1177
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:08,039
route reflector topology but you don't

1178
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,180
have to look at the stuff and you can

1179
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:11,010
actually even implement it without

1180
01:07:09,180 --> 01:07:12,750
advertising anything so this is a local

1181
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:18,059
configuration knob on the router like

1182
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:21,539
this goes to my flat reflector the whole

1183
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:23,440
thing makes you allows you to scale the

1184
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:26,890
l2 control plane in a row

1185
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,810
linear fashion right so nothing you

1186
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:32,140
don't have the n square or full L to

1187
01:07:28,810 --> 01:07:34,960
tunnel meshes which practically speaking

1188
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:39,100
gives you a very very long runway for

1189
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:42,730
very little work right so what you get

1190
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:45,430
out is this l1 but actually the l1

1191
01:07:42,730 --> 01:07:47,620
doesn't have to l be l1 so this leads to

1192
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:50,200
further thinking if you abstract these

1193
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:52,540
things as l1 you could run out of

1194
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:55,960
protocol so you can run OSPF underneath

1195
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:58,930
as l1 and you can run l2 with front

1196
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:00,520
refraction is is on top which gives you

1197
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:02,950
interesting properties in terms of like

1198
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:04,840
faith sharing in a protocol don't you

1199
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:08,529
know you can you don't have to but it

1200
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:10,300
gives you this degree of freedom so an

1201
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:13,690
l2 runs with these flat reflectors

1202
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:16,180
nevertheless it uses all the l1 path

1203
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:17,680
diversity in the topology underneath

1204
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:19,030
which is really what you what you really

1205
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:24,670
want right because that's how you scale

1206
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:26,109
up a bandwidth this is you know they

1207
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:27,640
make better and better fools every year

1208
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:29,620
that's which that's why we still working

1209
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:31,270
right but this is as foolproof as fools

1210
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:32,559
fools come these days I'm sure they

1211
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,840
invent better fools that will break the

1212
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,020
stuff but you know as far as we could we

1213
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:38,920
base it to run out anything that can be

1214
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:41,890
misconfigure on lead you into

1215
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,390
interesting you know problems which I

1216
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:45,250
think we understood fairly well because

1217
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:47,490
we went a whole BGP route reflector

1218
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:53,430
curve and it was actually extremely

1219
01:08:47,490 --> 01:08:58,960
educational all right and so it's kiss

1220
01:08:53,430 --> 01:09:00,580
means so yeah sorry he's all this

1221
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:03,160
complicated this thing tends to be these

1222
01:09:00,580 --> 01:09:04,899
days you know in GP but it seems to have

1223
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,139
a pretty good run away for what people

1224
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:12,250
are looking for a question

1225
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:16,480
Tony AC and Irma Cisco Systems so on

1226
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:18,670
these tunnels which ones the l2 l1 l1

1227
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:20,649
tunnels yeah you're not running the

1228
01:09:18,670 --> 01:09:22,330
Jason sees over there over the or the

1229
01:09:20,649 --> 01:09:26,259
tunnels as well as you have you are

1230
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:29,140
you're not all right underneath

1231
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:32,140
underneath you have two l1 all right so

1232
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:36,710
you better do yes you know what I mean I

1233
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:38,989
do you know you but the draught says you

1234
01:09:36,710 --> 01:09:40,580
better do okay for lot of practical

1235
01:09:38,988 --> 01:09:43,129
purposes we saw in deployment like

1236
01:09:40,580 --> 01:09:44,600
nothing as ugly as a broken tunnel over

1237
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:50,230
which you trying to forward happily

1238
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:52,279
right so yeah we suggest people do but

1239
01:09:50,229 --> 01:09:54,468
yes so this is this degree of

1240
01:09:52,279 --> 01:09:57,770
flexibility of l1 or you can want the

1241
01:09:54,469 --> 01:10:01,060
right protocol in l1 right which makes

1242
01:09:57,770 --> 01:10:07,400
it ztp if you do it correctly

1243
01:10:01,060 --> 01:10:10,130
GPS PF BGP MPs of obviously we the

1244
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,960
controller yeah so a lot of these

1245
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:19,460
typologies when I when I was thinking

1246
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:21,770
about them as presented the data center

1247
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:23,719
or whatever sort of you can also start

1248
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:28,460
thinking about it it's like a partition

1249
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:33,040
l2 right and this is right no I so when

1250
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:36,620
you're suggesting level one virtual

1251
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:38,750
links right to correct the partition and

1252
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:43,190
help you it's it's another way of

1253
01:10:38,750 --> 01:10:45,739
modeling is I think though is that if

1254
01:10:43,190 --> 01:10:49,250
people are interested in this let's keep

1255
01:10:45,739 --> 01:10:51,320
talking about right so yes I mean the

1256
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:53,090
nasty way to talk about it say well

1257
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:56,049
you're inventing virtual links again

1258
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:58,910
yeah yes with the flavor yeah that's

1259
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:01,130
well I mean look if you if you if you

1260
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:03,230
really paranoid you don't need to tell

1261
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:08,060
to tunnels you can put this think one

1262
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:10,370
top away or or you can be make them like

1263
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:12,680
Tony was make them at all the level one

1264
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:15,380
routers l1 l2 yeah but then you lose the

1265
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:17,060
l2 scalability then you just just kill

1266
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,040
the baby that's the problem

1267
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:20,750
well that's how we started and they say

1268
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,670
well there's still all the routers are

1269
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:25,190
in l2 like you didn't serve our scale

1270
01:11:22,670 --> 01:11:27,710
problem but the most any router has is

1271
01:11:25,190 --> 01:11:31,339
what you have at the edges which is the

1272
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:33,770
subset of one l1 and l2 you don't have

1273
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:36,860
all the other l1 o irrigate them right

1274
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:39,170
no no no if you look at the stop because

1275
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:40,910
the way people build these meshes there

1276
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:42,950
by sectional means that you end up with

1277
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:46,670
all the routers in l2 again otherwise

1278
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:49,489
the problem wouldn't exist ok Tony Leoni

1279
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:50,150
and the way we are doing things while it

1280
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:53,599
puts

1281
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:56,480
everything into l2 the l2 information

1282
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,530
about the inside area does not leave the

1283
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:00,199
inside area

1284
01:11:57,530 --> 01:12:02,900
this is absolutely key because it means

1285
01:12:00,199 --> 01:12:05,389
that when we actually abstract things we

1286
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:07,730
effectively take it out of link level

1287
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:10,219
tuning state database for the rest of

1288
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:11,809
the network okay

1289
01:12:10,219 --> 01:12:14,030
so if I've got an area I've got a

1290
01:12:11,810 --> 01:12:15,679
thousand routers in it I've just taken

1291
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:16,780
those thousand routers out of the

1292
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:20,179
network

1293
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:23,059
it was AC again I was thinking of in the

1294
01:12:20,179 --> 01:12:27,890
in the OSPF term where you would leak

1295
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:30,770
them into the into the area as opposed

1296
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:32,989
to into the non backbone area which

1297
01:12:30,770 --> 01:12:36,640
would have been the maximum you ever

1298
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:41,379
have would you'd have one L one area and

1299
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:43,850
l2 and the l2 stuff would be aggregated

1300
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,190
are you saying you couldn't satisfy the

1301
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:47,480
traffic engineering requirements if you

1302
01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:49,519
don't if you don't if you do any

1303
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:51,559
aggregation of the l1 areas how do you

1304
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,870
preserve all the diversity of the

1305
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:56,060
traffic look if you have height the

1306
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:58,219
problem is that yes obviously you can

1307
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:59,719
abstract this l1 and show something on

1308
01:12:58,219 --> 01:13:02,719
the edges but I know you don't know how

1309
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:05,750
how much diversity you get out of it ok

1310
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:08,090
if you want diversity then we're talking

1311
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:10,730
back to traffic engineering and your

1312
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,940
traffic engineering mechanisms like BG

1313
01:13:10,730 --> 01:13:16,699
pls yeah are highly applicable ok you

1314
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:20,389
cannot have both abstraction and detail

1315
01:13:16,699 --> 01:13:22,969
at the same time it doesn't work well

1316
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:25,640
and for our purposes right now in

1317
01:13:22,969 --> 01:13:28,400
scaling the IGP we need the abstraction

1318
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:30,380
we have a low yes and no so this keeps

1319
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,420
them the abstraction without losing the

1320
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:34,670
diversity and with the bgp LS that they

1321
01:13:32,420 --> 01:13:36,710
take out of l1 and l2 on the controller

1322
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:40,239
they can do a full path computation yes

1323
01:13:36,710 --> 01:13:42,409
I cannot do optimal distribute the TE

1324
01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:44,599
whatever solution we take I mean that

1325
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:47,210
like you say you hide it it's controlled

1326
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:48,980
lying right so what I'm telling people

1327
01:13:47,210 --> 01:13:51,770
well you need to run BTW pls and take

1328
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:53,299
everything from from the l1 and l2 in

1329
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:55,159
the controller and you have to do

1330
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:56,719
optimal computation that way but at

1331
01:13:55,159 --> 01:13:58,129
least you don't forgive if it's a

1332
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:59,719
standard mechanism we have those

1333
01:13:58,130 --> 01:14:02,030
controllers built they do that actually

1334
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:04,110
today already so you know what suppose

1335
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:09,740
so why not just abstract everything

1336
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:09,740
that's the answer because then you well

1337
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:15,840
you for cliff too much stuff that's the

1338
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:17,849
first thing and second look so simple

1339
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:21,150
observation when you run the abstract

1340
01:14:17,850 --> 01:14:23,970
note you end up basically build a

1341
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:27,089
chassis again because this area leader

1342
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:30,720
starts to take in a lot of state to

1343
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:32,430
synchronize the same way as a routing

1344
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,830
engine in a router synchronizes line

1345
01:14:32,430 --> 01:14:36,750
cards and the next thing you build NSR

1346
01:14:34,830 --> 01:14:38,400
between the two of them and then you

1347
01:14:36,750 --> 01:14:40,530
just reinvented the shots in a different

1348
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,120
way and this is there was a big no-no

1349
01:14:40,530 --> 01:14:45,150
right they don't want any kind of

1350
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:48,120
centralized think when one thing failing

1351
01:14:45,150 --> 01:14:50,129
can affect it and less gave you the

1352
01:14:48,120 --> 01:14:54,480
first layer of the onion there's like

1353
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:56,460
twelve underneath but I mean you willing

1354
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,919
I mean perfectly fine you build it and

1355
01:14:56,460 --> 01:15:03,660
then we talk and maybe I'm wrong and we

1356
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:06,900
see code in progress so what we've seen

1357
01:15:03,660 --> 01:15:08,639
is that when we do this it's relatively

1358
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:11,160
straightforward to create the

1359
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:14,190
abstraction that forklifting everything

1360
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:17,550
is not necessary just the things that

1361
01:15:14,190 --> 01:15:21,570
are going to use this new hack and it's

1362
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:23,250
relatively straightforward what I mean

1363
01:15:21,570 --> 01:15:32,460
we agree that this is forklifting less

1364
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:35,700
or maybe not okay so back to my comment

1365
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:37,350
about the redistributing routes Tony you

1366
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:41,370
mentioned that it's it could be

1367
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:44,550
dangerous I'd be interested I mean maybe

1368
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:46,530
we can mitigate that danger like if

1369
01:15:44,550 --> 01:15:49,650
maybe you know maybe it's worth

1370
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:52,440
exploring a small protocol extension

1371
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:54,299
that allows otherwise using normal

1372
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,210
already deployed things like multi

1373
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:59,010
instance with redistribution with a

1374
01:15:57,210 --> 01:16:00,630
little bit of extra information there to

1375
01:15:59,010 --> 01:16:02,730
keep us from you know like the down bit

1376
01:16:00,630 --> 01:16:04,020
when we went you know there could be a

1377
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:06,089
way that we could look at this and just

1378
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:12,510
keep the danger from redistribution from

1379
01:16:06,090 --> 01:16:16,290
all right unless Ginsburg so we I mean

1380
01:16:12,510 --> 01:16:18,870
we do have the are bits no as far as you

1381
01:16:16,290 --> 01:16:21,670
know signaling that a route has been

1382
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:23,769
redistributed in some way plus we have

1383
01:16:21,670 --> 01:16:26,110
the X bit to indicate that it's external

1384
01:16:23,770 --> 01:16:29,170
came from another protocol which could

1385
01:16:26,110 --> 01:16:32,130
be another ISS protocol instance that

1386
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:35,040
said I don't think the big danger with

1387
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:38,530
you know widespread redistribution has

1388
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:41,980
to do with you know the protocol itself

1389
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:44,440
not figuring out that this this

1390
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:46,540
particular route was redistributed it's

1391
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,969
that well you got redistribution on

1392
01:16:46,540 --> 01:16:51,400
router a and you got redistribution on

1393
01:16:48,970 --> 01:16:53,260
router in at the other end of the

1394
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:58,030
network and they get misconfigured and

1395
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:59,590
and yep go alright so I mean since there

1396
01:16:58,030 --> 01:17:01,660
seems to be a particular area of

1397
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:03,940
interest let me lose a sentence or two

1398
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:06,340
with the up-down beat we have everything

1399
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:10,540
that is enough to make that stuff work

1400
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:13,840
without Tom's point we know it yeah and

1401
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:15,730
then what more do you want this is like

1402
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:20,080
Goldilocks right I keep scratching my

1403
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:22,150
head but you're just admitting you're

1404
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,210
just admitting that you can make it work

1405
01:17:22,150 --> 01:17:28,179
for the tunnels at the only expense you

1406
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:33,250
may not take the optimal entry point

1407
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:35,980
into yeah well yes I that is a caveat

1408
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:37,300
which I mean we can argue now the paint

1409
01:17:35,980 --> 01:17:40,000
off the wall in graph theory if you

1410
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:41,440
start to abstract in any way there is no

1411
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,600
bloody way and that's what I tell people

1412
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:45,429
when they want te with absolute optimal

1413
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,920
they have to take the full topology into

1414
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:49,750
the controller flat make it flat and run

1415
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:54,160
the computation flat and that works as

1416
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:55,870
well but it has a cost right i I'm not a

1417
01:17:54,160 --> 01:17:57,940
magician that cannot abstract apology

1418
01:17:55,870 --> 01:17:59,890
and expose all the topology again right

1419
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:03,099
without actually even forklifting the

1420
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:04,600
protocol on top right yes so absolutely

1421
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:12,160
I mean there there we heated just hard

1422
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:14,020
boundary transcoder brief follow-up to

1423
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:17,980
Chris's point about redistricting

1424
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:20,230
redistributing yeah you can have

1425
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,509
everything you want all you have to do

1426
01:18:20,230 --> 01:18:25,089
is reinvent EGP please don't reinvent GC

1427
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:28,199
we've already got one don't count them

1428
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:33,380
they made they don't like BGP I already

1429
01:18:28,199 --> 01:18:37,138
that at the very beginning yet so I

1430
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:39,659
don't think this is as simple as you

1431
01:18:37,139 --> 01:18:41,159
make it sound well that's a feeling by

1432
01:18:39,659 --> 01:18:43,860
yours I'm here to talk technical reality

1433
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:46,768
so give you technical arguments please

1434
01:18:43,860 --> 01:18:49,199
so what simple is the protocol

1435
01:18:46,769 --> 01:18:51,809
extensions which are very minimal yeah

1436
01:18:49,199 --> 01:18:55,518
okay I think what gets to be complex is

1437
01:18:51,809 --> 01:18:57,389
is the implementation of the changes and

1438
01:18:55,519 --> 01:18:59,130
the deployment

1439
01:18:57,389 --> 01:19:00,900
well you haven't talked at all and I

1440
01:18:59,130 --> 01:19:05,039
don't I don't think you've talked at all

1441
01:19:00,900 --> 01:19:06,780
in the draft and granted its v-0 so you

1442
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,070
know there may be more coming but you

1443
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:10,259
haven't talked at all about the draft

1444
01:19:08,070 --> 01:19:12,090
about the population of the route

1445
01:19:10,260 --> 01:19:15,510
reflectors and the distribution of the

1446
01:19:12,090 --> 01:19:17,789
information to the clients and you just

1447
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:19,440
said well in which sense you mean

1448
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:21,840
because we don't modify flooding

1449
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:24,629
procedures at all there is nothing there

1450
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:26,340
to mention it just slots like L to flats

1451
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:29,849
there is no modification slotting

1452
01:19:26,340 --> 01:19:33,860
procedures who what so ever so again I

1453
01:19:29,849 --> 01:19:36,630
think you're talking about as far as

1454
01:19:33,860 --> 01:19:38,219
protocol extensions but that doesn't

1455
01:19:36,630 --> 01:19:40,320
mean that the code that's running inside

1456
01:19:38,219 --> 01:19:43,289
the boxes is the same I

1457
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:44,369
so what argument are you making that you

1458
01:19:43,289 --> 01:19:47,429
want the solution without any

1459
01:19:44,369 --> 01:19:48,808
implementation no I'm just saying you

1460
01:19:47,429 --> 01:19:52,139
know it's a little bit of false

1461
01:19:48,809 --> 01:19:55,019
advertising to say look I just all I did

1462
01:19:52,139 --> 01:19:57,150
was to find a tiny little TV so that

1463
01:19:55,019 --> 01:19:59,099
they less you are slandering right now I

1464
01:19:57,150 --> 01:20:01,170
don't hear a technical argument sorry

1465
01:19:59,099 --> 01:20:03,389
bring me a hard technical argument which

1466
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:05,519
is no disk right I'm just saying

1467
01:20:03,389 --> 01:20:07,769
putting kiss up there isn't a technical

1468
01:20:05,519 --> 01:20:09,599
argument either yeah okay I take that

1469
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:11,610
all right so that's advertisement I take

1470
01:20:09,599 --> 01:20:13,320
the keys yeah that's that's absolutely

1471
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:15,478
valid so let's drop the kiss but I think

1472
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:17,369
the draft tells you everything that is

1473
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:20,999
necessary to implement that stuff yes

1474
01:20:17,369 --> 01:20:23,159
SPF is modified we describe it okay

1475
01:20:20,999 --> 01:20:25,650
there's multiple solution actually to

1476
01:20:23,159 --> 01:20:27,268
implement it so you can modify SPF in

1477
01:20:25,650 --> 01:20:30,150
three or four different way so we just

1478
01:20:27,269 --> 01:20:33,769
outlined one way how we can implement it

1479
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:36,869
flooding procedures is zero modification

1480
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:39,539
literally otherwise you know we would be

1481
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:41,400
forklifting the tlvs can be ignored on

1482
01:20:39,539 --> 01:20:42,120
the outside safely actually even inside

1483
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:44,759
of you

1484
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:47,760
you implement local configuration knobs

1485
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:49,890
if you find holes more than happy you

1486
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,840
more you more than you know I have more

1487
01:20:49,890 --> 01:20:53,640
than happy to invite you to participate

1488
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:55,830
on the draft and then iron this stuff

1489
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:59,040
out or roll me the technical arguments

1490
01:20:55,830 --> 01:21:01,530
because I'm not foolproof we may have

1491
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:04,769
missed land hold that size we very

1492
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:07,950
confident we did but hey we know this is

1493
01:21:04,770 --> 01:21:11,630
arcane and very difficult art right so

1494
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:11,630
technical arguments more than welcome

1495
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:25,380
thank you was lively enough so yeah I

1496
01:21:24,060 --> 01:21:27,090
think at this point in time it wasn't

1497
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:36,710
hostile enough I think I'll call for

1498
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:40,310
adoption how many have read the draft

1499
01:21:36,710 --> 01:21:47,220
how many people understood the draft

1500
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:49,200
nine offers yeah I read but you didn't

1501
01:21:47,220 --> 01:21:51,650
unsigned it I'm appreciated more of it

1502
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:54,300
after I've seen the present every time I

1503
01:21:51,650 --> 01:21:55,769
appreciate a little more you know and

1504
01:21:54,300 --> 01:21:57,030
you thought I was just repeating what

1505
01:21:55,770 --> 01:21:59,220
you were saying I was making sure I

1506
01:21:57,030 --> 01:22:00,480
understood it yeah I mean people accuse

1507
01:21:59,220 --> 01:22:02,100
me that I've write too much so I've

1508
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:06,240
wrote less so now they accused me they

1509
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:08,670
didn't like so as AC mentioned a minute

1510
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:12,630
ago this is also working on the same

1511
01:22:08,670 --> 01:22:15,600
sort of problem so I like yeah I like

1512
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:17,460
the energy now can we take this energy

1513
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:21,090
to the list I don't think we should be

1514
01:22:17,460 --> 01:22:23,460
calling for adoption on any these drafts

1515
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:26,100
yet but if we could keep this energy

1516
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:29,610
going and maybe argue about the

1517
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:34,100
solutions on the list maybe we can read

1518
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:36,750
relook at the adoption idea next name

1519
01:22:34,100 --> 01:22:39,110
what do you think yeah I think that I

1520
01:22:36,750 --> 01:22:41,370
think that's a good thing

1521
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:43,950
hopefully we'll hear from like you had

1522
01:22:41,370 --> 01:22:47,550
said the operators on the requirement to

1523
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:49,710
do this there's also going at the same

1524
01:22:47,550 --> 01:22:53,760
time if we can get the flooding

1525
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:55,350
reduction if that's you know you know

1526
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,800
it's really mitigate mitigates the

1527
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,800
problem

1528
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:13,440
and I actually think that's less complex

1529
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:16,860
than these area abstractions for my

1530
01:23:13,440 --> 01:23:20,009
money the abstraction and the flooding

1531
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:24,900
reduction are orthogonal and both are

1532
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:29,490
necessary that's why they both use the

1533
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:31,410
same leader election no that's a common

1534
01:23:29,490 --> 01:23:35,610
useful mechanism I should have been

1535
01:23:31,410 --> 01:23:37,920
probably been in I was I I agree they're

1536
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:41,130
orthogonal I was just saying whether or

1537
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:45,450
not we need the area abstraction giving

1538
01:23:41,130 --> 01:23:48,540
the complexity and yours is you did drop

1539
01:23:45,450 --> 01:23:50,490
the kiss for the flood reflectors too I

1540
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:53,100
actually I actually think it would be

1541
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:54,179
good for your graph if you put the

1542
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,550
different you said there's four or five

1543
01:23:54,180 --> 01:23:58,740
ways if you put those alternatives and

1544
01:23:56,550 --> 01:24:01,410
how to do without the tunnels the

1545
01:23:58,740 --> 01:24:04,050
tunnels yeah okay keen as a working

1546
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:05,730
relation and then well you know I get to

1547
01:24:04,050 --> 01:24:07,920
stuff adopted where I run all this stuff

1548
01:24:05,730 --> 01:24:10,080
out if I don't get it adopted like I may

1549
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,940
as well just let it sit and expire thank

1550
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:14,550
you very much right so yeah I mean if

1551
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:16,679
that gets adopted yes that's perfect the

1552
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:19,200
other very very valid discussion is

1553
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:22,380
should we build hierarchies right which

1554
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:24,900
I killed but if well there's a certain

1555
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,370
runway that you get with this right if

1556
01:24:24,900 --> 01:24:28,259
you build hierarchy of road reflectors

1557
01:24:26,370 --> 01:24:30,090
it's pretty much in finite size but

1558
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:32,880
there's a certain size you can go with

1559
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:35,880
that we think the practical runways from

1560
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,370
what we saw is about you can 5x the

1561
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:40,530
scale though they already are insane

1562
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,580
scale so they get like 5x insane with

1563
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:43,230
something very simple without

1564
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:46,170
forklifting so that's pretty cool and

1565
01:24:43,230 --> 01:24:49,259
what we saw with that is that if you do

1566
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:51,450
this you put it on you pretty much need

1567
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,870
flood reduction right because that kills

1568
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:57,750
all this highly dense things right into

1569
01:24:54,870 --> 01:24:59,430
relatively simple stars like current

1570
01:24:57,750 --> 01:25:02,250
flooding is good enough as far as we saw

1571
01:24:59,430 --> 01:25:03,750
so yeah so absolutely we can work all

1572
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:05,100
this stuff out but you know there's only

1573
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:06,570
interest from our society we get the

1574
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:08,070
stuff adopted and you know we get enough

1575
01:25:06,570 --> 01:25:09,690
people to work on the stuff and chew

1576
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:11,190
through the details because you know

1577
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:13,500
we know we know this stuff we don't have

1578
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:15,419
to write it down right and then who

1579
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:17,550
cares if you don't care well then why

1580
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:20,040
should we put to work but that's neither

1581
01:25:17,550 --> 01:25:23,910
here there so I think I'm pretty much at

1582
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:29,400
the end of my spiel everybody woke up

1583
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:30,059
and now they can go back to snooze more

1584
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:34,559
questions

1585
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:36,630
uncertainties doubts flowers no

1586
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:41,100
chocolate nothing

1587
01:25:36,630 --> 01:25:49,290
the way this yeah all right good thanks

1588
01:25:41,100 --> 01:26:05,070
Tony here are we clubbing cuz he sat

1589
01:25:49,290 --> 01:26:27,210
down just such an odd reaction update

1590
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:29,219
the else are v6 in okay so I'm beer I'm

1591
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:32,280
going to change the subject a little bit

1592
01:26:29,219 --> 01:26:36,630
and I'm not going to talk about any

1593
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:38,370
tunnels or transit areas anymore so I'm

1594
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:44,370
going to give a quick update on the SR

1595
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:46,349
e6 the only change that happened to the

1596
01:26:44,370 --> 01:26:50,239
draft from the from the last version is

1597
01:26:46,350 --> 01:26:55,520
that we move the a flag from the locator

1598
01:26:50,239 --> 01:26:59,639
options or flags and we added it to the

1599
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,940
prefix attribute Flags because the

1600
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:06,120
prefix attribute TLV or subtly supported

1601
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:08,309
in inside the locator so there's no

1602
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:12,030
functional change we only moved it and

1603
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:13,830
we said I'll use the prefix attribute

1604
01:27:12,030 --> 01:27:18,210
like something away to advertise the a

1605
01:27:13,830 --> 01:27:21,510
bit we also specify what they beat

1606
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:24,150
should do we say that they should be

1607
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:27,090
preserved been leaked

1608
01:27:24,150 --> 01:27:29,070
we said that when the a flag is said the

1609
01:27:27,090 --> 01:27:31,320
influx should not be said on must not be

1610
01:27:29,070 --> 01:27:33,630
said and what what to do if it is said

1611
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:37,530
basically we ignore the inflate dates

1612
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:40,199
like he said and we also said that if

1613
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:41,849
there are multiple routers advertising

1614
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:44,159
the prefix or locator and one

1615
01:27:41,849 --> 01:27:46,409
advertising the I flag the other one

1616
01:27:44,159 --> 01:27:51,179
doesn't we should consider the prefix or

1617
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:53,070
locator to be any caste anyway so that's

1618
01:27:51,179 --> 01:27:56,730
the only change in the draft from the

1619
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:58,170
previous version the document has been

1620
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,780
pretty stable there are multiple

1621
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:04,260
implementations question is is this

1622
01:28:00,780 --> 01:28:07,349
ready for Alaska so that's something the

1623
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:19,289
outers believe could be at that state at

1624
01:28:07,349 --> 01:28:22,079
the moment I think we will I think a

1625
01:28:19,289 --> 01:28:24,059
good thing to do would be to start a

1626
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:26,308
dialogue just ask if everybody's read

1627
01:28:24,059 --> 01:28:30,570
this something already for last call I'd

1628
01:28:26,309 --> 01:28:32,489
like I'd like you'd be good to - you

1629
01:28:30,570 --> 01:28:36,599
could have to be removed at publication

1630
01:28:32,489 --> 01:28:37,289
at this implementation status - the

1631
01:28:36,599 --> 01:28:39,539
draft

1632
01:28:37,289 --> 01:28:42,809
yeah yeah me just say just to get an

1633
01:28:39,539 --> 01:28:45,440
idea okay a people who are willing to

1634
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:52,380
let it know that they've implemented

1635
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:54,000
okay and I haven't read the recent

1636
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:55,770
version I don't think I've read it for

1637
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,900
about a year so I wonder I think and

1638
01:28:55,770 --> 01:29:01,260
Chris you read it recently I did read

1639
01:28:57,900 --> 01:29:03,449
the Deaf yeah okay yeah I want to read

1640
01:29:01,260 --> 01:29:07,079
it from start describe the only thing

1641
01:29:03,449 --> 01:29:08,820
between it was the structure sub TLV

1642
01:29:07,079 --> 01:29:11,910
analysis so we'll have a ready for

1643
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:14,389
working class or a class call call

1644
01:29:11,910 --> 01:29:15,869
[Music]

1645
01:29:14,389 --> 01:29:18,239
sounds good

1646
01:29:15,869 --> 01:29:19,889
yeah so why don't you put the why don't

1647
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:22,049
you put the implementation status in and

1648
01:29:19,889 --> 01:29:24,510
then like we're like a t mentioned

1649
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:26,820
earlier just send it a public thing

1650
01:29:24,510 --> 01:29:34,250
requesting last call and then we'll do

1651
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:34,250
it okay will do okay so you're next

1652
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:54,000
[Applause]

1653
01:29:54,600 --> 01:30:03,040
okay so the next is Theodore the flags

1654
01:29:58,420 --> 01:30:04,750
all go draft so there are two changes in

1655
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:08,519
the draft from the previous version

1656
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:14,850
first days more mechanical change where

1657
01:30:08,520 --> 01:30:17,560
previously in the eye size and OSPF

1658
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:20,230
application Ling attributes draft there

1659
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:23,410
was an axpy which means the application

1660
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:25,809
is flex I'll go we basically took that

1661
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:27,639
bit out of that draft and moved it and

1662
01:30:25,810 --> 01:30:29,740
define the bit with the exactly same

1663
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:32,560
semantics in the Flex I'll go draft

1664
01:30:29,740 --> 01:30:34,300
there's no functional change the reason

1665
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:37,930
we did this is because we didn't want to

1666
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:41,680
have the dependency of the Oslo drafts

1667
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:44,170
the the the application link attribute

1668
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:46,540
drafts on the Flex Haggadah itself so

1669
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:54,910
that's why we moved a bit to the Flex of

1670
01:30:46,540 --> 01:30:56,820
the raft and we discovered one one

1671
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:58,900
problem in the in the Flex algo

1672
01:30:56,820 --> 01:31:00,880
specification which we are now trying to

1673
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:03,429
fix in the Indus revision of the draft

1674
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:07,660
so here I give you an example where we

1675
01:31:03,430 --> 01:31:09,550
have two two areas or domains and if you

1676
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:13,599
have the right one in the left one so we

1677
01:31:09,550 --> 01:31:16,930
have the prefix 1/1 1/32 and here are

1678
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:19,990
the links with the metric IGP metric of

1679
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:22,270
10 and flexible metric which could be

1680
01:31:19,990 --> 01:31:24,910
delay or anything else being hungry and

1681
01:31:22,270 --> 01:31:29,590
the definition of the alga says remove

1682
01:31:24,910 --> 01:31:32,260
any languages which is red so what would

1683
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:34,810
happen and there's no link between the

1684
01:31:32,260 --> 01:31:36,000
r2 and r3 in any of those domains or

1685
01:31:34,810 --> 01:31:39,160
areas

1686
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:41,610
so what P r2 and r3 routers would do

1687
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:44,410
they would advertise the prefix and

1688
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:46,530
without so in the previous version of

1689
01:31:44,410 --> 01:31:50,190
the draft we define what we call a flag

1690
01:31:46,530 --> 01:31:53,969
a specific metric of Luxardo prefix

1691
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:56,940
metric even without this basically what

1692
01:31:53,969 --> 01:32:00,090
happens is that the r1 will still

1693
01:31:56,940 --> 01:32:03,030
believe he can reach the the prefix 1 1

1694
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:07,230
1 1 in a flex I'll go hundred 28 yr -

1695
01:32:03,030 --> 01:32:09,690
but r2 because the link he has in the

1696
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:11,218
right area it's not participating or

1697
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:13,558
he's excluded from the from the

1698
01:32:11,219 --> 01:32:15,750
calculation he would actually calculate

1699
01:32:13,559 --> 01:32:20,579
the past via the left area and there we

1700
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:23,219
have a loop so we defined as I said the

1701
01:32:20,579 --> 01:32:25,530
Flex I'll go specific metric previously

1702
01:32:23,219 --> 01:32:27,420
but even that doesn't solve the problem

1703
01:32:25,530 --> 01:32:31,619
because the previous version of the

1704
01:32:27,420 --> 01:32:33,690
graph says if you if the advertisement

1705
01:32:31,619 --> 01:32:36,360
of the prefix doesn't have the Flex all

1706
01:32:33,690 --> 01:32:39,150
got specific metric fall back to the IGP

1707
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:40,949
metric so the r1 would still believe

1708
01:32:39,150 --> 01:32:43,769
that there is actually even a better

1709
01:32:40,949 --> 01:32:46,320
pass why r2 because the IGP metric is

1710
01:32:43,770 --> 01:32:48,420
lower and would cause a loop again the

1711
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:51,329
problem really is we have no way of

1712
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:54,449
saying or we had no way of saying don't

1713
01:32:51,329 --> 01:32:56,900
use me for flex I'll go under 28 pass

1714
01:32:54,449 --> 01:32:59,308
but you can use me for alga zero pass

1715
01:32:56,900 --> 01:33:01,019
because the reach ability is basically

1716
01:32:59,309 --> 01:33:04,289
taken from the algal zero and that's why

1717
01:33:01,020 --> 01:33:07,739
the prefix is advertised so to fix that

1718
01:33:04,289 --> 01:33:11,130
problem what we say is that when the ABR

1719
01:33:07,739 --> 01:33:13,230
or SBR advertises or redistribute or

1720
01:33:11,130 --> 01:33:15,510
leaks the prefix between the areas or

1721
01:33:13,230 --> 01:33:18,780
levels it must set the Flex August

1722
01:33:15,510 --> 01:33:21,360
Pacific metric and then anyone computing

1723
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:24,119
the destination for flex I'll go for the

1724
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:26,699
prefix must use this flex all go

1725
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:29,030
specific metric and if the prefix

1726
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:32,519
doesn't have it is basically unreachable

1727
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:33,719
so this way we kind of make the

1728
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:35,820
announcement of the reachability

1729
01:33:33,719 --> 01:33:38,639
parallel go well obviously this only

1730
01:33:35,820 --> 01:33:41,789
works if the algo has the plugs algo

1731
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:45,840
prefix metric as it's one of its part of

1732
01:33:41,789 --> 01:33:47,579
the flags algo definition so that way we

1733
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,800
fix the problem the question is what do

1734
01:33:47,579 --> 01:33:52,308
we do if we don't use the Flex algo

1735
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:55,139
prefix metric as a flexible definition

1736
01:33:52,309 --> 01:33:57,690
attribute in that way it what the draft

1737
01:33:55,139 --> 01:33:59,890
says is it's not recommended to use it

1738
01:33:57,690 --> 01:34:03,309
for inter area inter domain

1739
01:33:59,890 --> 01:34:06,190
switch ability because it can actually

1740
01:34:03,310 --> 01:34:08,740
cause loops or like holes if people feel

1741
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:10,660
this is not strong enough language we

1742
01:34:08,740 --> 01:34:13,059
can even say we are not allowed to

1743
01:34:10,660 --> 01:34:15,490
compute the inter domain or inter area

1744
01:34:13,060 --> 01:34:17,590
pass if if we don't use the Flex

1745
01:34:15,490 --> 01:34:21,340
soccer-specific metric it's up to the

1746
01:34:17,590 --> 01:34:22,930
you know the discussion I'm open for the

1747
01:34:21,340 --> 01:34:26,170
suggestion which which way people want

1748
01:34:22,930 --> 01:34:28,600
to go but basically we have to somehow

1749
01:34:26,170 --> 01:34:31,600
let people know that without these

1750
01:34:28,600 --> 01:34:37,120
mechanism it makes really cause some of

1751
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:42,450
these issues just a second here let me

1752
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:48,760
restate that so the advantage of not

1753
01:34:42,450 --> 01:34:51,370
doing a hard prohibition of this is you

1754
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:54,880
could use flex algorithm within one area

1755
01:34:51,370 --> 01:34:57,190
but still forward the prefix through

1756
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,140
other areas using the default right

1757
01:34:57,190 --> 01:35:03,969
that's the advantage and but but the

1758
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:05,590
problem is in certain topology somewhat

1759
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:08,080
pathological with this kind of

1760
01:35:05,590 --> 01:35:10,270
configuration you could have loosed yes

1761
01:35:08,080 --> 01:35:12,460
that's the issue is you don't know

1762
01:35:10,270 --> 01:35:14,950
whether the ABR is being has the reach

1763
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:20,080
ability for the prefix for that

1764
01:35:14,950 --> 01:35:23,010
algorithm itself okay so those are the

1765
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,450
two changes we made implementations are

1766
01:35:23,010 --> 01:35:29,290
already available we are continue to

1767
01:35:25,450 --> 01:35:37,870
enhance them so I'm not asking for last

1768
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:42,490
call yet so Tony P juniper hey Peter so

1769
01:35:37,870 --> 01:35:46,059
I think even if you forward between the

1770
01:35:42,490 --> 01:35:48,849
the inter area default you may still end

1771
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:50,530
up looping because you cannot mix and

1772
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:53,710
match right if before default between

1773
01:35:50,530 --> 01:35:56,530
inter area it realized that it brings it

1774
01:35:53,710 --> 01:35:58,840
on you know some exit which is based on

1775
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:02,889
shortest metrics when it brings in to

1776
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,960
funny you know out which uses default

1777
01:36:02,890 --> 01:36:06,820
again you may end up in a loop but I

1778
01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:09,010
need a napkin to go and draw her a draw

1779
01:36:06,820 --> 01:36:11,980
around the stuff it's just you know you

1780
01:36:09,010 --> 01:36:13,960
can't take shortest path and start to

1781
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:15,610
mix it you know which

1782
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:16,930
what you choose in which part of

1783
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:18,549
topology and hope that this thing

1784
