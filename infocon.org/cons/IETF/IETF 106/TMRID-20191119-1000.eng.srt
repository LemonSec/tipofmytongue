1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:01:11,870
yeah we're gonna give people a couple of

2
00:00:07,069 --> 00:01:14,900
minutes so as soon as I recover my

3
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:17,500
culture will be starting he should be

4
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,500
bugging mommy

5
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,919
[Music]

6
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,869
[Music]

7
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:42,209
thank you to get coffee with a human to

8
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:44,010
get coffee would be yeah I mean if you

9
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:45,269
get to sign the blue sheets in the

10
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:57,510
meantime that'd be perfect

11
00:02:45,269 --> 00:03:05,720
yeah thank you okay we can get started

12
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:08,310
then I'll I'll go on find him okay um

13
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,440
yes okay get a seat and we can get

14
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,260
started and at some point Daniel will be

15
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,950
back so welcome to to the trash forty

16
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:19,590
multi-purpose remote ID both as you know

17
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,660
this is uh I mean officially czar

18
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,299
working group forming both I guess or

19
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:26,670
working group recharging so the idea is

20
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,320
that you know if we agreed to do this we

21
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,570
will think I mean we will talk to really

22
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,340
can decide whether we want to retire hip

23
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,230
or create a new working group or

24
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:36,000
something but that's not basically so

25
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,500
important so let's focus on you know

26
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,690
agreeing on a charter and having in

27
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,130
discussions the way we're going to run

28
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,709
the session is like we will have three

29
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,359
presentations and we already talked to

30
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:48,780
them but we will try to limit some how

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,430
they each slot to 15 minutes roughly you

32
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,950
know 15 20 minutes don't go over that

33
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,709
and after that we will go into the QA

34
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,358
and under discussions if you have any

35
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,609
clarifying questions during the

36
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,520
presentations feel free to go and ask if

37
00:03:59,609 --> 00:04:02,230
you have more

38
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,210
discussion let's you know hold them till

39
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:06,579
the end so that we can have the

40
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,050
presentations get you guys to be exposed

41
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,750
to all the material they have prepared

42
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:12,730
and and then you know just have the

43
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,590
discussions afterwards but if anything

44
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,690
is like clarifying something is that

45
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,019
clear just feel free to interrupt the

46
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,420
speakers then at the end bob has put

47
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:24,240
together a charter because the idea of

48
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,520
this type of both is to basically agree

49
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,140
somewhat on a charter so we will be

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,010
projecting it at the end and I'm

51
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,150
thinking about that and again

52
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,400
summarizing what are the main decision

53
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,020
points here would be to agree if this is

54
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,880
a problem just so that I get you

55
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,560
thinking to the about the questions that

56
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,020
we will be asking at the end if this

57
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,520
problem is worth solving if it's worth

58
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,320
basically you know working on on this

59
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,570
problem if the constraints that we're

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,860
going to be defining make sense and you

61
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,930
will be the constraints basically

62
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:55,630
defined I mean in their presentations

63
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,790
the scope and then I will be asking the

64
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,170
the presenters also and the room if

65
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,420
there's people that they are willing to

66
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,130
put cycles on that so we make sure that

67
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:05,620
this enough energy that's one of the

68
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,740
explicit questions we got from our ad so

69
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:12,280
I will be asking that okay so now I got

70
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:14,440
Daniel back and we can we can start

71
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,299
basically officially on the note world

72
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,130
so if you are not familiar with a note

73
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,720
world you should go off and and read the

74
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,670
note well and they and the links the

75
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,180
references and this meeting is governed

76
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:26,890
by by the note well and this is the

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:29,080
agenda we put together as I said three

78
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,000
speakers roughly 15 minutes each and

79
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,810
then we will go into Q&A on discussions

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:39,970
okay so without further delay we will go

81
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:41,800
into the first deck and as bob was

82
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,020
saying please you know stand close to

83
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,520
the pink cross so that they can pick you

84
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,520
up with a camera

85
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,609
he will way to a full screen in a second

86
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,700
that's it

87
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,050
hi I'm Stu and I'm a 20 some-odd your

88
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,850
email list participant in some IETF

89
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,370
activities but a total newb before

90
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:32,750
actually being here in person so forgive

91
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:34,520
me and correct me if I stray so the

92
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,410
subtitle here extending locator

93
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,150
identifier split and strongly dedication

94
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,410
techniques to identify physically nearby

95
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:42,049
objects you'll notice it doesn't say

96
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:44,240
anything at all about unmanned aircraft

97
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,600
systems unmanned aircraft systems are

98
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,160
the motivating first use case but I mean

99
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,350
the general problem is I encounter this

100
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,390
object in the physical world and I have

101
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,730
some reason for believing that it or a

102
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:58,880
proxy for it is on the Internet

103
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:00,890
how do I figure out which it that it is

104
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,719
so that I can begin communicating with

105
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:08,990
it or its proxy or whatever so talk

106
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,540
about the UAS problem we need to somehow

107
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,270
identify these aircraft they're small

108
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,770
they're not fast compared to a jet

109
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:18,740
airplane but they're fast compared to

110
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,680
how big they are and they're fast

111
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,280
compared to the distances at which you

112
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,960
can see them hear them receive short

113
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:29,000
wavelength radio transmissions from them

114
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,430
etc which means they can close the

115
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,500
distance to you really rapidly from the

116
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,050
first point where an audio-based

117
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,030
detection system for drones can detect a

118
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:40,370
drone and it's been optimized to be able

119
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:45,109
to hear it at range until when it's on

120
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,570
you is a matter of maybe 15 seconds if

121
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,450
it's flying full-out so if somebody is

122
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,550
malicious this is clearly a problem or

123
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,190
if somebody is merely incompetent it's

124
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:57,200
it's a problem the language that's

125
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:59,230
developed in the in the industry to talk

126
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:01,630
about the operators is

127
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:04,720
the clueless the careless and the

128
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:06,790
criminal right the clueless guy doesn't

129
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,040
know that he shouldn't be flying at

130
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,680
Gatwick um

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,810
the careless guy knows that he wouldn't

132
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,490
shouldn't be flying at Gatwick when he

133
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,130
doesn't care he figures uh who's gonna

134
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:20,230
notice I'll get away with it um and then

135
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,450
the criminal guy he's there because he

136
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,400
intends to do harm the criminal guy I

137
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:28,120
believe I still have enough faith in

138
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:30,130
human nature is in the vast minority but

139
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:34,380
even if he didn't exist we got a problem

140
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:36,939
with the the clueless and the careless

141
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,320
remote operation you know everybody's

142
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,240
used to the little joystick controller

143
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,919
for the guy who's flying in the park but

144
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,330
you know we've slept Bell te modems on

145
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,449
these things which by the way is mostly

146
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:49,750
illegal ah and at that point you can fly

147
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:51,220
them twelve thousand miles away so this

148
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,570
talk will be a little bit United States

149
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,010
centric because you know those are the

150
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,330
people who are paying me to do this work

151
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,180
and that's what I'm most familiar with

152
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,070
but the FAA in the u.s. is just one

153
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:02,859
example of a Civil Aviation Authority

154
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,720
and all the cia's worldwide are worrying

155
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,070
about this problem FAA is gonna do a

156
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,440
notice we're poles rulemaking this

157
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,760
December they want to do

158
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,760
performance-based standards they've

159
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,970
turned to ASTM International as a

160
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,140
consensus-based

161
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,360
industry standards development

162
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:19,449
organization to develop how this will be

163
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,070
done I was at the ASTM meeting two weeks

164
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:25,270
ago where we passed a standard that

165
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:27,310
doesn't answer the mail it is cool as so

166
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:30,880
far as it goes it's got two modes of

167
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:32,739
operation Network remote ID uses the

168
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,660
internet to get information from the

169
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,220
aircraft or a proxy for the aircraft

170
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,050
which might just be the operators

171
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,790
cellphone where he goes to a web-based

172
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:41,770
forum and says I'm gonna operate in this

173
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:43,689
airspace volume from this time hack to

174
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,670
that time hack but somehow over the

175
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,430
internet I can find out who's in this

176
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,050
airspace Val I'm in a particular time

177
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:51,760
broadcast remote ID is an actual

178
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,620
transmission from the aircraft to the

179
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,110
ground so I can take my phone or my

180
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,330
tablet and receive it and get a beacon

181
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,950
from this thing who is it but the

182
00:09:58,330 --> 00:10:01,830
initial ASTM standard falls woefully

183
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:05,470
short in making the information

184
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:08,740
immediately actionable first off I can

185
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,850
just assert I am Adam stone there's no

186
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,310
signature there's no verification

187
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,610
there's there's no basis for trust what

188
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,649
so

189
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,779
in the ASTM standard they do have a so

190
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,519
called authentication message format but

191
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:21,429
it doesn't really tell you how to do

192
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,040
authentication which is kind of cool

193
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:27,339
because that gives us a foot in the door

194
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,980
right it gives the ITF an opportunity to

195
00:10:27,339 --> 00:10:31,299
write some complimentary standards based

196
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,759
upon the much greater knowledge of

197
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:35,920
cryptographic protocols here in this SDL

198
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:38,230
then in that SDL which is more concerned

199
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:41,049
with strengthen materials to solve this

200
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:43,089
problem secondly there's no way to know

201
00:10:41,049 --> 00:10:45,249
whether the operator is trusted if the

202
00:10:43,089 --> 00:10:47,649
observer lacks Internet connectivity I

203
00:10:45,249 --> 00:10:48,879
got this ID I'm looking at it I go ok

204
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,629
it's drone number one two three four

205
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,949
five is that a guy who's well trained

206
00:10:52,629 --> 00:10:55,360
and is allowed to be flying near the

207
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:57,189
nuclear reactor to make sure that it's

208
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,449
not leaking or is that some hobbyist

209
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:00,269
who's flying near the nuclear reactor

210
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:02,469
because he thinks it's fun

211
00:11:00,269 --> 00:11:04,449
also there's no way to instantly

212
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,279
communicate with the operator and say I

213
00:11:04,449 --> 00:11:08,229
need to get this guy to exit this

214
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,239
airspace volume or land right now I need

215
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:13,480
to communicate with him immediately it's

216
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:14,860
not built-in so anyway the problem comes

217
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,569
from the fact that aviators tend to be

218
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:18,910
familiar with radio comms but not with

219
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:22,029
the middle layers of networking so IETF

220
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:25,350
could bring a lot to bear here we think

221
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:28,029
that hip can help DNS can help the whole

222
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:30,220
registry process probably with our DAP

223
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:31,869
rather than who is could help we need to

224
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:34,749
strengthen authentication but also

225
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:36,279
balance operator privacy right you don't

226
00:11:34,749 --> 00:11:37,989
want the little old lady next door who

227
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,629
hears the buzzing sound and doesn't like

228
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:42,639
it to have remote ID as a way of

229
00:11:40,629 --> 00:11:44,169
identifying and harassing an operator

230
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,329
who's doing something is perfectly legal

231
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:47,829
and legitimate but when a public safety

232
00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:49,779
or security person needs to identify

233
00:11:47,829 --> 00:11:52,809
that operator and talk to them and say

234
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,269
you got to land then there needs to be a

235
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:56,860
way to present credentials you know to

236
00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:00,129
our dap for instance and then pull that

237
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,629
information that makes that possible we

238
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:03,089
think it can be generalized to support

239
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:05,199
lots of other applications and

240
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,610
fundamentally we think that this mapping

241
00:12:05,199 --> 00:12:08,169
of an unmanned aircrafts physical

242
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,660
location to an unmanned aircrafts

243
00:12:08,169 --> 00:12:13,600
identity is kind of isomorphic to an

244
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:14,949
inverse problem of a host logical

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,709
location in the internet an IP address

246
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:19,359
to a host ID which is why we've done

247
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:20,649
some work with him we have actually

248
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,809
prototyped and flown a hip based

249
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:25,119
extension to the open joint ID at the

250
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:26,000
New York State UAS test site so I'm

251
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:27,500
going to go a lot quicker and

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:41,900
remaining slides how much time they

253
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:44,030
already burned thank you okay anyway so

254
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,709
obviously remote ID is critical for

255
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,780
unmanned aerial system traffic

256
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:50,000
management you see it you want to know

257
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:52,850
who it is from that you can look up all

258
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,050
kinds of other stuff lots of different

259
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:55,760
entities need it for lots of different

260
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:58,099
reasons you know the first question is

261
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,720
can i ID this guy if I can't ID him then

262
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,420
unidentified is an important attribute

263
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,260
that might go into further decisions if

264
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,510
I can ID him

265
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:07,400
is heat askable can I ask him to go over

266
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:09,680
there and take video for me to a better

267
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,329
look of the building on fire or is he

268
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,250
just a low concern because I can't task

269
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,080
him but I can at least ask him to be

270
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,970
cooperative from a safety perspective or

271
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,170
is he an aircraft of high concern I mean

272
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,490
maybe he's the one who set the building

273
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:24,829
on fire the ASTM standard uses various

274
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:27,800
internet media to do your Mon ID

275
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:29,930
typically B LTE there's a network Ridd

276
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,640
service provider that gathers data from

277
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,829
all the sources and then there's a

278
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:35,150
network redisplay provider that is where

279
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,380
you point your web browser to if you

280
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:38,750
want to find out who's flying in this

281
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,220
airspace volume right now they can be

282
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,750
co-located and they can be the same

283
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,120
corporate entity running them or not and

284
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:47,000
a so-called UAS service of supplier

285
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:50,120
which is a big part of this new UTM a

286
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,860
UAS traffic management system is it does

287
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,580
other jobs but it's going to do this job

288
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,170
as well

289
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:56,180
broadcasts and what ideas the much

290
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:59,240
harder problem they started out with the

291
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,430
idea that you're your average volunteer

292
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,160
fireman needs to be able to go to a

293
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:05,810
scene and see an aircraft and be able to

294
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,790
identify it which means we're not going

295
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,880
to equip him with a special radio or

296
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:12,079
whatever he's gonna phone which meant

297
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,420
they decided that we got to be able to

298
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:16,850
do this with Wi-Fi neighbor awareness

299
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:19,310
networking and Bluetooth five and to my

300
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,040
chagrin also a Bluetooth 4 which really

301
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,680
constrains the physical range and the

302
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,670
packet size so we're just using the

303
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,439
beacons basically so we can extend this

304
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,319
once you've got ID to vehicle the

305
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,440
vehicle vehicle to infrastructure etc

306
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,550
can be used to keep these things

307
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,650
separated

308
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,120
safe distances and we can even do

309
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,770
support payload coms and we've

310
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,700
experimented with a lot of this at the

311
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:47,079
UAS test site Internet Protocol is like

312
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:52,930
a lot of issues when you try to use them

313
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:54,340
for airborne comms and you know but

314
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:55,780
fortunately we're likely to have

315
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:58,510
multiple radios if it's a big aircraft

316
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:00,010
and so we can take advantage of having

317
00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:01,390
those multiple radios but each of those

318
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:04,180
radios it's got lots of link layer

319
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,350
issues cryptographic handshakes are a

320
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,180
big problem because you got little

321
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,920
processors not much processing power and

322
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,510
you know two aircraft that pass in the

323
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,520
night have got a very brief radio

324
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,970
contact window - to do these handshakes

325
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,949
before they move their actual traffic

326
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:19,060
and then you've got the whole

327
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,490
aggregating information you know if

328
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,560
Amazon can watch Walmart's delivery

329
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,980
drones and vice versa then they can

330
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,420
infer things about their businesses so

331
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,890
the first mitigation that we've applied

332
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,300
for command and control is just to take

333
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:34,720
advantage of multiple wireless links

334
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,949
that brings a lot of benefits all these

335
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,320
slides are available so I'm not going to

336
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:39,640
waste a lot of time on each of them

337
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,560
second mitigation is strong identity

338
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,850
based security now a big aircraft has a

339
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,869
tail number on it you know you look at

340
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:45,220
it sitting there on the runway and it

341
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,900
says you know n one two three four five

342
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:48,280
on the back of the aircraft problem is

343
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,959
if the aircraft is this big and it's a

344
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,970
few hundred feet away you can't read

345
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:55,530
that number plus they're allowed to put

346
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,940
it inside the battery compartment so

347
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,140
obviously an aircraft's an aircraft a

348
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,400
low number doesn't change when it hands

349
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,430
off from base station to base station to

350
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,449
base station its IP address does so this

351
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,030
is one of the things that drove us to

352
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:08,710
hip we'll come back to hit more later

353
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,140
for right now I just want to say that

354
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:14,200
you know it buys us a lot of things for

355
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:16,030
this application so this is you know

356
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,740
this is an aerial shot of where we do

357
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,560
some of this test work at the New York

358
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:22,390
UAS test site we've actually maintained

359
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,329
positive command and control using hip

360
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:26,980
where you flew outside a Wi-Fi range you

361
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,420
just rolled over to LTE you got back

362
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:31,210
within Wi-Fi range you rolled back over

363
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,870
to Wi-Fi remote pilot never even knew

364
00:16:31,210 --> 00:16:37,210
the difference our approach to unmanned

365
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,620
aerial system remote ID is to adopt and

366
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:39,940
extend existing standards and there's a

367
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,960
whole boatload of different standard

368
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,740
setting bodies involved the

369
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,650
International Civil Aviation

370
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,690
Organization the radio technical

371
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:48,640
Commission for aviation the various

372
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:49,800
civil aviation authorities including

373
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,600
here in the United well

374
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,859
we're not here including where I live in

375
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:58,019
the United States the FAA the FAA has

376
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,880
said that they're gonna cite this ASTM

377
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:01,260
while it was draft when I created this

378
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,450
slide now it's a standard as of two

379
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:04,679
weeks ago but security in the threat

380
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,809
model are still be not addressed in the

381
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,240
draft so I've made myself very unpopular

382
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:11,160
in ASTM by saying hey you need to bring

383
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,569
in the IETF here because these guys

384
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,610
understand how to do cryptographic

385
00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:19,379
protocols which ASTM that's not really

386
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:21,300
one of their strengths so again the

387
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,130
forward problem of host ID to logical

388
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:25,050
location is similar to the inverse

389
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:28,079
problem of mapping physical location to

390
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:29,879
a UAS ID so we think we could use hip

391
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,770
and some other IETF standardized

392
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:36,140
protocols as adjuncts to the ASTM

393
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,480
standard if the observer has got

394
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:41,490
Internet connectivity and the pilot has

395
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,270
got Internet connectivity then we could

396
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:44,300
do a one-button

397
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:47,850
I need to talk to the pilot right now

398
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:49,440
and if the observer doesn't have

399
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:51,540
internet connectivity but he's got a

400
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:54,480
database on his device not of all the

401
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,980
aircraft but of all the registries then

402
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,780
with an extension to hit that Bob is

403
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,740
proposing hierarchical host identity

404
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:04,200
tags I don't know Adam but I know that

405
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,850
Adam is in I don't know the Department

406
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,890
of Homeland Security's registry and

407
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:09,899
because he's in DHS is registry I can

408
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,880
say yes Adam is allowed to fly at this

409
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,470
emergency site unlike the hobbyist who's

410
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,960
in the registry that's used by everybody

411
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:19,980
who buys the drone at Walmart I think

412
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,230
this is it for my first I go here's the

413
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:25,559
last slide for them for my first part of

414
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:28,050
the deck over on the Left we've got the

415
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:29,730
case where there is Internet

416
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:31,620
connectivity so the observer sees the

417
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:34,740
aircraft he receives his Bluetooth

418
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,620
broadcast with a remote ID he does some

419
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:40,500
lookups he figures out who this guy is

420
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,850
he presses the button that says hey mr.

421
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,110
pilot even though it was entirely

422
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,459
legitimate for you to fly in this

423
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:46,139
airspace at the time you filed your

424
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,940
flight plan well now there's a building

425
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,900
on fire underneath that airspace please

426
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:55,559
get out and then this second case here

427
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:58,740
over on the right the observer doesn't

428
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:00,990
have internet connectivity but he does

429
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,490
have this database of registries and you

430
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,180
can see that this guy is not in a

431
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,850
registry

432
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,530
of trusted operators so at a minimum

433
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,090
although he may not be able to

434
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,040
communicate with the pilot he at least

435
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,439
knows that this is an aircraft of

436
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:24,000
concern that he's gonna have to do

437
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:25,710
whatever it is he does so yeah okay so I

438
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,730
guess I should wrap up with with with

439
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:31,260
this slide my two keywords are UAS

440
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,910
remote ID information must be

441
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,379
immediately actionable I've got to be

442
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:37,110
able to trust it it's real not that it's

443
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:39,390
being spoofed if there's any way to have

444
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:41,100
communications with the guy who can land

445
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,600
that aircraft or exit this airspace

446
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:44,669
volume I want to be able to do that

447
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,020
instantly not by looking at a screen

448
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,310
calling a phone number

449
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:51,900
the guy doesn't answer the phone because

450
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:53,639
he's flying a plane right and we want to

451
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,110
know whether the operator is trusted and

452
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,720
yet somehow we've got to maintain

453
00:19:55,110 --> 00:20:00,199
privacy when it hasn't been forfeited by

454
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,460
clueless careless or criminal action and

455
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:04,830
we believe that there are several

456
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,450
protocols within ITF land that can

457
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,100
complement the SDM stuff to make this

458
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:10,560
happen

459
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:13,230
standards and IIST in ASTM are going to

460
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:16,159
need two minor tweaks there's a UAS

461
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,330
remote ID type it is either type 1 a

462
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:20,160
manufacturer serial number when the

463
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:21,929
thing came from the factory or type 2 a

464
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,610
number that was assigned by the FAA or

465
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,230
other Civil Aviation Authority and

466
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,740
whatever jurisdiction you're in static

467
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,520
okay

468
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:31,710
enabling correlation attacks or three

469
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,240
it's a UTM assigned ID which in

470
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,160
principle could be dynamic but all of

471
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,130
them today are static we want them to

472
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:39,870
assign type 4 probably a hierarchical

473
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:41,550
host identity tag that's are going in

474
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,169
position now people here in the room

475
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,240
know enough law about enough lot of

476
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,010
other protocols that may bring something

477
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,900
to help solve this problem all I've been

478
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,310
able to find that's able to fit nice

479
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,630
little tiny Bluetooth packets and

480
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:54,360
provide the trust properties that we

481
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,420
need is hid but there may be things less

482
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:59,189
I see if they could help the other tweak

483
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:01,440
we need is there's just a parameter

484
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,270
that's 5 and it needs to be 10 in terms

485
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,010
of how many segments a message can be

486
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,300
segmented into and that'll make it big

487
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,300
enough that we can put a really really

488
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:11,760
short host identity tag certificate of

489
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:14,010
which registry you're registered in into

490
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,740
one of these short messages we're going

491
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,720
to be more

492
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,700
on the ietf side we need to bring more

493
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,980
modern crypto to hip which i will talk

494
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:22,750
about we need to have hierarchical host

495
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,760
identity tags in hip which Bob will talk

496
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:27,520
about and we need to look at what we can

497
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:28,840
do in DNS for stuff that any member of

498
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,030
the public should be able to look up and

499
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,699
what we could do in the registry system

500
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:35,740
with our DAP for things that only duly

501
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,179
constituted authority can look up when

502
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,600
they present their credentials that's my

503
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:43,570
time

504
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:48,969
thanks that was locked out yeah yeah

505
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:51,100
Eric so you said you made yourself

506
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:53,380
unpopular by pointing out that they need

507
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,490
some help do they have they gotten to

508
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:58,470
the point that they would appreciate

509
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,470
help from the ITF at this point or not

510
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:03,750
there is one chairman who remains to be

511
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,980
convinced but those who actually

512
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:10,260
produced the standard that was just

513
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:13,630
approved they appreciate it when they

514
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,010
started trying to add trust I mean they

515
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:16,420
didn't they didn't take it going in

516
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,740
position of all you know just gonna

517
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,330
assert claims and they are what they are

518
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,740
they wanted to have this thing

519
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:22,960
trustworthy but they just couldn't

520
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:24,910
figure out how to make signatures short

521
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,650
enough and how to make certificates

522
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:30,070
short enough they would fit in these

523
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:31,480
tiny little Bluetooth 4 pilots and when

524
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,220
we came to them and said yeah we can get

525
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:34,480
that done they're like we're thrilled

526
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,650
but why didn't you come to the party 6

527
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:39,120
months earlier so that could have been

528
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:43,300
in version one of the standard Thank You

529
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:47,949
Barbara stark AT&T this sounds pretty

530
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:50,110
rational um but I'm curious you didn't

531
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,000
list CTA which is another player in this

532
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,530
and they recent they a couple of years

533
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,450
ago now I guess did a thing on

534
00:22:53,530 --> 00:23:00,160
identifying the syntax of an ID and then

535
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,059
they tried to start getting into this

536
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,130
and it was really horrible

537
00:23:03,059 --> 00:23:08,830
unfortunately it died are you going with

538
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:10,690
would you be liaising with CTA as well

539
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:15,399
just to make sure that things don't get

540
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:17,559
in GSMA and it's like it's more than

541
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,450
just the ones you listed would liaison

542
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:21,370
be a lot of what you intend to do and I

543
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,929
would hope to see it in the Charter uh

544
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:28,399
yes liaison is going to be a key piece I

545
00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:30,260
don't have standing in the vast majority

546
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:33,920
these organizations but for instance ray

547
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:36,110
Young who's here he has long been

548
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:37,940
involved in the aviation industry and so

549
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,379
he's plugged into several of those Bob

550
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:40,790
obviously as well plugged in here and

551
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,400
we're gonna need to recruit people who

552
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:49,430
are plugged into these other SD O's so

553
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:53,630
that we can do that okay Wes her degree

554
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:57,890
I say they seem to have this belief that

555
00:23:53,630 --> 00:24:00,200
trust is binary and the authorization is

556
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:04,880
easy and that authorization will never

557
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:09,710
be misused is what's the clue level

558
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:10,970
there so I hope I didn't give the

559
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:15,230
impression of thinking the trust was

560
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:18,740
binary personally I I got a little bit

561
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,240
more nuanced view than that but really

562
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,720
what we're looking for in terms of trust

563
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:26,330
is most fundamentally that there is some

564
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:29,000
evidence that the asserted ID of this

565
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,550
aircraft or of this aircraft operator is

566
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,650
indeed the ID of that aircraft or its

567
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,330
operator then once you start getting

568
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:37,550
into what is the information that's in

569
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:39,620
the registry and has that information

570
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:43,250
been vetted and all kinds of other you

571
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,510
know second order issues like that will

572
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:47,020
kind of cross that bridge when we come

573
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:50,330
to it but right now it's just that the

574
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,790
ASTM standard I can assert I am Adams

575
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:54,290
drone and that's it we're done and we

576
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:56,810
want to at least have something or when

577
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:58,610
I make that assertion I can sign that

578
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:00,379
assertion with something where you can

579
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:07,490
verify that signature that's like the

580
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:11,390
first step I'm and I represent the New

581
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:14,800
York UAS test site which is one of seven

582
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:14,800
test sites in the United States

583
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:20,210
designated by the Federal Aviation

584
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:23,050
Administration to test unmanned aircraft

585
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:28,090
systems I'm also a member of the ASTM

586
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:30,830
f38 group and I've been working with

587
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:33,470
rtca which is the radio technical

588
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:38,210
commission for aeronautics on unmanned

589
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:41,820
aircraft standards since 2011 and the

590
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:46,560
answer it's to whether ASTM

591
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:48,810
is seeking help from IE TF is yes the

592
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:51,810
problem with the current ASTM standard

593
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:55,409
which we call version 4 remote ID

594
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,490
version 1.0 is it's not scalable and

595
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,830
it's not secure

596
00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:05,010
so we've already at the meeting two

597
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:06,510
weeks ago which Stewart attended we are

598
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,900
under great pressure to get out of

599
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:13,110
remote ID standard from the FAA because

600
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:17,670
the FAA will not allow drones to fly

601
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:19,469
over people or over crowds or beyond the

602
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:22,320
line of sight visual line of sight of

603
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:27,300
the pilot without a remote ID standard

604
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,889
so the version 1.0 that we approved we

605
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:34,050
had to deal with some objections which

606
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:36,660
was a difficult process but we finally

607
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:39,030
got the version 1.0 standard out just to

608
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,610
get something that people could work

609
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:47,399
with we're committed to working on

610
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:51,330
version 1.1 which hopefully will include

611
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:53,640
host identity protocol and we're already

612
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,710
planning on version 2.0 which will

613
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:01,170
incorporate a higher standards of

614
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:04,980
cybersecurity when the final roll is

615
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:08,220
approved by the FAA so this is this very

616
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:13,350
logical we're excited about the work

617
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:21,870
that this team has done we want to see

618
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:23,939
it move forward Thank You Carla Sonia

619
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:26,550
and with sick folks and I also happen to

620
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,160
be a regular attendee of I Triple E 802

621
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:31,379
and I was involved in the past in the

622
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:34,260
work on the Wi-Fi MAC address

623
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,030
randomization for privacy issues so I'm

624
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,440
familiar with the way registries

625
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:41,879
addresses work and so cause to me that

626
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,410
some of the requirements I saw

627
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,740
especially talking about Bluetooth and

628
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:49,320
stuff rely on identifiers that are

629
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,860
basically managed by registration

630
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,379
authorities like the Tripoli

631
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:56,510
and if that is a requirement that means

632
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:58,610
or at least my understanding is we

633
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:02,260
cannot change that so we have to rely on

634
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:08,540
existing identifiers that are on those

635
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:10,850
hopefully compliant and drones so if

636
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,550
that is a case then correct me if I'm

637
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:16,100
wrong but I see that the problem has

638
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:18,250
three issues one is the identifier

639
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:20,719
itself and and being an authentic

640
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,760
identifier the second one is getting

641
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,100
that identifier to the to the actual

642
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,710
person that is concerned and the third

643
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:32,419
one is that person authenticating their

644
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:35,300
identifiers so am i right saying that we

645
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:40,280
only want to concentrate here on the

646
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:45,110
third problem I'm not convinced that the

647
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:47,389
Mac will be a panacea because for

648
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:49,100
instance it's frequently randomized for

649
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:53,870
for good reason

650
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:55,669
and I guess we can talk in in in greater

651
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,379
specifics later I'm really hoping that

652
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:59,210
people will step forward with

653
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:02,000
alternative solutions besides the hip

654
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,600
approach that we have prototyped but it

655
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,370
seemed to me that a hit was the most

656
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,169
suitable identifier of the various

657
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:11,169
identifier options of which I was aware

658
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:21,770
HD consulting just to longhouses comment

659
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:23,720
about MAC address registration my work

660
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,480
with some the processors which are use

661
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,360
these devices is that they use a local

662
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,520
scope MAC address for both their Wi-Fi

663
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,949
and their Ethernet they do not use a

664
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:37,310
registered one that MAC address is

665
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:39,890
derived from a device number of very

666
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:43,270
inside the FIR of that that particular

667
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:45,920
chip that's us each chip does get a

668
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:47,600
typical e a different address MAC

669
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,450
address assigned so you can they can

670
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,550
exist on the same physical media but

671
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,440
these are decent addresses that do not

672
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:56,240
go through the I Triple E registration

673
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,740
process and I don't know what they're

674
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,890
doing for the Bluetooth I can't speak to

675
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:03,050
that but I can't speak to the chips use

676
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:04,909
of Wi-Fi and they also sent a house

677
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:11,239
Ethernet port for configuring

678
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:16,629
when they're on the ground and room

679
00:30:11,239 --> 00:30:20,080
aggregor firstly I also happened to in a

680
00:30:16,629 --> 00:30:22,519
previous situation be involved with a

681
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,178
search-and-rescue drone operation for

682
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:27,559
New Zealand's Coast Guard we had the

683
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:29,659
somewhat unique distinction of being

684
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,019
actually getting certification to fly a

685
00:30:29,659 --> 00:30:36,409
UAV at night in controlled airspace

686
00:30:33,019 --> 00:30:38,210
under IFR conditions because we had a

687
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,519
particular problem which is that there

688
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,080
is a known marine trouble spot that

689
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:45,249
happens to be dead center on

690
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:48,710
christchurch international airport's

691
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:50,929
runway to zero approach right about at

692
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:54,139
the middle market and we need to be able

693
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:55,519
to operate you aces over that so we got

694
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,080
quite a bit of experience there talking

695
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,869
to New Zealand CAA about these kinds of

696
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:01,728
issues and all of this stuff firstly I

697
00:30:59,869 --> 00:31:02,809
was well aware of her because I've been

698
00:31:01,729 --> 00:31:06,799
involved with it way back at the

699
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:08,809
beginning we actually discussed the

700
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,269
solution very much like this with a West

701
00:31:08,809 --> 00:31:12,950
New Zealand in the CAA and they would be

702
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:15,919
very I'm certain they would be very glad

703
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:18,080
to see this happen it would solve a lot

704
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,840
of people's problems we actually got

705
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,580
that done by maintaining aviation radio

706
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:24,709
in cellphone contact with air traffic

707
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:26,779
control the whole time we were doing it

708
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:29,269
which is one option for a search and

709
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:30,289
rescue organization but that doesn't

710
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:31,879
work in a situation where you don't have

711
00:31:30,289 --> 00:31:36,229
radio comms that doesn't work in a whole

712
00:31:31,879 --> 00:31:39,199
lot of whole lot of places and one of

713
00:31:36,229 --> 00:31:41,419
the things about this that occurs to me

714
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,570
is that there are going to be manned

715
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,639
aircraft running in the existing air

716
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,509
traffic control system that also need to

717
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:49,508
render this system simultaneously

718
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,080
particularly search particularly rescue

719
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:55,970
helicopters another sorry aircraft but

720
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,678
there are police and various others are

721
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:58,399
going to do it as well for sure because

722
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,129
they're going to be working in

723
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:02,629
conjunction with drones and so that

724
00:32:01,129 --> 00:32:05,719
interface is something that needs to be

725
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:09,168
sorted out and and get its regulations

726
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,429
sorted and so forth I'm going to try and

727
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:11,809
get in contact with some people in New

728
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:15,139
Zealand and and plug them into this

729
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:16,460
process as well because internationally

730
00:32:15,139 --> 00:32:18,620
that particular Civil Aviation Authority

731
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,840
is very influential

732
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:23,209
the control control zone is a sixth of

733
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:25,850
the planet it's bigger than the FAA s

734
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,380
and they run I think for other company

735
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,719
other countries civil aviation

736
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:33,040
organizations as well because they're

737
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,170
just that good at it so alone

738
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:38,030
yes plug some people into the process

739
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:40,070
thank you Andrew thank you

740
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:41,990
and and to just speak to that issue of

741
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,659
the interface between manned aviation

742
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:47,840
and the ATM system and unmanned aviation

743
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:51,740
the UTM system the general scheme is

744
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,840
that it's the small unmanned aircraft

745
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:57,140
operators job to stay out of the way of

746
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,629
the larger manned aircraft so the larger

747
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,400
manned aircraft are typically beginning

748
00:32:58,630 --> 00:33:03,650
automatic dependent surveillance mode be

749
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:05,840
ATS be and so long as that information

750
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:07,370
gets plunked into the UTM system then

751
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,800
the operators of these small craft can

752
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,290
stay out of the way of the big aircraft

753
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,240
the big aircraft don't need to and don't

754
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,760
want to keep track of where all the all

755
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,910
the little ones are but that said an

756
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,810
interesting thing that seems to be

757
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:26,180
gathering steam is that because UTM well

758
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,679
because he way us typically don't carry

759
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,330
human passengers who can die if they

760
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:31,220
crash they're being held to a lower

761
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,730
safety standard than the manned aircraft

762
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:36,680
that's both good and bad the good part

763
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:40,730
is that it's allowing for a lot more

764
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,860
experimentation and so the tech is

765
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:44,600
advancing in the unmanned aircraft world

766
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,760
much faster than it's advancing in the

767
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:48,590
manned aircraft world and eventually

768
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:50,930
I've heard people say UTM is the future

769
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:52,730
of atm then we're gonna sort things out

770
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,110
with these small unmanned aircraft and

771
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:58,280
then it's going to migrate its way up

772
00:33:54,110 --> 00:34:01,969
into larger manned aircraft as well Rick

773
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:05,540
Taylor Airbus so one of the

774
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:08,690
considerations that I totally approve a

775
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,600
potty's one of the considerations when

776
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,820
you talk about moving technology onto

777
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:18,679
aircraft which carry passengers as you

778
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:20,840
say the reliability aspects is massively

779
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:23,540
increased so you're looking at real-time

780
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,070
embedded operating systems sorry Mike my

781
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:29,509
voice is going artists reliability stuff

782
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,710
done in firmware stuff done in

783
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:31,629
triplicate with different compute

784
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:36,429
systems

785
00:34:31,629 --> 00:34:39,098
lucien must be bulletproof so a lot of

786
00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,359
internet star technologies don't go on

787
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,490
the flight deck you'll be pleased to

788
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:43,929
know so there has to be that

789
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:45,638
consideration in there when you're

790
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,250
talking about talking with civilian

791
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:50,700
aircraft well I can say that that is

792
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:53,589
point well taken and underlined

793
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:56,230
Andrew Berger again I'd like to point

794
00:34:53,589 --> 00:34:58,599
out that your major competitor is the is

795
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:01,029
also the only organization that has ale

796
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,329
well they and their customers are the

797
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:05,759
only organizations that have a

798
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:09,160
significant scale deployment of hip

799
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:10,509
every Boeing customer and supplier is

800
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:15,098
using a protocol whether they know it or

801
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:16,690
not yeah the death of hip has been

802
00:35:15,099 --> 00:35:22,990
greatly exaggerated although the

803
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:25,630
deployments have been quiet okay good

804
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:27,250
moving on okay um so I think I'm

805
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:31,859
supposed to do a few more slides now on

806
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:34,390
the next topic right oh yeah go ahead

807
00:35:31,859 --> 00:35:35,799
this is possibly off-topic and I

808
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,509
apologize for that my name is Mike with

809
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:39,430
Mozilla and the concern I have was about

810
00:35:37,509 --> 00:35:42,279
the degree to which this respects

811
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:44,169
privacy particularly particularly

812
00:35:42,279 --> 00:35:45,460
because we've talked about this

813
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:46,660
technology scaling upwards to much

814
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,859
bigger hardware but it's certainly

815
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,118
envisioned I can certainly envision the

816
00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:50,890
world where it scales much downward

817
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:53,529
towards communities towards pardon me

818
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:55,180
commodity Hardware of any of any type at

819
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:57,160
all right the ability for the

820
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,169
authorities to reliably identify a

821
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,140
specific piece of hardware in a specific

822
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,490
location is to the wrong kind of

823
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,000
authorities an extraordinarily valuable

824
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:10,689
resource and I'd like to hear more about

825
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,059
what you envision robust privacy

826
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,700
concerns there to look like particularly

827
00:36:13,059 --> 00:36:18,009
given that the model you've described

828
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:20,589
involves you know very rapidly

829
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:24,609
delivering and acting on very accurate

830
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:26,589
information so I don't want to prejudice

831
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:29,230
the work of what will hopefully be

832
00:36:26,589 --> 00:36:31,569
either a team working group or the hip

833
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:35,680
working group I can only give you my

834
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:38,589
going in intuition which is that hip can

835
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:40,808
give us an identifier DNS can allow us

836
00:36:38,589 --> 00:36:41,670
to look up very rapidly that information

837
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:44,130
which

838
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,660
has few privacy implications and that

839
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:47,160
any member of the general public at any

840
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:51,390
time ought to be able to look up and

841
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,060
then something like just inspired by

842
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,310
perhaps the business models of the

843
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,770
domain registries but not with the Whois

844
00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:01,470
protocol with its known issues something

845
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,750
more like our DAP where access controls

846
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,490
can be there and you know you can ensure

847
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:08,010
that policy is satisfied before the

848
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:12,270
information is revealed now that assumes

849
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,980
that there is some probably governmental

850
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,500
authority that in any given jurisdiction

851
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,780
says this is the information that you

852
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,060
must put in the registry and that we

853
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,220
must be able to look up or you don't get

854
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:25,590
to fly in our jurisdiction and I'm

855
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,089
afraid that that that goes beyond

856
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:28,620
anything to which I can find a solution

857
00:37:27,090 --> 00:37:32,460
if the particular jurisdiction is

858
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:34,740
totalitarian at least with regard to

859
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:36,480
unmanned aircraft and privacy of

860
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,970
information

861
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,590
be aware students not said this the law

862
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:46,740
states that the FAA controls all

863
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:48,870
navigable airspace in the US and so

864
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:51,569
whether that's one inch above the ground

865
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:53,100
up to the top of the mesosphere or three

866
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:54,930
feet above the ground to the top of the

867
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:57,540
mesosphere is something we can discuss

868
00:37:54,930 --> 00:38:00,720
you do not own your backyard you do not

869
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:04,259
own your roof the FAA in a sense does in

870
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,470
terms of your right to privacy of to

871
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,810
certain extent to whom is you are in a

872
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:12,480
public domain and there's certain

873
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:15,450
privacy that you cannot that you forfeit

874
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,210
by being in that yes once this goes to

875
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:21,089
other areas and other things who then

876
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:23,670
has access to the additional information

877
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:27,300
that will be a policy set by Bill that

878
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:30,660
user community the intent here is that

879
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:32,400
there will be an authentication basis in

880
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,430
terms of who can get what sort of

881
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,910
disinformation but this is a safety

882
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:41,250
concern of the open air space which is a

883
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,069
rather unique situation that many people

884
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,230
even people who operate in this with

885
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:49,140
their hobbies drones don't understand

886
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,990
what it is they're doing we had the case

887
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,270
in Texas where the man shot down a drone

888
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,850
overs backyard he was indeed found

889
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:57,400
guilty

890
00:38:54,850 --> 00:39:00,880
but since there was no existing law he

891
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:03,910
was flying one tower but this is against

892
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,990
its legal precedents that no this is an

893
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:09,279
open public space yeah it's it's kind of

894
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,379
like the story about you know the right

895
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,970
to shout fire in a crowded theater if

896
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm in a theater and I'm minding my own

897
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:16,180
business watching the movie and eating

898
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,010
my popcorn the guy in the seat next to

899
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,470
me has no business knowing who I am or

900
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,390
what credentials I possess right but the

901
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,970
minute I shall fire in that crowded

902
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:28,750
theater I have forfeited my right to to

903
00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:31,569
privacy so the the the clueless careless

904
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:35,620
and criminal operation of a vehicle in

905
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:37,510
airspace forfeits some degree of privacy

906
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:40,060
but up until that point the privacy

907
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:42,790
should be maintained Jonathan Holden's

908
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:45,670
carplay and just to push back a little

909
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:48,340
bit on that and we're talking about a

910
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:52,270
broadcast medium that is permanently

911
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:54,820
broadcasting so we're already assuming

912
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:57,070
that even if you may legally have no

913
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:59,110
rights privacy that nobody in any

914
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:03,400
country ever would ever want privacy

915
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:05,740
which is sort of the privacy aspect

916
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,110
should definitely be in the protocol

917
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:09,310
from the beginning even if you don't

918
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,700
necessarily have a legal right to

919
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:20,440
privacy you might still want it

920
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:23,259
secondly the the the record-keeping of

921
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:27,180
who has looked up ie the authentication

922
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:30,550
of the requester of this information is

923
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,509
you know also very important hasn't

924
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:37,680
really appeared in the slide so far

925
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:40,630
correct and I'll go one step further

926
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,160
what if I observe your aircraft in a

927
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:44,830
particular place at a particular time

928
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:46,750
with my device and I record the beacons

929
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:48,549
that you have broadcast and then I

930
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,250
subsequently assert in front of a

931
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,780
magistrate that I received those beacons

932
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:54,670
at a different place or at a different

933
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:57,040
time you may have been flying in an

934
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:59,380
entirely legitimate temporal spatial

935
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:01,500
volume and I assert that you were flying

936
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,920
in an entirely different volume we

937
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:07,950
looked at the need for a a fair witness

938
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,990
on the observer device such that be

939
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:12,660
logged the information received over the

940
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,979
beacon is trustworthy not just that it

941
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:15,629
was trustworthy coming from the aircraft

942
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,450
to the observer device but that the

943
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:23,750
observer cannot easily falsify where and

944
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:27,259
when this guy was flying thank you

945
00:41:23,750 --> 00:41:27,260
Rick Taylor again

946
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,340
as the

947
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:34,470
very valid point which is I understand

948
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:39,480
that this is largely being funded out of

949
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:43,350
the US and the US has a single fairly

950
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:46,860
open legal system but the IETF is not a

951
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:50,460
u.s. organization and the FAA will lead

952
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:52,230
the way on this and whatever the IETF

953
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:55,560
works on has to be applicable in

954
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:59,160
jurisdictions outside of the West in

955
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:00,600
quotes into some other places in the

956
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:01,589
world where they will just pick up and

957
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,460
run with this technology the

958
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:08,730
manufacturers are not largely us so

959
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,660
privacy is a concern here beyond what is

960
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,480
expected in a in a Texas backyard

961
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:18,270
granted but to to allay some concern the

962
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,310
FAA z-- us from what identification

963
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:22,920
aviation rule mating rulemaking

964
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:25,009
committee AR C in their final report of

965
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,020
recommendations in the file of 2017

966
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:29,970
devoted a considerable number of pages

967
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:31,830
to the protection of personally

968
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:33,029
identifiable information which is not

969
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:37,470
something that you might have expected

970
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:39,960
from a regulatory agency stay tuned to

971
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:42,689
later slides the intent here is that

972
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,410
what are we broadcast is that hello I'm

973
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:48,750
Doug the drone and you always know that

974
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,460
I'm Doug the drone but that's all you

975
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:57,510
will know and nothing else from the

976
00:42:50,460 --> 00:43:00,030
broadcast then TR to be shown they don't

977
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:02,130
like hey I want to sort of reflect on

978
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:04,950
this in a second and then we can move on

979
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:07,290
but I'm delighted that in the first 40

980
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,210
minutes of a ball that talks about this

981
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,130
stuff we spent 20 minutes talking about

982
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:12,960
privacy because I've never seen that

983
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,180
before right it's clearly important and

984
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,800
it's something that presumably working

985
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:18,720
good for actually spent time working on

986
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,910
based on what I hear people saying right

987
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:26,069
so that this is this is great so I think

988
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,420
I need to move on to my second briefing

989
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:29,600
which will be shorter than my first one

990
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,600
so

991
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:35,060
first briefing was really intended to

992
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:37,520
convince anyone who needed convincing

993
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:39,799
that the problem of unmanned aircraft

994
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,340
system remote identification is an

995
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,560
important problem and that the IETF can

996
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:48,680
help and that was the whole point right

997
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:50,240
the point of the second briefing is that

998
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,609
although I was not one of the original

999
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,229
hip developers I have been a hip true

1000
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,680
believer for many years I have several

1001
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:59,630
small deployments and maybe it's because

1002
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,230
all I have is a hammer this looks to me

1003
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:03,320
like a nail

1004
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:05,600
but maybe hip really is a good match for

1005
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,800
this application then so I'll just give

1006
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:13,220
a couple of slides to why I think that's

1007
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:16,850
true so JavaScript Interop sorry so

1008
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:19,580
quake deeds as posted in the Java chat

1009
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:21,980
saying I'm one of the authors of STM

1010
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:24,319
remote ID standard I don't recall this

1011
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:26,210
talking about privacy being widely

1012
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:29,410
considered at the meeting this is not a

1013
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:32,930
consensus model being discussed by ICAO

1014
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:34,970
IETF support is support effort is early

1015
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:38,390
there are other options IETF can offer

1016
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:41,390
via OAuth 2 we need both to be fixed and

1017
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,520
it can roll in hit ICAO trusts

1018
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:45,259
frameworks is not considering this for

1019
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,040
integration with large aircraft which is

1020
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:55,910
needed for UTM to be accepted worldwide

1021
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:58,190
it goes on by

1022
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:00,490
I feel like I got the gist of all true

1023
00:44:58,190 --> 00:45:01,640
summary response I was late to the party

1024
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,259
ok

1025
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,480
ICAO has been working on this for a

1026
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:08,690
while STM's been working on this for a

1027
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:11,870
while I was a woefully ignorant of those

1028
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:13,100
efforts until quite recently and they

1029
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:14,509
have problems that they didn't think

1030
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,710
could be solved and I said hey wait a

1031
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,000
minute over here an IETF there are

1032
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,040
solutions that could be applied and

1033
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,550
they're like we don't believe you this

1034
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,070
is too hard there you go

1035
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:26,900
sorry just to read off the key bit of

1036
00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:28,460
the message I suggest we hold off on

1037
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:29,810
until next year to an alpha Airbus

1038
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:34,310
Boeing and others to contribute to the

1039
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:36,049
conversation I I guess I have to

1040
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:38,880
disagree because this is moving so fast

1041
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:40,890
the FAA is going to issue the notice of

1042
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,570
while making in December it's already

1043
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:46,109
been delayed repeatedly for something on

1044
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:48,960
the order of a year and if we don't

1045
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,880
bring forward the solutions including

1046
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,130
the privacy protections that the IETF

1047
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,030
can offer now we're gonna be stuck with

1048
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:57,420
something and it's gonna be an ugly baby

1049
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:58,980
Andrew McCrea

1050
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:02,430
I'd also like to point out that the ITF

1051
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:05,730
sleep time is not trivial sorry so even

1052
00:46:02,430 --> 00:46:07,859
if the IETF does this IETF in foster

1053
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,240
it's paid holding off for that

1054
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:14,460
effectively amounts to holding off RIA

1055
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:17,009
in itself thank you okay so um so if

1056
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:19,200
you're not familiar with hip RFC 44 23

1057
00:46:17,010 --> 00:46:22,290
lays out the architecture there is a

1058
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,180
current draft for RFC 44 23 bits the

1059
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,560
only reason that draft is not preceded

1060
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:27,089
is it refers to a couple of although

1061
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,470
drafts they have some issues so they

1062
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:31,140
have not yet proceeded so it's just a

1063
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:33,390
dependency issue on the overlay routable

1064
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,879
cryptographic hash identity which is

1065
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:39,600
what a host identity tag is is defined

1066
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:41,190
in 73 43 74 alone is the basic hip

1067
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,390
standard eight thousand two through

1068
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:44,160
eight thousand five are various

1069
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:45,420
extensions some of which even though

1070
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:48,330
they are considered extensions are

1071
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:50,220
pretty fundamental the general thing

1072
00:46:48,330 --> 00:46:51,750
that hip does for us in remote ID is it

1073
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,310
gives each device a persistent

1074
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,230
identifier that remains the same across

1075
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,060
IP address changes so just like the tail

1076
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,800
number the aircraft doesn't change you

1077
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,440
know the the hip host identity doesn't

1078
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,330
change the big beauty of this is it

1079
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,830
enables persistent TCP connections you

1080
00:47:03,330 --> 00:47:06,660
know just like mobile IP I was an early

1081
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:10,460
deployer of mobile IP to aircraft and

1082
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:10,460
then when hip came along and like better

1083
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,750
social security associations can be

1084
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:18,900
persistent as well it gives all packets

1085
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:21,570
of provenance there is a book

1086
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:24,210
beyond hip the end to hacking as we know

1087
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,610
it which an awful lot of his marketing

1088
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:28,710
glitz but it does drive home the point

1089
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,030
that every packet has a provenance and

1090
00:47:28,710 --> 00:47:31,560
that can be a handy thing it can also be

1091
00:47:30,030 --> 00:47:35,520
a very dangerous thing when we go back

1092
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:37,350
to the privacy issues I'm already using

1093
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,560
it in the secure mobile architecture and

1094
00:47:37,350 --> 00:47:42,360
derivatives thereof it's a natural match

1095
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,070
to aeronautical networking or you

1096
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,480
associate the persistent identifier with

1097
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,860
the aircraft tail number now it's not

1098
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,660
really called a tail number for small

1099
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:49,800
UAS it's called something else just like

1100
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:52,078
it's not called a flight plan it's

1101
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:54,359
called an operation or whatever

1102
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,770
and then wealthy homing is really really

1103
00:47:54,359 --> 00:47:57,990
helpful because we can do make before

1104
00:47:55,770 --> 00:47:59,670
break smooth handoff you really don't

1105
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:01,529
want a lapse in connectivity when you're

1106
00:47:59,670 --> 00:48:04,190
doing remote ID or command and control

1107
00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:07,050
or various other things

1108
00:48:04,190 --> 00:48:10,380
so what worker mode ID can leverage all

1109
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:12,359
of hips advantages so it's not just that

1110
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,400
we can have a host identity on the

1111
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:16,828
aircraft we can have a host identity on

1112
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,109
the UTM service supplier the USS we can

1113
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:22,260
have a host identity on the registry

1114
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:23,220
host that you're turning to too so you

1115
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,680
know I don't know how far we want to

1116
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:29,669
take this and one of the beauties of hip

1117
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:32,279
is Auto magical setup of IP security ESB

1118
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:34,140
tunnels from the observer to a pilot so

1119
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,579
I can say you know I need to talk to

1120
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:37,560
this guy right now and I want that

1121
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:40,410
connection to be mutually authenticated

1122
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:42,210
and strongly encrypted broadcast remote

1123
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:46,500
ID is much more constrained but we can

1124
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:50,119
still have a verifiable persistent ID if

1125
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:52,710
it is specifically a hierarchical hit

1126
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:54,450
well the second bullet is really if it's

1127
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:55,829
a hierarchical head you know which

1128
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,118
wedges tree are you in you're in the

1129
00:48:55,829 --> 00:48:59,940
good guy registry or you're not in a

1130
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,369
good guy registry and obviously good guy

1131
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:04,410
registry is in the eye of the beholder

1132
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:06,180
and then beyond him right I think

1133
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,129
there's a lot of other machinery that

1134
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:11,759
the IETF can bring to bear including DNS

1135
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:14,010
and our DAP as a start and a radical

1136
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:17,190
idea that I want to propose is multicast

1137
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:19,619
hip because sometimes what I want to do

1138
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:21,450
as the public safety person is contact

1139
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,770
all the operators of all the vehicles

1140
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:26,098
that are currently operating in this

1141
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:30,359
airspace and say full-stop get out or

1142
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:32,430
land or whatever right and and multicast

1143
00:49:30,359 --> 00:49:38,960
would be very very handy for that I

1144
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:41,990
think this is the last of mine yeah yeah

1145
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:41,990
thank you

1146
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:54,660
Thanks so Adam or you want we said first

1147
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:57,030
happen then I think so I think I mean we

1148
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:58,319
had good discussions I didn't cut them

1149
00:49:57,030 --> 00:49:59,940
because I think it's important when

1150
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:02,610
there's not what is the use case now we

1151
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:07,250
will dig a bit on on the details on how

1152
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:07,250
they had been approaching this problem

1153
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:11,220
hey everyone

1154
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,979
so Adam Whittaker I work for ax

1155
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:16,230
Enterprise I've been working on this for

1156
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:18,210
maybe about eight months now maybe

1157
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:20,370
twelve months and I've been focusing on

1158
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:22,080
authentication message formats so I'm

1159
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:23,819
gonna go into a little bit of detail

1160
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:27,440
technical detail here just to give you

1161
00:50:23,820 --> 00:50:28,830
some scope of what we're dealing with

1162
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:33,270
mm-hmm okay

1163
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:35,880
so obviously stood up the ASTM standard

1164
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:37,530
I passed the Bell on November 7th

1165
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,570
everything's great

1166
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:40,620
so there's an authentication message so

1167
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:43,470
there's a bunch of different ethic

1168
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,970
message formats in the standard one of

1169
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:47,100
them that we were focusing on is the

1170
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:50,700
authentication message format and it's a

1171
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:53,430
paged format so it has up to five it has

1172
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,720
up to five pages this is the things to

1173
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:57,690
do was mentioning that we need the

1174
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,959
number to go from five to ten and you

1175
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:03,570
can see a very general outline of how

1176
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,530
this looks in the packet format in a

1177
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:11,640
Bluetooth packet so you only hit a

1178
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:15,360
hundred and nine bytes of payload for

1179
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:18,660
authentication be it a signature be it a

1180
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:21,510
certificate whatever and this align

1181
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:24,240
authentication data signature is exactly

1182
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,250
what the ASTM standard says they don't

1183
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:29,700
specify anything beyond what you see

1184
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:34,290
here and this is a very stripped out

1185
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:36,689
version of it so I'm going to be a

1186
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:39,150
little bit of background on Bluetooth so

1187
00:51:36,690 --> 00:51:42,330
what you see to your right is the

1188
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:44,940
Bluetooth packet format there's 19 bytes

1189
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:48,750
of header there's 25 bytes for the

1190
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:51,210
message that's it we have 25 bytes in a

1191
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:53,550
singular Bluetooth message whether it's

1192
00:51:51,210 --> 00:51:55,200
Bluetooth 4 or Bluetooth 5 well mostly

1193
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:58,049
Bluetooth 4

1194
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,379
and this is all we have and this is

1195
00:51:58,049 --> 00:52:04,140
where our constraint is so that's where

1196
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,549
we're fighting so we have a couple

1197
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:07,529
different solutions that we've been

1198
00:52:05,549 --> 00:52:10,769
thinking of and been trying to prototype

1199
00:52:07,529 --> 00:52:16,200
the ax first was a entik ation wrapper

1200
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:20,669
so in the open drone id message the 25

1201
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:22,980
bytes we would include the host ID the

1202
00:52:20,670 --> 00:52:26,220
hierarchal host identity tag a timestamp

1203
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:29,309
for trust the signature and the payload

1204
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:31,950
now this is based on some stuff that Bob

1205
00:52:29,309 --> 00:52:35,789
will talk about with the new crypto but

1206
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:39,598
the hit is 16 bytes long the signature

1207
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:42,660
is 32 bytes long and that's 64 sorry

1208
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:47,940
yeah I get my numbers all screwed up and

1209
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:50,670
you only get 23 bytes of payload so this

1210
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:51,900
is the first wrapper format that we kind

1211
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:53,910
of came up with we looked at the

1212
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:59,430
constraint size and we said what can we

1213
00:52:53,910 --> 00:53:01,589
fit that's meaningful to us the payload

1214
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,419
has to have some sort of dynamic thing

1215
00:53:01,589 --> 00:53:06,210
if we want to sign that's why there's a

1216
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:08,339
timestamp that we have there but it

1217
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:11,190
could be any message conveniently the

1218
00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:15,799
payload is just big enough to fit any

1219
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:19,200
other message format from the ast M

1220
00:53:15,799 --> 00:53:23,910
because they're all 24 to 25 bytes long

1221
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:26,038
so we could just fit them in so how we

1222
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:28,920
got up with this I'm sorry if this is a

1223
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:31,920
little too small but the slides are

1224
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:34,829
available we came up with a trusted

1225
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,009
vector or trusted message format where

1226
00:53:34,829 --> 00:53:40,859
you put in the payload as you can see

1227
00:53:38,009 --> 00:53:44,130
here on the far right a vector message

1228
00:53:40,859 --> 00:53:46,710
and now the vector message is signed you

1229
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:50,430
can sign the vector message and assert

1230
00:53:46,710 --> 00:53:52,710
its trustworthiness so on a the RIT

1231
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:56,279
application you might see vector dots

1232
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:59,460
every second Bink blink-blink

1233
00:53:56,279 --> 00:54:02,849
blink-blink but every third one will

1234
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:05,279
turn yellow because of this format where

1235
00:54:02,849 --> 00:54:07,610
we resend a vector message almost

1236
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:10,400
instantaneously to

1237
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:14,810
cert and sign yeah this is where I'm

1238
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:18,290
going and this is my path so currently

1239
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:21,140
we only have the Sun side um prototyped

1240
00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:22,970
we're working on the on the receive side

1241
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:25,670
and that was part of my hackathon thing

1242
00:54:22,970 --> 00:54:27,049
I'm still working on it so hopefully

1243
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:27,470
I'll get something by the end of the

1244
00:54:27,050 --> 00:54:31,610
week

1245
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:33,799
maybe we'll see about it the other thing

1246
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:37,160
that we came up with was signed hashed

1247
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:39,230
lists this is an invention of Stu's I

1248
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:40,549
did not think of this I'm just

1249
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:44,600
implementing it and I'm trying to make

1250
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:46,040
sense of it still so basically we want

1251
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,690
to try to provide provenance to the

1252
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:51,310
messages you're spitting out on

1253
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:54,740
Bluetooth messages every second at least

1254
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:56,360
that's a lot of messages and you might

1255
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:02,089
not trust all of them so what if you

1256
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:05,630
could hashtag and ship them so these are

1257
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:07,910
two variants on message signing message

1258
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:12,830
hashing and then signing a list of those

1259
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:15,500
hasit hashes to help out there you might

1260
00:55:12,830 --> 00:55:18,560
notice that there I noted I say pseudo

1261
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:20,920
blockchain blockchain is a nice word

1262
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:25,370
that we use a lot and kind of annoys me

1263
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:27,050
but if you can link these authentication

1264
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,960
message the signed hashed list

1265
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:33,740
authentication messages together and you

1266
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:36,890
trailed ad Rome somehow you could in

1267
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:41,779
theory reput back together the entire

1268
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:44,000
flight path but the question that I have

1269
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:45,980
and I'm still working on is is this

1270
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,100
really worth it based on the number of

1271
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:51,140
hashes we have as you can probably see

1272
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,029
here there's only seven message hashes

1273
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,660
in the left one and there's only five

1274
00:55:53,030 --> 00:55:58,310
message hashes in the right one if this

1275
00:55:56,660 --> 00:56:00,770
is only being sent out once every three

1276
00:55:58,310 --> 00:56:04,120
seconds is it worth it I don't know so

1277
00:56:00,770 --> 00:56:06,140
that's a open question the final

1278
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:08,839
authentication message format that we've

1279
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:13,009
been tinkering with thank you to Bob is

1280
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:14,810
the offline based so Stu is mentioning

1281
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:18,230
you know whether you're online or you're

1282
00:56:14,810 --> 00:56:20,870
offline this is your offline where if

1283
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:21,470
you get the idea of a drone and you

1284
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,710
don't have it

1285
00:56:21,470 --> 00:56:29,089
at connectivity you can still at least

1286
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:32,810
trust it because you have the registry

1287
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:35,450
the auth in this case side where you can

1288
00:56:32,810 --> 00:56:37,460
look at the registries hit and you can

1289
00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:41,569
look at its signature and be like yeah I

1290
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,700
trust him because he's in a registry

1291
00:56:41,570 --> 00:56:45,590
that I trust I'm in the DHS registry

1292
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:47,868
that drones in the DHS registry

1293
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:51,020
well he's flying over an Air Force Base

1294
00:56:47,869 --> 00:56:54,290
I guess this kind of makes sense so this

1295
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,150
is this however this does not fit the

1296
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:59,359
authentication message format is only

1297
00:56:56,150 --> 00:57:03,500
five pages long so the max is a hundred

1298
00:56:59,359 --> 00:57:07,430
and nine bytes you need a minimum of 200

1299
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:11,030
bytes to get this to fit if someone has

1300
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:15,529
some other way to do this thing in 109

1301
00:57:11,030 --> 00:57:17,540
bytes I'm curious um but that's one of

1302
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:19,250
the pushes we're going for ASTM is to go

1303
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:22,520
from five pages to ten pages to make

1304
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:27,980
this thing possible and not fragment it

1305
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:30,230
as badly as we want so future work we

1306
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:33,200
need to talk to the STM on five to ten

1307
00:57:30,230 --> 00:57:35,420
pages this entire formatting stuff that

1308
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,720
I just went over might get pulled into

1309
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:41,210
the ASTM instead but that won't happen

1310
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,609
tomorrow it won't happen next month

1311
00:57:41,210 --> 00:57:47,630
it'll happen a year from now in version

1312
00:57:43,609 --> 00:57:50,990
two most likely so I'd love feedback I'd

1313
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:53,570
love comments and you know hey maybe

1314
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:54,979
this kind of format would look better to

1315
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:56,240
have a list of things that we could

1316
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:00,050
bring to the ASTM to be like look this

1317
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:01,549
might be useful might be worth it um if

1318
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:04,910
you don't mind let me finish this slide

1319
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:07,670
real quick so improvements to the format

1320
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:10,399
as I said I need some stuff to do on my

1321
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:12,740
draft missing pros and stuff like that

1322
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,450
and development of prototypes to show

1323
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:19,629
that this is actually viable and works

1324
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:22,220
thank you good luck soon you go again

1325
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:24,020
thanks a lot for information and just

1326
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:27,950
I'm just curious try to figure out how

1327
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:31,430
in your mind this should work you

1328
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:33,290
because we keep talking about backwards

1329
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:34,220
compatibility in the Bluetooth I think

1330
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:38,029
so

1331
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:40,490
Bluetooth has this advertising services

1332
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:45,290
right so they have to say I'm a

1333
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:49,910
thermometer I'm audio device so I guess

1334
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:52,850
you are relying on some existing service

1335
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:55,819
of Bluetooth that potentially will be

1336
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:59,690
broadcast by hundreds of devices in the

1337
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:02,180
exact same area and you have to figure

1338
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:05,450
out which one of these hundred beacons

1339
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:08,750
is actually the drone then look into the

1340
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:11,450
payload then figure out if there's a op

1341
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:15,290
and drone ID message and then go inquiry

1342
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:18,589
device so yeah there's a lot of layers

1343
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:23,360
to this it's quite complicated let's be

1344
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:26,900
honest um yes so I really don't know how

1345
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:30,020
to phrase this properly the Bluetooth

1346
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,650
format is dumb let's be honest I mean

1347
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:36,770
you can see it here I only get 25 bytes

1348
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:39,560
that's and that's where we fit and the

1349
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:44,150
ASTM standard breaks this further down

1350
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:46,549
actually let me jump to I will come back

1351
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,900
to that I'll jump to this slide because

1352
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:52,010
this is one of my beautiful backup

1353
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:55,190
slides you can kind of see where the

1354
00:59:52,010 --> 00:59:56,510
ASTM there's a header in the ASTM so

1355
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:59,390
that you can find out what message they

1356
00:59:56,510 --> 01:00:01,130
have um but at the end of the day we're

1357
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:03,980
just using their beaconing Bluetooth

1358
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,330
beacon frames that's the technology

1359
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:07,880
we're using whether it's in Bluetooth or

1360
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:09,920
bluetooth five beacon does say whether

1361
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:14,210
the type of service the device is

1362
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:18,200
supposed to yes okay so um do I have

1363
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:20,360
that slide here I do not have it here so

1364
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:23,180
in the Bluetooth at the very end of the

1365
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:27,860
Bluetooth frame of the Bluetooth headers

1366
01:00:23,180 --> 01:00:29,899
there is a application code and the ASTM

1367
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:34,610
has gotten approved an application code

1368
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:36,560
it's 0d that's that's their application

1369
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,240
code so ended so that will be that's

1370
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:42,500
been was comfortable to bluetooth for

1371
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:44,180
yes it should be yes I I don't know the

1372
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,020
exact answer I'd have to look at it and

1373
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,720
then get back to you

1374
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:51,619
so it's just a clarification

1375
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:55,459
when Kara was your concern about the

1376
01:00:51,619 --> 01:00:56,900
allocation of a code point or the

1377
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:00,380
complexity of the Bluetooth protocol

1378
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:02,599
yeah yeah that's I'm just trying to

1379
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:04,369
figure out how complex the problem is

1380
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:05,990
and how much can we actually do at

1381
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:09,140
higher layers when the probably the

1382
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:10,328
bigger issue is in the lower layers okay

1383
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,220
[Music]

1384
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:14,809
the interesting Matt Moskowitz the

1385
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:17,808
interesting part about this of course

1386
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:21,410
these are bluetooth broadcast messages

1387
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:24,260
and I would suspect that most phones are

1388
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:28,190
not listening to these except when

1389
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:30,230
they're in discovery mode so you have to

1390
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:32,750
basically you have to have your phone go

1391
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:36,289
into discovery mode on Bluetooth to be

1392
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:38,930
looking at these messages whether that

1393
01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:42,200
then interrupts the use of your your

1394
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:43,129
your bluetooth headphone at that time be

1395
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:45,799
able to do that

1396
01:01:43,130 --> 01:01:48,980
I depend Zahn again how the radio code

1397
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:51,950
is designed on that they go then into

1398
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:54,380
look at just the broadcast messages and

1399
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:56,839
then do I even know what the zero have

1400
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,490
code to recognize oh this is zero D type

1401
01:01:56,839 --> 01:02:01,099
oh I need to pass this up to the

1402
01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:04,848
application that deals with that that's

1403
01:02:01,099 --> 01:02:07,039
the the the open drone ID code to be

1404
01:02:04,849 --> 01:02:08,930
able to process these messages so

1405
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,539
there's a lot of yes underlying hidden

1406
01:02:08,930 --> 01:02:13,640
things here when you when you get um and

1407
01:02:11,539 --> 01:02:15,500
and who will be actually doing a

1408
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:18,410
Bluetooth beacon e other than

1409
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:21,380
troublemakers who want to confuse to

1410
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:25,940
know what's what's available in this

1411
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:29,180
case and why fine and then produces yet

1412
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:32,210
another interesting set of concerns as

1413
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:36,078
as a different media that's being used

1414
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:37,940
this but if you get down for those of

1415
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:40,250
you who live down these lower levels

1416
01:02:37,940 --> 01:02:42,289
have experiences low levels it is in a

1417
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:44,750
node and Juan Carlos because he deals

1418
01:02:42,289 --> 01:02:46,730
with us he he knows a lot of authors as

1419
01:02:44,750 --> 01:02:49,549
well it's a mess down there

1420
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:51,680
but once that Packer now gets passed up

1421
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:53,480
it's a it's a bluetooth broadcast it's a

1422
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:55,129
zero D type it gets passed if it's a

1423
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:56,390
application it's saying gonna be making

1424
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:59,000
whatever decision is going to be making

1425
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:01,520
and then we have the sub messages our

1426
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,220
single broadcast the the

1427
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,890
the general ID the vector information

1428
01:03:04,220 --> 01:03:08,569
but then see off messages which is a

1429
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,859
change these messages together which

1430
01:03:08,570 --> 01:03:12,590
thing comes to question what if you got

1431
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,060
four out of five of them then how do you

1432
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:16,280
forward error correction a couple other

1433
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:17,840
things but that's getting yourself

1434
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:23,000
buried in the details and this is a bath

1435
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:26,119
yeah just woman what do you do when you

1436
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:28,910
have five hundred out of five so I can

1437
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:31,250
tell you what my students were to when

1438
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:32,960
they read this document they will write

1439
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:36,950
a thing that waits for the first page

1440
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:40,250
and then supplies alternate values for

1441
01:03:36,950 --> 01:03:42,259
the other pages so the receiver would

1442
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:43,820
have a lot of fun recombining these all

1443
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:46,640
and finding out which of the ones is

1444
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:49,310
actually the renal so I'll make an

1445
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,509
interesting comment on that to extend to

1446
01:03:49,310 --> 01:03:53,570
it

1447
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:55,670
so shout out to James ax if he's

1448
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:58,910
listening I don't see him on the make

1449
01:03:55,670 --> 01:04:01,430
echo but when we were developing a ridah

1450
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:03,950
plication our demo prototype we decided

1451
01:04:01,430 --> 01:04:04,580
to try to make the phone a surrogate to

1452
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,080
a UAS

1453
01:04:04,580 --> 01:04:08,799
because that was what we were doing

1454
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,859
initially turns out Android phones

1455
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:16,900
changed the MAC address randomly when

1456
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:18,980
you send messages the ASTM standard

1457
01:04:16,900 --> 01:04:20,900
expects that the MAC address stays

1458
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:26,450
static because that's how they correlate

1459
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:27,710
- you know what droning came from I I

1460
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,839
won't go any further than that because

1461
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:31,850
we'll get into technical implementation

1462
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:34,040
details but I just want to point that

1463
01:04:31,850 --> 01:04:36,740
out because that is I think a similar

1464
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,450
vein and Ruger I just like to point out

1465
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:42,439
that there are some existing commonly

1466
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:44,689
used gadgets that use these features of

1467
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:48,380
Bluetooth from apps on both major phone

1468
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:50,720
Oasis so somehow it can be done I don't

1469
01:04:48,380 --> 01:04:52,910
happen to know how but if you look into

1470
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,529
the remote control remote control

1471
01:04:52,910 --> 01:04:56,839
protocols for hearing aids you'll find

1472
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:58,880
that they don't unbind as audio devices

1473
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,470
while they're in remote control mode and

1474
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:03,460
the phone did go into discovery mode to

1475
01:05:00,470 --> 01:05:08,899
get this so yeah somehow it works

1476
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:11,750
somehow yes I agree so with that that is

1477
01:05:08,900 --> 01:05:15,080
my presentation any other questions

1478
01:05:11,750 --> 01:05:15,360
comments concerns Stu's walking up to

1479
01:05:15,080 --> 01:05:22,920
them

1480
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:25,410
don't know Stu card so I just wanted to

1481
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:27,480
say what a vector message is now a

1482
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:28,770
vector message is a dot from the

1483
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,650
standpoint of surveillance and tracking

1484
01:05:28,770 --> 01:05:34,140
it is what is your position in 3-space

1485
01:05:31,650 --> 01:05:35,550
and what is your velocity vector in

1486
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,080
3-space

1487
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:38,520
the other thing that I want to mention

1488
01:05:37,080 --> 01:05:41,130
is this whole issue of going from five

1489
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:43,560
pages to ten the ASTM standard already

1490
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:46,320
does ten page authentication messages

1491
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:47,790
but they fill five of the pages with

1492
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:49,980
stuff that they want to authenticate and

1493
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:51,540
then the other five pages is for the

1494
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:53,760
signature or whatever so we're not

1495
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:55,200
actually asking them to extend the total

1496
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:55,650
message length any longer than it

1497
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,410
currently is

1498
01:05:55,650 --> 01:06:00,390
we're merely asking them to allow fewer

1499
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,399
of the bytes to be used for the data to

1500
01:06:00,390 --> 01:06:03,960
be authenticated and more of the bytes

1501
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,140
to be used for the authentication

1502
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:11,070
they're off right and the chairman of

1503
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:14,009
work item 6500 41 in ASTM Gabriel Cox

1504
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:16,170
from Intel has said that the two thing

1505
01:06:14,010 --> 01:06:18,230
changes that we've asked for are no

1506
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:21,120
brainers and he expects them to be in

1507
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:23,850
version 1.1 if there is a version 1.1

1508
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,799
and definitely in version 2.0 so simply

1509
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:28,560
getting them to accept the hierarchical

1510
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,510
hit as a UAS ID type not a problem and

1511
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:32,340
getting them to extend from five page to

1512
01:06:30,510 --> 01:06:33,930
10 page for authentication data no

1513
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,370
problem now somebody could stand up and

1514
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,290
object when it actually comes before the

1515
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:55,279
committee but but that's the opinion of

1516
01:06:37,290 --> 01:07:00,720
the Chairman at this point okay okay

1517
01:06:55,280 --> 01:07:06,360
javis qui relaying from Java to things

1518
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:10,379
from Greg deeds the USS and

1519
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:13,170
deconfliction is key to adoption and the

1520
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:16,710
trust framework is working on the ICAO

1521
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:19,320
identifier for the bird pilot we're

1522
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:22,020
going to have a new unmanned and general

1523
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:25,620
aviation framework for the ID privacy is

1524
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:27,210
still a big topic of debate as as as who

1525
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:28,859
is flying over one's house and you're

1526
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:31,140
right start and end as the person

1527
01:07:28,859 --> 01:07:35,009
being thrown over is a regulator issue

1528
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:37,078
FAA CAA and will be coming next year as

1529
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:40,380
a rule from the regulator we just got

1530
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:44,339
the f30 8.0 to spec born so we're

1531
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:49,200
working on it fair enough

1532
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:53,670
good 100% agree well okay so we're the

1533
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:55,890
blue sheets on the floor because I just

1534
01:07:53,670 --> 01:07:58,470
started go flying any anyone need still

1535
01:07:55,890 --> 01:08:01,140
to sign them okay so please raise your

1536
01:07:58,470 --> 01:08:03,598
hand and get them somehow so take

1537
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:05,519
another two to five of your minutes just

1538
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:09,150
to give you because we were at the

1539
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:14,038
hackathon which was really fun so this

1540
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:17,699
is what we did this is xkcd 303 if

1541
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:20,460
anyone has not familiar with it I had

1542
01:08:17,698 --> 01:08:23,428
lots of fun I was compiling things and I

1543
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:26,069
waited that's not what we really did

1544
01:08:23,429 --> 01:08:28,859
though I did quite a bit of work um so

1545
01:08:26,069 --> 01:08:31,409
open hip is an implementation of hip

1546
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:33,900
obviously I fixed it well partially

1547
01:08:31,408 --> 01:08:36,299
fixed it it didn't really work that well

1548
01:08:33,899 --> 01:08:39,750
in a bun - 1804 there were some

1549
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:43,350
dependency issues and whatnot so I made

1550
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:45,710
the builds go from 1604 and did some

1551
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:48,449
manual work and fix the make files

1552
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,219
hopefully this will make you know hip

1553
01:08:48,448 --> 01:08:52,169
adoption and development a little bit

1554
01:08:50,219 --> 01:08:55,380
easier and this was something I've

1555
01:08:52,170 --> 01:08:57,389
wanted to do for a while so I'll be

1556
01:08:55,380 --> 01:09:00,810
branching off in the bitbucket and

1557
01:08:57,389 --> 01:09:03,810
making a people request soon the next

1558
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:05,549
thing I did was I had to hit each hit

1559
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:08,279
generation prototype um

1560
01:09:05,549 --> 01:09:10,528
the source code is was floating around

1561
01:09:08,279 --> 01:09:12,569
the TM read list at one point I don't

1562
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:16,380
know where it is now other than in my

1563
01:09:12,569 --> 01:09:19,259
possession and I was using EDD sa 255

1564
01:09:16,380 --> 01:09:22,290
one nine key pairs um for signing and

1565
01:09:19,259 --> 01:09:26,279
verifying I attempted to update to see

1566
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:29,339
shake instead of sha-1 that's a pain see

1567
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:31,290
shake hurts my brain so because there's

1568
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:34,939
no Python implementation so I need to

1569
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:37,859
kind of review some stuff and do that

1570
01:09:34,939 --> 01:09:39,759
then finally the UAS demo application if

1571
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:44,179
you're at the heck

1572
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:45,859
demo happy hour we had a tablet which i

1573
01:09:44,179 --> 01:09:47,929
think is Stu's tablet wherever it may be

1574
01:09:45,859 --> 01:09:50,029
located and my phone acting as the

1575
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:54,590
surrogate UAS and the receiver and we

1576
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:56,989
were showing a very very prototype demo

1577
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:00,650
of what it's like when there's a hit as

1578
01:09:56,989 --> 01:10:03,650
an ID type and using DNS to reverse to

1579
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:07,129
look up information that the observer

1580
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:10,339
can see there were similar demos done at

1581
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:13,579
the UAS test site shoutout to james &

1582
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:15,949
ryan at ax they're the two that really

1583
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:18,880
have been fostering this implementation

1584
01:10:15,949 --> 01:10:21,919
forward with me supporting them and

1585
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:23,929
really want to shout out to james he

1586
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:26,270
helped me remotely a couple of times

1587
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:28,969
where it was midnight in New York and I

1588
01:10:26,270 --> 01:10:30,920
emailed him or I like just texted him

1589
01:10:28,969 --> 01:10:32,690
and he answered me at midnight one

1590
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,940
o'clock in the morning even though it

1591
01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:37,098
was ten o'clock here and he helped me

1592
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,699
out and debug some problems for me and

1593
01:10:37,099 --> 01:10:43,849
got me unstuck a couple of times so huge

1594
01:10:39,699 --> 01:10:45,969
shout-out to him so overall it was super

1595
01:10:43,849 --> 01:10:48,860
productive I learned a lot of things

1596
01:10:45,969 --> 01:10:50,539
mainly that ACLS really suck if you

1597
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:53,389
don't know they exist or you forget they

1598
01:10:50,539 --> 01:10:56,239
exist and DHCP is not your friend when

1599
01:10:53,389 --> 01:10:58,150
you're using ACLs and C Shake is a pain

1600
01:10:56,239 --> 01:11:01,489
so I need to figure that all out and

1601
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:03,980
these are some next steps help is always

1602
01:11:01,489 --> 01:11:07,009
appreciated whether it's just supporting

1603
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:09,138
me through a mailing list or email if

1604
01:11:07,010 --> 01:11:12,739
you can help me out that'd be great

1605
01:11:09,139 --> 01:11:14,210
or any any of us out and really more

1606
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:17,178
implementations are needed for

1607
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:27,440
interoperability testing any other

1608
01:11:17,179 --> 01:11:30,349
questions or comments so what one

1609
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:34,129
comment which is according to Google

1610
01:11:30,349 --> 01:11:37,099
there is a Python sea shake now oh okay

1611
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:39,020
well I've not tested it I don't I

1612
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:42,829
haven't even downloaded it but Google

1613
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:47,809
says there is one download it this

1614
01:11:42,829 --> 01:11:51,289
machine and something from relaying from

1615
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:53,210
great deeds keep in mind that remote ID

1616
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:56,059
is also about avoiding collision with

1617
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:58,400
aviators thus why we all need the need

1618
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,930
to have the big areas work it out we

1619
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:01,700
also need Apple to allow the speaking

1620
01:11:59,930 --> 01:12:03,980
reception which is not part of the I

1621
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:09,559
Triple E Wi-Fi standard yet Google

1622
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:12,669
phones do support it now you may take

1623
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:15,080
yeah go ahead

1624
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:20,980
like I'm going to stop you you're my

1625
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:25,519
boss so it's to card here so I

1626
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:28,759
personally agree that UAS remote ID is a

1627
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:31,340
foundational technology for detect and

1628
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:32,780
avoid vehicle to vehicle and vehicle to

1629
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:36,380
infrastructure communications etc etc

1630
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:40,219
etc however the official party line at

1631
01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:44,750
ASTM is that UAS rid is UAS rid period

1632
01:12:40,219 --> 01:12:47,630
done that it is not a component or

1633
01:12:44,750 --> 01:12:49,969
subsystem for detect and avoid or

1634
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:54,080
anything else now there is a reason for

1635
01:12:49,969 --> 01:12:58,550
them to say that detect and avoid is a

1636
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:02,450
safety critical application and UAS

1637
01:12:58,550 --> 01:13:05,690
remote ID is being treated as a security

1638
01:13:02,450 --> 01:13:08,030
critical application and within ASTM and

1639
01:13:05,690 --> 01:13:10,879
I think within the FTAA rate can correct

1640
01:13:08,030 --> 01:13:14,599
me if I'm wrong safety critical is

1641
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:17,960
regarded as a higher bar than security

1642
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:20,180
critical and so if you a s rid is good

1643
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,340
enough to address security concerns it

1644
01:13:20,180 --> 01:13:24,530
may or may not be good enough to address

1645
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:27,140
safety contradict all safety critical

1646
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:28,910
concerns of detect and avoid for

1647
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:30,110
collision avoidance so I just wanted to

1648
01:13:28,910 --> 01:13:32,719
make sure that that was out there that

1649
01:13:30,110 --> 01:13:35,389
you know I may I may agree with it with

1650
01:13:32,719 --> 01:13:43,250
the commenter on jammer right but but

1651
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:48,530
ASTM officially doesn't so response from

1652
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:50,210
Jabra so agree it is possible in time

1653
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:56,389
I'm not quite sure what that point

1654
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:57,650
relates to but and keep in mind that

1655
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,120
right it is about avoiding collision

1656
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:01,910
with general aviators thus we need to

1657
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,830
have the big aviators work it out we

1658
01:14:01,910 --> 01:14:05,180
also need Apple to allow the speaking

1659
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:07,040
reception which is not part of the I

1660
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:09,470
Triple E Wi-Fi standard yet

1661
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:11,900
same message yes iPhone will only

1662
01:14:09,470 --> 01:14:15,890
support Bluetooth for five at two miles

1663
01:14:11,900 --> 01:14:18,070
max roughly Google phones do support now

1664
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:20,660
Samsung is coming next

1665
01:14:18,070 --> 01:14:23,000
yeah yeah there's a bit of fragmentation

1666
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:25,099
in the Bluetooth it's surprising my

1667
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:27,170
pixel four supports everything for

1668
01:14:25,100 --> 01:14:29,150
Bluetooth five which is quite surprising

1669
01:14:27,170 --> 01:14:30,710
including the long range a lot of phones

1670
01:14:29,150 --> 01:14:32,900
that say Bluetooth five don't actually

1671
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:34,430
support the long range so there's that

1672
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:38,089
hurdle but that's a technical hurdle

1673
01:14:34,430 --> 01:14:40,180
that's beyond the IETF I'll just make a

1674
01:14:38,090 --> 01:14:43,400
shameless plug I'm here all week

1675
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:46,370
find me talk to me I'd love to sit down

1676
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:48,379
show you my draft talk about the message

1677
01:14:46,370 --> 01:14:51,410
formats and everything so feel free to

1678
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:56,330
do so thank you

1679
01:14:51,410 --> 01:14:57,830
what is an incan I am a beacon okay so

1680
01:14:56,330 --> 01:15:01,070
so now we're gonna go with Bob's

1681
01:14:57,830 --> 01:15:03,110
presentation and and then I mean we are

1682
01:15:01,070 --> 01:15:06,590
having quite many discussions anyway I

1683
01:15:03,110 --> 01:15:10,330
didn't want to cut them so it's okay

1684
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:10,330
that is taking a bit longer than planned

1685
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:19,370
good morning I'm Bob love you know me I

1686
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:23,240
can assert that I'm Bob though my sister

1687
01:15:19,370 --> 01:15:25,190
calls me Robert is my classic in terms

1688
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:27,469
of talk about identity he's 11 years old

1689
01:15:25,190 --> 01:15:29,809
I got my first phone call from a

1690
01:15:27,470 --> 01:15:32,750
classmate back in 61 getting a phone

1691
01:15:29,810 --> 01:15:34,370
call or something my classmate called my

1692
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,950
younger sister who was seven picked up

1693
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:39,590
the phone my classmate said hello is Bob

1694
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:42,200
there to my younger sisters responses

1695
01:15:39,590 --> 01:15:48,200
bye Bob there's no Bob here and she hung

1696
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:50,210
up the phone so what's an ID I've been

1697
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:55,519
basically that's lecturing about IDs

1698
01:15:50,210 --> 01:15:59,330
since I've been 11 years old can I

1699
01:15:55,520 --> 01:16:00,500
please have the other deck the the

1700
01:15:59,330 --> 01:16:06,620
higher okay I won't do that one first

1701
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:11,300
okay good so Bob do you do you bring

1702
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:12,890
your bells today I didn't get high I

1703
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:15,350
didn't come up my bill sorry I lost him

1704
01:16:12,890 --> 01:16:17,470
somewhere along the way now they use him

1705
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:19,710
to get here okay

1706
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:23,700
okay there we go okay

1707
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:26,580
so my hierarchal hits what are them here

1708
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:29,130
the idea here is an implicit domain of

1709
01:16:26,580 --> 01:16:31,200
use I'm assuming there is knowledge of

1710
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:34,530
what a host identity tag is but really

1711
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:39,599
quickly host identity tag is a hash of a

1712
01:16:34,530 --> 01:16:42,660
public key into 96 bits within 4 bits to

1713
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,090
add in terms of what is the public key

1714
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:48,360
algorithm and then 28 bits in front of

1715
01:16:45,090 --> 01:16:51,000
it which is available IP v6 prefix in

1716
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:55,400
other words the hitch is a valid ipv6

1717
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:55,400
address it's just not routable on

1718
01:16:55,430 --> 01:17:00,900
hierarchal hits is what i'm adding here

1719
01:16:58,170 --> 01:17:02,670
is an implicit domain of use into it and

1720
01:17:00,900 --> 01:17:05,610
again the details how that is done on

1721
01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:09,930
the hierarchy information forms what the

1722
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:11,849
hit is for the higher go here associated

1723
01:17:09,930 --> 01:17:14,670
with hacking prevents could have been

1724
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:17,340
duplicate prevention defense against hit

1725
01:17:14,670 --> 01:17:20,460
hashing attacks because of how to be

1726
01:17:17,340 --> 01:17:22,920
registered and and importantly scalable

1727
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:25,680
lookups on the original hit work on

1728
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:28,500
distributed hash tables and how we could

1729
01:17:25,680 --> 01:17:30,060
support large communities of lookups but

1730
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:32,630
even though we had a stupid hash tables

1731
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:36,030
here came the question about distributed

1732
01:17:32,630 --> 01:17:38,910
registration of them and who registers

1733
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:40,440
and control said it was problem

1734
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:42,809
everything there is an RFC out on

1735
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:44,610
distributing hash tables for four hits

1736
01:17:42,810 --> 01:17:48,450
I'm trying to be better than that

1737
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:50,849
but why hire go hits now that wasn't in

1738
01:17:48,450 --> 01:17:53,670
the original design back in 2002 it was

1739
01:17:50,850 --> 01:17:56,760
pulled out of 2003 because at that time

1740
01:17:53,670 --> 01:18:00,330
there was no use case for it now there

1741
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:02,850
is a use case for it on the UAS could

1742
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:06,170
use national domains for instance FAA or

1743
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:09,570
other a CAS providing the registry of

1744
01:18:06,170 --> 01:18:11,640
authority on services these are minimal

1745
01:18:09,570 --> 01:18:17,150
to registering an and signing the

1746
01:18:11,640 --> 01:18:21,300
hierarchical hit the HTA's of forget

1747
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:23,780
domain Authority on to this the regional

1748
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:27,060
you TMS would then actually provide the

1749
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:29,300
domain authority services accepted there

1750
01:18:27,060 --> 01:18:32,490
there are unmanned

1751
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:33,520
management systems you a flying from

1752
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:35,980
Canada us with

1753
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:38,020
quickly identified as such potentially

1754
01:18:35,980 --> 01:18:40,240
because oh this hit my Rohit was

1755
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:42,490
registered to the Canadian Systems

1756
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:44,740
flying in in the u.s. that may be

1757
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:46,960
perfectly okay or not okay depending on

1758
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:49,240
the situation or just movement just

1759
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,800
launched in the u.s. that's a separate

1760
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:52,719
issue but the point is that you can

1761
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,410
identify the domain in which it was

1762
01:18:52,720 --> 01:18:59,320
registered each on CA can apply its own

1763
01:18:56,410 --> 01:19:03,250
policy honest is you TMS and any other

1764
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:06,040
of markets HCA providers so you can have

1765
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:09,100
different policies in terms of what

1766
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:12,220
needs to be registered who has authority

1767
01:19:09,100 --> 01:19:15,580
to get what private this P I information

1768
01:19:12,220 --> 01:19:18,190
whatever they are on but by doing this

1769
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:21,400
there's not just in the distributed hash

1770
01:19:18,190 --> 01:19:23,650
table table the flat one there could not

1771
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:26,950
be separate policies this allows us to

1772
01:19:23,650 --> 01:19:30,129
have several policies on the UAA's free

1773
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:32,559
to register unique hi Rohit with each

1774
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:34,540
region operates in or each day it

1775
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:37,000
operates or each flight it takes

1776
01:19:34,540 --> 01:19:43,990
whatever is appropriate for its

1777
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:46,930
particular mission reality so I had some

1778
01:19:43,990 --> 01:19:50,980
design compromises I have to stay within

1779
01:19:46,930 --> 01:19:57,640
the V to hit design which is this 28 bit

1780
01:19:50,980 --> 01:20:02,530
unprefixed 4 bit identifier 96 bit half

1781
01:19:57,640 --> 01:20:05,790
space and what I worked out so the 96

1782
01:20:02,530 --> 01:20:08,800
bits for hierarchy and the the hi hash I

1783
01:20:05,790 --> 01:20:12,670
worked out the 64 business adequate for

1784
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:15,730
the hi hash there is math behind this

1785
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:19,180
the draft gives the math and if you want

1786
01:20:15,730 --> 01:20:21,099
I can even supply you with a a Excel

1787
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:24,340
spreadsheet which actually makes it very

1788
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:27,670
easy to plug in but it the it shows is

1789
01:20:24,340 --> 01:20:31,300
that if if a domain has 66 million

1790
01:20:27,670 --> 01:20:34,090
registered addresses the next one coming

1791
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:37,750
in has a 100 percent chance of a

1792
01:20:34,090 --> 01:20:39,850
collision we actually generate a million

1793
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:41,350
armed hierarchical hits on a test and

1794
01:20:39,850 --> 01:20:43,330
there were no collisions in that 1

1795
01:20:41,350 --> 01:20:46,420
million we generated we stopped after

1796
01:20:43,330 --> 01:20:47,410
million actually I only asked Adam to do

1797
01:20:46,420 --> 01:20:51,700
a million I thought that

1798
01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:53,320
a reasonable request collision

1799
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,790
prevention through the hierarchal hit

1800
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,570
registration which I'll be getting to in

1801
01:20:54,790 --> 01:20:58,450
a bit

1802
01:20:55,570 --> 01:20:59,799
and I said in the draft appendix a gives

1803
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:00,700
the collision for me so you can work it

1804
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:05,920
out for yourself

1805
01:21:00,700 --> 01:21:10,480
I said 66 663 million is where you get

1806
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:13,270
to 1% collision risk so it seemed

1807
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:15,820
reasonable the 64 bits for the hash and

1808
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:18,250
32 bits for the hierarchy so what do I

1809
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:20,170
do with these 32 bits per hierarchy what

1810
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:23,410
I decided to break it up into two levels

1811
01:21:20,170 --> 01:21:25,990
for the registered assign register

1812
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:29,590
assigning Authority give them it's 14

1813
01:21:25,990 --> 01:21:33,550
bits that means that that that solar

1814
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:35,680
system wide there can be 16384 Ras I

1815
01:21:33,550 --> 01:21:38,830
felt that's a reasonable number of such

1816
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:41,620
entities with each entity can then have

1817
01:21:38,830 --> 01:21:43,750
in the 18 bits for the higher cohere

1818
01:21:41,620 --> 01:21:49,960
domain Authority each one can then just

1819
01:21:43,750 --> 01:21:52,030
register to 262,000 144hz ace for each

1820
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:53,890
RA again I feel that is a reasonable

1821
01:21:52,030 --> 01:21:56,099
number to have and two levels of

1822
01:21:53,890 --> 01:21:59,740
hierarchy seem to be enough for this

1823
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:05,170
management of the higher of the devices

1824
01:21:59,740 --> 01:22:07,269
that have higher hits so that's the

1825
01:22:05,170 --> 01:22:09,180
decision I came up with I'm open to

1826
01:22:07,270 --> 01:22:13,900
other ways to play around those 32 bits

1827
01:22:09,180 --> 01:22:16,450
but this as as I explained to arms to a

1828
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:18,519
stake in the ground and a stake in the

1829
01:22:16,450 --> 01:22:19,750
ground is a very very strong statement

1830
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:21,130
and if you want to apply now I'll

1831
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:23,500
explain to you what a stake in the

1832
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:26,950
ground really means or at least what it

1833
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:28,360
meant originally so but how are these

1834
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:30,070
top level members numbers assigned

1835
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:31,750
that's a question if you answered as

1836
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:37,290
with everything when we create a new

1837
01:22:31,750 --> 01:22:37,290
number space who manages it TBD

1838
01:22:37,690 --> 01:22:42,460
how to distinguish a flat space from the

1839
01:22:40,030 --> 01:22:43,780
hakko hits this becomes a problem we're

1840
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:45,910
having if it within the current flat

1841
01:22:43,780 --> 01:22:48,759
space heart will go hit how can we tell

1842
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:51,190
which way to powers it on there we have

1843
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:53,800
two choices we can either have specific

1844
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:56,440
suite IDs or hierarchical hits in those

1845
01:22:53,800 --> 01:23:00,650
four bits or we can have a different

1846
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:03,610
prefix different slash 28 so

1847
01:23:00,650 --> 01:23:05,540
I recommend different prefixes because

1848
01:23:03,610 --> 01:23:07,549
there are only a limited number of

1849
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:10,310
Suites and four bits we could

1850
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:12,190
potentially use the hit v1 prefix except

1851
01:23:10,310 --> 01:23:15,350
we know there are deployments of those

1852
01:23:12,190 --> 01:23:18,589
and we're probably not gonna go away and

1853
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:19,790
maybe they won't have collisions so that

1854
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:21,739
that is a question

1855
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:27,290
that'll be again be answered by the

1856
01:23:21,739 --> 01:23:28,820
people who own the prefix space so but

1857
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:31,370
looks like that hopefully they'll be

1858
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:34,580
only two prefixes either one for flat

1859
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:37,070
and one for hierarchy thus we need to

1860
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:38,690
get that our key right to do it right

1861
01:23:37,070 --> 01:23:40,969
the first time

1862
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:43,610
good foot in case you never heard the

1863
01:23:40,969 --> 01:23:45,679
term good foot my automotive history we

1864
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:51,710
are sitting all ways been said do it

1865
01:23:45,679 --> 01:23:53,750
right the first time there's an impact

1866
01:23:51,710 --> 01:24:00,110
on order construction access to impacts

1867
01:23:53,750 --> 01:24:03,440
on worker construction is was designed

1868
01:24:00,110 --> 01:24:06,530
for 96 big cache of the high there's no

1869
01:24:03,440 --> 01:24:09,199
flexibility in that no support for

1870
01:24:06,530 --> 01:24:11,120
hierarchical bits so this is a change to

1871
01:24:09,199 --> 01:24:14,299
how orchids are constructed right there

1872
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:15,920
and additionally though it cannot take

1873
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:19,190
advantage of the new variable output

1874
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:21,760
hashes on both shake and seat shake put

1875
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:25,040
out exactly how many bits you want our

1876
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:28,400
tradition in hashes with using sha-1

1877
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:30,530
shot to show all to be six whatever yes

1878
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:33,139
we say we got so many bits out I don't

1879
01:24:30,530 --> 01:24:36,259
need some bits hash it well how do we

1880
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:40,010
ask or discussion on trunk area how do

1881
01:24:36,260 --> 01:24:44,179
we truncate a hash with shake you the it

1882
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:46,219
is a variable output it is look at learn

1883
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:48,409
about if you're all involving hashes

1884
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:50,750
look at sponge functions they are um

1885
01:24:48,409 --> 01:24:54,500
it's an amazing invention in the world

1886
01:24:50,750 --> 01:24:55,850
of hashing and we get up as many bits as

1887
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:59,960
you want so this is a change to order

1888
01:24:55,850 --> 01:25:03,620
construction with this so how should

1889
01:24:59,960 --> 01:25:05,449
these changes to Orkut be addressed some

1890
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:08,330
are here some learn new crypto draft

1891
01:25:05,449 --> 01:25:11,030
which I keep those are or am I going to

1892
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:14,390
create a separate draft which is a an

1893
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:16,460
addendum to Orkut that's again

1894
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:18,410
organizational that's for the working

1895
01:25:16,460 --> 01:25:20,090
group to decide but to note that right

1896
01:25:18,410 --> 01:25:23,470
now I've been discussing this I am

1897
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:26,240
changing Orca construction for this work

1898
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:29,600
the Python script soon to be available

1899
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:31,219
to create Jaco hips for testing we

1900
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:33,620
already have kind of one of the things

1901
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:36,050
we don't have the sea shake support for

1902
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:39,050
how we do the hashing right now because

1903
01:25:36,050 --> 01:25:41,930
that's why Adam has said that he needs a

1904
01:25:39,050 --> 01:25:42,410
Python see shake implementation so he

1905
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,840
can do it

1906
01:25:42,410 --> 01:25:46,309
and here comes Adam to speak to that and

1907
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:50,510
I'm Whitaker ax

1908
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:54,280
so the original Python script that I ran

1909
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:59,480
the collision testing on was using sha-1

1910
01:25:54,280 --> 01:26:03,730
so theater saying I saw one before yes

1911
01:25:59,480 --> 01:26:06,440
three four is three four I'm using

1912
01:26:03,730 --> 01:26:09,379
Python terminology but I was using Shaw

1913
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:12,290
384 to do the collision testing and then

1914
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:14,420
during the hackathon I got the shake 128

1915
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:16,010
to work because of the variable output

1916
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:19,430
length but I didn't get see shake

1917
01:26:16,010 --> 01:26:22,340
because of the implementation problem so

1918
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:24,980
I can get a I can have a Python script

1919
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:27,350
with either of those available to

1920
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:29,179
whoever wants one I gotta get it up

1921
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:31,040
somewhere at some point on a github or

1922
01:26:29,180 --> 01:26:33,500
whatnot and I'll be working on that

1923
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:36,800
hopefully during the week so I just

1924
01:26:33,500 --> 01:26:39,350
wanted to clarify that point and just as

1925
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,290
a point of I'm talking these these

1926
01:26:39,350 --> 01:26:46,460
hashes these artists standards shake is

1927
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:50,690
in tips - OH - see shake is in special

1928
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:52,460
pro of 800 185 and these are referenced

1929
01:26:50,690 --> 01:26:53,719
in the documents and they are available

1930
01:26:52,460 --> 01:27:02,870
from in this site if you don't have them

1931
01:26:53,720 --> 01:27:09,440
so questions on the hierarchal hits but

1932
01:27:02,870 --> 01:27:14,269
okay Jonathan maybe it's maybe I'm just

1933
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:18,110
not paying enough attention but um is

1934
01:27:14,270 --> 01:27:21,740
there no worry about finding collisions

1935
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:24,639
or is it like do you assume that the

1936
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:27,510
hashes are generated truthfully like

1937
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:29,849
like could I not try

1938
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:31,820
come up with I find a drone can I not

1939
01:27:29,849 --> 01:27:35,639
try and clone it you know like trying

1940
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:36,058
663 million hashes that's what two three

1941
01:27:35,639 --> 01:27:38,789
minutes

1942
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:40,889
computer time yes these are concerns

1943
01:27:38,789 --> 01:27:43,349
that's the next presentation on the

1944
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:46,619
registry the registry will have the

1945
01:27:43,349 --> 01:27:48,210
hierarchal hit and the high so it is a

1946
01:27:46,619 --> 01:27:51,030
first come first serve baby space

1947
01:27:48,210 --> 01:27:56,849
jumping it when it set asides and then

1948
01:27:51,030 --> 01:28:00,630
yes when you're talking about e2 519

1949
01:27:56,849 --> 01:28:04,829
there are our issues in terms of that

1950
01:28:00,630 --> 01:28:07,440
you can have was it multiple public

1951
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:09,239
values for private I forget there's this

1952
01:28:07,440 --> 01:28:11,820
much though which I'm covering in in the

1953
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:14,280
security considerations on that but the

1954
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:19,590
registry registry addresses these

1955
01:28:14,280 --> 01:28:20,969
concerns okay thank you Andrew McGregor

1956
01:28:19,590 --> 01:28:23,460
I think it's probably just best to

1957
01:28:20,969 --> 01:28:25,409
update the orchid Drive

1958
01:28:23,460 --> 01:28:28,050
it's probably just best to update update

1959
01:28:25,409 --> 01:28:29,820
the orchid RFC or supersede it rather

1960
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:32,309
than spread it around among several

1961
01:28:29,820 --> 01:28:33,690
documents yeah III think that's what I

1962
01:28:32,309 --> 01:28:35,579
need to do is just spin it off and make

1963
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:36,690
that yeah another graph of F for

1964
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:40,380
anything else that speeds up the process

1965
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:43,250
to Jonathan's point sure you can Chloe

1966
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:49,110
you can find you can find something that

1967
01:28:43,250 --> 01:28:52,860
matches that that hit but you're going

1968
01:28:49,110 --> 01:28:55,130
to have to have a to run the protocol

1969
01:28:52,860 --> 01:28:59,429
you're going to have to have a valid

1970
01:28:55,130 --> 01:29:01,139
matching private key and yes but what

1971
01:28:59,429 --> 01:29:03,539
you can't do is get this is get the

1972
01:29:01,139 --> 01:29:11,190
registry to sign it because they'll just

1973
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:12,929
refuse because it's a collision yes but

1974
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:15,329
someone locally can look at it and go

1975
01:29:12,929 --> 01:29:20,179
hang on that registry signature is

1976
01:29:15,329 --> 01:29:22,820
invalid if the registry

1977
01:29:20,179 --> 01:29:26,360
to the hash and hasn't signed the public

1978
01:29:22,820 --> 01:29:28,519
key then all I have to do is find

1979
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:31,670
another public key that hashes to the

1980
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:34,010
collision and they will be so presumably

1981
01:29:31,670 --> 01:29:36,679
with the widow and while signing the

1982
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:38,989
hash is not signing the whole if signing

1983
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:41,270
the public key that's why their thing is

1984
01:29:38,989 --> 01:29:43,940
200 bytes long and what we have to do

1985
01:29:41,270 --> 01:29:45,920
here to fit into the ignore I've not

1986
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:49,549
been how to make it significantly less

1987
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:51,050
than 200 bytes yeah I had one of the

1988
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:53,239
principles of hip is that the is that

1989
01:29:51,050 --> 01:29:54,350
the tag is just a tag you could use you

1990
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:56,379
can actually make the protocol work

1991
01:29:54,350 --> 01:29:58,610
using a random tags that are not

1992
01:29:56,380 --> 01:30:00,890
cryptographically bound to the to the

1993
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:03,469
public key but that makes various things

1994
01:30:00,890 --> 01:30:06,320
less efficient so the actual there the

1995
01:30:03,469 --> 01:30:08,390
hashing is an optimization here I don't

1996
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,730
I don't will not make the claim that

1997
01:30:08,390 --> 01:30:13,310
I've handled every single edge condition

1998
01:30:10,730 --> 01:30:17,059
I have tried really hard to get that

1999
01:30:13,310 --> 01:30:19,580
done and and the registry is a key part

2000
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:32,179
of this whole thing so let's go on to

2001
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:33,610
the registries whoa beep clunk oh no

2002
01:30:32,179 --> 01:30:41,840
it's the whole thing

2003
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:44,000
just froze okay so this is service

2004
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:47,060
provided by the Hakka Mohit domain

2005
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:50,360
Authority HDA and also da race for the

2006
01:30:47,060 --> 01:30:53,360
HDA itself all hierarchal hits for

2007
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:55,960
domain must be registered prevents

2008
01:30:53,360 --> 01:30:57,980
duplicate hits and the high is

2009
01:30:55,960 --> 01:31:00,699
associated with the higher go here it

2010
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:03,440
which does and allows us to deal with

2011
01:31:00,699 --> 01:31:03,980
various attacks against them hashing

2012
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:06,259
attacks

2013
01:31:03,980 --> 01:31:09,559
Colette's other information based on the

2014
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:13,270
HCA's policy for other lookup based on

2015
01:31:09,560 --> 01:31:15,860
who has authorization for that the

2016
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:18,880
registries provide retrieval based on

2017
01:31:15,860 --> 01:31:21,530
the heart go hit and authorization

2018
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:26,360
initially we're looking at is using our

2019
01:31:21,530 --> 01:31:27,559
C 805 DNS hip resource record we this is

2020
01:31:26,360 --> 01:31:32,540
what we're actually you were testing

2021
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:33,909
with Stu provided the tablet atoms are

2022
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:37,239
brought for body the

2023
01:31:33,909 --> 01:31:40,239
Android phone I supplied the the server

2024
01:31:37,239 --> 01:31:41,949
that Ash was running a version of buying

2025
01:31:40,239 --> 01:31:43,959
where we're actually hit were fighting

2026
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:45,730
domains and the lookups for this to show

2027
01:31:43,960 --> 01:31:48,580
that we're actually we're retrieving the

2028
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:52,209
the hip resource record using the hits

2029
01:31:48,580 --> 01:31:54,010
and getting the high as a result and but

2030
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:56,110
other information register information

2031
01:31:54,010 --> 01:31:58,000
based on authorization and we're talking

2032
01:31:56,110 --> 01:32:00,610
about what protocols that'll be because

2033
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:05,620
DNS has no authorization so we have to

2034
01:32:00,610 --> 01:32:09,099
that is something else in DNS expansion

2035
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:12,760
to this the this draft is expansion to

2036
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:14,350
800 3 the registration extension the

2037
01:32:12,760 --> 01:32:18,010
registration of hierarchal hits is

2038
01:32:14,350 --> 01:32:20,620
always authenticated no your clients no

2039
01:32:18,010 --> 01:32:23,110
support for opportunistic registration

2040
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:26,130
it will be you have to be able to prove

2041
01:32:23,110 --> 01:32:28,509
who you are to be able to register

2042
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:33,730
because what you have to have something

2043
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:36,750
either using an x.509 certain in an egg

2044
01:32:33,730 --> 01:32:39,309
problem or a pub or a pre-shared key

2045
01:32:36,750 --> 01:32:41,830
again where did this device gets pre

2046
01:32:39,310 --> 01:32:44,080
shared key that can be done through some

2047
01:32:41,830 --> 01:32:45,969
sideband furnaces the device first tries

2048
01:32:44,080 --> 01:32:48,460
to register because it has nothing it

2049
01:32:45,969 --> 01:32:52,270
fails but in their registration says no

2050
01:32:48,460 --> 01:32:55,719
semi PSK over to here and it's very

2051
01:32:52,270 --> 01:32:59,770
common what we see today in various web

2052
01:32:55,719 --> 01:33:03,580
base SMS a sending of an authorization

2053
01:32:59,770 --> 01:33:08,679
code method can be used this needs a lot

2054
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:12,040
of work still I won't say they have that

2055
01:33:08,679 --> 01:33:14,949
done again getting in to hit some of the

2056
01:33:12,040 --> 01:33:19,120
other things that can happen is that the

2057
01:33:14,949 --> 01:33:23,440
I to message in the registration can't

2058
01:33:19,120 --> 01:33:25,960
contain a CSR so here's my my hit to my

2059
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:27,879
hi and I'm going to need a certificate

2060
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:29,710
for being used for other sorts of things

2061
01:33:27,880 --> 01:33:36,730
and then the r2 can actually then

2062
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:38,739
contain the clients x.509 certificate

2063
01:33:36,730 --> 01:33:43,629
can use in any other other applications

2064
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:45,870
to assert its client miss there is a new

2065
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:47,440
parameter I'm introducing the client

2066
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:50,260
info for ready

2067
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:53,559
specific information requests this is

2068
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:56,080
just a blob and it be defined by the HTA

2069
01:33:53,560 --> 01:33:58,690
in terms what information Oh give me the

2070
01:33:56,080 --> 01:34:01,570
operators name the operators phone

2071
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:04,299
number whatever other information that

2072
01:34:01,570 --> 01:34:07,960
they may want for it and and whatever

2073
01:34:04,300 --> 01:34:12,520
format this this client info blob will

2074
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:17,199
be and making no attempt yet to find

2075
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:20,440
that the now the operation how this

2076
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:22,719
works you starting from the top they are

2077
01:34:20,440 --> 01:34:26,710
a must have a heart who hit with an HD a

2078
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:28,239
value of zero the HGS must also have

2079
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:31,630
narco here and they register with the

2080
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:36,730
Raa there says I am now a valid HD a

2081
01:34:31,630 --> 01:34:39,910
Raa and the RF provides lookup service

2082
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:42,968
convert confirm that yes this HTA really

2083
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:46,030
did register with me on the the are a

2084
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:48,699
may provide a PKI going back to those

2085
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:54,009
certificates for though they example

2086
01:34:48,699 --> 01:34:56,559
RC 802 four hits inserts the the harken

2087
01:34:54,010 --> 01:34:58,510
insert can be used to sign these client

2088
01:34:56,560 --> 01:35:00,280
registrations and so forth so he can

2089
01:34:58,510 --> 01:35:01,690
have a parallel operation the raw

2090
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:03,670
certificates are all here for the

2091
01:35:01,690 --> 01:35:05,799
efficiencies in the packets but for

2092
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:08,650
those things that that would love and

2093
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:11,020
just and say I got to have x.509 source

2094
01:35:08,650 --> 01:35:15,549
we can do that or there's also work in

2095
01:35:11,020 --> 01:35:17,440
chose it in for a concise object ID and

2096
01:35:15,550 --> 01:35:22,510
that may be yet another alternative for

2097
01:35:17,440 --> 01:35:26,679
that work so the eyes may provide other

2098
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:28,719
signed objects for FDA validity this

2099
01:35:26,680 --> 01:35:33,850
gets back into what Adam was talking

2100
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:35,830
about as an example of them the the HD a

2101
01:35:33,850 --> 01:35:39,130
can then use this and client hit

2102
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:41,260
registration so again this is then this

2103
01:35:39,130 --> 01:35:43,960
is proof of registration message this

2104
01:35:41,260 --> 01:35:47,020
200 bytes thing that I created that the

2105
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:49,989
cloak and then the the drunk and then

2106
01:35:47,020 --> 01:35:52,900
provide this the observing say yes all

2107
01:35:49,989 --> 01:35:53,709
this this is the h JS proof of

2108
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:57,040
registration

2109
01:35:53,710 --> 01:36:00,880
thus I know that this drones claim that

2110
01:35:57,040 --> 01:36:03,159
it is registered with DHS

2111
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:06,159
is truthful and valid and I can now

2112
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:10,299
assume that this is a DHS drone oh this

2113
01:36:06,159 --> 01:36:15,339
is a whatever other registry and gives

2114
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:17,770
us that information so that's kind of a

2115
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:20,800
fast run through read my drafts I have

2116
01:36:17,770 --> 01:36:23,170
it in there the drafts are not long of

2117
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,500
course they assume that you know a bit

2118
01:36:23,170 --> 01:36:28,330
about here before you get into them

2119
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:31,570
there are fairly short drafts that that

2120
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:33,280
that shows how this process works and I

2121
01:36:31,570 --> 01:36:36,519
believe that it then would allow us to

2122
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:39,550
have a trust of all ID which then can be

2123
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:43,239
used in the work that Adam is doing and

2124
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:46,150
scalable authorities and and and

2125
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:49,959
protection against cloning protection

2126
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:56,259
against flossed claims of identity and

2127
01:36:49,960 --> 01:37:03,580
have this trustable actionable IDs good

2128
01:36:56,260 --> 01:37:05,530
questions I have one more set of slides

2129
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:13,900
okay so put them in you and Dad elastic

2130
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:16,900
yeah they're elastic dough if you can

2131
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:23,920
keep it like I mean be concise that it's

2132
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:28,769
this fast hello

2133
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,770
is she not responding okay so can you

2134
01:37:31,290 --> 01:37:35,739
okay

2135
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:40,389
what's new is adding the EDD sa

2136
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:48,400
algorithms for highs and the new hash

2137
01:37:40,389 --> 01:37:50,889
algorithms which is saw three shakes

2138
01:37:48,400 --> 01:37:53,259
each shake and kmac these change

2139
01:37:50,889 --> 01:37:56,290
everything in how we do things in hip

2140
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:58,150
and and they're really I'm really

2141
01:37:56,290 --> 01:38:03,010
fascinated by them what they change and

2142
01:37:58,150 --> 01:38:05,589
finally a new aad I'm using k ik as a

2143
01:38:03,010 --> 01:38:07,719
placeholder as mist is still having the

2144
01:38:05,590 --> 01:38:09,250
lightweight competition I really like k

2145
01:38:07,719 --> 01:38:10,929
AK for a lot of reasons but I'm not a

2146
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:12,190
crack whore I will not at all be

2147
01:38:10,929 --> 01:38:13,320
involved in the decision-making process

2148
01:38:12,190 --> 01:38:15,540
I'm just

2149
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:17,670
plumber that uses this stuff but the

2150
01:38:15,540 --> 01:38:20,910
beauty about k AK over the other Gris

2151
01:38:17,670 --> 01:38:25,080
it's the same code base as all the rest

2152
01:38:20,910 --> 01:38:26,010
of the as a hashes so in terms of code

2153
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:29,490
savings

2154
01:38:26,010 --> 01:38:33,660
it's or FPGA implementation it's really

2155
01:38:29,490 --> 01:38:36,719
using all the same stuff this changes

2156
01:38:33,660 --> 01:38:40,010
everything in hippie to crypto smaller

2157
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:40,010
lighter faster

2158
01:38:41,630 --> 01:38:53,760
EDD sa is a fine IRC 8230 to only using

2159
01:38:47,220 --> 01:38:57,060
the the 255 19 and the 448 not using the

2160
01:38:53,760 --> 01:39:00,990
pre hash forms i we don't like the fact

2161
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:05,100
that you saw 512 and I've been given how

2162
01:39:00,990 --> 01:39:06,540
to comment on what is it 165 anyway

2163
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:07,620
there's there's a standard and this is

2164
01:39:06,540 --> 01:39:09,840
coming out which give me a place to

2165
01:39:07,620 --> 01:39:12,540
comment about this because this may be

2166
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:16,080
the only place the device may be needing

2167
01:39:12,540 --> 01:39:21,090
to use the old Shaw forms because

2168
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:24,720
handling the the 2 for 519 that's that's

2169
01:39:21,090 --> 01:39:29,730
a side issue and outside of its use if

2170
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:36,750
key here is small key size only 32 bytes

2171
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:39,509
44 519 and 57 by 4 4 4 8 y 57 at 84 it's

2172
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:41,760
not called gory locks for nothing if you

2173
01:39:39,510 --> 01:39:43,380
all followed it wasn't-it of discussions

2174
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:48,450
the rest of it why was a car going locks

2175
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:51,840
just just enough crypto signatures are

2176
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:54,570
twice this size so the public key is 32

2177
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,070
bytes the signature is 64 bytes and

2178
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:57,870
that's we're working with there's

2179
01:39:56,070 --> 01:40:01,969
nothing else out there of this size

2180
01:39:57,870 --> 01:40:06,150
which is reliably secure and usable

2181
01:40:01,970 --> 01:40:09,120
purity for 519 and careful for 8 natural

2182
01:40:06,150 --> 01:40:11,610
compression representation this applies

2183
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:14,160
to EDD si as well no patent issues as

2184
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:16,530
within this p2 by 6 which has the

2185
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:19,530
complete compressed format patent from

2186
01:40:16,530 --> 01:40:22,019
Sirte Cobb is already specified here Dex

2187
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:25,460
but that static there's hi this is not

2188
01:40:22,020 --> 01:40:25,460
adding it as a ephemeral diffie-hellman

2189
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,780
hassey of all manners hippie uses

2190
01:40:28,020 --> 01:40:32,940
hatchets in many places in many ways

2191
01:40:29,780 --> 01:40:35,099
kept check is a major change approach to

2192
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:37,559
hashing and a symphony impact on many

2193
01:40:35,100 --> 01:40:39,660
aspects of hip as its as sponges are

2194
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:42,840
amazing things if you want to learn

2195
01:40:39,660 --> 01:40:46,050
about them go to catch X site lots of

2196
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:48,630
documents out there 5202 itself has some

2197
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:53,160
very good details on how the sponges

2198
01:40:48,630 --> 01:40:57,030
work and 801 85 expands considerably on

2199
01:40:53,160 --> 01:41:01,080
on the variable outputs as well as 56

2200
01:40:57,030 --> 01:41:05,040
er1 funky material generation and yet

2201
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:07,559
there's no one coming up soon so shake

2202
01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,030
rattle and rock shake and its

2203
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:11,840
derivatives provide variable length

2204
01:41:09,030 --> 01:41:14,460
output with known cryptographic strength

2205
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:17,880
this is really something new in the area

2206
01:41:14,460 --> 01:41:20,580
of hashes not a fixed length output but

2207
01:41:17,880 --> 01:41:22,320
a variable length output maybe we should

2208
01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:24,360
call it have been called squeeze because

2209
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:27,179
the content is you put all your data

2210
01:41:24,360 --> 01:41:30,360
into the sponge and then you squeeze out

2211
01:41:27,180 --> 01:41:32,490
as many as bits as you want no more

2212
01:41:30,360 --> 01:41:35,280
truncating hashes no more debating about

2213
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:36,840
how to truncate the ashes this is

2214
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:41,070
important packet as I said for orchids

2215
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:42,630
and and instead of know which bitches

2216
01:41:41,070 --> 01:41:43,920
select and even see orchid take some

2217
01:41:42,630 --> 01:41:46,170
middle bits other people's take the

2218
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:49,290
front bits something fat bits that's a

2219
01:41:46,170 --> 01:41:53,520
longer issue shake 128 for the our hash

2220
01:41:49,290 --> 01:41:57,120
in in in here another significant change

2221
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:59,610
is using K Mac which is another shake

2222
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:03,900
variant came at does in one sponge

2223
01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:06,690
function which H Mac needs to ashes so

2224
01:42:03,900 --> 01:42:10,080
there's no truncated needed for hip Mac

2225
01:42:06,690 --> 01:42:12,830
and hip Mac to they are naturally you're

2226
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:16,980
using K MEK you get the size you need

2227
01:42:12,830 --> 01:42:20,100
came at for the key mat production and

2228
01:42:16,980 --> 01:42:22,019
here's a really big one and it amazes me

2229
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,880
but I've got a lot of confirmation and

2230
01:42:22,020 --> 01:42:27,000
if I really need the cryptographers way

2231
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:30,810
in this one because according to 56 see

2232
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:37,050
one you have one kmac operation for what

2233
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:40,080
h mat does h Mac needs to HK DF it does

2234
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:44,220
to HVAC operations for

2235
01:42:40,080 --> 01:42:46,740
h k DF and that's the stu each to sha

2236
01:42:44,220 --> 01:42:49,650
operations so one sponge operation

2237
01:42:46,740 --> 01:42:51,900
equals four hash operations and what we

2238
01:42:49,650 --> 01:42:53,759
traditionally do jury's still on this

2239
01:42:51,900 --> 01:42:55,830
construction only couple cryptographers

2240
01:42:53,760 --> 01:43:01,920
have commented but i seem to have a

2241
01:42:55,830 --> 01:43:05,750
right but a warrants more review the

2242
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:08,250
lightweight aad cipher this is a active

2243
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:11,340
competition going on in this no winner

2244
01:43:08,250 --> 01:43:14,430
yet but k ik is cat check base and the

2245
01:43:11,340 --> 01:43:16,620
same code base and if he PR g

2246
01:43:14,430 --> 01:43:17,010
implementation it's a good for starting

2247
01:43:16,620 --> 01:43:19,290
point

2248
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:24,300
i also be working on a draft we're using

2249
01:43:19,290 --> 01:43:28,470
it in ESP for additional cipher for ESP

2250
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:35,240
and i am using it in in hip cipher and

2251
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:41,340
find the the p RF no pudding today and

2252
01:43:35,240 --> 01:43:44,460
so appendix 185 appendix speed sells how

2253
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:46,110
you can use shake as your PRF of

2254
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:49,140
construction if you need that any

2255
01:43:46,110 --> 01:43:52,830
implementation so I kind of ran through

2256
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:54,570
it it is all new crypto coming in on but

2257
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:56,040
well establish crypto and it does him

2258
01:43:54,570 --> 01:43:57,900
input and it's kind of like I find

2259
01:43:56,040 --> 01:44:00,030
interesting that nowhere else not yet

2260
01:43:57,900 --> 01:44:03,830
them I've seen discussion about the cat

2261
01:44:00,030 --> 01:44:06,120
check hashes so Eric code marks or

2262
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:08,610
turning translate this to mind not

2263
01:44:06,120 --> 01:44:10,410
knowing any of this so what are the

2264
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:11,849
benefits is it that we can get smaller

2265
01:44:10,410 --> 01:44:14,130
signatures with the same level of

2266
01:44:11,850 --> 01:44:16,050
security it was more like flexible

2267
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:19,740
flexibility in terms of how big remain

2268
01:44:16,050 --> 01:44:23,130
smaller some EDD s a smaller signature

2269
01:44:19,740 --> 01:44:28,010
small signature smaller public keys the

2270
01:44:23,130 --> 01:44:33,270
hashing faster hashing light away code

2271
01:44:28,010 --> 01:44:36,030
and and in the case of the of the the

2272
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:39,090
macking and and the key generation fewer

2273
01:44:36,030 --> 01:44:42,090
operations less load on the small

2274
01:44:39,090 --> 01:44:43,740
devices actually these we call small

2275
01:44:42,090 --> 01:44:45,150
devices remember they're throwing a

2276
01:44:43,740 --> 01:44:46,830
tremendous amount of power for that for

2277
01:44:45,150 --> 01:44:48,330
their navigation tremendous amount of

2278
01:44:46,830 --> 01:44:50,880
power for their cameras these are

2279
01:44:48,330 --> 01:44:53,730
typically quite capable devices further

2280
01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:56,460
says it we don't want to erase any of

2281
01:44:53,730 --> 01:44:58,620
capability on crypto Kryptos too

2282
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:01,230
expensive we need it for the to keep the

2283
01:44:58,620 --> 01:45:03,809
bird in the plane so again keeping it

2284
01:45:01,230 --> 01:45:06,540
even small for them for this case is is

2285
01:45:03,810 --> 01:45:11,330
very important so let's say oh I guess I

2286
01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:11,330
can afford to do this okay thanks

2287
01:45:11,989 --> 01:45:17,309
more questions

2288
01:45:14,060 --> 01:45:19,500
Andrew Berger it's a bit rich to hear

2289
01:45:17,310 --> 01:45:22,080
you a UAV people talking about crypto

2290
01:45:19,500 --> 01:45:23,730
being too expensive when just the heat

2291
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:26,010
dissipation of the MOSFETs the speed

2292
01:45:23,730 --> 01:45:27,929
controllers exceeds the power

2293
01:45:26,010 --> 01:45:32,970
consumption of the entire radio system

2294
01:45:27,930 --> 01:45:40,050
and computer but anyway well we need for

2295
01:45:32,970 --> 01:45:44,390
that and do you know of any formal

2296
01:45:40,050 --> 01:45:47,610
analysis of the came out construction

2297
01:45:44,390 --> 01:45:49,640
I've just been looking on the catch AK

2298
01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:51,929
team page and there's a bunch of like

2299
01:45:49,640 --> 01:45:54,030
people who've done like practical crypt

2300
01:45:51,930 --> 01:45:56,790
analysis but is there any reason we

2301
01:45:54,030 --> 01:46:04,559
believe the construction itself is in

2302
01:45:56,790 --> 01:46:05,730
any way secure i I've imported various

2303
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:08,700
things and all the things I've been

2304
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:10,530
pointed to answer that question I am NOT

2305
01:46:08,700 --> 01:46:12,540
the cryptographer in the room

2306
01:46:10,530 --> 01:46:14,730
I am the crypto plumber I've been told

2307
01:46:12,540 --> 01:46:19,170
that these things have been extensive

2308
01:46:14,730 --> 01:46:20,910
evaluated you can trust mr. surprising

2309
01:46:19,170 --> 01:46:27,690
and trust NIST to put them in his

2310
01:46:20,910 --> 01:46:30,330
standards but others are using it and it

2311
01:46:27,690 --> 01:46:32,009
is what it is it is it is pretty amazing

2312
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:34,380
I'm hoping that this will then drive

2313
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:39,510
more his valuation for this right now

2314
01:46:34,380 --> 01:46:44,340
where is it being used as far as I know

2315
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:45,510
no where and as Network time NTP um but

2316
01:46:44,340 --> 01:46:47,730
okay it's fine

2317
01:46:45,510 --> 01:46:50,430
could you I know put on the mailing list

2318
01:46:47,730 --> 01:46:52,110
or something a list of all the papers

2319
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:54,360
you've been pointed to just hope people

2320
01:46:52,110 --> 01:46:57,450
like me to have a look at I will try to

2321
01:46:54,360 --> 01:47:00,150
dig it all together I've been I've been

2322
01:46:57,450 --> 01:47:01,739
talking with Johan diamond in in Belgium

2323
01:47:00,150 --> 01:47:04,170
she's been speaking to him directly and

2324
01:47:01,739 --> 01:47:07,150
some of the others I'm also in the past

2325
01:47:04,170 --> 01:47:08,880
in CFR G we've had I forget the

2326
01:47:07,150 --> 01:47:11,349
name whose attended a couple of sessions

2327
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:14,170
one of the the other members with the

2328
01:47:11,350 --> 01:47:16,120
the the monkey hash they've been making

2329
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:19,570
their punky twelve hash so they've been

2330
01:47:16,120 --> 01:47:22,210
here as well and so they told me number

2331
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:23,830
of things about it but yeah I will I

2332
01:47:22,210 --> 01:47:26,620
will dig through my emails to find out

2333
01:47:23,830 --> 01:47:29,500
what I have there and and share those

2334
01:47:26,620 --> 01:47:30,969
that'd be great thank you thank you okay

2335
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,159
so thanks that this has been all the

2336
01:47:30,969 --> 01:47:34,810
presentations and you know we had good

2337
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:36,400
discussions which is good so now we're

2338
01:47:34,810 --> 01:47:38,440
gonna move today thank you Bob

2339
01:47:36,400 --> 01:47:40,269
the last part of the meeting which is

2340
01:47:38,440 --> 01:47:43,449
that you know Bob put together actually

2341
01:47:40,270 --> 01:47:46,150
a charter proposal which I mean the idea

2342
01:47:43,449 --> 01:47:47,620
is not to to do our committee edit in or

2343
01:47:46,150 --> 01:47:49,989
something like that obviously so go to

2344
01:47:47,620 --> 01:47:51,610
their materials page and you can you

2345
01:47:49,989 --> 01:47:54,309
know get it there I mean we are

2346
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:55,809
projecting but you know I mean you know

2347
01:47:54,310 --> 01:47:58,150
scrolling up and down is not gonna work

2348
01:47:55,810 --> 01:48:00,659
for everyone so so you know it's it's

2349
01:47:58,150 --> 01:48:03,489
online available and the idea is with

2350
01:48:00,659 --> 01:48:05,860
all the presentations the you know

2351
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:08,259
problem space the the basically

2352
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:09,610
constraints you know the the initial

2353
01:48:08,260 --> 01:48:12,270
approach that they are using to solve

2354
01:48:09,610 --> 01:48:15,159
this whether or not it's worth it

2355
01:48:12,270 --> 01:48:16,810
basically chartering a working group or

2356
01:48:15,159 --> 01:48:18,489
rich artery in the heap working group so

2357
01:48:16,810 --> 01:48:21,130
so that's the question we are having

2358
01:48:18,489 --> 01:48:23,320
here so please take a few seconds to

2359
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:27,239
read through it and and then we will

2360
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:30,370
move into it into the questions but just

2361
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:32,919
maybe one comment if you go through the

2362
01:48:30,370 --> 01:48:35,769
Charter is that the expectation is that

2363
01:48:32,920 --> 01:48:40,390
the the work is being driven in a pretty

2364
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:42,909
fast way so exactly into considerations

2365
01:48:40,390 --> 01:48:44,770
there is one comment earlier in the ball

2366
01:48:42,909 --> 01:48:47,049
of the line were that we'll be adding

2367
01:48:44,770 --> 01:48:50,140
here and this liaison with other

2368
01:48:47,050 --> 01:48:53,080
organizations like yes that's not in

2369
01:48:50,140 --> 01:48:56,199
this draft that will be in the final two

2370
01:48:53,080 --> 01:48:59,130
final charter yeah I captured a diva

2371
01:48:56,199 --> 01:48:59,129
notes yeah good point

2372
01:49:00,480 --> 01:49:05,320
it's to card here so obviously there's a

2373
01:49:03,340 --> 01:49:07,810
question of do we take this on at all

2374
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:09,280
and then if the answer is yes that we

2375
01:49:07,810 --> 01:49:12,250
take this on at all there's the question

2376
01:49:09,280 --> 01:49:15,400
of do we reach other the hip working

2377
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:18,550
group to add this scope or do we create

2378
01:49:15,400 --> 01:49:20,969
a new TM grid working group because I

2379
01:49:18,550 --> 01:49:23,760
don't think hip is the end of the store

2380
01:49:20,969 --> 01:49:25,800
in terms of application application of

2381
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:27,479
various IETF standardized protocols to

2382
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:28,889
this problem space I think we're gonna

2383
01:49:27,479 --> 01:49:30,749
need help in DNS we're gonna need help

2384
01:49:28,889 --> 01:49:32,610
in in in our DAP and who knows what all

2385
01:49:30,749 --> 01:49:34,469
else last thing that I want to mention

2386
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:36,598
is I know that a consideration is

2387
01:49:34,469 --> 01:49:40,439
whether there will be available manpower

2388
01:49:36,599 --> 01:49:46,939
to work this if you take it on and back

2389
01:49:40,439 --> 01:49:50,729
at the ranch we have Adam James Joe Matt

2390
01:49:46,939 --> 01:49:52,289
Ryan and Zev II so k66 young developers

2391
01:49:50,729 --> 01:49:56,789
not cutting me because I'm useless at

2392
01:49:52,289 --> 01:49:58,530
this point he's not in yes we have but

2393
01:49:56,789 --> 01:50:00,688
we have six young developers who are not

2394
01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:02,728
focused exclusively on the remote ID

2395
01:50:00,689 --> 01:50:09,119
problem but they are focused exclusively

2396
01:50:02,729 --> 01:50:12,209
on communications for or communications

2397
01:50:09,119 --> 01:50:14,429
and networking for small UAS and a big

2398
01:50:12,209 --> 01:50:16,800
part of that is is the remote ID problem

2399
01:50:14,429 --> 01:50:18,989
specifically so and these guys are fully

2400
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:22,829
funded for like the next 18 months so we

2401
01:50:18,989 --> 01:50:25,348
have we have programmer cycles to work

2402
01:50:22,829 --> 01:50:29,849
on prototype implementations for the

2403
01:50:25,349 --> 01:50:31,289
necessary implement interoperability

2404
01:50:29,849 --> 01:50:33,539
testing to move this forward on the

2405
01:50:31,289 --> 01:50:37,978
standards track okay good thank you

2406
01:50:33,539 --> 01:50:39,360
I'm Eric so Eric not my my question was

2407
01:50:37,979 --> 01:50:41,579
going to be about the other pieces right

2408
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:44,489
because I can see that and people are

2409
01:50:41,579 --> 01:50:46,320
presented or Bob is presented they hit

2410
01:50:44,489 --> 01:50:48,749
part of things right but then the order

2411
01:50:46,320 --> 01:50:50,429
thing because still you're hinting

2412
01:50:48,749 --> 01:50:52,559
earlier maybe thought that maybe it's

2413
01:50:50,429 --> 01:50:55,079
something like order up right and is

2414
01:50:52,559 --> 01:50:57,749
that something that is can be done later

2415
01:50:55,079 --> 01:50:59,159
or you know because it's not in the list

2416
01:50:57,749 --> 01:51:03,449
of deliverables right now as I

2417
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:05,938
understand it Bob do you want to address

2418
01:51:03,449 --> 01:51:07,739
that I'll address that first I want to

2419
01:51:05,939 --> 01:51:11,760
address something that Stu said and that

2420
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:13,558
is just be though yes we Stu's company

2421
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:17,610
they work for it has resources on this

2422
01:51:13,559 --> 01:51:19,679
please other people join in and make

2423
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:23,669
make it a broader effort but now to

2424
01:51:19,679 --> 01:51:25,739
Eric's comment there's like I got two

2425
01:51:23,669 --> 01:51:28,219
lines in there talking about the our DAP

2426
01:51:25,739 --> 01:51:31,468
it maybe I need to expend more on

2427
01:51:28,219 --> 01:51:34,770
interacting with with other areas and I

2428
01:51:31,469 --> 01:51:37,200
welcome help on expanded because it

2429
01:51:34,770 --> 01:51:41,780
there is a need that we've alluded to

2430
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:44,849
here on how does this the safety officer

2431
01:51:41,780 --> 01:51:46,950
authenticate and get the PI they're

2432
01:51:44,850 --> 01:51:48,570
allowed to get is this something that

2433
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:51,389
we're going to address in this workgroup

2434
01:51:48,570 --> 01:51:54,719
and how do we do it what things do we

2435
01:51:51,390 --> 01:51:57,870
need or do we just profile something

2436
01:51:54,720 --> 01:52:00,950
existing so that so the workgroup I

2437
01:51:57,870 --> 01:52:04,140
think will we need to look at this and

2438
01:52:00,950 --> 01:52:10,530
make a selection and minimally do a

2439
01:52:04,140 --> 01:52:10,950
profile of how that is done thank you

2440
01:52:10,530 --> 01:52:14,009
Bob

2441
01:52:10,950 --> 01:52:17,099
Andrew enter MacGregor I think the hip

2442
01:52:14,010 --> 01:52:22,110
parts of that chatter are reasonably

2443
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:24,000
complete and insensible I think because

2444
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,830
we noted noting that there are things to

2445
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,490
be done in other parts of the of the

2446
01:52:25,830 --> 01:52:29,130
protocol stack

2447
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:32,190
I think the chart is not sufficiently

2448
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:35,280
complete at this stage to know what the

2449
01:52:32,190 --> 01:52:37,980
scope is that said it should probably be

2450
01:52:35,280 --> 01:52:39,690
a working group of its own that is

2451
01:52:37,980 --> 01:52:41,370
chartered to do further work on HIPAA

2452
01:52:39,690 --> 01:52:44,190
because hip is cut because the hip

2453
01:52:41,370 --> 01:52:47,640
working group is kind of long inactive

2454
01:52:44,190 --> 01:52:50,309
at this point in time and if the scope

2455
01:52:47,640 --> 01:52:58,260
is substantially different it does also

2456
01:52:50,310 --> 01:53:01,380
deserve a new name and Whittaker I just

2457
01:52:58,260 --> 01:53:03,470
want to make another point for a working

2458
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,460
group thing it's trustworthy

2459
01:53:03,470 --> 01:53:08,010
multi-purpose remote ID that's kind of

2460
01:53:05,460 --> 01:53:10,860
what we're calling this there are other

2461
01:53:08,010 --> 01:53:14,430
places that remote ID that we need to be

2462
01:53:10,860 --> 01:53:16,679
trustworthy could be applied in it's

2463
01:53:14,430 --> 01:53:20,970
something that we know that's there and

2464
01:53:16,680 --> 01:53:23,310
if we can get something there I don't

2465
01:53:20,970 --> 01:53:25,710
know what it looks like right now but I

2466
01:53:23,310 --> 01:53:29,610
know that I want I don't I don't want to

2467
01:53:25,710 --> 01:53:31,920
save the word but IOT because that's a

2468
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:35,820
very dangerous word to speak here I

2469
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:37,440
think um because it's quite a big term

2470
01:53:35,820 --> 01:53:40,019
and has a lot of people involved in it

2471
01:53:37,440 --> 01:53:41,849
but you know IOT devices and as Stu was

2472
01:53:40,020 --> 01:53:43,860
saying you have a thing in front of you

2473
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:45,940
you want to idea and you want to be you

2474
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:47,530
want to trust it I think that is

2475
01:53:45,940 --> 01:53:50,889
a big piece of this but I don't know how

2476
01:53:47,530 --> 01:53:52,750
it fits overall okay thank you I know

2477
01:53:50,890 --> 01:53:56,739
they can please keep your your questions

2478
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:58,390
concise and comments so I guess there's

2479
01:53:56,739 --> 01:54:00,280
one question wasn't answered about order

2480
01:53:58,390 --> 01:54:02,170
so he said time frame wise

2481
01:54:00,280 --> 01:54:04,090
could it be deferred for six months to

2482
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:06,010
work on those pieces what do we need to

2483
01:54:04,090 --> 01:54:07,660
put it up front because we need to get

2484
01:54:06,010 --> 01:54:09,730
the complete sort of registration

2485
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:12,099
process that includes the hip part of

2486
01:54:09,730 --> 01:54:14,500
the registration and the registration of

2487
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:17,410
the other information into an order Pike

2488
01:54:14,500 --> 01:54:18,580
thing right that's like because it

2489
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:20,170
affects the shorter because if it

2490
01:54:18,580 --> 01:54:22,900
doesn't need to be started now we could

2491
01:54:20,170 --> 01:54:27,430
say okay it will show up later right not

2492
01:54:22,900 --> 01:54:30,309
an immediate worker yeah us to cut here

2493
01:54:27,430 --> 01:54:36,460
um I can't answer the question but I can

2494
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:41,680
tell you what ASTM has done ASTM says in

2495
01:54:36,460 --> 01:54:46,060
their WK 6500 41 work item that a

2496
01:54:41,680 --> 01:54:48,430
registry is essential but defining how

2497
01:54:46,060 --> 01:54:50,500
that registry will do its job is out of

2498
01:54:48,430 --> 01:54:52,239
scope for this particular standard this

2499
01:54:50,500 --> 01:54:54,730
particular standard will address only

2500
01:54:52,239 --> 01:54:57,940
I'm talking about the ASTM standard well

2501
01:54:54,730 --> 01:55:00,580
address only how the identification is

2502
01:54:57,940 --> 01:55:04,089
done how you then use that ID that you

2503
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:06,489
have acquired to look up data was was

2504
01:55:04,090 --> 01:55:10,060
left for the diligent student I think

2505
01:55:06,489 --> 01:55:13,809
that is a major material omission that

2506
01:55:10,060 --> 01:55:16,600
does need to be addressed but if ASTM

2507
01:55:13,810 --> 01:55:19,630
can punt it temporarily we could put it

2508
01:55:16,600 --> 01:55:21,790
temporarily okay and we yeah and we are

2509
01:55:19,630 --> 01:55:25,330
cutting the line now to Andrew Andrew

2510
01:55:21,790 --> 01:55:28,230
McGregor - forgotten your name to the

2511
01:55:25,330 --> 01:55:32,730
point about other areas than aviation

2512
01:55:28,230 --> 01:55:37,809
Adam Adam - Adams point I note that

2513
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:39,730
marine traffic control and and

2514
01:55:37,810 --> 01:55:43,120
transformative protocols and and the

2515
01:55:39,730 --> 01:55:46,419
like are based on the aviation ones and

2516
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:49,559
very very similar and well marine

2517
01:55:46,420 --> 01:55:53,469
autonomous lauder vehicles are a thing

2518
01:55:49,560 --> 01:55:55,690
and I have no idea who to contact in the

2519
01:55:53,469 --> 01:55:57,610
protocol space for that but having been

2520
01:55:55,690 --> 01:55:59,730
involved in in new zealand's Coast Guard

2521
01:55:57,610 --> 01:56:03,219
I can probably find someone who does

2522
01:55:59,730 --> 01:56:04,540
Thank You Andrew West herd occur I say

2523
01:56:03,219 --> 01:56:06,849
so one of the things that confused me

2524
01:56:04,540 --> 01:56:08,079
about sort of how you're supposed to

2525
01:56:06,849 --> 01:56:09,190
think about all of these little pieces

2526
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:11,380
that have been talked about in the past

2527
01:56:09,190 --> 01:56:12,909
two hours right some feel fairly

2528
01:56:11,380 --> 01:56:14,320
straightforward it's like we can just

2529
01:56:12,909 --> 01:56:16,000
throw it over the wall to hip and we can

2530
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:18,579
add it to their Charter and and you know

2531
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,320
then you can use those pieces for the

2532
01:56:18,579 --> 01:56:22,150
much harder building blocks that you

2533
01:56:20,320 --> 01:56:24,009
know related to aviation identification

2534
01:56:22,150 --> 01:56:26,920
with all of the problems and all of the

2535
01:56:24,010 --> 01:56:28,389
we need help in these ten areas it

2536
01:56:26,920 --> 01:56:29,619
doesn't seem like an existing working

2537
01:56:28,389 --> 01:56:31,179
groups going to be able to take on

2538
01:56:29,619 --> 01:56:32,619
something that large without you know

2539
01:56:31,179 --> 01:56:35,079
doubling their time or something like

2540
01:56:32,619 --> 01:56:36,489
that so it's almost like you guys have

2541
01:56:35,079 --> 01:56:38,170
two different charters that you're

2542
01:56:36,489 --> 01:56:40,629
talking about one small and constrained

2543
01:56:38,170 --> 01:56:46,599
and one yet you have a scoping problem

2544
01:56:40,630 --> 01:56:48,010
so okay so yeah the last few minutes

2545
01:56:46,599 --> 01:56:51,790
we're gonna go through through the

2546
01:56:48,010 --> 01:56:53,829
questions and then we will ask the ad if

2547
01:56:51,790 --> 01:56:56,409
he needs more clarification or you know

2548
01:56:53,829 --> 01:56:58,690
so so the first one is basically you

2549
01:56:56,409 --> 01:57:00,670
know the scenario we we talked about the

2550
01:56:58,690 --> 01:57:02,230
scope so is there support to form

2551
01:57:00,670 --> 01:57:04,030
basically working good let's assume that

2552
01:57:02,230 --> 01:57:05,530
we are forming a new working group as I

2553
01:57:04,030 --> 01:57:07,300
said you know we charter in four minutes

2554
01:57:05,530 --> 01:57:11,619
is really a detail at the end of the day

2555
01:57:07,300 --> 01:57:14,260
so first of all and I'm gonna take it be

2556
01:57:11,619 --> 01:57:16,509
taking hands you know for and against so

2557
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:17,949
who thinks that this report or who

2558
01:57:16,510 --> 01:57:19,719
thinks that you know we we should be

2559
01:57:17,949 --> 01:57:20,259
forming a working group to follow this

2560
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:26,349
charter

2561
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:28,810
please hum all against so for tonight a

2562
01:57:26,349 --> 01:57:35,650
note-taker which is me that was a strong

2563
01:57:28,810 --> 01:57:37,840
support to form a working group so well

2564
01:57:35,650 --> 01:57:39,280
the Charter as us as Bob said I mean we

2565
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:42,579
see this was kind of like a draft

2566
01:57:39,280 --> 01:57:45,009
charter you know he will basically work

2567
01:57:42,579 --> 01:57:46,750
with with you know the ideas and to

2568
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:48,340
basically complete it and there were

2569
01:57:46,750 --> 01:57:50,349
some comments that maybe needs to be

2570
01:57:48,340 --> 01:57:52,810
divided into two working groups so we

2571
01:57:50,349 --> 01:57:55,270
will look into all that so the the

2572
01:57:52,810 --> 01:57:56,889
second is you know the community thing

2573
01:57:55,270 --> 01:57:59,560
that the problem statement is clear well

2574
01:57:56,889 --> 01:58:01,900
scope and so level and it would be

2575
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:09,570
useful to solve so again please hum if

2576
01:58:01,900 --> 01:58:09,570
you think that's true okay all against

2577
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:14,850
okay so basically I mean I like my

2578
01:58:12,989 --> 01:58:17,639
summaries that you know we we need to

2579
01:58:14,850 --> 01:58:19,980
work more on the scope and I'm basically

2580
01:58:17,640 --> 01:58:21,239
not clarify a bit or I think it was

2581
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:25,199
clear from the discussion that the

2582
01:58:21,239 --> 01:58:27,269
concern was only scope yeah yeah yeah

2583
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:29,190
exactly um they were discussions like

2584
01:58:27,270 --> 01:58:30,960
yeah either even how many working groups

2585
01:58:29,190 --> 01:58:33,809
we would need if this had general

2586
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,340
problem versus the specific one so so we

2587
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:39,780
got all the questions and I think we can

2588
01:58:35,340 --> 01:58:41,310
we can work on something and now and as

2589
01:58:39,780 --> 01:58:42,840
you know I mentioned before and and the

2590
01:58:41,310 --> 01:58:45,239
Institute was following up on that we

2591
01:58:42,840 --> 01:58:47,370
need to basically you know get a fill of

2592
01:58:45,239 --> 01:58:49,049
you know the level of commitment and the

2593
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:50,340
level of energy and the level of you

2594
01:58:49,050 --> 01:58:52,739
know the number of cycles people are

2595
01:58:50,340 --> 01:58:54,360
going to be able to spend on these so

2596
01:58:52,739 --> 01:58:59,339
the first one is like who would be

2597
01:58:54,360 --> 01:59:02,900
willing to review documents and and this

2598
01:58:59,340 --> 01:59:02,900
is not a ham please raise your hands

2599
01:59:03,230 --> 01:59:08,250
yeah yeah of course I'm right in

2600
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:11,790
reviewing and can you confirm this on

2601
01:59:08,250 --> 01:59:15,350
the mailing list please take it yeah but

2602
01:59:11,790 --> 01:59:17,310
but show like yeah show of hands so that

2603
01:59:15,350 --> 01:59:19,620
five six seven eight

2604
01:59:17,310 --> 01:59:27,150
so around eight people that are willing

2605
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:28,680
to review documents and well the editor

2606
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:30,449
we said you know we included in that so

2607
01:59:28,680 --> 01:59:36,239
is eight people willing to edit or

2608
01:59:30,449 --> 01:59:38,489
review documents and yeah then there's

2609
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:47,009
there's more questions or yeah exactly

2610
01:59:38,489 --> 01:59:49,459
so the next well the working group I

2611
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:52,600
think we answered that question already

2612
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:52,600
[Music]

2613
01:59:55,969 --> 02:00:00,690
yeah so I think I mean I think I we have

2614
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:02,550
covered everything so so at this point

2615
02:00:00,690 --> 02:00:04,049
you know I as I said the summary is that

2616
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:06,120
there was a strong support to form a

2617
02:00:04,050 --> 02:00:08,489
working group but we really need to work

2618
02:00:06,120 --> 02:00:10,769
still on on the scope mostly to

2619
02:00:08,489 --> 02:00:13,139
basically scope scope it in a way that

2620
02:00:10,770 --> 02:00:16,050
you know in is not you know too much to

2621
02:00:13,140 --> 02:00:18,510
to chew for a working group and and then

2622
02:00:16,050 --> 02:00:21,079
I saw the energy you know I mean I I

2623
02:00:18,510 --> 02:00:22,880
think if it would be okay

2624
02:00:21,079 --> 02:00:24,170
also I mean following up you're coming

2625
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,820
that there's also people you know

2626
02:00:24,170 --> 02:00:28,250
working let's say back-end support you

2627
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:31,519
know prototyping writing code which is

2628
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:34,130
actually very useful and but I would

2629
02:00:31,520 --> 02:00:36,260
like to think unsound Daniel for sharing

2630
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:39,409
the boss at the point these two

2631
02:00:36,260 --> 02:00:42,860
gentlemen are swamped in the working ITF

2632
02:00:39,409 --> 02:00:45,348
so to note that we will hopefully we'll

2633
02:00:42,860 --> 02:00:47,869
get a work group of this so if you want

2634
02:00:45,349 --> 02:00:50,480
to either have experience as a chair and

2635
02:00:47,869 --> 02:00:53,750
have cycles or you want to get involved

2636
02:00:50,480 --> 02:00:55,579
in this area speak to the ad speak to

2637
02:00:53,750 --> 02:00:58,460
our both chairs yeah yeah and this is

2638
02:00:55,579 --> 02:01:00,320
this is actually a good point so that we

2639
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:01,969
we agreed to help with a with the both

2640
02:01:00,320 --> 02:01:04,489
but going forward we would need also

2641
02:01:01,969 --> 02:01:06,500
people willing to chair and and that put

2642
02:01:04,489 --> 02:01:10,070
you know much more cycles on on this I'm

2643
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:11,599
Stu my parting shot here um I really

2644
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:14,659
want to thank everybody who showed up

2645
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:17,659
today and doubly thank anyone who

2646
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:19,790
chooses to assist us in this work not

2647
02:01:17,659 --> 02:01:22,119
wishing to be well melodramatic I do

2648
02:01:19,790 --> 02:01:25,369
have to say that in all seriousness um

2649
02:01:22,119 --> 02:01:27,290
this can save a bunch of lives thank you

2650
02:01:25,369 --> 02:01:29,719
and to conclude that the meeting I would

2651
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:31,849
like to ask Eric if you have something

2652
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:34,639
to add you are happy any further

2653
02:01:31,849 --> 02:01:36,349
questions no way first thank you again

2654
02:01:34,639 --> 02:01:40,190
for for doing this and thank you for

2655
02:01:36,349 --> 02:01:43,130
them and and Stu on this Oh usually the

2656
02:01:40,190 --> 02:01:45,469
Charter is not ready to go this is clear

2657
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:48,650
we can do it of course over mailing list

2658
02:01:45,469 --> 02:01:50,360
getting something and we do not need

2659
02:01:48,650 --> 02:01:52,150
another buff maybe to form the working

2660
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:54,259
group so we can go more direct

2661
02:01:52,150 --> 02:01:56,030
everything needs to be completed on the

2662
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:57,710
mailing list I'm afraid there but I'm

2663
02:01:56,030 --> 02:02:00,440
quite positive and I'm pretty happy to

2664
02:01:57,710 --> 02:02:02,869
see big names here and people are

2665
02:02:00,440 --> 02:02:04,879
looking to work beyond ASTM because that

2666
02:02:02,869 --> 02:02:07,130
was my major concern to be honest so

2667
02:02:04,880 --> 02:02:09,409
it's not a single company effort this

2668
02:02:07,130 --> 02:02:11,179
border Thank You Eric so the next step

2669
02:02:09,409 --> 02:02:13,219
we will you know continue working on a

2670
02:02:11,179 --> 02:02:16,760
mailing list on the Charter and the

2671
02:02:13,219 --> 02:02:20,899
meeting is adjourned thank you

2672
02:02:16,760 --> 02:02:20,899
[Applause]
