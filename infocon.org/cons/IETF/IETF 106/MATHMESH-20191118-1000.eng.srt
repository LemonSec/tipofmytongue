1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,750
officialy top of the error yeah sure did

2
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:26,610
you're still walking in actually it's at

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:28,350
least Christ it is the top of the hour

4
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:37,469
we're gonna wait just another minute or

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:39,300
two to let people keep walking in we

6
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,280
apologize for the temperature in the

7
00:00:39,300 --> 00:01:13,890
room there is hot tea and coffee right

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:01:19,439
outside for another minute okay we're

9
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:21,329
gonna start here is the agenda we

10
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,070
already have volunteers for Jabba scribe

11
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:27,110
Thank You Michel a note-taker thanks

12
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:30,089
Melinda blue sheets are going around

13
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:33,420
anyone have any additions or changes

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:38,909
they want to make to the agenda going

15
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:40,829
once going twice sold then oh well this

16
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,119
is the first or second time depending on

17
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,579
what you into yesterday that you've seen

18
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:49,649
it it will not be the last it can it

19
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:52,079
used okay this will not be the last time

20
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,039
you see it so read it now so you don't

21
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,699
have to read it Wednesday Thursday

22
00:01:53,039 --> 00:02:03,229
Friday continued I can't get the the

23
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:05,460
page or the screen size thing to work so

24
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:09,408
all right

25
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,408
and then Wes had a few notes to kick off

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,150
so quick couple of notes on how today is

27
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,900
gonna run and sort of the purpose of

28
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:21,090
this Boff it's gonna start with a number

29
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,060
of presentations by Phil giving sort of

30
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:25,680
a overview of the math mess mathematical

31
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,990
mesh technology that he's bringing to

32
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,030
the ITF it comes from a much larger

33
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,940
framework than he'll be presenting today

34
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,520
but he has lots of information on that

35
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,930
outside this meeting and he's starting

36
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,580
with propose starting candidate of

37
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,390
password management which you'll go into

38
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:44,640
a bit later the goal for us today is to

39
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,589
see if there are pieces of this solution

40
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,049
that are of interest to you regardless

41
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:50,640
of whether the larger framework is you

42
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,230
know your exact need are there pieces

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,910
that might work in other working groups

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,239
or pieces that that might work in other

45
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:59,549
frameworks within the ITF so the purpose

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,290
of today is to to do just that what is

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,150
attractable to the IETF work and

48
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,590
assuming that there is interest in at

49
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,480
least some of them what are the right

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,840
set of starting components as I said

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,119
that his his fuller set of technologies

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,670
is quite large and we need to find a

53
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,130
line of where is the best sub components

54
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:19,230
to start with in the IETF to get started

55
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:21,750
and then to find participants who are

56
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:25,980
able and willing to help do the work as

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:27,930
well so finally as for the agenda the

58
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,730
flow of today is going to be fairly

59
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:31,350
rigorous on the clock management side of

60
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,540
things we're going to keep two fairly

61
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,769
strict times in terms of both the

62
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,320
presentations that Phil's going to give

63
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,480
and then the the clarifying questions

64
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,790
sections do note that the five-minute

65
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,739
clarifying questions are just that we're

66
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,870
gonna leave discussion for a good bed

67
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,030
ugly you know pieces that people love

68
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:50,670
issues that people have with it until

69
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:54,450
later so just clarifying questions after

70
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:55,708
each of those breaks and then after that

71
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,060
we'll have the discussion which will

72
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:58,770
really focus on the components of

73
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:00,540
interest to the IETF what pieces that we

74
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,610
may or may want to want to adopt and

75
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,989
then finally of course we'll talk about

76
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,970
you know determining consensus and

77
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:08,250
conclusions and and is this work

78
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,420
relevant to the IETF and is there

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:18,029
interest in forming a working group

80
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:18,329
around it anything else on you all right

81
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:19,738
so

82
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,729
I think with that we'll turn it over to

83
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:25,830
Phil with the first of the presentations

84
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:32,789
thank you very much for coming here to

85
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:35,878
Chile Singapore okay so what I want to

86
00:04:32,789 --> 00:04:38,159
do here is to give a brief introduction

87
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:40,830
to what the mesh is about and what

88
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:44,610
problems are trying to solve for those

89
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,438
of you who have long flights we also

90
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,000
have a video version of the complete

91
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:52,800
presentation seven hours of them and

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,039
those you can download from the math

93
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:59,190
mesh site so I'm not going to get into

94
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:02,190
the detail technical pieces on any one

95
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:06,479
component here what I want to do here is

96
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,120
to give a an overview of the mesh and

97
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:13,020
what the large problem that we're trying

98
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:29,219
to solve is why that's important and so

99
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:32,219
on okay do I get the ticker okay so the

100
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:36,360
objective of the mesh is to make

101
00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:40,440
computers easier to use by making them

102
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,729
more secure so the first thing that we

103
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,710
want to do is to set a you know we want

104
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,940
to stop trying to do good enough

105
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:53,430
security and make it easy for the user

106
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:56,520
to do things and also get security as a

107
00:05:53,430 --> 00:06:00,180
byproduct and so the first thing we're

108
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:02,669
going to do is Alice today she doesn't

109
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:05,339
just have one computer she has a whole

110
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:07,620
suitcase full and so the first thing

111
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:09,919
we're going to do is to glue all of

112
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,690
Alice's devices together

113
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,378
cryptographically and that is what we

114
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:19,349
call her personal mesh I don't want to

115
00:06:16,379 --> 00:06:21,569
bike shed the name mesh we can leave

116
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:24,469
that so and then once we've done that

117
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:27,240
we're going to use that framework to

118
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:29,849
exchange maintenance messages between

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:31,110
those devices that we've all glued

120
00:06:29,849 --> 00:06:34,590
together

121
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:38,010
and that will allow us to use strong

122
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:41,789
end-to-end encryption with all the

123
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:45,330
applications Alice uses as if Alice had

124
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:48,470
one super device rather than a whole

125
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,760
bunch of itty-bitty devices separate

126
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:53,550
okay so in order to do this we've got

127
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:56,010
three core problems we need to solve the

128
00:06:53,550 --> 00:07:00,210
first is we need to provision private

129
00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:03,570
keys to all the devices so every device

130
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:05,729
is going to have a set of private keys

131
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:09,240
for encryption and authentication and

132
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,060
signature and then the second core

133
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,270
problem is how do we get the public

134
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:17,730
components of those keys to where we

135
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:20,370
need it to be in order to establish our

136
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:20,790
end-to-end cryptography and our data at

137
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,020
rest

138
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:27,030
a cryptography so go to the next slide

139
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,200
oh and the fact that the third problem

140
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:35,789
is to secure data at rest so today

141
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:39,150
security we have a whole bunch of siloed

142
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:42,030
applications that are independent that

143
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:44,729
Alice has to configure on each of her

144
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,900
machines separately and the

145
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:52,500
configuration can be a real hassle I was

146
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:56,669
trying to secure to enable s/mime on a

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,060
really well-known email application it

148
00:07:56,670 --> 00:08:04,340
took me 15 minutes to do that

149
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:07,470
configuration and I know what I'm doing

150
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:11,039
so how is somebody who doesn't know as

151
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:12,660
much about BK I expected to so today

152
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,910
we've got a separate product separate

153
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:17,400
dashboards and security keeps falling

154
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:18,540
through the cracks and so we can glue

155
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,940
all the devices together

156
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:23,450
cryptographically we can start to get a

157
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:26,430
handle on it next slide please

158
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:28,800
so this is the picture of the mesh in

159
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,520
the large and as you can see you know

160
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,940
ITF I've got a narrow waist for you so

161
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,510
the green piece is the mesh itself so

162
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,700
this is the part that is providing Alice

163
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:44,709
with a personal PKI that she's the root

164
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:49,209
of trust for the mesh

165
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:52,118
depends on three based technologies UDF

166
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,540
which is the naming infrastructure dere

167
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:58,990
which is the cryptographic message

168
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:03,279
syntax which is basically pkcs7 Plus

169
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:06,550
blockchain type capabilities and meta

170
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,490
cryptography which is about extending

171
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:11,199
the cryptographic toolset from the one

172
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:15,790
that we use today which was established

173
00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:17,679
by PGP and PEM to add some of the stuff

174
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:20,349
that was invented in 1990s and I'll get

175
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:24,519
onto so I'm going to be addressing each

176
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:27,160
of those blue boxes later on now this is

177
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:31,509
mix-and-match in that you can decide to

178
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:33,579
do any one of those blue boxes you can

179
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:36,009
decide to do any two you can decide to

180
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:38,800
do all three if you want to do the green

181
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:42,970
box you have to do all the blue boxes

182
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,179
because there are dependencies so if we

183
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:49,110
build the mesh we can then build a whole

184
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:51,519
bunch of applications on top of it as

185
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:55,209
I've been thinking about how do we

186
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,819
manage IOT devices how do we enable SSH

187
00:09:55,209 --> 00:10:01,089
s mine PGP how do we make all these

188
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:04,029
things really easy to use so there's a

189
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:05,679
huge expand you know this is a platform

190
00:10:04,029 --> 00:10:11,529
there are lots of things you can build

191
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:13,209
on it but that's obviously too much for

192
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:16,050
one working group so go to the next

193
00:10:13,209 --> 00:10:20,649
slide so what I'm proposing that we do

194
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:28,299
for phase one is we pick one or possibly

195
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:32,679
two of those applications and we use

196
00:10:28,299 --> 00:10:36,129
that to as the proof case in order to

197
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:38,559
build the mesh because yeah I I don't

198
00:10:36,129 --> 00:10:40,569
want to be trying to build 15

199
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,219
applications and do it through a

200
00:10:40,569 --> 00:10:44,199
standard process you know I don't think

201
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:47,019
that works but I also don't want to be

202
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:49,779
designing a platform with no reference

203
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:52,809
application so I think we need to pick

204
00:10:49,779 --> 00:10:55,179
one and the reason I suggest passwords

205
00:10:52,809 --> 00:10:57,339
is first of all it's the smallest one

206
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:58,520
it's about 50 lines of code that is

207
00:10:57,339 --> 00:11:02,270
specific to the password

208
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:06,110
Boult here we go to the next slide it's

209
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:08,870
also where the pain is for the user this

210
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,120
is how we can make computers easy to use

211
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:15,680
by making them more secure because if

212
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:18,620
you take away the pain of passwords from

213
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,239
the user you're doing you know you're

214
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,360
doing them the biggest favor we can do

215
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,810
them in terms of usability - today the

216
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:31,400
long the shortest password that is

217
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:33,859
secure is much longer than the longest

218
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:37,189
password then you can possibly expect a

219
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,990
user to remember and no I'm sorry you

220
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:42,290
cannot get round this with new hash

221
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:46,100
algorithms either I can explain why

222
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:49,160
offline so go to the next one so the

223
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:51,170
mesh password catalog it's as a test

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:52,880
application it tests out almost the

225
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:55,400
whole the mesh infrastructure there's

226
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,540
one piece that it doesn't test out which

227
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:01,189
is deliberate it doesn't add too much to

228
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,640
the code base and it's an immediate

229
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:07,010
value because this is something that

230
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,840
even if one person is using it and

231
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:11,600
nobody else in the world ever uses the

232
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:14,090
mesh that person can get value from

233
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,700
having an end-to-end secure password

234
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:18,530
manager so it doesn't rely on the

235
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,320
network effect which as we all know is

236
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:25,390
the chicken and egg problem until you've

237
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:28,010
got two critical mass and one of the

238
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:30,740
feedbacks have got from certain banks

239
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:33,290
has been we can apply this to solve the

240
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,510
functional password problem which is

241
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:37,160
everybody's familiar with password

242
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,830
username and password when it's in the

243
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,270
web browser there are often used names

244
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:44,900
and passwords that are embedded in

245
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:48,319
scripts and those are necessary in order

246
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,600
for one piece of infrastructure to talk

247
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,150
to another a piece of infrastructure and

248
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,190
these are really poorly maintained in

249
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,780
many enterprises they'd like to get a

250
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:58,700
handle on it

251
00:12:55,780 --> 00:13:00,290
so why I think we could do with

252
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,720
independently of anything else is a

253
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:06,469
really good open standard for a good

254
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,840
password fault and that enables the

255
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:11,060
users to use really long secure

256
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,070
passwords because this is going to be an

257
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,930
open

258
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:16,630
that's going to be on all of their

259
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:20,138
devices and can be built into all of

260
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:23,529
their web browsers so that they can use

261
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:27,339
their strong passwords without being

262
00:13:23,529 --> 00:13:29,019
tied to one particular vendor now if you

263
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:31,029
wanted to just do that well the mesh

264
00:13:29,019 --> 00:13:33,959
would be a bit like using a sledgehammer

265
00:13:31,029 --> 00:13:36,399
to crack a nut because we're also

266
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,069
provisioning public key pairs onto every

267
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,949
device but in doing that we're also

268
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:45,219
providing the path to replace passwords

269
00:13:41,949 --> 00:13:46,689
entirely and use emerging technologies

270
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,329
like the web authentication

271
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:52,089
infrastructure that the w3c has

272
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:54,699
developed you know if we could provision

273
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:57,190
a public key pair onto every one of the

274
00:13:54,699 --> 00:14:01,750
user devices that then becomes practical

275
00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:04,660
its next slide so for from a technical

276
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:06,670
view Alice is going to create a personal

277
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:09,250
mesh and become her own ultimate route

278
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,130
of trust so she can outsource that to a

279
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:15,310
third party you know like she does for

280
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:19,000
malware and anti-spam or whatever and

281
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:22,209
she's going to create a choice you can

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,730
outsource it but she can always reclaim

283
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:27,219
her autonomy she's always going to be

284
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:32,050
the root of trust for her own digital

285
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:33,579
Gestalt she can create a master - she's

286
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:36,969
going to create a most personal master

287
00:14:33,579 --> 00:14:40,300
profile which has you know the usual px

288
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:44,110
type of stuff this is basically key

289
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,269
axioms and you have a master signature

290
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,660
key that never changes and so we can use

291
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:51,970
the fingerprint of that as Alice's

292
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,949
permanent fingerprint and it has

293
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:56,019
administration keys that can revolve and

294
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:59,949
all that good online offline stuff so

295
00:14:56,019 --> 00:15:02,079
next slide from Alice's point of view

296
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:04,689
she has installed an application on a

297
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:08,349
mobile phone she's creating account

298
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:12,250
alice at example.com and now she can add

299
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:14,860
her devices to a personal mesh by maybe

300
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:20,470
as simply as scanning a QR code on the

301
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:22,449
device with a phone or it might be she

302
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,760
goes to the device she installs an app

303
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,680
on it says I want to connect to Alice at

304
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:30,480
example

305
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:33,689
and then we do a password comparison of

306
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:37,499
two fingerprints so the user experience

307
00:15:33,689 --> 00:15:40,259
here is really simple not much more not

308
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:44,579
different much different from what users

309
00:15:40,259 --> 00:15:46,860
do already today and it establishes that

310
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:50,670
this device is connected to this

311
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:53,399
personal mesh with you know good work

312
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:56,878
factor you know 120 bits 128 bits

313
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:58,920
whatever and if so Alice checks these

314
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,079
two fingerprints look the same she

315
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,628
accepts the connection and now the

316
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:07,559
device is connected and once the device

317
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:11,939
is connected it stays connected until

318
00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:15,300
Alice says to disconnect it I have a lot

319
00:16:11,939 --> 00:16:17,849
of IOT devices in my house and what

320
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,040
really upsets me is not that I have to

321
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:23,970
program them and that it takes me 10

322
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:26,219
minutes to an hour each time but the

323
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:29,850
fact that I then have to reprogram them

324
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:34,399
regularly because they throw away their

325
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:36,689
configurations for stupid reasons so

326
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,309
once the device is connected to a

327
00:16:36,689 --> 00:16:41,490
personal mesh it will stay connected

328
00:16:38,309 --> 00:16:44,309
until Alice says to drop it so next

329
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:46,499
slide and I think all coming to and once

330
00:16:44,309 --> 00:16:50,279
a device is connected they can share

331
00:16:46,499 --> 00:16:53,129
access to all the catalogs that are

332
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:56,939
connected to a device so each connected

333
00:16:53,129 --> 00:16:58,740
device now has a shared world view so

334
00:16:56,939 --> 00:17:01,349
Alice can now use a personal and

335
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,689
vocabulary that is for voice-activated

336
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,339
devices for example that is shared

337
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:08,879
across all her devices so that if she

338
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,099
says a command like Zen turn on the

339
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,529
lights in the yellow room that can now

340
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,990
mean the same to any device she has

341
00:17:13,529 --> 00:17:18,659
connected no matter which device she it

342
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:21,390
is and no matter which vendor has

343
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:24,270
provided it if she adds a bookmark to

344
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:27,600
one device that change will be visible

345
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:29,190
to all the others and what this means is

346
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,320
that every connected device can

347
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:36,570
authenticate the messages that are

348
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:38,939
producing all this of being of Alice and

349
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,510
do the right thing so this allows us to

350
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,900
establish a

351
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,770
single dashboard for IOT devices so next

352
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:47,730
slide so there are three basic mesh

353
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:50,070
components

354
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,980
there's the schema per component which

355
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:53,700
is basically very similar to sam'l or

356
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:57,470
PKK's

357
00:17:53,700 --> 00:18:01,200
but in JSON instead of XML or asn.1

358
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:03,330
sorry about that xml encoding thing it

359
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,950
wasn't a good idea

360
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:09,470
then there's the mesh account which is

361
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:12,750
unusually for an indie black profile

362
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:16,350
protocol a mesh account belongs to the

363
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:19,260
user not to a service provider it is

364
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:21,570
created independently and can be bound

365
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:23,820
to a different service so this allows

366
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:26,960
Alistair hat maintain separate

367
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:31,500
identities for her business personal

368
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:34,020
restaurant golf and whatever but manage

369
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,730
them all as being the same thing as far

370
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:38,040
as she's concerned and then there's a

371
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:40,110
service which basically just acts as a

372
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:42,659
synchronization point for the catalogs

373
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,169
that connected and provides an always

374
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,910
available point of contact for messaging

375
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:50,220
so if we go to the final slide I think

376
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:52,310
it's the final one so what we have now

377
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,360
is the five minutes of discussion

378
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:57,419
clarification there's more information

379
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,870
on each of these systems on the website

380
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:03,210
go into the details of the architecture

381
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:06,120
in the videos which are fairly

382
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,680
comprehensive and as I said the Tecna be

383
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,810
discussing this is on the green box

384
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:13,140
we're going to be coming back to each of

385
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,210
the blue boxes in turn so so as a

386
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:16,170
reminder clarifying questions of things

387
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,030
you don't understand that was a

388
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:19,290
high-level overview from Phil and then

389
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:20,760
we'll he'll go into the technical

390
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,470
components more in a bit

391
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:25,440
sure well I'll let you don't there's a

392
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:28,020
clarifying question I think it is so I

393
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,760
certainly I understand what you're

394
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,730
technically proposing here and I

395
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,700
understand that passwords are bad and

396
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:38,760
I'm struggling to understand how this

397
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:42,780
Connect how this connects the password

398
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,780
thing okay so if you have a password if

399
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:47,580
you only had one machine then you can

400
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:51,000
write a password vault I think just sits

401
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,549
on that one machine and it can take long

402
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,710
passwords and any program

403
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,809
on that machine can then access the

404
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:00,840
passwords so you can now use strong long

405
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:05,100
and strong passwords if however you've

406
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:07,738
got 20 machines then if you add if you

407
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,110
change a password on my machine you want

408
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:12,989
those changes to be replicated across

409
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:14,639
all the other ones and you want to be

410
00:20:12,989 --> 00:20:17,279
able to do this in such a way that you

411
00:20:14,639 --> 00:20:22,949
do not have a password vault in the sky

412
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:26,759
which has a a that is available to the

413
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:27,929
service that is animating it so you

414
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:30,090
don't want to store the plaintext

415
00:20:27,929 --> 00:20:32,039
passwords in the cloud now there are

416
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:36,330
various ways that you go around it

417
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:39,029
but if you want to deal with the

418
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:42,359
specific problem of Alice has 20 devices

419
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:44,759
and she loses one then you need to be

420
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:47,189
able to turn off access of that device

421
00:20:44,759 --> 00:20:50,759
without affecting any of the other

422
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:52,710
devices or going into rekeying and if

423
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:55,080
you want to do that then you need to

424
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:56,100
have more mechanism than anything that's

425
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,049
out there at the moment

426
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:00,928
so just to restate what I think are

427
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,820
saying this is a replacement for the

428
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:05,879
password sync technologies that say one

429
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:08,549
password or Firefox or Chrome or bit

430
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:10,949
wording has yeah and it should be a

431
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,769
drop-in replacement in that the people

432
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:16,679
who are in those businesses can go to

433
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,720
this technology they don't need to you

434
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,730
know this isn't blow up their business

435
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,619
model it's providing them with a new

436
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,779
business model that allows them to

437
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:26,549
provide more for the customer great I

438
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:31,379
have one more question what happens if I

439
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:34,019
have one device and I lose it okay if

440
00:21:31,379 --> 00:21:38,158
you have there is a mechanism that we

441
00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:40,830
can use for key recovery for that I will

442
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,840
step until yes basically if you're going

443
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:45,418
to do data at rest security you

444
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,369
absolutely must think about key recovery

445
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:49,440
because the worst thing you can do to

446
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:51,090
the customer is to lose the pictures of

447
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,470
the kids when they were five for the

448
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,879
record that was era Chris Kohler from

449
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:57,600
Firefox in the back can you say your

450
00:21:53,879 --> 00:22:00,299
name and your well could you go to the

451
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,939
user experience lights it's a couple of

452
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:05,970
slides before thanks for having that

453
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,200
slide it I think I think you can pass no

454
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,679
no you

455
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:14,940
bastard it's so this is technical but

456
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:19,340
then after yeah this use of you so I

457
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:22,470
like this idea but like who runs this

458
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:25,350
server where Alice has her account who

459
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:27,779
provides me with the app is it tied to

460
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:31,189
certain devices and what motivation do

461
00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:36,450
device manufacturers have to follow this

462
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:44,039
okay so yeah I've been told that that's

463
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:46,320
a we'll come back to that well in the

464
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:50,190
store and just don't have to go into a

465
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,240
lot of detail one sentence answer so how

466
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,919
are you doing

467
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:57,029
providing password consistency if you're

468
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:59,639
not using a centralized storage the user

469
00:22:57,029 --> 00:23:03,539
chooses a service that provides a

470
00:22:59,639 --> 00:23:10,379
Dropbox so it's kind of like an IMAP

471
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:13,980
server so it is centralized in the sense

472
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:15,899
that each user at any one given time has

473
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,389
a single sync synchronization point

474
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:21,029
however you can change that

475
00:23:18,389 --> 00:23:24,149
synchronization point at any time that

476
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:27,049
you like because the account belongs to

477
00:23:24,149 --> 00:23:30,389
the user and not to the service provider

478
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,460
so if you want to change your service

479
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:34,199
provider you can and there's nothing

480
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,059
that the service provider can do to stop

481
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,909
you and you will have no interruption in

482
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,720
service okay but you're not using like a

483
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:46,590
consistency protocol that's not

484
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:49,169
necessary server list okay yeah and that

485
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:51,389
was Melinda short next question this is

486
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:53,279
Dena clarification question most your

487
00:23:51,389 --> 00:23:55,639
language seems to want to make it easier

488
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,350
for us to manage our multiple devices

489
00:23:55,639 --> 00:24:00,330
but right now in the real world most

490
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:01,949
people just have one cell phone and the

491
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,230
real problem is is managing all the

492
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,580
web-based passwords which is in the

493
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:08,279
hundreds

494
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:09,750
you got that should be the high priority

495
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:13,730
problem the solver doesn't solve it at

496
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:13,730
the same time with the device problem

497
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,750
you can just run this without if you

498
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,030
only have one device you don't need the

499
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,220
service and it will run quite happily

500
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,139
without any service at all you can

501
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:27,510
create an account without having an

502
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:29,550
internet service will you solve the 100

503
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,070
website yeah different password problem

504
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:34,260
absolutely yeah as many passwords as you

505
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:36,510
like no mobile that take longer to

506
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:43,350
deploy than the device solving the

507
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:45,450
device problem do you think yeah yeah I

508
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,240
mean I think we'll get into those

509
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:51,090
technical details so Michael last

510
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,560
question Michael Richardson so one

511
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:54,870
question from Jabbar was what how does

512
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:58,500
this stop a thief who has your phone

513
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:01,709
from having getting your passwords okay

514
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:05,160
so there's two cases here one case is if

515
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:09,480
you know that you've lost the phone

516
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:12,240
before the thief assuming that it's not

517
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:14,850
password-protected or you know biometry

518
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,660
protected or whatever yeah if you

519
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:21,090
realize before the thief opens it up

520
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:24,810
then you can disable it by calling the

521
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:27,929
service do not perform the other side of

522
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:29,899
the decryption for that password and

523
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:33,810
I'll come to the map on that in a moment

524
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:37,050
if however the thief gets there first

525
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:39,240
well you're hosed and that's just simply

526
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:41,580
because if you designed the system so

527
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,900
that you can get it at your password

528
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,850
without any other pin whatever well if a

529
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,860
thief has got it the thief is you so

530
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,740
there's nothing that I can do and my

531
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:56,310
question is does this work for the

532
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:59,070
situation where um I I have a phone

533
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:01,409
everyone in my family has a phone and it

534
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,389
turns out that my TV's also a phone and

535
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,280
needs access to some of our common

536
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:08,790
passwords but I don't necessarily want

537
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,820
to share transitively my facebook

538
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:14,250
password with my son through the TV

539
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,689
absolutely okay yes that's actually one

540
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,620
of the things that you would want to do

541
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:21,510
with accounts and yeah I mean like the

542
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:23,729
structures are there I cannot guarantee

543
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:25,440
that the usability is perfect and that's

544
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,510
something that I think we need to go

545
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:31,380
through a working group to you know

546
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:33,740
hammer out the best way of doing it okay

547
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,770
so next

548
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:42,440
ten minutes okay so so the first of the

549
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:45,590
technology presentations is on UDF which

550
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:47,539
started out as uniform data fingerprint

551
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,570
because we were going to redo PGP

552
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:52,779
fingerprints and has become something

553
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,760
else it's become cryptography on Rails

554
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:58,970
anybody people here familiar with Ruby

555
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:01,309
on Rails as a framework it's a really

556
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,740
great idea you have one name to refer to

557
00:27:01,309 --> 00:27:06,260
everything everywhere and it simplifies

558
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:09,350
your code well I want to bring that to

559
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,470
crypto so let's go to the next slide and

560
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:14,658
then it kind of like mushroomed because

561
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:18,159
we started off with this idea okay we've

562
00:27:14,659 --> 00:27:22,809
got base 32 encoding of cryptographic

563
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:25,520
outputs so we've got content digests and

564
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:28,760
here we've got a char 2 and a char 3

565
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,340
digest I could do message authentication

566
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,169
code and there's that you know there's a

567
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,240
there's a heap of technology there you

568
00:27:33,169 --> 00:27:39,200
can do them at various lengths they

569
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:41,809
resist semantic substitution attacks and

570
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,789
great stuff like that and then people

571
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,039
started to say well what if we wanted to

572
00:27:43,789 --> 00:27:49,610
put in other things like nonces into

573
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:52,700
this form or a symmetric encryption key

574
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:54,770
and that becomes really useful so we've

575
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,230
got a key here that's the input to a key

576
00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,500
derivation function that can then be

577
00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:02,630
used to create ourselves encryption keys

578
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:06,110
and initialization vectors for a piece

579
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:08,539
of data and then Michael said well what

580
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:11,870
about private keys can you generate a

581
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:14,360
private key from one of these and so we

582
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,789
did that and that's quite interesting

583
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,500
because now I have a private key that I

584
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:24,169
can generate from a really short you

585
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,690
know base 32 encoded piece of data and

586
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:30,110
that's something that I can copy across

587
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:33,289
so if I'm doing SSH I need to copy my

588
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:35,469
private key onto multiple devices

589
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:38,419
instead of doing it how it's done today

590
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:41,539
by a significant fraction of the

591
00:28:38,419 --> 00:28:46,420
sysadmin population which is to send it

592
00:28:41,539 --> 00:28:48,040
by unencrypted email I can enter the UDF

593
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,990
and then of course if you're doing all

594
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,129
this stuff with private keys aren't you

595
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:53,770
gonna want to have Shamir's secret

596
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,620
sharing so you can do the key recovery

597
00:28:53,770 --> 00:29:00,330
and so there's a whole bunch of

598
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:04,750
mechanism in there it's a next slide and

599
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:06,970
this allows us to do one what I call

600
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,970
cryptography and rails which is in the

601
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,600
mesh the only form of key identifier

602
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:19,090
that is used in the mesh itself is the

603
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:21,490
content digest of the public key and the

604
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,470
reason for that is if you have one way

605
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:28,510
of referring to the doctor the key in

606
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:29,950
every place and it simplifies all the

607
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,260
path map that we've traditionally done

608
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:35,410
through PKK's

609
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:39,220
so if we go to the next slide the other

610
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:41,830
thing that we can do and I don't know if

611
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:44,740
they've still got the there's a

612
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:48,669
demonstration of this on the both poster

613
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:52,150
we can create encrypted QR codes so what

614
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:56,320
we've got here is a QR code which is a

615
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:59,200
combination of a hint that allows us to

616
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:02,350
discover a website that can be converted

617
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:05,440
to a web service endpoint and an

618
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:07,990
encryption key and to resolve this we

619
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,320
first of all resolved that the

620
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,090
example.com two web service endpoint and

621
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:17,639
take the content digest of the

622
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:21,760
encryption key and use that to locate

623
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:23,890
the document that is encrypted we

624
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:28,180
retrieve that encrypted document and

625
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,550
then decrypt that document with the

626
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:33,700
original encryption key which we hadn't

627
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:36,850
shared with the site and so now we've

628
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:39,490
got a way that we can put QR codes on on

629
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:43,000
documents and piece of paper that allows

630
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:46,780
that document to link to an encrypted

631
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,850
copy of the document in the cloud so

632
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:52,660
imagine that you're doing your taxes and

633
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:55,419
you've got all those w-2 forms you could

634
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,640
just scan the w-2 form and back comes an

635
00:30:55,420 --> 00:31:00,490
encrypted version you're doing your

636
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,289
invoices you can scan the invoice

637
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:04,690
come back with an encrypted version

638
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:07,509
there's a whole bunch of stuff that the

639
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:10,419
combination of this in QR codes solves

640
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:12,879
the reason that I put it into the mesh

641
00:31:10,419 --> 00:31:16,990
was that I wanted a way of doing contact

642
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:21,279
exchange so that if I need Alice in a

643
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:23,200
bar or whatever we can bump phones so

644
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:26,700
next slide sorry

645
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:30,549
quick question Boyet this seems oddly

646
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,090
similar to 60 RFC 69 20 naming things

647
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:37,389
with hashes that admit maybe I'm wrong

648
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,668
but could you clarify what sir there is

649
00:31:37,389 --> 00:31:41,979
a reason for that which is Stephen wolf

650
00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:46,210
and one of the authors of naming things

651
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,129
with patches and so basically this is

652
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:53,460
coming back to some of the work that I

653
00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:57,908
did previously and reapplying it so yes

654
00:31:53,460 --> 00:32:01,240
this is I'm not pretending that any of

655
00:31:57,909 --> 00:32:04,240
this is new I'm not trying to be new I'm

656
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,419
not an academic and trying to solve a

657
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,669
problem and I'm quite happy

658
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:16,269
boring stuff that's ten years old or

659
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:23,080
twenty years old so yeah so we're now

660
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:26,549
into the discussion of UDF Behnke doc

661
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,549
could you go back one slide please

662
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:31,178
so just to double check I'm

663
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:34,360
understanding this right with sort of

664
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:36,940
encrypted URL thing the idea is that I

665
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:40,360
can put a QR code somewhere and anyone

666
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:43,149
who looks at that QR code can fetch the

667
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:45,158
plain text to the content but the

668
00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:46,629
content itself is hosted on a site that

669
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:48,460
does not have access to the plain text

670
00:32:46,629 --> 00:32:51,428
because it's encrypted to the key that

671
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,799
is local on the QR code yeah that's

672
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:57,210
basically it great so basically what you

673
00:32:53,799 --> 00:33:00,429
have is the QR code becomes a bearer

674
00:32:57,210 --> 00:33:05,200
token that allows you to locate and

675
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:08,619
retrieve and that was been yeah and you

676
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,740
know it's what it was you know I was

677
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:14,049
trying to do data at rest security here

678
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:19,000
and that stuff that you know I did with

679
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:22,809
Stephen what ten years now yeah 2011 I

680
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,520
think and you know it just looked like

681
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:27,070
the time to put that in as well since

682
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:28,899
we're revisiting it so so can you

683
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:30,309
clarify the first question a little bit

684
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:32,529
more how is this different than the

685
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:37,470
previous RFC or are they compatible or

686
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:41,200
they incompatible did you add stuff they

687
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:43,570
the architecture is similar what has

688
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,510
changed is the syntax and the fact that

689
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:50,740
we're now using the content digests so

690
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:51,879
they're not compatible but I think that

691
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:56,140
there are some improvements that have

692
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:59,559
happened since and Stephen tells me that

693
00:33:56,140 --> 00:34:05,919
nobody's using the nice stuff so I think

694
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:11,020
that if we're going to you know yes I

695
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,418
mean come yes echo so I'm sorry I think

696
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,530
I just don't understand how this

697
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:15,580
specific I understand how one would go

698
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,770
one of these things were much sure I

699
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:20,469
understand how you built it so that

700
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:22,540
first URL yeah the thing the path

701
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:26,199
component won't be the practically is

702
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:28,199
the caption key right yeah um but the

703
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,609
presumably lots of crap on example.com

704
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,819
right lots of resources so what tells me

705
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:38,409
a resource it is well do the example.com

706
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:40,480
piece you throw it at web service at DNS

707
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:42,940
service discovery you know Stuart's

708
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,668
chess your stuff so you look for SRV and

709
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:49,149
txt records and those can identify the

710
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:51,549
the web service endpoint and if neither

711
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:54,819
of those are populated then you fall

712
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:57,490
back to well-known service discovery and

713
00:34:54,820 --> 00:35:00,430
so here we've got example.com so this

714
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:03,368
piece here the HCBS example.com

715
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:06,160
well-known mmbf all that stuff is just

716
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:09,280
some stuff that is defined by the UDF

717
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:13,390
example.com piece I'm sorry I think I'm

718
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,220
still missing it like I have like 5,000

719
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,450
resources that I want to post somewhere

720
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,000
each of which has their own decryption

721
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:21,970
key and their own name right and where

722
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,930
does the name get stuffed like I mean so

723
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,500
some point I'm going to connect it on

724
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:28,190
some white show the name is

725
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:30,860
we get the name to differentiate the the

726
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,770
thick that's the hash of the encryption

727
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,320
key oh okay

728
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:37,700
so we use that to complete the with that

729
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,740
Sublette but that's not content rest

730
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,910
then because because the because that's

731
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:44,509
the direct necessarily the encryption

732
00:35:40,910 --> 00:35:45,980
key right right okay so on so that I am

733
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,420
now not making a clarifying question but

734
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,400
a technical point which is an

735
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:52,640
unattractive property this design is

736
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,180
that on anybody else who has access to

737
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,859
the URL is able to forge new content and

738
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:59,960
you cannot detect it and the typical way

739
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,120
to prevent that is to have the URL that

740
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:04,040
had the top thing the URI contain an

741
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,210
intent an integrity check rather than

742
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,620
just an encryption as well as an

743
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:17,410
encryption key that's preventing

744
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:19,819
opposition yeah we yeah we as I said let

745
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:24,170
let's take this you know people want

746
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:27,940
this feature we can bash it around there

747
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:31,930
is far too much PHP in this already so

748
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:37,670
we need to get other Minds involved yeah

749
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:45,620
so okay let's go to the next so okay so

750
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:50,780
that so let's go to the dare piece so so

751
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:52,490
since we I was doing this this mesh

752
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:55,310
stuff I needed a way of wrapping up my

753
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:58,430
schemas and I didn't want to use sn1

754
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:02,720
because you know I just am fed up of

755
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:05,330
having arguments over it and so Jason is

756
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:10,689
the format of the hour so let's do it in

757
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:15,730
Jason and so go to the next slide and so

758
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:17,690
the basic spec is simply pkcs7 for jason

759
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:23,560
reusing most of the same crypto

760
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:30,020
approaches with a few changes that allow

761
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:32,720
the use of dare envelopes in sequences

762
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:36,350
and this particular change is we

763
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:39,950
generate instead of having the key

764
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:42,259
output of a key agreement be the master

765
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,720
secret that's used to the the encryption

766
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:47,240
key and then specify the initialization

767
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,689
vector separately we use a key

768
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,319
derivation function in order to generate

769
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:56,600
to derive our initialization vector our

770
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:58,400
encryption key mat key if we're not

771
00:37:56,600 --> 00:38:01,700
using authenticated encryption and

772
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,550
anything else we might need to use and

773
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:06,939
we put a nonce into that and what that

774
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:10,070
allows us to do is to have one envelope

775
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:12,470
that is encrypted with under one key

776
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:15,170
exchange that has a payload that's

777
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:18,230
encrypted and then has attached

778
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:22,130
attributes that are encrypted under the

779
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:25,520
same key but can be decrypted separately

780
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:28,700
from the main payload and to do all of

781
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,640
this without the risk of reusing the

782
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:34,330
same key twice which would be really bad

783
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,680
if you're using a stream cipher and

784
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:38,600
since people are going to authenticated

785
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:42,259
encryption that's pretty much the norm

786
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,610
now so that's the basic envelope piece

787
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:49,640
so go to the next slide

788
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:51,380
oh yes and then also the other piece

789
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:53,660
that came up is that you're probably

790
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,270
aware in the crypto world there's an

791
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:59,960
argument that goes on as to whether you

792
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:03,250
should sign and then encrypt or encrypt

793
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:06,830
and then sign and there are actually

794
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:09,590
disadvantages to both and so the proper

795
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:13,130
way to do it is actually to sign encrypt

796
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:16,060
and then sign and so one of the ways

797
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:18,560
that we this particular key derivation

798
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:20,440
because of the way that we'd wanted to

799
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,150
use these envelopes in the mesh is

800
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,580
critical that we sign the cipher text

801
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:30,080
and that would be able to verify the

802
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:31,670
signature from the cipher text alone but

803
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,470
then what if you need to be able to

804
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:38,980
prove that the person who signed the

805
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,839
content had knowledge of the plaintext

806
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:43,759
well we can generate a witness value out

807
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:47,859
of the key derivation function

808
00:39:43,759 --> 00:39:50,599
and that provides almost exactly that

809
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:52,429
piece of information it isn't quite the

810
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:54,949
same and we can explai discuss the

811
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:59,149
difference offline so let's go to the

812
00:39:54,949 --> 00:40:01,069
next slide so if we were just going to

813
00:39:59,149 --> 00:40:01,759
do envelopes it probably isn't that

814
00:40:01,069 --> 00:40:03,799
interesting

815
00:40:01,759 --> 00:40:05,409
but the main reason that we do this in

816
00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:09,019
the mesh is so that we can create

817
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:11,929
append-only logs which are sequences of

818
00:40:09,019 --> 00:40:15,019
dare entrant Lopes and this allows two

819
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:16,939
things incremental encryption sorry

820
00:40:15,019 --> 00:40:18,799
incremental authentication via Merkel

821
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:21,979
tree so all that stuff that's in

822
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:27,699
certificate transparency we've got in

823
00:40:21,979 --> 00:40:31,549
there so that we can sign the sign the

824
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:33,409
final head of the Merkel tree and then

825
00:40:31,549 --> 00:40:36,889
we can authenticate any envelope in the

826
00:40:33,409 --> 00:40:41,119
sequence and I believe it's used in some

827
00:40:36,889 --> 00:40:43,969
minor currency thingy somewhere I forget

828
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,389
what its name is and it also gives us

829
00:40:43,969 --> 00:40:50,029
incremental encryption so the idea here

830
00:40:47,389 --> 00:40:52,279
is that if I've got a log file from my

831
00:40:50,029 --> 00:40:56,630
server I would like to be able to

832
00:40:52,279 --> 00:41:00,079
encrypt each entry into that log but I

833
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:03,259
don't want to do an RSA key exchange for

834
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,630
every entry I add and I saw an even if

835
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:07,130
I'm doing a lip tic curve I don't want

836
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:09,529
to have to do a key exchange for every

837
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:12,319
entry because then I'm gonna have to do

838
00:41:09,529 --> 00:41:16,909
it key exchange for every decrypt as

839
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,069
well it's just too much and so what this

840
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:21,349
provides us with so this structure

841
00:41:19,069 --> 00:41:24,049
allows us to create an incremental

842
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:27,229
encryption have the key exchange in the

843
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:30,880
first record and then use that same key

844
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:33,348
exchange in any subsequent packet and

845
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,809
just have a pointer back to where the

846
00:41:33,349 --> 00:41:37,999
key exchange went and so the only thing

847
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:39,829
you need to do to make this secure is to

848
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:42,499
make sure that each of the envelopes

849
00:41:39,829 --> 00:41:44,659
that you have has a different nonce and

850
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:49,729
then the key derivation function works

851
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:53,359
properly and and this can be used also

852
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:55,489
insists W pack has been proposed I did

853
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,029
not know about W pack when I was working

854
00:41:55,489 --> 00:41:57,620
on this

855
00:41:56,029 --> 00:42:01,370
nor did I am

856
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:04,700
to propose a replacement for zip however

857
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:08,180
while I was designing it I implemented a

858
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,859
zip archive format as a sanity check on

859
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:12,890
the design to make sure that it worked

860
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:15,650
and so this might be some something

861
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:19,490
that's relevant to the W pack people so

862
00:42:15,650 --> 00:42:24,130
next secret next slide okay so why do

863
00:42:19,490 --> 00:42:27,560
all this well the idea is so that we can

864
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,960
create a dare catalog so dare catalog is

865
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:34,250
the persistence store that we use in the

866
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,820
mesh and it is based on a dare sequence

867
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:42,380
so we're going to add or change or

868
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:45,850
delete entries in this catalog by

869
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:49,580
appending chunks to the end of the

870
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:51,380
sequence and the objects can be

871
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,080
encrypted and you know if you're going

872
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:56,150
to use this as a password format you

873
00:42:54,080 --> 00:43:00,110
might want to consider encrypting the

874
00:42:56,150 --> 00:43:03,530
password entries in fact I hope you will

875
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:07,460
and yeah we can discuss the exact way

876
00:43:03,530 --> 00:43:09,500
that we apply that encryption but the

877
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:14,270
big payoff here is that there now

878
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:17,480
because every data structure that is

879
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:20,660
stored on a mesh service is an encrypted

880
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:23,750
Dare sequence the only thing that we

881
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:28,220
need in order to synchronize Alice's

882
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:31,730
device to her mesh service is to have a

883
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:35,569
means of synchronizing the Dare sequence

884
00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:38,450
but we've got that we can automatically

885
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:42,400
synchronize the bookmarks the passwords

886
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:45,770
the contacts everything all in one

887
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,140
transaction or win one set of protocol

888
00:43:45,770 --> 00:43:50,870
instead of requiring separate things for

889
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,650
each one and this means that the mesh

890
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:56,359
service protocol is really quite simple

891
00:43:53,650 --> 00:44:00,290
there's basically through the meat of it

892
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:03,020
is three commands for status to get the

893
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:06,380
status of the containers upload a change

894
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:09,290
to a container or download and because

895
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,040
we've got that merkel free going on we

896
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:14,279
maintain

897
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,470
integrity checks all the time the

898
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:19,829
service can check the integrity of a

899
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:22,259
proposed upload but cannot read any of

900
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:26,930
the contents of the container because

901
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:32,299
they're encrypted so next slide and so

902
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:35,490
so do we have any discussion on dare

903
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:44,520
what discussion clarifying verifying

904
00:44:35,490 --> 00:44:46,259
questions so it sounds like you said you

905
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,509
wanted at the same time let's solve

906
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:49,619
encryption data a trust problem while

907
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:52,710
you're doing these other things that's

908
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:54,690
great it also sounds like you're solving

909
00:44:52,710 --> 00:44:55,290
the internet identity problem once and

910
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:57,359
for all

911
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:59,339
maybe and at the same time you're

912
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:06,779
solving device synchronization

913
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:08,700
this true identity people have

914
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:10,680
occasionally accused me of trying to

915
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,169
solve too many problems at once this yes

916
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,640
well I mean that is exactly they will

917
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,849
applaud you for thinking holistically

918
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,578
that's good yeah I mean like my fault

919
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:23,160
here is that I am a systems guy and I

920
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:24,960
just obsess about these things and so

921
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:29,040
you know what you may end up with here

922
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,859
is a really overbaked thing but I find

923
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:33,720
that as I look you know what when I find

924
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:36,359
haven't have got an idea where to go I

925
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:38,250
look for more requirements and then I

926
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,009
try and simplify and I think that this

927
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:44,700
structure yeah you don't want to use

928
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,200
blockchain to do bgp or dns or whatever

929
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,910
it's just the wrong thing because

930
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:51,689
blockchain was designed to do one thing

931
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:53,848
and trying to repurpose it is you know

932
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:54,240
like trying to do everything with a

933
00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:57,299
hammer

934
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,129
so you didn't you didn't assert this but

935
00:45:57,299 --> 00:46:00,900
I think you are now is that you want to

936
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,140
use black chain for an Internet identity

937
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,790
is this true this allows you to do the

938
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,339
same things that blockchain would allow

939
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:11,009
you to do and so all those proposal to

940
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:13,170
the base on blockchain they make a lot

941
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:15,390
more sense with this what I absolutely

942
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,799
do not want to do is to use proof of

943
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:19,379
work okay

944
00:46:16,799 --> 00:46:21,020
proof of waste right yes so one other

945
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:24,150
clarification question but that's okay

946
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:25,109
if it sounds like

947
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:27,270
since you're thinking holistically

948
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:29,190
that's wonderful but are you worried

949
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,980
that you may solve the password problem

950
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:33,480
at the expense of identity solving the

951
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:35,190
identity or device synchronization

952
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:38,099
problem won't work as well as you would

953
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,349
like so as a designer do you think you

954
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:41,700
can do all these things really good or

955
00:46:40,349 --> 00:46:44,220
one really good and the other one just

956
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:46,700
mediocre because it's all together it's

957
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:49,680
honest no I am of a designer rate I

958
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:53,220
honestly think that at the point that

959
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:58,529
I've got the documents now there is very

960
00:46:53,220 --> 00:47:04,109
little the bones I mean if he's really

961
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:07,289
concentrated and I don't think that it

962
00:47:04,109 --> 00:47:10,230
won't compromises the other there's a

963
00:47:07,289 --> 00:47:11,819
few pieces in the current specs that

964
00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:13,440
maybe we should strip out because

965
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:16,020
originally when I was looking at these

966
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:17,369
sequences I proposed multiple ways of

967
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,700
doing the sequences you could have

968
00:47:17,369 --> 00:47:22,140
chains or whatever I think at this point

969
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,189
we should just strip out everything

970
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:24,750
that's you grieve you have enough

971
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:27,900
detailed design at this point to make

972
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:33,750
this assertion yeah ok this has all been

973
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,910
implemented benkei doc so I'm gonna get

974
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:37,799
the terminology wrong unless you take

975
00:47:35,910 --> 00:47:39,450
this slide back I think one or two

976
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:42,150
honestly ideas that sorry we have like a

977
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:44,069
three-tier structure where I can have

978
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,529
like an individual dare envelope that's

979
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:48,630
like the smallest quantum of and write

980
00:47:46,529 --> 00:47:50,910
stuff and then I might sort of

981
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:54,089
consolidate a bunch of those into a

982
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:56,819
sequence I think is the next term and so

983
00:47:54,089 --> 00:47:57,328
those could be related things like one

984
00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:59,250
envelope

985
00:47:57,329 --> 00:48:01,589
per password and my password manager

986
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:03,299
sort of thing and then I can have a

987
00:48:01,589 --> 00:48:05,549
bunch of these sequences which might be

988
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:08,670
related and I build those together into

989
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:10,500
their container which is maybe I can

990
00:48:08,670 --> 00:48:12,720
think of that was like a database of

991
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:14,670
stuff that gets synchronized and the

992
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,308
container is gonna it's gonna include

993
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:19,529
like the updates and removals and like

994
00:48:17,309 --> 00:48:21,390
this is the the latest version of this

995
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:22,069
thing that appeared previously in the

996
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:26,220
container

997
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:28,920
pretty much I call them catalogs I was

998
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:31,980
using the term container at one point

999
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:33,779
and then when I got a review back that

1000
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,789
was saying yeah this is really bad

1001
00:48:33,779 --> 00:48:37,650
you're confusing me because I'm doing

1002
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:39,180
docker ok so it's alright

1003
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:41,099
envelope and in the sequence in the

1004
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:44,970
catalog okay great

1005
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:46,710
right wrong there's also a spool and a

1006
00:48:44,970 --> 00:48:50,220
spool is simply a list of a queue of

1007
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:52,799
messages or it can be a queue of tasks

1008
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,709
okay yeah so I mean if there's any IBM

1009
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:58,980
poke around here I can do kicks on

1010
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:05,579
blockchain with encryption I think that

1011
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:07,589
that could be invaluable to you Malinda

1012
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,690
sure I actually have two questions the

1013
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:11,308
first one is when you say blockchain

1014
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:13,049
that usually implies the data structure

1015
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:15,510
plus some sort of consensus or

1016
00:49:13,049 --> 00:49:18,839
consistency protocol are you doing both

1017
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:20,700
or just the data structure I what I'm

1018
00:49:18,839 --> 00:49:25,170
proposing here is just the data

1019
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:27,960
structure what I'm doing yeah I mean

1020
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:34,740
like you you I do have a consensus

1021
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:37,829
protocol I I I presented that at the

1022
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:41,848
Boston hub meeting and it does not

1023
00:49:37,829 --> 00:49:44,069
involve proof of work basically the way

1024
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:48,410
that I can get around the need for proof

1025
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:52,680
of work is by having multiple chains and

1026
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:55,319
to then have cross assertions between

1027
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,879
them and then the problem with those

1028
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:59,220
things is that you always end up with

1029
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,589
the problem of who's the ultimate root

1030
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,328
of trust you know who teach and the way

1031
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:06,480
that I saw that is to fold it back on

1032
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:09,059
the user so the Alice by when she

1033
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,779
reincorporate her mesh service it says

1034
00:50:09,059 --> 00:50:16,260
at a station into her chain that becomes

1035
00:50:12,779 --> 00:50:18,569
her personal root of trust and so over

1036
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:21,450
time our each time Alice is

1037
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:24,750
synchronizing she is reinforcing her own

1038
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:27,058
proof so we can discuss that offline I

1039
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,710
mean yeah because I mean right because a

1040
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:30,059
lot of the consistency put our consensus

1041
00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:31,650
protocols through based on so the

1042
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:33,240
Byzantine generals problem where you

1043
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:37,500
assume you've got Hospital actors in the

1044
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,629
network the other question this sort of

1045
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:41,400
consistency stuff is relatively

1046
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:44,180
unrelated to most of what we're talking

1047
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,680
about today let's take let's say that I

1048
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:49,440
think this is where we wrote wave the

1049
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:51,190
rat around and yeah we can take that off

1050
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,210
to a bar okay so yeah

1051
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:54,830
the other question I think is probably

1052
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:57,860
more directly relevant and that is that

1053
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:59,480
Merkel trees are very efficient to do

1054
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:01,460
lookups and they're kind of expensive to

1055
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:03,740
extend so have you done any performance

1056
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:07,660
character characterizations and is this

1057
00:51:03,740 --> 00:51:07,660
really the best data structure for your

1058
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:13,730
for what I'm trying to do I think it's

1059
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:15,830
acceptable I've not really tried to do

1060
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:17,300
any performance stuff if people want to

1061
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:19,819
propose something that's better and

1062
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:23,930
quite happy I know that there's a whole

1063
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:26,390
literature there and you know i i'm

1064
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:28,879
bringing this here because i need help I

1065
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:32,859
mean like I've been keeping this around

1066
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:36,080
in my head for five years and III

1067
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:38,270
desperately need your help I cannot

1068
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:40,400
continue to build this on my own okay

1069
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:44,870
we're looking for co-authors for all the

1070
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,700
documents you know I really am looking

1071
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:49,970
for your help this is I'm not here

1072
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:53,569
because I want you to see my shiny stuff

1073
00:51:49,970 --> 00:51:55,669
I'm here because I want to convince you

1074
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,990
to work on my shiny stuff right so we're

1075
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:59,440
gonna cut the cure for the two people

1076
00:51:56,990 --> 00:52:02,149
and I am currently this is Jeffrey askin

1077
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,160
how does the fact that this is the pend

1078
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:05,840
only help with the password use case as

1079
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,470
opposed to just a file that you replace

1080
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,510
when you change it basically it means

1081
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:14,600
that I can use the same synchronization

1082
00:52:11,510 --> 00:52:17,900
primitive for passwords for bookmarks

1083
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,940
for contacts and for everything else and

1084
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,600
for synchronizing messages to the spool

1085
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:26,930
and yes if you're oh if you were only

1086
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:28,759
going to do passwords this wouldn't be

1087
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:30,500
the absolute optimal way of doing it

1088
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:32,480
because most people aren't gonna have

1089
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,850
enough passwords to make it worthwhile I

1090
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,820
know even if you've got a thousand

1091
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:39,080
passwords like I do that's probably not

1092
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,190
going to be enough to justify this

1093
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:45,950
however once you realize yeah the

1094
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:48,170
passwords is how you access the web your

1095
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,810
authentication for your website the

1096
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:54,110
other really critical catalog is the

1097
00:52:50,810 --> 00:52:56,690
contacts catalog because that is giving

1098
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:59,090
you the public key of all the people

1099
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:01,130
that you're talking to and for that you

1100
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:03,560
really want to have an append-only log

1101
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:05,520
and the other piece in where we get is

1102
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:07,140
the meta cryptography

1103
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,930
the other use for this particular

1104
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:13,560
structure is so that I can do true and

1105
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:17,910
to end encrypted web by which I mean

1106
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:20,580
encrypt from the content creator to the

1107
00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:23,399
content consumer in which all the data

1108
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:26,430
that is in the cloud is encrypted and

1109
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:30,060
still be able to do social network web

1110
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:35,279
to point not type stuff because I can

1111
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:43,170
represent a comment forum as a cattle as

1112
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:46,830
a spool of posts so it it's all about

1113
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:49,140
reuse yeah this do you know just need a

1114
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:50,970
binary answer to this is the mesh

1115
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:56,430
service decentralized in your opinion

1116
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:58,680
yes anybody can set up their own and if

1117
00:53:56,430 --> 00:54:00,359
you choose a mesh service provider and

1118
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:05,240
you decide you don't like them you can

1119
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:07,920
always change so they're not sticky

1120
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,040
you said mesh service provider and that

1121
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:18,210
made me feel centralized well yeah but

1122
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:20,160
you can be your own yeah okay so so this

1123
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:24,750
is the final one of the blue talks which

1124
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:27,629
is meta cryptography and mmm this is not

1125
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:30,480
new cryptography well maybe the this is

1126
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:32,970
not this is all stuff that should be

1127
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:34,920
part of the cannon but didn't make it

1128
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:39,629
because the cannon or cryptography that

1129
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:43,500
we using kind of closed in 1990 when Pam

1130
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:45,960
and PGP launched so so I'm taking a leaf

1131
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:49,140
out of Tim O'Reilly book and I'm

1132
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,610
rebranding it so that we can go back and

1133
00:54:49,140 --> 00:54:51,690
look at what we were doing that we

1134
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:53,850
should have been doing all along

1135
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:56,940
so we're rebranding threshold

1136
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:59,940
cryptography and some other stuff with

1137
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:03,120
meta cryptography the next slide so what

1138
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,040
do I mean by that well one thing that we

1139
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:10,830
can do with meta cryptography is key

1140
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:16,880
combination so this is used in the mesh

1141
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:16,880
key provisioning protocol how exactly

1142
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,589
[Music]

1143
00:55:20,369 --> 00:55:26,290
so if you're doing PKI the big the big

1144
00:55:23,589 --> 00:55:28,839
bugbear rpki has always been how do you

1145
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:31,270
actually provision keys or issue

1146
00:55:28,839 --> 00:55:33,520
certificates and it's really tricky

1147
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:36,520
because if you do it wrong well

1148
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:40,839
everything falls apart and so you can

1149
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:43,390
generate keys on devices and that's okay

1150
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:46,000
if the device can has a sufficiently

1151
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:47,319
good random number generator if it

1152
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,210
doesn't have a good random number

1153
00:55:47,319 --> 00:55:53,140
generator you've got a weak key and you

1154
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:56,260
get hosed you can generate your private

1155
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,940
key in a centralized location which

1156
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,710
means that you can do it under

1157
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:02,920
controlled circumstances and make sure

1158
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:04,960
that you've got strong key but then you

1159
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:07,150
can't really trust it I mean when I was

1160
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,849
a CA people kept coming at me and saying

1161
00:56:07,150 --> 00:56:12,400
I want you to generate the keys for me

1162
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:14,980
and I'm saying oh no no no I'm not doing

1163
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,540
that for you and so this was a way that

1164
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:20,740
I came up with it would allow me to do

1165
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:23,109
it for diffie-hellman so one of the

1166
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:26,680
amazing facts about diffie-hellman is

1167
00:56:23,109 --> 00:56:31,450
that if you take two private keys and

1168
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:36,220
you add them you can calculate the

1169
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:39,160
corresponding public key simply from the

1170
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,890
to public components so if you look at

1171
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:44,290
the two red boxes here the two are at

1172
00:56:41,890 --> 00:56:49,058
the top so if private key X private key

1173
00:56:44,290 --> 00:56:50,349
Y Z equals x plus y okay so they're all

1174
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:52,660
Dickie Harmon we can create different

1175
00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:54,940
keys for all of them but look what was

1176
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:59,348
happening on the black side the public

1177
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:03,339
key public key X is X dot P public key Y

1178
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:05,710
is y dot P well Z then I'm sorry this is

1179
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:08,109
elliptic curve not divyam not regular

1180
00:57:05,710 --> 00:57:11,650
diffie-hellman so here we go the public

1181
00:57:08,109 --> 00:57:13,270
key that corresponds to X plus y dot P

1182
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:19,740
well that is simply going to be the

1183
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:25,839
addition of the two points X plus y what

1184
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:28,029
yeah you you yes you Christian is

1185
00:57:25,839 --> 00:57:31,000
bringing up a bit of number theory that

1186
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:32,800
yeah there's a few tricks and whatever

1187
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,310
and there's a draft that explains them

1188
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:37,750
all and the some stuff that I have to go

1189
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:38,650
through and put in the draft for them

1190
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:40,870
and gone recurves

1191
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:43,060
but yeah I mean like this just work and

1192
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:47,890
it's really absolutely amazing that it

1193
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:50,140
does I mean like you know I knew that

1194
00:57:47,890 --> 00:57:51,100
this should work and when it did you

1195
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:54,850
still blew me away

1196
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:56,529
but okay so we can combine keys and what

1197
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:59,860
this means is that when you apply this

1198
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:01,480
to a key provisioning protocol we do

1199
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:08,590
away with the need for proof of

1200
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:12,700
possession and key provisioning becomes

1201
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:14,980
a kind of like a holistic thing because

1202
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:19,750
if you have to do if the device it

1203
00:58:14,980 --> 00:58:22,930
doesn't connect in the right private key

1204
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:25,390
well the public key is not going to come

1205
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:29,620
out right so it's going to end up not

1206
00:58:25,390 --> 00:58:31,180
knowing the right yeah so it ends up

1207
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:35,259
with a different way of doing proof of

1208
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:38,200
possession and simplifies the protocol

1209
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:42,000
at the same time as getting away from

1210
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:48,129
the traditional vulnerability of wikis

1211
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:49,600
next slide we can also do it for key

1212
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:53,050
splitting so this is threshold

1213
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:56,470
cryptography so we take a private key

1214
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:59,920
Zed and we do a key agreement with it in

1215
00:58:56,470 --> 00:59:02,680
the normal you know alga mal encryption

1216
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:07,870
so we do a key agreement and we end up

1217
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:11,890
with the value a okay well we can derive

1218
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:14,830
that same value a by generating a random

1219
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:18,700
number X which is going to be our first

1220
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:21,580
private key and then using the private

1221
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:28,000
key of the encryption group in this case

1222
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:30,270
Zed use that to derive Y we can then do

1223
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:34,090
the to a key agreement separately

1224
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:37,509
combine the results and come up with the

1225
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:40,200
same result as the original one so what

1226
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:45,600
this means is if we go to the next slide

1227
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:45,600
what this means is that we can do

1228
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:51,480
we can do encryption in the cloud we can

1229
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:55,110
have a key manager in the cloud that can

1230
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:59,760
control use of decryption but cannot

1231
00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:02,820
decrypt and we can prove that this cloud

1232
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:05,880
service has absolutely no knowledge of

1233
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:09,140
the private key because we give the

1234
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:13,230
service the random number so all the

1235
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:18,359
service has is a random number and a

1236
01:00:13,230 --> 01:00:20,160
bunch of encrypted files oh and we do

1237
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:23,430
have so we have a different random

1238
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:25,859
number for each person that we join to

1239
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:27,899
the group and what this means that we

1240
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:30,060
can do now is that we can do group

1241
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:32,430
encryption we can have a pile of

1242
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:35,190
documents that are already encrypted and

1243
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:37,740
we can add a new person to our

1244
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:41,040
encryption group and they've now got

1245
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:44,330
access to all those documents all the

1246
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,330
ones that were written in the past

1247
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:50,399
because all we need to do is to provide

1248
01:00:47,340 --> 01:00:52,380
the of the halves of the keys to the

1249
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,100
various people and now the cloud service

1250
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:58,050
can enable them conversely if the we

1251
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,730
decide they're a bad egg and we don't

1252
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:01,890
want them to have a decryption

1253
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:05,010
capabilities we can shut them off at the

1254
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:09,509
server we can tell the server do not

1255
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:14,580
decrypt for Bob anymore or alternatively

1256
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:17,970
again we can have velocity controls in

1257
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:22,680
the server so the server can say okay

1258
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:25,560
you've decrypted thirty thousand

1259
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:27,359
diplomatic cables this hour I'm not

1260
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:33,180
going to let you have thirty thousand

1261
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:35,340
and one and so it provides us with what

1262
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:40,080
I call confidential document control

1263
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:42,930
this is not a full CRM system because if

1264
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:45,810
you I've been if you want the ability to

1265
01:01:42,930 --> 01:01:48,509
decrypt the document you've got it and

1266
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:51,450
that's it you know this is not going to

1267
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:54,300
control the onward distribution it's not

1268
01:01:51,450 --> 01:01:56,040
going to force you to delete it if you

1269
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:58,230
are taken out of the group yeah so

1270
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:59,670
what's what Bob is already decrypted

1271
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:04,440
before he was thrown out of the group

1272
01:01:59,670 --> 01:02:07,920
he's still got however it does solve the

1273
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:10,680
problem of instead of everybody in the

1274
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,220
organization who might need access to

1275
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:18,600
the document we can control access to

1276
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:23,790
those who actually need it so next slide

1277
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:25,650
okay and this is the so do I have

1278
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:28,110
clarification questions on the

1279
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:30,780
cryptography yeah so as a reminder I

1280
01:02:28,110 --> 01:02:33,090
mean Rich's well-designed agenda this is

1281
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,650
clarifying for five minutes about that

1282
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:36,600
and then we'll go into the discussion of

1283
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,890
you know what do we do with the body of

1284
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,360
work so this is the last presentation

1285
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:42,509
but are there any clarifying questions

1286
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:44,610
on this last segment now also say that

1287
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:47,160
if people have you know more detailed

1288
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:48,750
questions on this they can come yeah I'm

1289
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:58,799
here for the whole week so they can come

1290
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:59,820
at me and Steven you may not have the

1291
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:03,000
answer to this I'll chop your head and

1292
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:04,830
that's okay it's unclear to me how what

1293
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,960
you're presenting remains as simple as

1294
01:03:04,830 --> 01:03:11,279
it is and meets the sort of group

1295
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,840
requirements your mission without

1296
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:17,100
turning into something as complicated as

1297
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:19,470
MLS so either they're doing something

1298
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:21,630
vastly over complex unnecessarily or

1299
01:03:19,470 --> 01:03:26,299
maybe your presentation is making it

1300
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:26,300
look easier than it is is that fair I

1301
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:33,990
think that your analysis is correct I'm

1302
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:40,830
not sure whether it would be politic of

1303
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:44,279
myself to answer your question I did try

1304
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:47,490
to persuade the MLS people to look at

1305
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:49,350
this stuff when they were starting the

1306
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:51,299
difference between what they're trying

1307
01:03:49,350 --> 01:03:55,290
to do and what I'm trying to do though

1308
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:57,480
is a matter of the different sitting

1309
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:59,730
ideology in it they're trying to do

1310
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:02,359
off-the-record they're trying to make

1311
01:03:59,730 --> 01:04:06,180
their messages disappear over time and

1312
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:08,130
what I'm trying to do is if I got a new

1313
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:10,350
employee that I've on boarded and

1314
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:12,090
brought into my group I want to give

1315
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:15,150
that new employee access

1316
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:18,020
to all the documents all the chats all

1317
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:21,750
the emails all the context information

1318
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:25,100
all the online discussions or the video

1319
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:28,650
conferences that took place before and

1320
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:32,610
so we're actually trying to do two

1321
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:35,220
separate things now I have tried to get

1322
01:04:32,610 --> 01:04:38,490
my head around there at the MLS problem

1323
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:43,560
and apply this stuff to it I think it is

1324
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:46,259
intrinsically a harder problem but that

1325
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:49,490
might just be because I'm stupid I mean

1326
01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:54,390
like this is one of those things that

1327
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:57,390
you know I or somebody else might wake

1328
01:04:54,390 --> 01:05:00,870
up one morning and suddenly see oh

1329
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:06,410
there's an easy way of doing this but so

1330
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:11,370
far that's not happened to me well it so

1331
01:05:06,410 --> 01:05:13,230
my previous question about who has the

1332
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:18,230
app and why do device manufacturers

1333
01:05:13,230 --> 01:05:20,400
follow this is still unanswered I I get

1334
01:05:18,230 --> 01:05:22,110
some something is clear to me now that

1335
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,210
anybody can be a service provider

1336
01:05:22,110 --> 01:05:27,030
include including the user can set up

1337
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:29,730
its own server so that part is clear but

1338
01:05:27,030 --> 01:05:32,550
is there some standard mesh app that

1339
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:35,360
will work regardless of what device I

1340
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:38,820
buy or which organization I use and

1341
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:42,510
who-who will have this app so those guys

1342
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:45,900
remain unanswered okay sorry so when you

1343
01:05:42,510 --> 01:05:47,970
what in order to use the mesh you can

1344
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:51,120
that there's a mesh management tool and

1345
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:53,339
that will create a device profile that

1346
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:58,049
contains all the keys for that device

1347
01:05:53,340 --> 01:06:00,950
and so you don't need the did the device

1348
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:05,910
manufacturer does not need to cooperate

1349
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:10,230
in order to use this stuff however if we

1350
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:12,990
want to do the type of if however the

1351
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:16,050
device manufacturer did want to

1352
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:19,560
cooperate there are some opportunities

1353
01:06:16,050 --> 01:06:21,870
that this stuff makes possible that

1354
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:25,950
aren't available otherwise so for

1355
01:06:21,870 --> 01:06:28,049
example the key provisioning piece

1356
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:31,980
what you can do is say the device

1357
01:06:28,049 --> 01:06:34,730
manufacturer has a key that is unique to

1358
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:38,849
each device embedded into the device

1359
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:42,809
okay and the device comes with that well

1360
01:06:38,849 --> 01:06:45,390
that's a key that cannot be extracted

1361
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:48,960
from the device which makes it really

1362
01:06:45,390 --> 01:06:52,790
interesting to me it's also a key that I

1363
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:56,089
cannot possibly trust because the device

1364
01:06:52,790 --> 01:07:00,690
manufacturer might have been coerced any

1365
01:06:56,089 --> 01:07:02,819
piece in the in the supply chain might

1366
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:06,599
have been coerced or manipulated or

1367
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:10,230
whatever however what I can do is I get

1368
01:07:06,599 --> 01:07:14,309
this device I then layer on a key

1369
01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:18,000
contribution of my own and I've now got

1370
01:07:14,309 --> 01:07:21,089
I going to be doing my device level you

1371
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:24,510
know my trusted Hardware public key

1372
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:29,210
stuff and also my secondary layered key

1373
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:31,500
stuff and that allows me to use that

1374
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:40,020
untrustworthy key in a trustworthy

1375
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:41,549
manner and sorry so if if we have device

1376
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:45,089
manufacturers that are willing to go

1377
01:07:41,549 --> 01:07:48,509
this stuff we can absolutely make use of

1378
01:07:45,089 --> 01:07:54,270
that and it can allow a whole new lease

1379
01:07:48,510 --> 01:07:58,109
of life for trustworthy hardware Jef

1380
01:07:54,270 --> 01:08:00,089
Raskin how is trust divided between the

1381
01:07:58,109 --> 01:08:01,859
server and the clients it seems like

1382
01:08:00,089 --> 01:08:03,089
you're hiding the content of the

1383
01:08:01,859 --> 01:08:04,650
documents from the server but you're

1384
01:08:03,089 --> 01:08:07,410
trusting it to add and remove people

1385
01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:12,569
from groups is that fair right

1386
01:08:07,410 --> 01:08:16,469
the the service is trusted to remove

1387
01:08:12,569 --> 01:08:18,689
people from groups a person can only be

1388
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:21,029
added to a group by the group

1389
01:08:18,689 --> 01:08:24,299
administrator and the group

1390
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:27,929
administrator controls the key locally

1391
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:32,370
so adding users to the group is always

1392
01:08:27,929 --> 01:08:35,339
end to end now if you get into you know

1393
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:37,140
if you want to go beyond the level of

1394
01:08:35,339 --> 01:08:38,670
security that ordinary internet uses

1395
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,690
what you know say you want to do this in

1396
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:41,460
the government types that you

1397
01:08:39,689 --> 01:08:43,108
raishin or you want to do it in a

1398
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:46,160
banking type situation where you have

1399
01:08:43,109 --> 01:08:48,960
huge amounts of money involved we can

1400
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:52,349
apply separation of duties

1401
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,540
it isn't described how to do it in you

1402
01:08:52,350 --> 01:08:57,239
know the that isn't being rarefied into

1403
01:08:54,540 --> 01:09:02,040
code but I absolutely know how to do it

1404
01:08:57,238 --> 01:09:03,839
and there are disclosures and prior arts

1405
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,488
and oh I should have mentioned I believe

1406
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:06,899
that this this should all be an income

1407
01:09:05,488 --> 01:09:08,839
but as far as I'm concerned I don't

1408
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:11,809
believe that there's any all right last

1409
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:14,399
clarifying question I should okay and

1410
01:09:11,810 --> 01:09:16,080
enjoy from article 19 just building up

1411
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:17,849
on the previous question just wondering

1412
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:19,019
if there's going to be provisioning in

1413
01:09:17,850 --> 01:09:26,219
case that the manufacturer actually

1414
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:27,900
wants to block it how do you mean like

1415
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:30,469
you mentioned if the manufacturer wants

1416
01:09:27,899 --> 01:09:33,988
to participate then they that they can

1417
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:36,000
be part of the key for the device for

1418
01:09:33,988 --> 01:09:38,580
there but what if they actually don't

1419
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,738
want the user to be able to set this

1420
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:48,390
happen on the device well then they

1421
01:09:40,738 --> 01:09:49,919
don't need well censorship that before

1422
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:54,870
oh okay

1423
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:57,390
I mean if the computer if the user hat

1424
01:09:54,870 --> 01:09:59,190
is allowed to install their own

1425
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:02,550
applications they can always run the

1426
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:05,759
mesh as an application if the device has

1427
01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:06,960
been locked down and so that they have

1428
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,630
you have to have the permission of the

1429
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,870
manufacturer whoever to run it and they

1430
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:18,000
don't allow secure applications well

1431
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:21,000
that's not going to be possible but we

1432
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,910
can at least the manufacturer can at

1433
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,400
least take themselves out of the trust

1434
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:28,110
loop which is good for the manufacturer

1435
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:30,570
I believe because you're most

1436
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:35,460
manufacturers they do not want to

1437
01:10:30,570 --> 01:10:38,040
sabotage their customers but then

1438
01:10:35,460 --> 01:10:40,739
concern is not that it's that they might

1439
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:44,250
be coerced honor but their employees

1440
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:46,139
might be corruptly induced to do

1441
01:10:44,250 --> 01:10:49,500
something that then you know cost the

1442
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:52,910
company something so yeah I mean we can

1443
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:52,910
come back to that offline but

1444
01:10:53,190 --> 01:10:58,599
if there is a sensible answer I think

1445
01:10:55,929 --> 01:11:00,340
that we can get into it this is Ben

1446
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,380
Caidic again to sort of respond to

1447
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:04,690
Jeffrey's point I think it's probably

1448
01:11:02,380 --> 01:11:06,489
useful to remember that so the starting

1449
01:11:04,690 --> 01:11:08,919
premise here is that we want to make

1450
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:10,360
something that is as easy to use or

1451
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,429
easier to use than what people are

1452
01:11:10,360 --> 01:11:14,860
currently doing and you know to some

1453
01:11:12,429 --> 01:11:16,179
extent that might limit the security

1454
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:18,580
properties that we know how to provide

1455
01:11:16,179 --> 01:11:19,929
within those constraints and so you know

1456
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:23,110
the fact that we have this slightly

1457
01:11:19,929 --> 01:11:25,750
weird who is trusted to do what behavior

1458
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:30,099
worried like the this the service in the

1459
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:31,750
cloud can remove people and it's a

1460
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,369
little bit wishy-washy about how much of

1461
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:35,619
a guarantee you have that it does so

1462
01:11:33,369 --> 01:11:37,449
properly we still have some other

1463
01:11:35,619 --> 01:11:39,869
properties that are useful within these

1464
01:11:37,449 --> 01:11:42,070
constraints about making it easy to use

1465
01:11:39,869 --> 01:11:44,259
absolutely actually this is one of the

1466
01:11:42,070 --> 01:11:46,150
things that has really been guiding the

1467
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:48,760
whole design in that traditionally

1468
01:11:46,150 --> 01:11:50,619
because we're security people we try and

1469
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:53,139
provide absolutely the most security

1470
01:11:50,619 --> 01:11:55,540
that we can and then after we've done

1471
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:58,230
all that stuff is kind of like oh well

1472
01:11:55,540 --> 01:12:00,790
how are we gonna make this tolerable

1473
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:03,369
here is the opposite way of looking at

1474
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:05,320
things it's how do we make it as easy as

1475
01:12:03,369 --> 01:12:08,019
possible to use the computer as possible

1476
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:11,190
and then how can we do that securely and

1477
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:15,880
how can security help us do that so yeah

1478
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:18,040
ok so so for the next section we were

1479
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:20,770
going to discuss you know how does a how

1480
01:12:18,040 --> 01:12:23,800
do we is this an interesting place for

1481
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:26,440
the ATF to spend work on what is the

1482
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:28,510
problem space of interest like password

1483
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:30,549
management might be a reasonable

1484
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,590
starting point is there a solvable

1485
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:33,880
problem here in other words do people

1486
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:36,520
agree that this is a solvable problem

1487
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:40,330
Phil doesn't have to necessarily win

1488
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,750
that battle which components of you know

1489
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:42,880
Phil's

1490
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:45,489
you know might be useful in a starting

1491
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:47,170
charter or at least you know these you

1492
01:12:45,489 --> 01:12:48,879
know he proposed a set of solutions that

1493
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:50,590
doesn't mean we have to pick his in the

1494
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:52,900
problem space that the IETF ends up

1495
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,639
wanting to work on and who is you know

1496
01:12:52,900 --> 01:12:56,739
willing to help work on it of course and

1497
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:58,119
you know is password management a

1498
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,400
reasonable starting place or for those

1499
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:02,139
that have read more of the documents are

1500
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,040
there you know or other components that

1501
01:13:02,139 --> 01:13:05,930
you feel would be even more

1502
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:09,490
appropriate or marked anything else to

1503
01:13:05,930 --> 01:13:09,490
prioritize do you want to add anything

1504
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:16,960
Phil you can fill you can sit down now

1505
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:19,310
thank you

1506
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:22,700
you might still need to answer questions

1507
01:13:19,310 --> 01:13:24,740
but it's not mine so so some other

1508
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:26,690
pieces here that was sort of mentioned

1509
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:28,519
in passing seemed quite fascinating the

1510
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:31,400
the ability to take you know a

1511
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:33,590
hardware-based key like off of a TPM or

1512
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,299
something some more and then augment it

1513
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:37,490
with something else so that you now can

1514
01:13:35,300 --> 01:13:40,310
can leverage that Hardware would have

1515
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:43,969
cost but still not completely trust the

1516
01:13:40,310 --> 01:13:47,090
manufacturer the doc these slides refer

1517
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:49,370
to some IOT use case and I one of the

1518
01:13:47,090 --> 01:13:52,580
things I want to explore is is whether

1519
01:13:49,370 --> 01:13:54,260
we should do that here now because I

1520
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:56,180
want to make sure we can do this for

1521
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:59,360
devices that don't have user interfaces

1522
01:13:56,180 --> 01:14:01,460
for all this on the device might be you

1523
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,650
know the barcode of the key fingerprint

1524
01:14:01,460 --> 01:14:05,900
of that public key that's in the TPM and

1525
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:09,460
make sure that that stuff works because

1526
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:09,460
that's a very interesting to me at least

1527
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:16,910
hi Roman Dean you know hat so since the

1528
01:14:15,410 --> 01:14:18,380
words working group were used I guess

1529
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:20,900
I'd be interested to hear from the

1530
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:24,500
community are we talking about a working

1531
01:14:20,900 --> 01:14:26,540
group whose success is governed on we

1532
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,550
solved the password problem are we

1533
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:30,620
looking at a working group that is

1534
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:32,240
picking out specific technologies that

1535
01:14:30,620 --> 01:14:34,040
we talked about here and we're gonna

1536
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,719
advanced and mature those technologies

1537
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:38,570
and we happen to maybe solve password

1538
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:42,830
stuff along the way that sure sounded

1539
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:44,660
like you had a hat on from my point of

1540
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:48,080
view I would really prefer that we did

1541
01:14:44,660 --> 01:14:51,320
the second and that we we use the

1542
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:54,620
password application as a sanity test

1543
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:57,230
but that isn't the output of it if you

1544
01:14:54,620 --> 01:15:00,050
want to produce a password manager there

1545
01:14:57,230 --> 01:15:03,019
are simpler ways of cracking that

1546
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:07,960
particular nut the reason for wanting

1547
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:10,910
all this mechanism is because shredding

1548
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,470
splitting up the problem space allows me

1549
01:15:10,910 --> 01:15:15,889
to then solve a whole bunch of other

1550
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:17,630
problems in the same vein and on the IOT

1551
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:19,489
side I

1552
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:22,520
deliberately trying to isolate myself

1553
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:25,699
and think about this separately from

1554
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:28,790
specific applications that aren't

1555
01:15:25,699 --> 01:15:32,059
already deployed I'm absolutely willing

1556
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:34,100
to interact with them but I needed to

1557
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:36,800
get my stuff done before I start to talk

1558
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:41,179
about how to interact because otherwise

1559
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:45,469
I just go crazy so high roaming back

1560
01:15:41,179 --> 01:15:46,520
I'll put the hat back on so my I I think

1561
01:15:45,469 --> 01:15:48,500
I understand country what you're saying

1562
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:49,940
I guess I struggle want to hear a lot

1563
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:53,630
more conversation about I don't know how

1564
01:15:49,940 --> 01:15:55,820
to measure success and I understand that

1565
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:58,219
password is you know way to test that we

1566
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:59,719
got it right but I dressed I'd want to

1567
01:15:58,219 --> 01:16:01,040
hear more discussion on what success

1568
01:15:59,719 --> 01:16:02,000
would be advancing any of those

1569
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:07,580
technologies kind of what the

1570
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:12,770
constraints would be Michael Richards

1571
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:14,900
the mic I'm with fill in that I would

1572
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:17,810
like to solve passwords along the way to

1573
01:16:14,900 --> 01:16:20,870
solving creating a set of technologies

1574
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:22,880
that have multiple applications I am not

1575
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:25,460
sure how to answer your success question

1576
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:28,940
but certainly if we fail to solve

1577
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:30,770
passwords we would be a failure okay so

1578
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:32,989
I think we can identify some failure

1579
01:16:30,770 --> 01:16:35,800
conditions which would mean stop working

1580
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:40,330
and continue if that's useful to the isg

1581
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:43,670
I think that the document in the cloud

1582
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:47,350
decrypt etc of that interesting thing

1583
01:16:43,670 --> 01:16:51,139
that isn't quite but is almost like MLS

1584
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:56,300
has an interesting IOT application which

1585
01:16:51,139 --> 01:16:58,850
is the devices devices one of the issues

1586
01:16:56,300 --> 01:17:00,260
with and anyone who has considered

1587
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:02,600
upgrading their phone has gone through

1588
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:04,190
this quandary either replacing your

1589
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,710
phone or operating the operating system

1590
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:10,549
either because it got destroyed by a bus

1591
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:11,900
or whatever is that all of these things

1592
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,090
would really like to save their

1593
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:16,280
configuration encrypted securely that no

1594
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:19,550
one can mess with it in a way that that

1595
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:22,699
device or an equivalent device can

1596
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:26,120
retrieve the configuration and resume

1597
01:17:22,699 --> 01:17:28,669
operations as if nothing had happened

1598
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:31,010
it's I heard an hour-long conversation

1599
01:17:28,670 --> 01:17:35,990
at a meeting in September of the

1600
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:42,260
Oh PC uh where they these is a

1601
01:17:35,990 --> 01:17:44,630
operational IOT consortium where they

1602
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:48,920
they completely rat holed into that

1603
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:51,560
conversation about that and and krill it

1604
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:53,660
critically it was obvious that that was

1605
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:56,360
a serious stumbling block for them to

1606
01:17:53,660 --> 01:17:58,730
adopt any onboarding such concise it

1607
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,469
solution because it was clear to them

1608
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:01,759
that you was pointless to onboard a

1609
01:18:00,470 --> 01:18:05,210
device that didn't have a valid

1610
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:06,410
configuration right you on board it

1611
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,210
automatically then you send the

1612
01:18:06,410 --> 01:18:10,010
technician up to send out to set up the

1613
01:18:08,210 --> 01:18:11,930
actual configuration well you missed the

1614
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:13,940
whole point of automatic onboarding if

1615
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:16,820
someone had to go configure it right and

1616
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:18,440
so I think that's a actual really

1617
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,150
interesting second use case that really

1618
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:23,719
has nothing to do with passwords and

1619
01:18:20,150 --> 01:18:26,059
isn't necessarily the Snowden problem

1620
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:28,330
but is in fact tractable at a small

1621
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:28,330
space

1622
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:39,769
benkei dock so with no hat I promise I'm

1623
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:41,480
actually pretty excited in the same vein

1624
01:18:39,770 --> 01:18:44,180
as Michael about you're getting to work

1625
01:18:41,480 --> 01:18:46,730
on some of this broader technological

1626
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:50,120
solution because there's a lot there

1627
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:51,440
that excites me I think there's a lot of

1628
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:53,300
potential in some of these new

1629
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:57,769
technologies especially the sort of meta

1630
01:18:53,300 --> 01:19:00,470
cryptography stuff to make solutions for

1631
01:18:57,770 --> 01:19:03,260
a lot of use cases that we just haven't

1632
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:06,410
been doing in the ITF before but I think

1633
01:19:03,260 --> 01:19:08,920
there's probably a lot there that that

1634
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:11,960
would be interesting to look at more I

1635
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,580
think I've also looked at the drafts for

1636
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:15,770
like the UDF and the Dare stuff a little

1637
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:17,420
bit more and there's a lot of

1638
01:19:15,770 --> 01:19:19,850
interesting ideas in there and there's

1639
01:19:17,420 --> 01:19:22,160
you know saying there's still a lot of

1640
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:24,410
room for more co-authors to come in and

1641
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:27,110
flush out some of the bits and make sure

1642
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:30,380
we're getting the details right so I

1643
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:32,509
think there's still work to be done to

1644
01:19:30,380 --> 01:19:35,720
to get that into the best shape but I

1645
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:37,370
think it's worth pursuing and Phil gets

1646
01:19:35,720 --> 01:19:41,989
bonus points for putting SVG's in this

1647
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:43,670
document to there

1648
01:19:41,989 --> 01:19:49,280
girl answering I just have something

1649
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:50,870
else so I guess on the question I was

1650
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:53,239
gonna get at earlier but it's not

1651
01:19:50,870 --> 01:19:54,590
clarifying so I did not ask it is there

1652
01:19:53,239 --> 01:19:58,910
are quite a few people who already are

1653
01:19:54,590 --> 01:20:01,550
doing um password sink systems we have

1654
01:19:58,910 --> 01:20:03,410
one I know Google has one ever every one

1655
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:05,540
password as one there's like law etc um

1656
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:08,210
we by the way or not unaware of these

1657
01:20:05,540 --> 01:20:11,090
ideas in fact the initial conventional

1658
01:20:08,210 --> 01:20:13,400
Firefox system use a fake for this which

1659
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:17,690
has some solar properties to unfold

1660
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:21,160
especially here um my question is which

1661
01:20:17,690 --> 01:20:21,160
if any of those which is to consume this

1662
01:20:23,830 --> 01:20:27,410
which of any of those which of any of

1663
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:29,260
those companies who build systems like

1664
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:31,489
this which is to consume this technology

1665
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:33,080
so I don't know who you're directing

1666
01:20:31,489 --> 01:20:35,209
your question to well certainly not me

1667
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:38,630
but anybody anybody hey is anybody in

1668
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:39,860
this room who um um is anybody this room

1669
01:20:38,630 --> 01:20:41,270
or something like that that likes

1670
01:20:39,860 --> 01:20:43,849
interesting I think I can tell you that

1671
01:20:41,270 --> 01:20:48,170
like um I I guess I guess speaking for

1672
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:49,340
baking for Firefox um like this is

1673
01:20:48,170 --> 01:20:50,900
somewhat different set of trade-offs in

1674
01:20:49,340 --> 01:20:55,460
science we decided to make I don't think

1675
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:58,969
we'd shift a piece so let me rephrase

1676
01:20:55,460 --> 01:21:04,340
that question occur so let me rephrase

1677
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:06,620
that for one sec so to answer other

1678
01:21:04,340 --> 01:21:08,510
people's question of what would be a

1679
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:10,219
reasonable successful outcome of this

1680
01:21:08,510 --> 01:21:12,710
working group a reasonable successful

1681
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:15,650
outcome would be interoperable password

1682
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:17,960
management right oh there's two sides to

1683
01:21:15,650 --> 01:21:19,940
your question right there's the user you

1684
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:21,800
know do users want it and are there

1685
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:23,540
companies willing to do it even with or

1686
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:24,469
without I mean the reason is not Naropa

1687
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,489
house turn management I thought that

1688
01:21:24,469 --> 01:21:26,810
don't have like the phone number the

1689
01:21:25,489 --> 01:21:31,849
guys are chrome do passwords saying

1690
01:21:26,810 --> 01:21:33,080
right um just not and I don't like no

1691
01:21:31,850 --> 01:21:34,489
Chris's phone number I can't call him

1692
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:36,320
it's not like the companies to do this

1693
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:39,650
don't want and her professor management

1694
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:42,920
um but I guess what I'm saying is that

1695
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:44,690
um if they did the the those

1696
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:47,360
presentation this use case was presented

1697
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:50,000
as this is presented as using the

1698
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:51,620
password management example to drive the

1699
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,510
technical partnership building these

1700
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:55,550
other other systems and what I'm saying

1701
01:21:53,510 --> 01:21:57,140
is is that it that's true

1702
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:58,340
then there are to be people who build

1703
01:21:57,140 --> 01:21:59,420
systems that are password management

1704
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:01,460
seeing systems who would be interested

1705
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,660
in this I'm trying to find a drive with

1706
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:06,220
that match that I just true

1707
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,220
is there a customer for this technology

1708
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:14,690
or the exist you know yeah so then

1709
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:15,980
Caidic to jump in I think the

1710
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:18,379
prerequisite to answering that question

1711
01:22:15,980 --> 01:22:20,690
is is there anybody in this room who is

1712
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:23,600
building a password manager product and

1713
01:22:20,690 --> 01:22:25,309
you know if we get silence to that then

1714
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:29,000
silence to the other question in really

1715
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:31,880
meaningful sure well I mean Firefox has

1716
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:33,290
a customer sink positions passwords as

1717
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:34,790
somewhere it's a difference that design

1718
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:35,870
trade-offs in this and I would not

1719
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:37,850
change these design trade-offs

1720
01:22:35,870 --> 01:22:39,230
I don't believe Chris I don't know if

1721
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:41,900
you can speak for the iCloud design um

1722
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:43,969
okay so I guess I don't know but like

1723
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:45,019
but similarly if those people are not in

1724
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,250
this room then we have no idea if the

1725
01:22:45,020 --> 01:22:50,120
requirements are and we solve the

1726
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:52,520
problem so so I guess my question I'm

1727
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:53,930
asking asking is are the are the

1728
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:55,280
consumer are their demonstrated

1729
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:57,590
consumers there's not a technology here

1730
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,290
I mean like we did in the less right we

1731
01:22:57,590 --> 01:23:01,730
have like a lot of people who said like

1732
01:22:59,290 --> 01:23:03,140
there's no technology and we would like

1733
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:04,910
consider adopting it if what we're done

1734
01:23:03,140 --> 01:23:06,500
that's my question is are there people

1735
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:09,920
for this technology one say the same

1736
01:23:06,500 --> 01:23:12,320
thing have any of those people been to

1737
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:15,140
IETF meetings before unlike say

1738
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:18,860
messaging in real time communication and

1739
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:20,570
so on I guess I don't have any question

1740
01:23:18,860 --> 01:23:22,460
can you say I'm saying you're asking if

1741
01:23:20,570 --> 01:23:24,320
anyone in the room is building or

1742
01:23:22,460 --> 01:23:27,500
working on let's call it a competing

1743
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:30,139
product right we've never seen one

1744
01:23:27,500 --> 01:23:31,700
password password safe shires key pass

1745
01:23:30,140 --> 01:23:33,650
whatever the hell you well I guess I

1746
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:35,360
guess I can tell you that like there are

1747
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:38,690
at least three big systems that are that

1748
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,339
had people in this room that build the

1749
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:42,410
build password steam systems which is to

1750
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,060
say Firefox Chrome and Apple they're all

1751
01:23:42,410 --> 01:23:45,410
in this room now I don't the relevant

1752
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:46,670
people in this room it's not like

1753
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:53,420
they're Cubs don't resent it represented

1754
01:23:46,670 --> 01:23:55,880
here thank you next thinking about dare

1755
01:23:53,420 --> 01:23:58,550
I I don't feel like the append-only

1756
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:02,570
blog aspect of it has has really been

1757
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:04,370
motivated enough and if if that goes

1758
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:05,599
into a working group I'd want to see

1759
01:24:04,370 --> 01:24:08,230
that that piece

1760
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,230
motivated better

1761
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:18,119
we went ashore that makes sense

1762
01:24:13,969 --> 01:24:20,190
so it's in the IETF we don't really work

1763
01:24:18,119 --> 01:24:24,659
on interesting problems because they're

1764
01:24:20,190 --> 01:24:26,400
interesting we work on on technologies

1765
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:27,960
for which there's demand and I think

1766
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:32,820
this is related to Eckert's ecords

1767
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:35,039
comment and so you know I shall put a

1768
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:39,119
massive amount of work into this it's

1769
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:41,159
great stuff he's the only author on this

1770
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:43,589
topic right and even though we saw the

1771
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:45,570
bath was coming there were no other

1772
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:47,880
contributions and so I'm wondering just

1773
01:24:45,570 --> 01:24:49,500
you know what the landscape out there

1774
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:51,449
actually is for this stuff the other

1775
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:53,909
thing is I don't think we should focus

1776
01:24:51,449 --> 01:24:56,159
overly much on the password management

1777
01:24:53,909 --> 01:24:58,440
aspect of it unless that turns out to be

1778
01:24:56,159 --> 01:25:00,449
the product but I think there's also

1779
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:02,699
seems to be agreement that it would not

1780
01:25:00,449 --> 01:25:06,839
be the product the technology would be

1781
01:25:02,699 --> 01:25:09,690
the product that's fair and I encourage

1782
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,699
people that want to work with fill on

1783
01:25:09,690 --> 01:25:13,018
elements of a couple of people have said

1784
01:25:11,699 --> 01:25:14,579
you're interested in other components

1785
01:25:13,019 --> 01:25:17,039
not necessarily in a patch management

1786
01:25:14,579 --> 01:25:19,469
space - - please state that you're

1787
01:25:17,039 --> 01:25:27,150
interested in helping fill microphone on

1788
01:25:19,469 --> 01:25:31,949
the back hello hello is that working

1789
01:25:27,150 --> 01:25:34,199
yeah okay so Lawrence lund blade I think

1790
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:36,089
there's probably about thirty to fifty

1791
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:38,250
percent overlap of some of the work

1792
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:40,400
being done in the phyto alliance there

1793
01:25:38,250 --> 01:25:43,289
of course centered around biometric

1794
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,299
authentication and that's their solution

1795
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:47,400
for replacing passwords but there's

1796
01:25:45,300 --> 01:25:51,059
always a fallback to something but but

1797
01:25:47,400 --> 01:25:52,888
the whole idea of eliminating passwords

1798
01:25:51,059 --> 01:25:56,389
or doing something better about

1799
01:25:52,889 --> 01:25:59,639
passwords that's in parallel the idea of

1800
01:25:56,389 --> 01:26:02,389
binding multiple devices is areas that

1801
01:25:59,639 --> 01:26:05,760
they're exploring that's relevant to

1802
01:26:02,389 --> 01:26:09,300
authentication and then the they call

1803
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:11,429
account recovery or to backup systems

1804
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:12,840
for authentication that's also work

1805
01:26:11,429 --> 01:26:14,760
that's being explored there so there's

1806
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,559
some white papers and some some things

1807
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:18,090
like that so I just wanted you're asking

1808
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:20,190
about people in the room that have some

1809
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:22,050
familiarity so that's just mentioning

1810
01:26:20,190 --> 01:26:22,679
that some work in the phyto alliance

1811
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:27,450
that's that's

1812
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:29,250
are allowing this been Caidic again so I

1813
01:26:27,450 --> 01:26:30,809
guess Melinda's sort of started to cover

1814
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,580
some of these topics could we go back to

1815
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:33,960
the so we run the original slides with

1816
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:37,410
the orange and the greeting in the blue

1817
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:39,690
boxes please so like we're talking about

1818
01:26:37,410 --> 01:26:42,150
passwords because that's what Phyllis

1819
01:26:39,690 --> 01:26:45,210
proposed as a potential use case that

1820
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:47,490
would be a concrete realization of this

1821
01:26:45,210 --> 01:26:51,780
technology but without trying to boil

1822
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:54,330
ocean but there's no particular reason

1823
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:59,910
we have to be tied to that there's other

1824
01:26:54,330 --> 01:27:01,320
potential use cases and you know if

1825
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:02,940
people are interested in those other

1826
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:07,139
ones we can talk about those instead of

1827
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:10,799
passwords and the other point that I

1828
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:12,060
want to make is that even if we're

1829
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,210
talking about passwords that's sort of

1830
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:16,890
relying on the green box the mesh core

1831
01:27:14,210 --> 01:27:19,920
and it might be worth taking a step back

1832
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:22,140
to look at the blue boxes to say you

1833
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:24,540
know do people understand what these

1834
01:27:22,140 --> 01:27:27,180
three technologies and blue boxes are

1835
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:30,380
trying to do and things that they might

1836
01:27:27,180 --> 01:27:33,000
have used cases for those as well so

1837
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:34,860
let's not focus too much on the on the

1838
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:37,110
orange part yet if we're getting ahead

1839
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:38,490
of ourselves by doing so I definitely

1840
01:27:37,110 --> 01:27:42,589
heard interest in some of the blue box

1841
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,590
front microphone then back then front

1842
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:50,310
Eric Mike you asked about other use

1843
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:52,650
cases so if it wasn't clear before at

1844
01:27:50,310 --> 01:27:54,630
least pieces of this stuff I would

1845
01:27:52,650 --> 01:27:56,820
actually apply to what I would call IOT

1846
01:27:54,630 --> 01:27:59,430
or at computing and an open source

1847
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:00,450
project next week if I have it because I

1848
01:27:59,430 --> 01:28:02,070
think that there's things you can do

1849
01:28:00,450 --> 01:28:02,849
here that I haven't seen anybody else be

1850
01:28:02,070 --> 01:28:06,090
able to do before

1851
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:07,500
it's that the whole IOT bubble on this

1852
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:09,030
thing I don't actually know because I

1853
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:11,160
don't know exactly what's in there but I

1854
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:13,679
think that if we only focus on the

1855
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:17,780
password side of things that use case we

1856
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:17,780
might you know wander off in the weeds I

1857
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:26,610
like to me over from Nick stole a tee um

1858
01:28:23,150 --> 01:28:28,320
regarding similar initiatives or similar

1859
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:30,150
work I believe that what what's related

1860
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:32,639
to that could be the work we see in the

1861
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:35,879
w3c within the decentralized identity

1862
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:36,459
working group we are essentially trying

1863
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,889
to do

1864
01:28:36,459 --> 01:28:42,489
pairwise encryption based on

1865
01:28:40,889 --> 01:28:44,499
cryptography there's a little bit of

1866
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:46,959
blockchain for public discovery of

1867
01:28:44,499 --> 01:28:49,539
private private key public keys and and

1868
01:28:46,959 --> 01:28:51,249
and revocation as well so that might be

1869
01:28:49,539 --> 01:28:52,989
very well related and there's there's a

1870
01:28:51,249 --> 01:28:55,478
lot going on in that space there like

1871
01:28:52,989 --> 01:29:01,468
hundred billions of startups coming out

1872
01:28:55,479 --> 01:29:03,880
of the area the the main goal of that

1873
01:29:01,469 --> 01:29:06,070
infrastructure is to get rid of

1874
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:09,159
passwords as well and also to do

1875
01:29:06,070 --> 01:29:11,409
something where you don't necessarily

1876
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:14,530
reveal all the attributes that you have

1877
01:29:11,409 --> 01:29:16,719
to some entity just because you want to

1878
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:21,909
authenticate for something so but it's

1879
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:24,340
like mobile clients selfs or an identity

1880
01:29:21,909 --> 01:29:27,638
and decentralized identifiers is the

1881
01:29:24,340 --> 01:29:28,900
keywords Thanks Phil can I give you a

1882
01:29:27,639 --> 01:29:31,900
leading question since a couple of

1883
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:33,308
people have mentioned it you you sort of

1884
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,199
made this statement at one point that

1885
01:29:33,309 --> 01:29:36,579
you're getting rid of passwords you're

1886
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:38,650
not actually getting rid of pasturage

1887
01:29:36,579 --> 01:29:41,049
right you're making it easier to store

1888
01:29:38,650 --> 01:29:43,688
longer passwords which you also said at

1889
01:29:41,050 --> 01:29:45,550
one point too so it's not a password

1890
01:29:43,689 --> 01:29:50,079
list system that is a password storage

1891
01:29:45,550 --> 01:29:54,179
system well the past the the Orange Box

1892
01:29:50,079 --> 01:29:57,070
is a password system however in order to

1893
01:29:54,179 --> 01:30:00,550
prevail in order to access that password

1894
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:04,058
vault from particular device you have to

1895
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:06,130
connect it to the mesh the use of

1896
01:30:04,059 --> 01:30:10,449
personal mesh which means that you've

1897
01:30:06,130 --> 01:30:14,829
already provisioned a key pair set for

1898
01:30:10,449 --> 01:30:19,808
that account which means that we can now

1899
01:30:14,829 --> 01:30:22,389
layer in whatever keys are required by

1900
01:30:19,809 --> 01:30:26,139
web authentication Fido alliance

1901
01:30:22,389 --> 01:30:29,439
whatever technology tries to replace

1902
01:30:26,139 --> 01:30:31,989
passwords so it is not just a password

1903
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:35,050
management system is a password

1904
01:30:31,989 --> 01:30:38,259
management system which by having

1905
01:30:35,050 --> 01:30:41,349
deployed it you have set you have met

1906
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:43,840
the hard precondition the stumbling

1907
01:30:41,349 --> 01:30:45,999
block for getting away from them which

1908
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,670
is having a private key on the device

1909
01:30:45,999 --> 01:30:49,969
that passwords plus got it yes so it is

1910
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:54,949
so

1911
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:58,370
now as far as you know I would be

1912
01:30:54,949 --> 01:31:01,059
overjoyed to do IOT I mean like I would

1913
01:30:58,370 --> 01:31:03,409
really like to do that

1914
01:31:01,060 --> 01:31:05,750
I've got no objections to doing

1915
01:31:03,409 --> 01:31:07,849
different scopes or whatever the reason

1916
01:31:05,750 --> 01:31:10,330
that I chose password was purely because

1917
01:31:07,850 --> 01:31:12,770
that is something I can share a concrete

1918
01:31:10,330 --> 01:31:18,500
value to me as a user

1919
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:19,969
and no Eric no the Firefox the Mozilla

1920
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:23,300
password management is absolutely

1921
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:27,620
useless to me because all my passwords

1922
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:30,620
are in Chrome every one of them and I'm

1923
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:33,110
not going to use Firefox because I am

1924
01:31:30,620 --> 01:31:35,630
tied to Chrome because that's where my

1925
01:31:33,110 --> 01:31:38,299
passwords are okay I want me to use a

1926
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:40,550
lot of fill let's not get a knave a

1927
01:31:38,300 --> 01:31:41,989
flamer over yeah the password managers

1928
01:31:40,550 --> 01:31:44,179
and which ones are best so yeah I mean

1929
01:31:41,989 --> 01:31:46,089
like I just pointing out yet no I

1930
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:49,940
understand you know the position is not

1931
01:31:46,090 --> 01:31:52,040
Thanks benkei duck oh sorry to jump in

1932
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:53,419
and in front of David but Phil would you

1933
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:55,400
consider it a friendly amendment if I

1934
01:31:53,420 --> 01:31:57,260
said that this is not necessarily a

1935
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:59,960
password synchronization protocol but a

1936
01:31:57,260 --> 01:32:02,030
key synchronization protocol and we just

1937
01:31:59,960 --> 01:32:05,330
considered passwords as kind of a really

1938
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:06,889
lousy type of key yeah because yeah I

1939
01:32:05,330 --> 01:32:09,320
would want to consume this to

1940
01:32:06,889 --> 01:32:11,989
synchronize like you know my SSH private

1941
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:13,639
keys or by PGP private keys and it's

1942
01:32:11,989 --> 01:32:19,400
just as easy to do that as to

1943
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:25,610
synchronize the passwords hi David

1944
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:28,120
Skinner's e Google Chrome so one way

1945
01:32:25,610 --> 01:32:31,580
that I'm kind of reasoning about this

1946
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:34,219
particular because Mike was saying a lot

1947
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:36,650
of the primitives here aren't new and

1948
01:32:34,219 --> 01:32:39,110
this kind of feels like what I might

1949
01:32:36,650 --> 01:32:43,070
call a grand unified theory of

1950
01:32:39,110 --> 01:32:47,809
cryptography like a way to tie many

1951
01:32:43,070 --> 01:32:52,330
things together and in general the ITF

1952
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:57,139
does not do grand unified theory is well

1953
01:32:52,330 --> 01:33:00,620
because you can't really reach consensus

1954
01:32:57,139 --> 01:33:02,510
on grand unified theories and in

1955
01:33:00,620 --> 01:33:03,260
particular what the ITF generally does

1956
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:08,510
really

1957
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:11,270
Elle is solving specific problems so for

1958
01:33:08,510 --> 01:33:14,660
this one approach is pick an orange box

1959
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:17,570
and solve that problem and then say oh

1960
01:33:14,660 --> 01:33:19,670
by the way one of the things like when

1961
01:33:17,570 --> 01:33:22,340
we completely only focus on that and

1962
01:33:19,670 --> 01:33:24,650
that also requires people signing up for

1963
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:26,030
that box like if we pick passwords we

1964
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:27,200
need people who make password managers

1965
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:29,030
to show that they're interested for

1966
01:33:27,200 --> 01:33:32,120
example but we could pick another box

1967
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:33,590
but and then we do some work and then

1968
01:33:32,120 --> 01:33:35,900
maybe along the way we say oh by the way

1969
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:39,890
we can reuse this for something else but

1970
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:44,900
right now like this seems really way too

1971
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:47,390
vague for this to be tractable is there

1972
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:53,379
a problem space that you would pick that

1973
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:58,190
would be a good target personally I

1974
01:33:53,380 --> 01:34:01,460
don't see a box here where people who

1975
01:33:58,190 --> 01:34:05,990
live inside the box are interested in a

1976
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:08,720
fix that is a wide solution so another

1977
01:34:05,990 --> 01:34:11,030
way of phrasing that is for a lot of

1978
01:34:08,720 --> 01:34:13,670
these individual problems people have

1979
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:16,160
come up with a special case solution and

1980
01:34:13,670 --> 01:34:18,430
while it is incredibly attractive to

1981
01:34:16,160 --> 01:34:22,460
have a unified solution for many things

1982
01:34:18,430 --> 01:34:24,260
those historically fail because it's

1983
01:34:22,460 --> 01:34:26,870
really hard to build a Swiss Army knife

1984
01:34:24,260 --> 01:34:29,800
with 72 different knives in it wherein

1985
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,800
all you want is scissors

1986
01:34:31,300 --> 01:34:37,550
Eric Riley David said a number of things

1987
01:34:33,890 --> 01:34:40,100
that I already said namely I think it

1988
01:34:37,550 --> 01:34:42,410
would be best to pick a single orange

1989
01:34:40,100 --> 01:34:44,240
box and attempt to solve it and that

1990
01:34:42,410 --> 01:34:45,920
would and a place to start with that is

1991
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,710
is there a consuming community which

1992
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:50,390
ones which ones that want that box soft

1993
01:34:47,710 --> 01:34:54,980
and which thinks this interactive way to

1994
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:58,760
solve it on to go back briefly to the

1995
01:34:54,980 --> 01:35:00,290
password manager example um um I don't

1996
01:34:58,760 --> 01:35:01,580
know the specific password management

1997
01:35:00,290 --> 01:35:03,110
products as well as I know the browser

1998
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:05,630
products the browser products typically

1999
01:35:03,110 --> 01:35:08,660
passwords sync the password is part of a

2000
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:10,340
generalized sync system where there's a

2001
01:35:08,660 --> 01:35:11,900
system where basically you can have

2002
01:35:10,340 --> 01:35:14,120
arbitrary crap saying between the sink

2003
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:16,040
between the browser endpoints on and

2004
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:17,040
passwords one of the things so history's

2005
01:35:16,040 --> 01:35:20,490
an example typically

2006
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:22,290
bookmarks that kind of crap um so um I

2007
01:35:20,490 --> 01:35:23,760
mean I think there's the one might

2008
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:26,010
imagine that the browsers would be

2009
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,560
interested in having a standardized

2010
01:35:26,010 --> 01:35:29,040
protocol for doing that I don't know if

2011
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:33,000
that's true

2012
01:35:29,040 --> 01:35:35,100
um one might imagine this true um I'm be

2013
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,720
honest I'm not sure we'd be ready for

2014
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:42,600
that I don't know the chrome guys um um

2015
01:35:38,720 --> 01:35:44,970
but um as I say I think that the vast

2016
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,520
majority of that work if we were to take

2017
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:48,930
on that work would not entail this

2018
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,240
cryptographic issue would entail

2019
01:35:48,930 --> 01:35:54,570
actually like harmonizing the data

2020
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:55,980
structures and handling some of the

2021
01:35:54,570 --> 01:36:00,299
things someone allude to earlier which

2022
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:02,219
is um conflicts simply and and multiple

2023
01:36:00,300 --> 01:36:03,870
undo updates from different points

2024
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:06,450
that's like all the complexity like like

2025
01:36:03,870 --> 01:36:08,250
like probably like 85% the complexity in

2026
01:36:06,450 --> 01:36:09,450
Firefox things there it's not in on the

2027
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:12,780
crypto although crypto is I'm a

2028
01:36:09,450 --> 01:36:18,540
complicated so um I guess so to go back

2029
01:36:12,780 --> 01:36:20,250
to the the the the basic point um let's

2030
01:36:18,540 --> 01:36:22,380
find a customer for this that excited

2031
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:23,700
about it and then charter of the work on

2032
01:36:22,380 --> 01:36:29,370
that but for to solve the problem of

2033
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:30,840
that customer Michael Richards tonight I

2034
01:36:29,370 --> 01:36:32,849
echo ecords

2035
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:34,500
thoughts and some of the complexity I

2036
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:37,740
think that you were referring to may

2037
01:36:34,500 --> 01:36:40,980
actually live in that contact box rather

2038
01:36:37,740 --> 01:36:43,679
than in the password box and so that may

2039
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:46,769
be just something to think about one of

2040
01:36:43,680 --> 01:36:49,080
the other things that that browsers have

2041
01:36:46,770 --> 01:36:50,670
a bunch of and that locks me to the

2042
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:52,500
specific browser and sometimes the

2043
01:36:50,670 --> 01:36:55,080
specific browser in the specific machine

2044
01:36:52,500 --> 01:36:57,030
when I would like to do have it NW get

2045
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:58,320
is a whole bunch of ooofff tokens and

2046
01:36:57,030 --> 01:37:01,590
other things like this that are supposed

2047
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:03,000
to be replacing passwords so I don't

2048
01:37:01,590 --> 01:37:05,520
have a good container to put them in

2049
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:08,070
that isn't a browser I have a mail

2050
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,540
system mhm that now has a mechanism it's

2051
01:37:08,070 --> 01:37:11,820
very cool and I know Thunderbird does

2052
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:14,010
the same thing where you wind up with an

2053
01:37:11,820 --> 01:37:15,660
OAuth token and you somehow store it

2054
01:37:14,010 --> 01:37:17,190
somewhere and I'm not actually sure it

2055
01:37:15,660 --> 01:37:18,660
gets encrypted intelligently and I

2056
01:37:17,190 --> 01:37:19,950
certainly have no idea how to move it

2057
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:23,160
from one place to another

2058
01:37:19,950 --> 01:37:25,710
okay so those are not passwords exactly

2059
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:27,630
but they are often bearer tokens and I

2060
01:37:25,710 --> 01:37:28,920
probably need to keep them secret but I

2061
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:30,180
don't always know when I need to keep

2062
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:30,480
them secret because some of them are not

2063
01:37:30,180 --> 01:37:32,400
there

2064
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,679
kokin sometimes there are other things

2065
01:37:32,400 --> 01:37:37,589
attached other things um so that may

2066
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:41,160
represent some box that is is outside of

2067
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:44,910
this and as we move to a an API

2068
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:48,690
you know based web with back ends there

2069
01:37:44,910 --> 01:37:51,780
may be a space of non user facing things

2070
01:37:48,690 --> 01:37:55,769
that would like a way to do that kind of

2071
01:37:51,780 --> 01:38:00,450
stuff I just want to be able to share

2072
01:37:55,770 --> 01:38:04,680
you know my logins with my scripts that

2073
01:38:00,450 --> 01:38:06,360
I do and not have passwords embedded in

2074
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:09,300
things I'm sure there are operational

2075
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:10,980
people that have as I think Phil said

2076
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:14,670
that have passwords embedded in shell

2077
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:19,769
scripts and it just disastrous right for

2078
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:24,090
that yeah - I think add another point

2079
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:26,400
Michael the the discussion so far has

2080
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:27,780
focused I think way too much on web

2081
01:38:26,400 --> 01:38:29,160
browsers and I think it's been made

2082
01:38:27,780 --> 01:38:30,960
clear that web browsers aren't

2083
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:33,900
interested in an interoperable protocol

2084
01:38:30,960 --> 01:38:35,520
today to do synchronization of their

2085
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:37,290
particular pieces but that doesn't

2086
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:39,000
invalidate it sounds like there's other

2087
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:40,769
people that are interested in is there a

2088
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:43,530
better problem space to do

2089
01:38:40,770 --> 01:38:46,770
synchronization of cryptographic

2090
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:49,739
material of some kind somebody mentioned

2091
01:38:46,770 --> 01:38:52,320
PGP I would love to hear other ideas of

2092
01:38:49,739 --> 01:38:56,009
is there a better space because I think

2093
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:57,809
Phil's original idea may have some

2094
01:38:56,010 --> 01:38:59,880
issues unless we find other users

2095
01:38:57,810 --> 01:39:03,320
willing to you know I actually do an

2096
01:38:59,880 --> 01:39:06,060
interoperable protocol around that area

2097
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:07,290
Chris would Apple speaking as an

2098
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:09,270
operating system we would not be

2099
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:14,180
interested in interrupt imitations of

2100
01:39:09,270 --> 01:39:16,530
this sort of thing would not would not

2101
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:19,560
of which sort of thing of passwords you

2102
01:39:16,530 --> 01:39:21,179
mean of anything we have iCloud keychain

2103
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:24,560
which does this sort of stuff like

2104
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:24,560
hacker was referring to earlier so

2105
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:38,770
and a Roman so I guess the the next

2106
01:39:36,190 --> 01:39:40,120
steps would be where do we want to go

2107
01:39:38,770 --> 01:39:43,510
from here and what would the conclusions

2108
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:45,309
be I think a safe conclusion is there's

2109
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:48,430
a fair amount of resistance from the

2110
01:39:45,310 --> 01:39:50,620
password point of view I did hear

2111
01:39:48,430 --> 01:39:53,650
people's interest in some of the other

2112
01:39:50,620 --> 01:39:55,330
technologies especially dare as well as

2113
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:57,790
some issues some interest at

2114
01:39:55,330 --> 01:40:00,960
synchronization although the problem

2115
01:39:57,790 --> 01:40:04,060
space isn't well explored at the moment

2116
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:04,060
[Music]

2117
01:40:07,200 --> 01:40:11,620
also there was some couple people

2118
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,020
expressed interest in strengthening keys

2119
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:17,410
that are in TPMS and so on IOT or not

2120
01:40:14,020 --> 01:40:19,120
trusting device embedded keys right you

2121
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:20,650
know check out a pile on that the other

2122
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:23,559
thing I heard is we didn't dive into

2123
01:40:20,650 --> 01:40:26,080
very specifically any of the blue boxes

2124
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:27,340
individually as well I mean we started

2125
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:28,840
very much kind of from the orange which

2126
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:30,700
is how I opened the conversation which

2127
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:32,800
way are we driving it top up or top down

2128
01:40:30,700 --> 01:40:38,290
we heard feedback on one of the orange

2129
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:41,440
boxes michael riches and UDF provided a

2130
01:40:38,290 --> 01:40:43,720
way to pass certificates by reference

2131
01:40:41,440 --> 01:40:46,570
rather than value in constrained

2132
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:50,560
protocols that was a requirement that I

2133
01:40:46,570 --> 01:40:54,549
had it doesn't it fits upwards into the

2134
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:57,490
IOT box but not so obviously and I want

2135
01:40:54,550 --> 01:41:01,660
to reiterate the IOT configuration

2136
01:40:57,490 --> 01:41:03,849
backup and restore is I think a real

2137
01:41:01,660 --> 01:41:07,180
problem out there and I don't think that

2138
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:08,980
the other quote sdo market verticals I

2139
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:11,920
don't think they're well positioned to

2140
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:15,700
come up with a with a solution that

2141
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:17,980
isn't going to suck ok suck in a

2142
01:41:15,700 --> 01:41:20,050
cryptographic way and probably in a

2143
01:41:17,980 --> 01:41:25,570
product implementation way and this is a

2144
01:41:20,050 --> 01:41:28,120
place where the ITF you know could could

2145
01:41:25,570 --> 01:41:33,429
be providing technologies rather than

2146
01:41:28,120 --> 01:41:35,250
solutions this has been chaotic so

2147
01:41:33,430 --> 01:41:37,630
Michael you mentioned the sort of IOT

2148
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:40,060
configuration synchronization backup

2149
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:41,560
sort of stuff do you think we have

2150
01:41:40,060 --> 01:41:44,440
people in the room

2151
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:46,450
or at the ITF who would be wanting to

2152
01:41:44,440 --> 01:41:48,870
implement or to sell or to deploy that

2153
01:41:46,450 --> 01:41:48,870
sort of thing

2154
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:57,700
the consortiums that I'm familiar with

2155
01:41:53,830 --> 01:42:00,820
all have members from companies who have

2156
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:05,200
people in this room but those people are

2157
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:09,759
not the same people always but the

2158
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:11,519
companies are common so does that that

2159
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:15,430
doesn't really answer your question

2160
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:18,280
except to say that I think that with a

2161
01:42:15,430 --> 01:42:20,920
little bit of I'm gonna say marketing

2162
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:22,030
that we may be able to pull those people

2163
01:42:20,920 --> 01:42:23,560
into the right place

2164
01:42:22,030 --> 01:42:38,410
or at least those companies into the

2165
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:39,670
right places all right so it's

2166
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:41,530
interesting where we're like right at

2167
01:42:39,670 --> 01:42:43,060
the floating level of almost finding you

2168
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:45,040
know a tractable problem and definitely

2169
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:46,600
some that people aren't just interested

2170
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:49,960
in but people are interested in some of

2171
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:53,310
the blue and not entirely the red and so

2172
01:42:49,960 --> 01:42:55,930
it's a it's challenging and as I guess

2173
01:42:53,310 --> 01:42:59,640
last comment and then Roman a few

2174
01:42:55,930 --> 01:43:01,930
company so yeah Jonathan Hamel so

2175
01:42:59,640 --> 01:43:07,270
there's been discussion about the blue

2176
01:43:01,930 --> 01:43:09,280
boxes and my question on technology this

2177
01:43:07,270 --> 01:43:12,010
this meta cryptography the key splitting

2178
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:15,670
combination to me I don't see an upgrade

2179
01:43:12,010 --> 01:43:18,190
path to quantum resistant algorithms

2180
01:43:15,670 --> 01:43:23,410
because it's all based on diffie-hellman

2181
01:43:18,190 --> 01:43:26,799
properties which with current proposals

2182
01:43:23,410 --> 01:43:28,269
for a quantum system crypto that the air

2183
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:32,230
is going to explode and you have to

2184
01:43:28,270 --> 01:43:34,240
reframe tries and things like that so my

2185
01:43:32,230 --> 01:43:37,769
main concern is that by the time this is

2186
01:43:34,240 --> 01:43:40,389
deployed it's not couldn't be secure

2187
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:48,340
interesting euro follow-up on that too a

2188
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:52,540
little I've spent quite a bit of time

2189
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:56,650
looking at quantum cryptography it's

2190
01:43:52,540 --> 01:44:00,130
really difficult to know what the threat

2191
01:43:56,650 --> 01:44:02,889
level is or what we can do about it

2192
01:44:00,130 --> 01:44:06,280
because it is really you know trying to

2193
01:44:02,890 --> 01:44:09,390
govern the unknown what is clear to me

2194
01:44:06,280 --> 01:44:13,030
as somebody who did experimental physics

2195
01:44:09,390 --> 01:44:16,420
you don't have computers today you have

2196
01:44:13,030 --> 01:44:18,880
physics experiments they're not doing

2197
01:44:16,420 --> 01:44:24,220
calculations they're doing experiments

2198
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:27,420
in fundamental physics the business

2199
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:30,520
about the number of qubits increasing I

2200
01:44:27,420 --> 01:44:32,020
don't think that the increase in the nut

2201
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:33,370
it's not going to be like Moore's Law

2202
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:38,320
you're not going to see the number of

2203
01:44:33,370 --> 01:44:40,809
qubits increasing incrementally I think

2204
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:43,150
that he's going to be one day somebody

2205
01:44:40,810 --> 01:44:45,430
will get the 50 qubit machine working

2206
01:44:43,150 --> 01:44:50,200
and the next they'll build the machine

2207
01:44:45,430 --> 01:44:53,230
with a million and so we're it I think

2208
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:55,870
there's a lot of thee so what I've

2209
01:44:53,230 --> 01:44:59,320
thought about about how to control that

2210
01:44:55,870 --> 01:45:02,410
is if I have connected together all of

2211
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:06,160
Alice's machines while we still have

2212
01:45:02,410 --> 01:45:09,490
public key cryptography and I can use

2213
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:13,540
that to authenticate I can then use that

2214
01:45:09,490 --> 01:45:18,460
to build in quantum resistant algorithms

2215
01:45:13,540 --> 01:45:21,940
based on Kerberos and based on Lamport

2216
01:45:18,460 --> 01:45:24,310
hash signatures and right now those are

2217
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:28,120
the only two things that I really feel

2218
01:45:24,310 --> 01:45:31,420
comfortable with so I do have a escape

2219
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:32,610
hole from all this but it isn't based in

2220
01:45:31,420 --> 01:45:35,320
yeah

2221
01:45:32,610 --> 01:45:38,730
all right thanks let's yeah we won't go

2222
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:41,110
down that that or up that rat hole so

2223
01:45:38,730 --> 01:45:44,169
Richard burns Francisco

2224
01:45:41,110 --> 01:45:47,920
so there's a question raised about IOT

2225
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:50,320
vendors one of my roles at Cisco is to

2226
01:45:47,920 --> 01:45:52,180
work on a few things that look like IOT

2227
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:55,780
of recognizing there's a spectrum of

2228
01:45:52,180 --> 01:45:57,730
things in classes of things but the

2229
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:59,920
things might the problems my things have

2230
01:45:57,730 --> 01:46:00,469
don't really map that well so it's of

2231
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:03,200
this techno

2232
01:46:00,470 --> 01:46:05,150
she sets so I don't think this is the

2233
01:46:03,200 --> 01:46:06,650
the the problems were solving here and

2234
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,700
then technology suite we're talking

2235
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:09,650
about in this meeting is something that

2236
01:46:07,700 --> 01:46:11,990
would really be useful to the stuff at

2237
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:14,030
least in in the space of IOT stuff I've

2238
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:15,410
been working on I also like to second

2239
01:46:14,030 --> 01:46:19,519
the concerns about post quantum

2240
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:22,580
cryptography I think we have I think my

2241
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:24,320
concern is I'm not quite as blase as

2242
01:46:22,580 --> 01:46:25,820
fell seems to me about the possibilities

2243
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:27,259
for upon computation I think it's it's

2244
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:28,670
worthwhile the effort the industry is

2245
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:34,790
investing in and being prepared for that

2246
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:37,130
technology all right I think with that I

2247
01:46:34,790 --> 01:46:39,080
don't know if the ADEs in the room want

2248
01:46:37,130 --> 01:46:42,050
to speak to anything or ask any more

2249
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:49,490
questions I think we're out of our set

2250
01:46:42,050 --> 01:46:53,390
of topics okay yeah so benkei talk here

2251
01:46:49,490 --> 01:46:57,139
I think users summarize what we've been

2252
01:46:53,390 --> 01:46:59,720
hearing correctly that looking at you at

2253
01:46:57,140 --> 01:47:02,180
the list of use cases orange boxes up

2254
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:05,030
there we're not getting anybody super

2255
01:47:02,180 --> 01:47:06,890
excited who's in the room but it sounds

2256
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:09,559
like we've got several people that are

2257
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:12,050
saying there's still potential to find

2258
01:47:09,560 --> 01:47:16,340
somebody and so we should be trying to

2259
01:47:12,050 --> 01:47:17,930
find people who would have a use case

2260
01:47:16,340 --> 01:47:21,500
and they'd be willing to adopt deploy

2261
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:23,180
implement this suite of Technology for

2262
01:47:21,500 --> 01:47:26,420
their purpose to solve a specific

2263
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:29,300
problem but I think at the same time or

2264
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:31,580
even before that we can also revisit

2265
01:47:29,300 --> 01:47:33,470
these sort of blue boxes at the bottom

2266
01:47:31,580 --> 01:47:35,450
those sort of foundational technologies

2267
01:47:33,470 --> 01:47:38,510
and so I would like to suggest that

2268
01:47:35,450 --> 01:47:42,349
maybe we could do some of the standard

2269
01:47:38,510 --> 01:47:44,570
buff questions as hums for each of the

2270
01:47:42,350 --> 01:47:45,800
three blue boxes so like in particular

2271
01:47:44,570 --> 01:47:48,620
we could say you know do people think

2272
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:52,250
they understand what UDF is trying to do

2273
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:54,260
and then if people do then we could ask

2274
01:47:52,250 --> 01:47:57,800
if people are interested in working on

2275
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:59,270
that and doing at night EF all right

2276
01:47:57,800 --> 01:48:01,480
would you like us to do that or did you

2277
01:47:59,270 --> 01:48:01,480
want

2278
01:48:11,460 --> 01:48:18,280
okay so Hagen Oh different different

2279
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:21,430
spectrum on the mothers up here anyway

2280
01:48:18,280 --> 01:48:25,389
so I going to ask a bunch of questions

2281
01:48:21,430 --> 01:48:28,450
hums and hopefully they will be in a

2282
01:48:25,390 --> 01:48:30,850
pattern that won't be similar but that

2283
01:48:28,450 --> 01:48:33,160
girl wants to say something first yeah I

2284
01:48:30,850 --> 01:48:35,080
mean we really didn't have much

2285
01:48:33,160 --> 01:48:37,180
discussion unless I missed it of the

2286
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:40,120
merits of these pieces of work right

2287
01:48:37,180 --> 01:48:41,890
right um so I think I'm I'm like kind of

2288
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:43,150
like sad about having hums and we

2289
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:45,100
haven't really a discussion about like

2290
01:48:43,150 --> 01:48:47,980
the narrative the pieces of work as

2291
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:49,510
standalone work items I mean if if the

2292
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,160
answer to the hum is people don't think

2293
01:48:49,510 --> 01:48:55,770
they understand what it's supposed to do

2294
01:48:51,160 --> 01:48:59,349
then like your shirt sales yeah okay

2295
01:48:55,770 --> 01:49:01,660
actually before I do any hems I asked

2296
01:48:59,350 --> 01:49:06,550
her show hands has anybody who's read

2297
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:10,380
the UDF document the separate draft it's

2298
01:49:06,550 --> 01:49:13,330
like 10 ish 15 maybe

2299
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:18,700
and so for the the Dare document who is

2300
01:49:13,330 --> 01:49:21,540
read the Dare document similar slightly

2301
01:49:18,700 --> 01:49:24,340
smaller set of hands maybe five to ten

2302
01:49:21,540 --> 01:49:26,260
same question for the the key splitting

2303
01:49:24,340 --> 01:49:31,030
combination stuff who's read the

2304
01:49:26,260 --> 01:49:36,430
document for that about the same five to

2305
01:49:31,030 --> 01:49:41,170
ten Ben may I ask a process question

2306
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:42,580
before we um yes so and please correct

2307
01:49:41,170 --> 01:49:45,580
me david's canaussie google chrome

2308
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:48,670
please correct me if i'm wrong but in

2309
01:49:45,580 --> 01:49:53,230
general the both questions come like for

2310
01:49:48,670 --> 01:49:55,690
a problem statement as a whole and i I'm

2311
01:49:53,230 --> 01:49:58,150
very confused by the idea of splitting

2312
01:49:55,690 --> 01:50:00,190
the blue boxes out into individual

2313
01:49:58,150 --> 01:50:03,099
components because I've heard a problem

2314
01:50:00,190 --> 01:50:04,929
statement for the entire proposal of the

2315
01:50:03,100 --> 01:50:08,440
mathematical mesh I have not heard a

2316
01:50:04,930 --> 01:50:12,700
problem statement for the blue box so I

2317
01:50:08,440 --> 01:50:14,049
would be very calm but they understand

2318
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:15,370
the policy and for one of the blue boxes

2319
01:50:14,050 --> 01:50:16,600
because they please explain it to me

2320
01:50:15,370 --> 01:50:20,200
because I didn't see that in any other

2321
01:50:16,600 --> 01:50:21,190
presentation today that's that's

2322
01:50:20,200 --> 01:50:22,460
probably a fair point

2323
01:50:21,190 --> 01:50:27,860
so like

2324
01:50:22,460 --> 01:50:29,900
I I will still ask the question but you

2325
01:50:27,860 --> 01:50:31,969
know your point stands that we didn't

2326
01:50:29,900 --> 01:50:34,070
really get a huge amount of presentation

2327
01:50:31,969 --> 01:50:38,330
about the the specific problems for the

2328
01:50:34,070 --> 01:50:41,389
blue boxes Michael we're allowed to have

2329
01:50:38,330 --> 01:50:44,300
a second ball in our normal process and

2330
01:50:41,390 --> 01:50:48,440
I suggest that maybe you're asking your

2331
01:50:44,300 --> 01:50:50,420
questions prematurely then maybe you

2332
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:52,820
should ask should we have another ball

2333
01:50:50,420 --> 01:50:53,989
should we proceed further with this

2334
01:50:52,820 --> 01:50:56,780
rather than worrying about the

2335
01:50:53,989 --> 01:50:59,750
technology I mean I think that that's a

2336
01:50:56,780 --> 01:51:01,190
very valid thing to do if people feel

2337
01:50:59,750 --> 01:51:03,500
like they need more time more

2338
01:51:01,190 --> 01:51:06,710
information or discussion or maybe what

2339
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:09,980
you should ask is um do you think we're

2340
01:51:06,710 --> 01:51:15,860
done with this now and if the answer is

2341
01:51:09,980 --> 01:51:20,509
not you ubiquitous yes then we should

2342
01:51:15,860 --> 01:51:22,370
continue if if if the group is hostile

2343
01:51:20,510 --> 01:51:25,730
and opposed to all of this at this point

2344
01:51:22,370 --> 01:51:26,719
then that's enough information to stop

2345
01:51:25,730 --> 01:51:29,389
at this point

2346
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:31,850
so can I reframe that as a more positive

2347
01:51:29,390 --> 01:51:35,330
question right if you like yeah

2348
01:51:31,850 --> 01:51:37,550
so so let me rephrase it that that Phil

2349
01:51:35,330 --> 01:51:40,190
presented a number of technologies that

2350
01:51:37,550 --> 01:51:43,460
might be useful in different areas to me

2351
01:51:40,190 --> 01:51:45,889
what I would like to know is do people

2352
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:48,110
believe that there are problem spaces

2353
01:51:45,890 --> 01:51:50,630
that these technologies might be of

2354
01:51:48,110 --> 01:51:52,280
interest to and then so you can say no

2355
01:51:50,630 --> 01:51:54,260
to that and so on that becoming negative

2356
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:57,170
right but but the initial question is is

2357
01:51:54,260 --> 01:51:59,409
there did people can't see something in

2358
01:51:57,170 --> 01:52:02,150
these presentations that made me want to

2359
01:51:59,409 --> 01:52:03,440
work on it further explore it further

2360
01:52:02,150 --> 01:52:05,320
even if we don't have all the

2361
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:08,000
information you know to date because

2362
01:52:05,320 --> 01:52:11,090
there's a lot of Technology in that and

2363
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:13,550
it's hard to do in a two-hour buff so so

2364
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:15,170
so where's Martin Thompson here um one

2365
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:16,370
of the things that we do these boss for

2366
01:52:15,170 --> 01:52:18,620
is to work out whether there's a

2367
01:52:16,370 --> 01:52:20,210
constituency of people that are

2368
01:52:18,620 --> 01:52:21,679
interested in working in the ITF on

2369
01:52:20,210 --> 01:52:23,420
something concrete they're going to

2370
01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:28,790
build something that depends on having

2371
01:52:23,420 --> 01:52:30,620
interoperability and so that sounds very

2372
01:52:28,790 --> 01:52:31,969
nice and I'm sure that Phil would like

2373
01:52:30,620 --> 01:52:33,889
to hear that but I don't think that that

2374
01:52:31,969 --> 01:52:36,550
has any bearing on a decision process

2375
01:52:33,889 --> 01:52:38,780
for whether we have above

2376
01:52:36,550 --> 01:52:41,330
again or whether we drop this or

2377
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:43,550
anything like that I think the questions

2378
01:52:41,330 --> 01:52:45,050
that we need to be looking at here is is

2379
01:52:43,550 --> 01:52:47,870
there something that we can do

2380
01:52:45,050 --> 01:52:50,530
concretely in the ITF is there a problem

2381
01:52:47,870 --> 01:52:52,730
statement we can work on that requires

2382
01:52:50,530 --> 01:52:54,980
interoperability between people who

2383
01:52:52,730 --> 01:52:58,219
intend even who need that

2384
01:52:54,980 --> 01:53:00,110
interoperability and I'm phrasing the

2385
01:52:58,220 --> 01:53:02,960
question that way maybe information for

2386
01:53:00,110 --> 01:53:04,549
for folks who would be interesting in

2387
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:06,830
pursuing this but I don't think it has

2388
01:53:04,550 --> 01:53:13,610
any direct bearing on the outcome of a

2389
01:53:06,830 --> 01:53:15,739
session like this right and so the line

2390
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:18,230
of questioning that the been is kind of

2391
01:53:15,739 --> 01:53:21,230
started is we heard in terms of how

2392
01:53:18,230 --> 01:53:23,780
things were framed in orange we didn't

2393
01:53:21,230 --> 01:53:25,549
find we didn't find a hit what we're

2394
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:26,840
trying to ask now if that's the top of

2395
01:53:25,550 --> 01:53:29,210
the diagram we're now trying to fit

2396
01:53:26,840 --> 01:53:32,660
asking kind of bottom-up so given what

2397
01:53:29,210 --> 01:53:34,280
you've heard about the blue again how

2398
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:36,500
much do you feel like you understanding

2399
01:53:34,280 --> 01:53:38,239
should we talk more about blue because

2400
01:53:36,500 --> 01:53:40,100
we still haven't hit the right thing

2401
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:43,040
with the orange is the correct use kiss

2402
01:53:40,100 --> 01:53:46,790
that's what we were certain right so I

2403
01:53:43,040 --> 01:53:48,470
think if I could try to synthesize most

2404
01:53:46,790 --> 01:53:52,550
of what I've heard

2405
01:53:48,470 --> 01:53:55,040
I wouldn't propose to ask is there any

2406
01:53:52,550 --> 01:53:58,780
technology described in any of the boxes

2407
01:53:55,040 --> 01:54:02,060
on the screen that you would like to

2408
01:53:58,780 --> 01:54:04,730
learn more about or think harder about

2409
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:08,870
or think that the ITF should should do

2410
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:10,700
work in potentially yeah Rick's all snow

2411
01:54:08,870 --> 01:54:13,250
hats just save time not going to the mic

2412
01:54:10,700 --> 01:54:15,650
I think the idea of home networking

2413
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:18,770
password management is something that we

2414
01:54:15,650 --> 01:54:20,950
could really address we've done a lot of

2415
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:23,720
other HomeNet kinds of working groups

2416
01:54:20,950 --> 01:54:26,300
and that does not overlap or get into

2417
01:54:23,720 --> 01:54:27,380
conflict well maybe Apple OS but it

2418
01:54:26,300 --> 01:54:29,180
doesn't get into conflict with the

2419
01:54:27,380 --> 01:54:30,170
chrome and the Firefox password

2420
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:33,739
management systems

2421
01:54:30,170 --> 01:54:36,080
but certainly IOT is coming and being

2422
01:54:33,739 --> 01:54:37,910
able to manage passwords in the home and

2423
01:54:36,080 --> 01:54:40,880
maybe it ends up being something you get

2424
01:54:37,910 --> 01:54:42,260
in your ISP router who knows but that is

2425
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:46,890
something that I would like to see move

2426
01:54:42,260 --> 01:54:49,950
forward okay

2427
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:55,530
so let me try wording a question for hum

2428
01:54:49,950 --> 01:54:58,730
so is there any technology listed on the

2429
01:54:55,530 --> 01:55:02,700
screen or that was mentioned in person

2430
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:08,190
that you think the ITR should continue

2431
01:55:02,700 --> 01:55:09,809
to discuss and potentially pursue can I

2432
01:55:08,190 --> 01:55:14,849
get a hum if people think that they

2433
01:55:09,810 --> 01:55:16,260
understand what that question means and

2434
01:55:14,850 --> 01:55:19,050
if you're confused by that question

2435
01:55:16,260 --> 01:55:37,890
please have now okay so that was not

2436
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:39,800
very good question so trying to kind of

2437
01:55:37,890 --> 01:55:43,860
restate it given what you heard about

2438
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:45,600
the blue boxes do you have something

2439
01:55:43,860 --> 01:55:47,790
that would be equivalent to what you see

2440
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:52,860
in orange that could have bla apply that

2441
01:55:47,790 --> 01:55:57,600
blue technology hum yes if you think you

2442
01:55:52,860 --> 01:56:07,019
understand that as a question um no if

2443
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:10,140
you do not understand that Malinda you

2444
01:56:07,020 --> 01:56:12,480
want to help us I don't know if this

2445
01:56:10,140 --> 01:56:15,060
isn't gonna help but ten people in the

2446
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:17,580
room give you know give or take I have

2447
01:56:15,060 --> 01:56:19,770
read each of the documents and we're

2448
01:56:17,580 --> 01:56:22,440
being asked to evaluate whether or not

2449
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:29,610
the IETF should take on a substantial

2450
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:33,089
effort based on yep yeah but we it's

2451
01:56:29,610 --> 01:56:35,790
still the case you know ten people have

2452
01:56:33,090 --> 01:56:38,550
read it I you know I I can see the value

2453
01:56:35,790 --> 01:56:43,200
perhaps in another bob depending on what

2454
01:56:38,550 --> 01:56:46,170
happens between now and March but it

2455
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:48,240
does concern me that you know we're

2456
01:56:46,170 --> 01:56:50,340
talking about progressing stuff with

2457
01:56:48,240 --> 01:56:52,769
people and interested enough to read the

2458
01:56:50,340 --> 01:56:53,850
documents or or don't have the time to

2459
01:56:52,770 --> 01:56:56,010
you know what I mean

2460
01:56:53,850 --> 01:56:58,980
there doesn't seem to be have been so

2461
01:56:56,010 --> 01:56:59,730
far much commitment from the folks in

2462
01:56:58,980 --> 01:57:01,379
the room

2463
01:56:59,730 --> 01:57:03,240
and that's a concern you know we don't

2464
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:05,070
work on stuff as I said earlier because

2465
01:57:03,240 --> 01:57:06,990
it's interesting we work on it because

2466
01:57:05,070 --> 01:57:13,440
there's a constituency for somebody

2467
01:57:06,990 --> 01:57:15,540
plans to implement it etc some yeah yeah

2468
01:57:13,440 --> 01:57:17,389
so I I think basically you were you're

2469
01:57:15,540 --> 01:57:20,580
trying to ask these questions too early

2470
01:57:17,390 --> 01:57:22,320
to a little small number of people read

2471
01:57:20,580 --> 01:57:25,920
documents and we understand too little

2472
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:28,380
of this and then it's too broad area for

2473
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:30,150
us to like fully grasp exactly what what

2474
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:34,290
things are interesting and what I what

2475
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:35,730
are not I think this overall space is or

2476
01:57:34,290 --> 01:57:38,130
continues to be very interesting

2477
01:57:35,730 --> 01:57:40,679
obviously there's gonna be specific

2478
01:57:38,130 --> 01:57:42,300
areas where there's existing solutions

2479
01:57:40,680 --> 01:57:43,890
for instance or different trade-offs and

2480
01:57:42,300 --> 01:57:46,560
those guys are not gonna be interested

2481
01:57:43,890 --> 01:57:47,730
in applying anything new but there's

2482
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:50,730
also many new things

2483
01:57:47,730 --> 01:57:52,080
IOT was mentioned here and other other

2484
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:54,240
things coming up in the future that

2485
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,740
might actually benefit from something

2486
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:57,900
like this and I think the next step is

2487
01:57:55,740 --> 01:58:01,500
not for us to ask too many questions but

2488
01:57:57,900 --> 01:58:04,110
for Phil and others to work on more

2489
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:05,430
specific applications of this and you

2490
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:07,980
know figure out if there's interest in

2491
01:58:05,430 --> 01:58:09,390
you know in the IOT community for

2492
01:58:07,980 --> 01:58:12,030
instance or some of the other other

2493
01:58:09,390 --> 01:58:13,680
items here and so that's you know I

2494
01:58:12,030 --> 01:58:16,139
think it's more of a you know offline

2495
01:58:13,680 --> 01:58:17,730
work than an ITF meeting thing and then

2496
01:58:16,140 --> 01:58:19,980
you know maybe they'll find something

2497
01:58:17,730 --> 01:58:21,629
and come back next time and propose

2498
01:58:19,980 --> 01:58:24,030
something more specific I think that

2499
01:58:21,630 --> 01:58:25,500
would be the way you had okay we're out

2500
01:58:24,030 --> 01:58:27,570
of time so no more people at the mic and

2501
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:29,400
please make it brief

2502
01:58:27,570 --> 01:58:31,980
so actually I'm sorry Gregor I mean we

2503
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:34,410
have got a two minutes so we want to

2504
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:36,959
pose a new question that was kind of

2505
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:38,280
suggested which is given the small

2506
01:58:36,960 --> 01:58:40,560
number of folks that have read the

2507
01:58:38,280 --> 01:58:42,870
document let's deal based on what you

2508
01:58:40,560 --> 01:58:44,910
have heard would you be interested in

2509
01:58:42,870 --> 01:58:48,090
finding out more and reading the

2510
01:58:44,910 --> 01:58:52,590
documents do okay could we get a hum one

2511
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:54,210
do folks understand that question does

2512
01:58:52,590 --> 01:58:56,070
anyone does anyone feel like that's a

2513
01:58:54,210 --> 01:58:59,160
bad question does not understand that

2514
01:58:56,070 --> 01:59:03,179
question okay so let's try that

2515
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:04,860
okay so hum now if based on what you

2516
01:59:03,180 --> 01:59:07,350
have heard here today you are motivated

2517
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:09,679
to read those documents and find out

2518
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:09,680
more

2519
01:59:12,510 --> 01:59:16,610
and if you are not motivated to time now

2520
01:59:22,369 --> 01:59:26,549
so I kind of based on that result we

2521
01:59:25,199 --> 01:59:27,900
heard humming in the order they want if

2522
01:59:26,550 --> 01:59:31,079
that folks want to find out more and

2523
01:59:27,900 --> 01:59:32,280
read more we heard very little on the

2524
01:59:31,079 --> 01:59:33,599
order of that they're not interested in

2525
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:36,780
finding out more and I think we're gonna

2526
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:40,159
have to end it on that so thanks so much

2527
01:59:36,780 --> 01:59:40,159
all right thank you everybody

2528
02:00:09,179 --> 02:00:13,409

2529
02:00:11,489 --> 02:00:16,610
