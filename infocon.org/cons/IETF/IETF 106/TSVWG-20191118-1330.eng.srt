time for comes with the status I'm

84
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,349
afraid TC WG like a number of who know

85
00:06:29,229 --> 00:06:34,360
transports his bursty this is not one of

86
00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:37,509
those bursty times the preneur she's

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,610
published since Montreal oops it should

88
00:06:37,509 --> 00:06:41,919
be three internet drafts in a uth

89
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:44,340
forty-eight will fix that and and we and

90
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,830
repost these slides

91
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:49,020
this is what happens when you prepared

92
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,640
shares slides based on combination

93
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:57,150
jetlag and caffeine any case the FEC for

94
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,479
the FEC framework drafts are in all 48

95
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:03,570
they're actively being discussed I we've

96
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:05,300
seen email and within the past day or so

97
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:07,140
on these so those those are the three

98
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,170
drafts they go together

99
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:11,240
they'll be RFC's some time real very

100
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:15,060
soon

101
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:16,860
there's Vincent believes that's done so

102
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,380
I I think we'll just see them very soon

103
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,180
yeah I mean I think I yeah I think all

104
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,620
the viewers are done the changes are

105
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,510
done it's just a matter of RepRap route

106
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,370
double-checking them and rounding up all

107
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,800
the sign offs from all the authors we

108
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,270
have one draft in the RFC

109
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,860
editor queue that has been there for a

110
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:34,590
long time but there's been development

111
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:37,350
this is the diffserv and WebRTC QoS

112
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,690
draft which for many many IETF was in

113
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,950
this ref state it is now only in ref

114
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,950
state because the missing reference

115
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:47,370
apparently has shown up and the infamous

116
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,630
web RTC cluster 238 is likely to get

117
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,450
published sometime in the near future

118
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:54,650
including this draft

119
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:57,750
we have no IDs at iesg

120
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,909
there are three IDs written group chairs

121
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:01,470
and authors after working group by last

122
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:03,750
call and just to prove that the world's

123
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,960
not fair all three of them are mine as

124
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:09,150
the responsible working group chair I've

125
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:12,960
talked to Bob Brisco who's the author

126
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:15,450
the first two drafts on ecn and cap we

127
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,099
know at a minimum what the text is

128
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:22,500
that's needed in these drafts on

129
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:23,970
fragmentation interaction we know how to

130
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,310
write the text we minerally compatible

131
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,640
with 3168 Bob thinks he'd like to do

132
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,770
better expect to see but before the next

133
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,480
I II TF some better text and we will

134
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,860
review the text on the mailing list

135
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,159
before when we move these drafts for

136
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:41,490
publication the other one is a transport

137
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,219
header confidentiality impacts this

138
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,110
draft was written glass called was

139
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:47,940
actually called across three arrows R

140
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:50,280
across posted to both into area and

141
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:53,720
security folks and let's just simply say

142
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:58,170
an interesting time was had by all

143
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,120
draft is being revised the major goal of

144
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:05,209
the vision is for the draft to take a

145
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:08,820
more or less neutral stance on on

146
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:11,969
transport protocol header encryption the

147
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,860
post - o9 version is already head in

148
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:16,170
that direction more to come stay tuned

149
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,209
it will probably be a second working

150
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:30,990
last call on this draft before the next

151
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:34,500
ITF hi gory face just as a document

152
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,420
editor for that draft we believe that we

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,589
have material know that who can use to

154
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,410
make a new revision

155
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,060
shortly after this ITF are we spoken to

156
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:44,250
several of people who contributed

157
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,739
comments to get new text so I think this

158
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:50,389
will go ahead yeah and I'm cautiously

159
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,389
out here here comes the other co-author

160
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:56,670
hi common Perkins I'm the other author

161
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,310
of that draft yeah just to be clear I

162
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:01,740
mean you say to be revised to have a

163
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,959
neutral point of view that was always

164
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:06,149
the intent and we clearly missed but

165
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,599
that's what we were aiming for yeah and

166
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:11,070
I'm speaking for myself as that sure yes

167
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,829
I've understood that's always been the

168
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:16,980
intent not quite realize the first time

169
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:20,729
around the next the the next version to

170
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,399
be posted will be considered will will

171
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,470
be considerably better in that regard

172
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,370
and we'll run a second last a second

173
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:33,420
last call on it hi Tommy Polly Apple um

174
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:35,190
so just to the point of this I spoke a

175
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:38,490
bit to the authors but also I had noted

176
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,079
in your email about him wanting to be

177
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:44,069
neutral just want to kind of clarify

178
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:46,439
what we mean by neutral here because I

179
00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:49,189
think we we don't want to necessarily

180
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:52,380
set it up as an opposition between

181
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:53,490
should we encrypt headers or not but

182
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,199
it's really where do we draw the

183
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:57,510
boundaries and what are the consequences

184
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:59,969
of it so maybe even just phrasing is

185
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,949
let's be objective about when you make

186
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,269
this choice this is the effect and it's

187
00:11:01,949 --> 00:11:04,949
not saying we are necessarily being

188
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:07,589
neutral between being Pro and anti

189
00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:08,939
because I think for a lot of community

190
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:12,060
as we are looking into quick there is

191
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,020
definitely a pro to do

192
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:15,030
this encryption we just need to

193
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,160
understand the consequences of it right

194
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:21,540
and this this draft is primarily aimed

195
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,600
at describing the design consequences of

196
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:28,260
transport headers mostly from a within

197
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,450
the net Network point of view so that

198
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,030
it's somebody considered in doing the

199
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:35,130
design it's it was it's not supposed to

200
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,390
be advocating in one direction or the

201
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,310
other but rather providing design

202
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,319
considerations so that an intelligent

203
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,089
considered choice can be made yeah I

204
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,420
guess I would just encourage that as we

205
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:46,950
are rewriting the reworking at the tone

206
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,199
of the text that we shouldn't

207
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:51,120
necessarily shy away from saying there

208
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,890
are positive reasons and good things

209
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,420
that we get from this encryption that

210
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:56,400
benefit the development of transfer

211
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,990
protocols and being honestly

212
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:03,350
enthusiastic about that as we are also

213
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:07,950
pointing out the qualifications Tommy

214
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:10,200
what's that oh what's that a offer to

215
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,230
have a quick look at the test we believe

216
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,460
will do that yes so if we have early

217
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:19,080
versions I would be happy to review

218
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:21,510
anything yes and because I mean to be

219
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:23,310
clear I think we we are not we're

220
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:27,180
certainly not saying don't do encryption

221
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:29,810
we're big fans of encryption we just

222
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:32,250
realized that there are other thing you

223
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:33,619
that there are sometimes reasons to

224
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:37,530
consider doing other things

225
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:38,970
absolutely I think we all agree on it's

226
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,400
just like how do we communicate outside

227
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,440
of this community where we do understand

228
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,959
what we're saying the right tones such

229
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,960
that they don't misunderstand us sure I

230
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:56,339
Brian Graham was sort of the same same

231
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,240
comment slightly different angle of it

232
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,760
uh I

233
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,370
somebody's been you know involved in

234
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,439
this discussion in this forum for a

235
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:08,660
little while

236
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:12,420
spend some time on it I think that that

237
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,319
this document is going to need much more

238
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:16,469
wordsmithing

239
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,490
than maybe other documents that come out

240
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:22,680
of TS BWT in the past simply because a

241
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:24,420
lot of people are being kind of I don't

242
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,160
want to I want to say emotional about it

243
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,510
but

244
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:31,430
there is a lot of people who are picking

245
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:36,110
things apart maybe not assuming best

246
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,430
intentions here so I will also offer to

247
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,010
you know go through the language of this

248
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:42,800
document with a fine-tooth comb and find

249
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:46,360
ways where you know maybe there are

250
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:50,270
opportunities for misinterpretation that

251
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:56,540
can be we can be available in the next

252
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:58,819
couple of weeks to do that yeah yeah

253
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:02,030
yeah let's talk offline but I can I can

254
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:07,070
make that happen next week yes okay good

255
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:11,959
all right so with luck that we're moving

256
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:15,530
forward okay we have no IDs in working

257
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:18,190
group last call no draft call we're

258
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:23,949
likely to start working group last call

259
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:27,650
on to draft soon sgtp net and Datagram

260
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:30,470
pl Datagram imp you discover E that's

261
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:33,110
Datagram PLP MTU D is the long acronym

262
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:34,700
we spell out a few pieces of it as for

263
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,230
the Alpha rest rest we will discuss the

264
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,330
next steps for the l4 s drafts on

265
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:41,150
Thursday not today we have enough fun

266
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:44,030
today thank you okay there are seven

267
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:46,670
additional working group drafts listed

268
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:48,560
here in various states are we listed the

269
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,120
L fresh drafts here just because I could

270
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:55,609
I'm not going to read off the whole list

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:15:01,790
bunch of related drafts over in six men

272
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:03,980
there is a PM tu d draft for v6 in int

273
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:08,510
area there is an individual draft right

274
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:12,350
now from Ron Bonica on lossless PMT UD

275
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:16,189
which in which also includes a a new I a

276
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:18,410
new ICMP message there is an l4 s and

277
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,860
diffserv draft that's been around for a

278
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:24,140
while not much happening lately loops

279
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,200
there will be a side meeting on loops

280
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:30,110
tomorrow morning 8:30 a.m. focused on

281
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,300
scope encapsulation details I've listed

282
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,300
the main loops draft if you put loops

283
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,740
into the data tracker and search for

284
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,780
drafts you'll find that there's there's

285
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,650
two more all three are

286
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:43,730
part of that means morrow morning

287
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:47,810
transfer early drafts whole bunch of

288
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:50,180
them SFC continues to work on ec n for n

289
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,859
sh the reason this one's interesting is

290
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,329
not so much for ECM which is stuff we

291
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,950
work on but because it relates the

292
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:57,290
tongue josh and feedback draft that is

293
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,150
working group draft there is the low

294
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:00,439
latency DOCSIS draft that's been

295
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:02,660
submitted the independent submission

296
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:06,440
editor and likely to be published via

297
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:09,500
that route to SCE really queueing drafts

298
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,910
that aren't directly on the agenda but I

299
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,550
related to stuff that we'll discuss on

300
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:17,360
Thursday there will be an exploratory

301
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:20,270
side meaning tomorrow morning again some

302
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,230
VIP a on our digestion control which

303
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:24,860
will include at least the following

304
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:27,590
three drafts a list of listed there

305
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:32,350
unfortunately I see crg ran out of time

306
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:36,640
so the third draft down there was not

307
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:40,130
talked about all in IC crg this morning

308
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:42,740
we have a draft later today on exposed

309
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:44,330
bits here's an appears expose lost bits

310
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:47,420
draft that was presented last time

311
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:50,960
around the interior tunnel staff

312
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:52,370
continues to move forward in the

313
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:54,740
interior working group along with the

314
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,930
fragmentation fragility draft and there

315
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,210
is a Sox protocol revision in progress

316
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:03,310
that draft may or may not be coming this

317
00:16:59,210 --> 00:17:06,140
working group I'm not sure a couple of

318
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:08,030
SCTP drafts in addition to what you'll

319
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:11,180
see here there's a multipath draft and

320
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:15,700
then there's a draft on retransmission

321
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:21,310
details there have been a couple of

322
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:23,990
contributions to 3gpp one on l4s and one

323
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:26,770
one that was more general those are from

324
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:29,480
the 3gpp have fun have fun with this

325
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:35,720
follow up okay

326
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:37,790
ts vwg agenda so you got to see this is

327
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,740
somebody the agenda we've done documents

328
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:41,120
called accomplishments and status about

329
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,980
you milestone review and there'll be a

330
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,169
bunch of drafts Friday a bunch more

331
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:50,990
drafts G wasn't interesting okay

332
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:52,520
milestone review 1st to February 2019

333
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:55,340
milestones are for the

334
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,960
encapsulation drafts those have been

335
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:58,760
delayed Bob do you think we can get

336
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,620
those done for January or is that you

337
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,800
out okay Bob thanks again dumb January I

338
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,379
made a good guess l4s drafts will pick

339
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:08,750
that back up again on Thursday I don't

340
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:10,010
care to try try to try it can't really

341
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,720
figure out when they're going to be

342
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:17,360
ready to be submitted until we have the

343
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,760
the discussion on Thursday SCTP nat

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:25,040
support obviously didn't happen in July

345
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:27,590
February sound reasonable um

346
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:33,860
yes because the plan is to start that

347
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:36,980
soon knows you'll discover yes ok the P

348
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,889
OPM tud draft and transfer here

349
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:41,420
confidentiality drafts these I'm hoping

350
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:43,580
we'll get done early above the time

351
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:45,830
being we're gonna shove the dates out to

352
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:49,879
April 22 April of next year to allow for

353
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:53,090
another IETF meetings cycle the SCTP

354
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:56,900
Biss draft sure about two meeting cycles

355
00:18:53,090 --> 00:19:00,800
of September and the next two dates

356
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,730
April 4 Tong session feedback and UV

357
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:06,440
transport options we'll deal with these

358
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:11,720
at the next meeting edition I'm gonna

359
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,300
pencil in a June 2020 a time frame for

360
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,530
the nqb draft for now after thank you be

361
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,980
is discussed we might have a better idea

362
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:23,809
today alright finally we get to the

363
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:26,179
agenda swing bash it item items 1 & 2

364
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:29,450
we've pretty much already done document

365
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:32,660
status etc agenda we're in the middle of

366
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:34,190
agenda bashing and the socks update

367
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:37,610
would basically gave which is that that

368
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:42,200
the socks draft me may move his working

369
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:44,300
group for the from the moment it still

370
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,679
burns interior name so of your transport

371
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,740
person interested in socks please

372
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:53,020
comment on that list so please use the

373
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:54,830
list to keep that draft progressing okay

374
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,129
yesterday we're gonna have a co

375
00:19:54,830 --> 00:20:01,370
develpment hackathon update covering TCP

376
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:03,110
Prague l4 s and SCS one side of topics

377
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,459
in addition there's been some work on

378
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:12,740
Datagram PLP MTU d4 for

379
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:17,659
SCTP three SCTP drafts and then the

380
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:19,519
Datagram PLP MTU d draft oops right

381
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:23,029
there we go and then we're gonna we're

382
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:23,840
gonna finish today with three three new

383
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:26,840
work graphs

384
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,039
NQ b which is the diffserv pv for non

385
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,240
queue building traffic that's the

386
00:20:28,039 --> 00:20:31,908
traffic dropped at the last meeting

387
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,370
there's going to be a presentation on DC

388
00:20:31,909 --> 00:20:37,840
cpp multipath that complements the

389
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:40,758
presentation in IC c RG this morning and

390
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,769
we'll have a final draft on endpoint

391
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,500
congestion rolled guide endpoint

392
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:47,899
congestion control guidelines accepting

393
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,840
the thursday want to start with yet

394
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:54,139
another around the UDP options draft and

395
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:55,730
then a session on l4 s both an updating

396
00:20:54,139 --> 00:20:59,840
the drafts and discussion of the issues

397
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,809
in the tracker the two principal SCE

398
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:05,090
drafts mostly focused on the first one

399
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:07,100
we put both on the agenda here because

400
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,500
these two need to be understood together

401
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:18,168
to to understand how SCE all the pieces

402
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:19,879
SCE work together and then ended agenda

403
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:24,320
on thursday where we have another round

404
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:26,928
of the QC i and of and diffserv draft we

405
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,928
have what's the spindle a bits which is

406
00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:31,639
this this is this is the alternates this

407
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:34,129
is one of the drafting in the

408
00:21:31,639 --> 00:21:35,389
alternative approaches to transfer

409
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:37,309
header encryption which is go ahead and

410
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,529
clip the headers and then expose

411
00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,809
selectively expose some limited

412
00:21:39,529 --> 00:21:45,100
information that might be useful in the

413
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:47,750
clear in the network and then a

414
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,330
presentation follows on from prior

415
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:53,389
presentation i think about a year ago on

416
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:56,389
a a intermediate resource reservation

417
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:59,959
protocol this is how to apply that to

418
00:21:56,389 --> 00:22:04,549
diffserv and they have some results okay

419
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:07,490
i believe that's it

420
00:22:04,549 --> 00:22:09,789
any comments or revisions desired on the

421
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:09,789
agenda

422
00:22:10,809 --> 00:22:15,928
all right can

423
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:25,650
the agenda bashed and next up we need to

424
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:28,890
go do a hackathon let's see so what the

425
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:31,789
fist one will take will be Bob and we'll

426
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:38,220
also have a remote participant for the

427
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:39,480
PLP and tu so yeah we need to work out

428
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,950
how to do this you need to open a new

429
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:54,950
window somehow yeah and press update

430
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:59,220
press refresh then it just appears

431
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:03,720
excellent you can start talking Bobby

432
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:07,679
what count against your time you can do

433
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,870
yeah if you if you can't yeah right okay

434
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,309
I was asked to spit out the update on

435
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:19,219
TCP prog to this session and have l4s

436
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:23,908
more generally in on Thursday so we

437
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,470
found it yet there we go okay so the

438
00:23:23,909 --> 00:23:26,880
acknowledgement list here is too long to

439
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,490
put on the first slide because it's like

440
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:34,260
now a large number of companies and

441
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:40,409
people and everything the next a quick

442
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:43,500
recap the motivation for TCP Prague and

443
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:46,320
Prague congestion controls generally and

444
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:50,549
the l4s architecture even more generally

445
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:52,260
is ultra-low queuing delay and the next

446
00:23:50,549 --> 00:23:55,740
slide will say what that means for all

447
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:59,158
Internet applications including capacity

448
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,169
seeking ones and the rest of the al

449
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:03,840
parecer architectures about transmit

450
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:06,720
transition mechanisms to that such as

451
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,559
the dual QA q m and per flow queuing and

452
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,049
the trick for doing outflow queuing

453
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,480
delay this is just a very brief recap is

454
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:17,760
to have much smaller sawteeth so that

455
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,350
you can have both low queuing delay and

456
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,120
higher utilization as shown in that

457
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:26,279
picture there but that creates a lot

458
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,539
more congestion events

459
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:31,739
that's why you have to have the

460
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:34,859
transitions next sorry slightly off the

461
00:24:31,739 --> 00:24:40,259
top there actual are queuing delay is at

462
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:43,168
the order of one millisecond and with 99

463
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:45,479
percentile around one millisecond and

464
00:24:43,169 --> 00:24:47,969
here we show five nines percentiles

465
00:24:45,479 --> 00:24:50,879
still at eight milliseconds compared to

466
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:55,950
others under a very heavy traffic load

467
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:57,959
this is a copy slide should your Jeff

468
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,519
speck and the good news is the whole the

469
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,019
whole slice is displaying on the screen

470
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:02,549
is the audience it's just been cut off

471
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:09,629
cut out for you for your convenience

472
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:11,820
right okay so the this slide gives the

473
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:14,189
structure of the rest of the talk it's

474
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:17,759
all about the requirements on the right

475
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:23,580
that are in the draft ACN l4s ID at the

476
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:26,399
bottom left there and they are for

477
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:30,599
congestion controls that are called

478
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:34,908
scaleable and what you have to do to in

479
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:37,168
or in order to be able to send an l4s

480
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:42,749
packet with the alpha race identifier

481
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:46,499
which is East e1 and they're derived

482
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:48,330
from a meeting that actually was held in

483
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:50,910
2015 in Prague which is why all these

484
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:52,099
protocols have the name Prague in them

485
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,019
[Music]

486
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:59,099
where a bunch of people got together and

487
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,719
set those those requirements down that

488
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:03,928
remain pretty much the same as they've

489
00:26:00,719 --> 00:26:05,940
gone into Internet drafts and they're

490
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,460
not just for TCP but I'm gonna talk just

491
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:12,179
about the TCP reference implementation

492
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:14,549
mostly in this talk and that's that

493
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,249
slide so I'm going to use them as you

494
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,599
see on the left as I go down and which I

495
00:26:17,249 --> 00:26:21,089
did well I didn't go down them in the

496
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:25,918
previous slide this is a copy of a slide

497
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:28,529
from July and just gonna sort of give

498
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:32,399
you a delta on the next slide to show

499
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:37,049
colors changing so watch now alright go

500
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:39,530
back watch now right okay if you weren't

501
00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:41,610
watching I'm not going to do it again

502
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:43,500
you'll see essentially we've been

503
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:49,770
focusing on the yellow and orange bits

504
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:51,150
and red bits are now all green and but

505
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:54,389
they're only light green the three in

506
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:57,300
the middle which the legend is along the

507
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:01,230
top and that means research has been

508
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,639
done and it's open so you know this is

509
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:05,610
meant to be the ietf it's not made to be

510
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
research but TCP Prague is more in the

511
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:14,490
research end of things so this is why

512
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:18,120
this is just a status update and I'm now

513
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:22,140
gonna go through a number of those rows

514
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:26,370
the first one was already green but it's

515
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:28,590
now about to be up streamed that's what

516
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:32,159
you hope oh who's just been contracted

517
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:35,159
in to work on that to upstream into the

518
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:37,080
linux mainline at the hackathon he

519
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:40,590
structured the whole thing into a

520
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:44,220
sequence set of patches so that um we

521
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:46,169
can start to do that or prepare at least

522
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:51,420
for up streaming for Linux stack which

523
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:54,810
is just just a quick thank you to elbow

524
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:57,420
he started work on this on Saturday at

525
00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:01,409
the hackathon having offended his PhD on

526
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:05,340
Thursday and sort of got a job now on

527
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:07,200
this so um he was both getting his head

528
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:15,659
around the code and starting to work on

529
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:20,550
it then by the way his PhD wasn't on

530
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:23,040
this subject but it was related the next

531
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:24,810
one which was the one that was

532
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,649
completely read before in the in the

533
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:33,270
table and is now a green or light green

534
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:39,660
at least to the the big issue issue

535
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:42,540
number 16 in the issues list of whether

536
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,730
there are any classic ECM bottlenecks

537
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:48,000
and if there are how does TCP Prague

538
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:50,760
fall back to Reno friendly behavior so

539
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,930
we're focused on a solution to this

540
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,770
problem but there is also the question

541
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,560
of prevalence

542
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,780
the problem the two subheadings on the

543
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:59,040
slide we're focused on the solution

544
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:00,660
because it has been pointed out that

545
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:03,330
even if the problems not prevalent it

546
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:07,730
could you know the standards are there

547
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:09,990
so someone could deploy something later

548
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:15,570
personally I think it's unlikely after

549
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,870
20 19 years you know so but let's move

550
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:18,960
on

551
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:22,379
so I published a discussion paper on a

552
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,380
design to do this with pseudocode in it

553
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:31,350
analysis rationale and I said who's also

554
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:35,070
just been hired in to work on this has

555
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:39,480
now implemented it and started testing

556
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:41,040
work on it and I've asked him if he can

557
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:43,140
also make his code available so that

558
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:45,389
other people can test it once his feels

559
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,390
it's stable enough which should be today

560
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,830
maybe he was working on that at the

561
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,590
hackathon as well well he'd written the

562
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:55,879
code a couple of weeks ago he's been

563
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:58,139
working on setting up evaluation so it

564
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,650
the question of the prevalence of the

565
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,480
problem going back to this slide in the

566
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:08,730
insert from Apple

567
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:11,310
they found 30% of devices in Argentina

568
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:14,520
were seeing seee doesn't necessarily

569
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:17,310
mean it's single cue causing that but we

570
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:19,710
did dig into that based on a clue from

571
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:20,820
Apple and got in touch with the ice P

572
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,350
and they found they were doing I

573
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,470
overwriting the tossed byte with zeros

574
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:30,179
sorry with with hex at 17 or something

575
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,860
which was causing the ce2 which is why

576
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:34,260
that was a problem and we're still not

577
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:40,500
sure whether it's whether any of the

578
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:42,990
other is single q 3168 in the new BB r

579
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:46,470
v2 code there's an L for SVC inside to

580
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:48,170
that there is Artie T dependence which

581
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:50,070
is one of the other rows in the table

582
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:51,360
and we've been testing various

583
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:53,760
combinations of that against various

584
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:57,270
congestion controls make UN's during the

585
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,800
hackathon and more testing and then

586
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:03,500
possibly design iteration is needed

587
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,909
scaling down to a fraction window was

588
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,580
one of the ones in there and I'm going

589
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,670
to talk about that first day morning

590
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:15,870
it's been done it's got it working it's

591
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:19,470
in the Linux not in Berlin it's kinda

592
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:23,189
it's been coded into it's currently

593
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:25,530
research code so there'll be a session

594
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,420
Thursday morning before the next es VG

595
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:30,600
that will include something on that and

596
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:35,460
here's the slide that says what those

597
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:39,090
sessions are so before the TS vwg

598
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,730
meeting on Thursday which is at 9:45

599
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:46,260
we've got a side meeting in the same

600
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:48,990
room at 8:30 to go over tcp prog status

601
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:55,500
update and i've posted to the TSV list

602
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:57,960
and other lists ICC rjt CPM we below the

603
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:02,280
coordinates to get there and the agenda

604
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,550
or provisional agenda and then we'll

605
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,590
also continue talking about FRS in the

606
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,600
second slot as they was pointed out and

607
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,209
there's some all the links to all that

608
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:39,629
is on the URL again I want I want

609
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:43,470
Aaron's cracker finished presentation do

610
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:55,550
we Julius whoops

611
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:55,550
it was bizarre can't try forward there

612
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:59,119
[Music]

613
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:15,449
all right which slides a question so um

614
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:22,790
being during more participant online to

615
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:22,790
do their update on coding for PL PM tud

616
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:38,179
then we come back to that because we

617
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:40,580
should be remote presentation um okay I

618
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:43,200
know that the SE folks were

619
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:46,110
participating a hackathon is anyone from

620
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,210
the SCE team want to give us an

621
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:51,800
interesting update on what on almost

622
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:51,800
happened so far Jonathan sure

623
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:10,389
I didn't prepare any slides specifically

624
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:14,010
for this but hopefully that said

625
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:14,009
real-time update is probably a feature

626
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:24,820
well I think there are two main things

627
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:27,610
that we achieved at the hackathon one of

628
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:32,100
them was some work on interoperability

629
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:36,280
with a key CN just to make sure that

630
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:38,589
when an SCE endpoint and an a key CN

631
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:42,100
supporting endpoint talked to each other

632
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:46,120
that something sensible happens and I

633
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:48,639
think we were able to achieve something

634
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,060
useful with that with the help of

635
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,850
Richard Jeff Niger

636
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,070
[Music]

637
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:56,500
the other interesting wing thing we did

638
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:58,750
was some investigation on what happens

639
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:01,660
when you have a bursty link and

640
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:07,930
variations in latency on the shorter

641
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:12,359
time scales and we found that these can

642
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:16,299
have quite a big effect on high fidelity

643
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:24,070
congestion control in general due to the

644
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:27,720
a very short effective queue depth when

645
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:31,810
used with a red type or a threshold type

646
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:35,529
marking 6-game but we also had some

647
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:42,759
success with trying out a new marking

648
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:47,770
scheme for the SCE feedback based on the

649
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:50,920
kata algorithm so we have a new version

650
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,290
of a of a QM that's actually using two

651
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:56,770
instances of code or one for C II

652
00:35:53,290 --> 00:36:03,790
marking and one for SCE marking was just

653
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:07,630
slightly different parameters and that's

654
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:10,120
proved to give quite a considerably

655
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,370
better throughput in the bursty

656
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,890
environment and it still seemed to

657
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,100
perform well in

658
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:19,140
the ordinary environment there's still

659
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,600
more work to be done on evaluating how

660
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:25,940
well that works and tuning the

661
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:25,940
parameters but it looks very promising

662
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,850
okay thank you

663
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:57,050
this one this yeah it should be that one

664
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:13,290
so hi I'm Michael took son or not as the

665
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:18,060
case may be but and pretty close to

666
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:21,660
Michael this is the update on the SCTP

667
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:26,370
based draft them the plan is to publish

668
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:29,819
a best to RSC 496 oh and I shall iterate

669
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:32,130
again that this is intending to revise

670
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,180
the spec to make it clearer implement

671
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:37,590
the errata which we've identified and

672
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,390
then the intention will be just sound

673
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:42,390
out the possibility of progressing this

674
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,370
to full standard so this is an important

675
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,970
document in this respect and it becomes

676
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:51,690
easier to read each time it's edited

677
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:54,629
document history is we're in the process

678
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:56,820
at at the moment of going past editorial

679
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,760
fixes it's the cleaner of musts and

680
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,750
shirts and the original document was

681
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,720
written with lowercase must meaning must

682
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:08,550
and uppercase most meaning must but

683
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,140
we're going to go through and just check

684
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,480
that that is actually correct

685
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,040
because um the idea has got a little bit

686
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,570
more pedantic on this and I think this

687
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,980
is a good thing to do to make sure that

688
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,660
the shoulds and musts are called out

689
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,990
correctly so that's what they're

690
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,990
currently doing

691
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:27,140
working progress handling of multiple

692
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:31,400
remote addresses in the associate

693
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:34,788
primitive and there is a draft the text

694
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,069
to go and github there's some more

695
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:39,109
editorial issues to be done maybe some

696
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,779
layout improvements and the good news is

697
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:44,328
if I put my chair hat on now is that

698
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:46,160
usually one sin one SCTP piece of work

699
00:38:44,329 --> 00:38:48,410
is done they quickly move on to the next

700
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,788
piece and this is the next piece of work

701
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:58,069
to be completed and they expect to

702
00:38:52,789 --> 00:39:01,970
complete this before Vancouver anybody

703
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:04,549
got any questions on the bits draft we

704
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:06,439
already have offers to review but it's

705
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:08,359
becoming increasingly interesting to

706
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:10,640
find good reviewers for this document or

707
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:12,380
any reviewers in fact to get feedback on

708
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,569
how good that document is he is

709
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:17,019
revolving as we head towards the

710
00:39:14,569 --> 00:39:18,319
inevitable end of trying to publish it

711
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:20,709
thank you

712
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:23,599
is that an end for me with a nice pink

713
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:26,539
let's see the next one not support aha

714
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,529
um in this case I'm telling you and we

715
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,529
figure out how to use a Chromebook

716
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,339
Michael tuckson again and although I

717
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:36,589
have no different sets of co-authors

718
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:39,319
Michael's co-authors are Randall and

719
00:39:36,589 --> 00:39:40,849
Irene and this is a document that's been

720
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,730
with our working group for far too long

721
00:39:40,849 --> 00:39:44,809
in fact it's been with the so long that

722
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,359
it came from another working group

723
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:49,789
called behave which closed a long long

724
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,740
time ago it's about adding that nut

725
00:39:49,789 --> 00:39:57,740
support to SCTP um ipv4 net support was

726
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,118
missing in SCTP it's the last of our ITF

727
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:02,029
transports that doesn't actually have a

728
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:05,680
spec defining it this document tries to

729
00:40:02,029 --> 00:40:08,329
do that the statuses were currently at

730
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:11,200
draft 15 there are comments from a

731
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:13,700
person called gory fairest on draft 14

732
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:16,250
going through this trying to separate

733
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:19,430
out mainly what it means to implement

734
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:21,339
SCT peanut support as somebody building

735
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:26,118
a box for system redoing an sctp

736
00:40:21,339 --> 00:40:30,200
implementation this draft covers both we

737
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,990
have comments from Max Maxim and these

738
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,308
comments have been addressed we believe

739
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:38,089
this document is

740
00:40:34,309 --> 00:40:40,459
for working group last call as in the

741
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:41,808
authors believe this and the chairs are

742
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:47,569
willing to believe this but there's one

743
00:40:41,809 --> 00:40:49,309
extra thing that's cropped up so and

744
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:52,249
before we take that working group last

745
00:40:49,309 --> 00:41:09,619
call discussion and we should have a

746
00:40:52,249 --> 00:41:11,058
look at the yang model for this let's

747
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:20,959
see if we can find it let's even find

748
00:41:11,059 --> 00:41:24,009
the yang Yang slide here I don't know

749
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:24,009
what happened here see

750
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:44,070
all right hang on we'll go get off of

751
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:53,369
this you're looking for yes we have

752
00:41:44,070 --> 00:42:03,770
young slides here we go and it should do

753
00:41:53,369 --> 00:42:07,950
it yeah I think so this is part of the

754
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:09,390
net draft okay proposed part of an air

755
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:14,790
draft so I'm going to go through these

756
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:17,279
and heads up please if you look at these

757
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:22,980
slides I'm do you think we should add a

758
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,720
young model to the nut draft after we've

759
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,359
don't gone through these sights I'd like

760
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,779
to take questions about the young model

761
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,078
or any interest in this and then finally

762
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,280
we're going to ask if we can complete a

763
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:36,720
consensus column whether the document is

764
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,099
ready for working group last cold

765
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:44,848
publication but first of all let's look

766
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:47,369
at the nut document with young and we

767
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:49,829
could add some nut related

768
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:53,430
considerations and including the young

769
00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:55,230
model to this document this is within

770
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:59,629
the scope of what we were allowed to do

771
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,630
how much effort would be involved and

772
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,430
there are a couple of things that we

773
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:10,140
have to do we have to describe the in

774
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:12,839
tag be tightly XV tag and this doesn't

775
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:15,779
sound hugely difficult and we could

776
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:19,440
express this in yang and the module

777
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,359
might look something like this the

778
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,700
person who wrote the site say this is

779
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,990
straightforward and here I confess I do

780
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:29,189
not know whether this is straightforward

781
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:30,959
are not straightforward so we are

782
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,089
looking for some expertise in this

783
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,660
working group who would understand the

784
00:43:33,089 --> 00:43:39,540
yang model or somebody to volunteer to

785
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:41,819
read this as chairs that would be really

786
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,850
helpful we do have it yang mid doctors

787
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,650
equivalent I mean

788
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:46,060
we can get expert advice on this but we

789
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:51,220
need a working group advice on this

790
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:53,860
first should we should we go ahead with

791
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:59,250
the model looks like this and integrate

792
00:43:53,860 --> 00:44:01,360
this into the NAP support document and

793
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:03,730
the suggestion by the person to

794
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,680
volunteer this slide deck is it's it's

795
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,960
easy just to add this to the young model

796
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:09,460
and that's better than creating a

797
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,610
separate model to describe something

798
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:15,910
which is kind of like only this long um

799
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:18,550
any objections any thoughts anybody able

800
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:20,020
to understand what this is how do you

801
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:22,540
know wish to come to the mic

802
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:24,759
I'll admit understanding some of this

803
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:27,640
the most important statement on the

804
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,580
screen is just short a half way down

805
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,080
where the magic word is augment which

806
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:35,350
means as opposed to describing a new

807
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:37,960
model yang Yang has a very nice ability

808
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:39,670
to just go add a few things that perhaps

809
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:43,780
shouldn't put in the first time but

810
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:48,280
weren't and so this this really is all

811
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:57,190
the yang is blissfully short can anybody

812
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:57,840
come to the mic and say something sorry

813
00:44:57,190 --> 00:45:13,230
for looking at

814
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:17,040
through the code of Maya J holin I've

815
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:19,440
done a little bit with yang but I'm less

816
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,700
familiar with SCTP what are the V tags

817
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,320
int and X I'm not sure the what are the

818
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:28,710
v-tex sorry

819
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:31,230
the v-tach or the yeah there's there's

820
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:37,410
two Leafs here the envy tag and the XP

821
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:39,390
tag and is there some meaning for this

822
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:42,120
besides internal verification tag I

823
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:45,690
don't know it's it's how I'm se TPD

824
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:48,120
multi muxes flows so it's tied in with

825
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:49,560
the nut state but I think if anybody is

826
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,990
willing to just say hey I don't

827
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,820
understand a couple lines of this it

828
00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:55,379
will be useful to talk to them to

829
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,420
Michael on the person who proposed it to

830
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,490
see whether kind of at least we're

831
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,170
heading in a direction that's useful we

832
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:05,729
can close this without doing this or we

833
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:08,010
can add this I guess I have no strong

834
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:12,050
opinion if you're asking for

835
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:14,820
does the light yang look sane at all I

836
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:16,260
have no objection if there's some

837
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:19,170
understanding of what these things mean

838
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:24,270
- various knits like the space or

839
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:26,400
whatever right but but the reason I'm

840
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:30,600
not volunteering is because I don't know

841
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,670
what we're doing with this yeah so hi

842
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:34,350
Frank Trammell let me rephrase the

843
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:39,270
question Jake before you sit all the way

844
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:41,430
down I think the question is is the

845
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:46,560
description internal verification tag

846
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:49,319
and external verification tag enough for

847
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:52,140
somebody who understands setp enough to

848
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,900
be messing with the NAT state on an sctp

849
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:59,540
NAT box to understand what that means

850
00:46:54,900 --> 00:47:01,320
and I think so if you if you're managing

851
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:02,700
right like so this is the additional

852
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,830
state that you need because of the way

853
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,589
that that flow mocks and de-mux works in

854
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:09,960
SCDP I had actually forgotten that this

855
00:47:07,590 --> 00:47:11,079
was called of V tag and told just now is

856
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:15,459
like Vita oh yeah

857
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:18,099
that's the thing right so I think it's

858
00:47:15,459 --> 00:47:19,239
fine do we want to just put it in this

859
00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:20,259
document as opposed to another document

860
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:24,009
yeah sure

861
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:26,140
yes seems perfectly reasonable is this

862
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:27,729
yang saying other than the VTEC thing I

863
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,950
have no idea I don't read yang that's

864
00:47:27,729 --> 00:47:32,649
okay we have SCTP experts we can get

865
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:35,680
young experts I'm asking the working

866
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:37,299
group please talk for not about mark sir

867
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,950
is there an assumption that somehow

868
00:47:37,299 --> 00:47:46,538
writing these drafts will actually make

869
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:49,689
SCTP work with Nats right but with the

870
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:52,390
nuts that wish to do this there is there

871
00:47:49,690 --> 00:47:54,190
is turn Annie what there are some yeah

872
00:47:52,390 --> 00:47:57,969
yeah yeah yeah right there are working

873
00:47:54,190 --> 00:48:00,099
SCTP nuts out there that do this they're

874
00:47:57,969 --> 00:48:01,900
maybe not in people's home but this is

875
00:48:00,099 --> 00:48:06,609
fine it's like saying they're magic

876
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:08,170
rapid7 yeah maybe assuming there are

877
00:48:06,609 --> 00:48:09,578
magic rabbit we would like to configure

878
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:15,640
them with yang because this is the ietf

879
00:48:09,579 --> 00:48:17,019
so exactly yeah this isn't this isn't

880
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:25,449
the thing up for debate we want to get

881
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:28,808
this thing out of this working group do

882
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:31,930
we know what we're doing David it sounds

883
00:48:28,809 --> 00:48:33,880
like it's moving forward we shall sounds

884
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,279
like we've got a few people we can quit

885
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,650
check with to make sure the SCTP

886
00:48:36,279 --> 00:48:40,989
contents are okay and it sound and it

887
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:42,999
looks like they probably are and after

888
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:45,309
that a trip to them a trip to the yang

889
00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:47,259
doctors one of whom will be very very

890
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:50,369
happy gets something this short to look

891
00:48:47,259 --> 00:48:53,829
at and we might have something useful

892
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:59,890
okay so my final question this time but

893
00:48:53,829 --> 00:49:03,849
the chair hut on is is the SCTP not

894
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:07,779
draft ready for publication meta solving

895
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:09,400
whether we include this is the anybody

896
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:13,269
here who thinks there is additional work

897
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:15,599
that needs to be done to finish that

898
00:49:13,269 --> 00:49:15,598
draft

899
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:25,440
all right I think having seen seeing no

900
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:27,300
hands raised in the room I think we're

901
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,920
just gonna go ahead and move forward we

902
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:39,840
need we should get this one done and

903
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:42,740
check it off Nagesh your slides up let's

904
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:42,740
see if we can do that

905
00:49:55,670 --> 00:50:15,240
all right I don't see any gaseous slides

906
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:16,950
hang on let's see did you see what I

907
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:23,069
wanted and then takes it right off the

908
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:25,439
screen well in the website wonderful no

909
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:29,790
we know we don't seem to have gotten

910
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,540
slides from Nagesh let's see is he yes

911
00:50:29,790 --> 00:50:37,730
he is on is on line what happens I push

912
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,730
the red button I'll give that a shot

913
00:50:46,970 --> 00:50:54,959
push the red button enough what a useful

914
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:56,940
red button so if me techo is monitoring

915
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,440
this the chairs are completely lost

916
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:04,260
about how to make any of the remote

917
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:05,550
presentations happen we will come back

918
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,650
to them when we can

919
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:15,100
[Music]

920
00:51:07,650 --> 00:51:18,430
whoa jabbers grab me equipment are you

921
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:20,380
guys on jabber sure remote propresenter

922
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:33,810
nice mute himself I wonder which one

923
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:39,670
we've got hello we got somebody

924
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:41,980
let's meet you yeah okay on your mind

925
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,170
the game your mic is set too high you're

926
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:47,430
clipping very badly now this is Julian's

927
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:54,160
presenter for which one of these drafts

928
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:54,370
okay ah back to the setp deal okay go

929
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,910
ahead

930
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:03,940
this this is going to 3.2 we're going

931
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:06,279
back to let me go get that up yes that's

932
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:07,900
much better thank you

933
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:12,400
all right me a minute we'll get the

934
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:14,440
slide set up in the room and then okay

935
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,680
go ahead with lucky an adventure on

936
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:19,780
slides if not ask us and we'll move them

937
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:22,450
thank you okay so this is a short

938
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:25,680
overview over the work we've been doing

939
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:28,569
for the last couple of weeks on the

940
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:31,660
implementation of the TPL p.m. Tod

941
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:39,820
algorithm for SCTP oh no it's the wrong

942
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:46,680
slide isn't it sorry sorry thought that

943
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:46,680
was red ones because I'm not going fast

944
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:53,040
[Music]

945
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:30,280
should be okay and that's what I get it

946
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,020
looks like we've got the wrong set of

947
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:43,750
slides associated with with meeting

948
00:53:32,020 --> 00:54:01,210
materials hang on we're looking for your

949
00:53:43,750 --> 00:54:02,860
slides okay if you can plug if you can

950
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,660
plug an HDMI into yours that might be

951
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:06,220
the fastest way you get to get get it

952
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:09,970
get a projector as opposed to high tech

953
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:15,819
stuff return to a hardware solution just

954
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:18,839
a minute I'm pretty sure that's going to

955
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,840
be HDMI connector

956
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:53,760
yeah I don't have a all right we're

957
00:54:51,690 --> 00:55:00,800
gonna get went up load the slides I hope

958
00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,800
that happens quickly full of vision

959
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,340
you

960
00:55:30,119 --> 00:55:45,339
okay now that's worked correctly be

961
00:55:38,859 --> 00:55:47,049
those two there okay we might have

962
00:55:45,339 --> 00:56:00,240
managed to move move the bits into the

963
00:55:47,049 --> 00:56:08,650
right place that looks better

964
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:09,129
okay sorry about that okay and okay here

965
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:10,839
we go

966
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,499
my person's name underlined this time

967
00:56:10,839 --> 00:56:16,869
yes great thank you so much okay so as I

968
00:56:14,499 --> 00:56:18,399
said this is a short review of the work

969
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:22,539
I've been doing for the last couple

970
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:28,930
weeks on the implementation of DPL PMT

971
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:31,900
UT for SCTP next slide please so as a

972
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:34,210
short recap this is an overview of the

973
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:38,349
state machine of the DPL PMT UT

974
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:43,269
algorithm in the current - on nine draft

975
00:56:38,349 --> 00:56:48,400
version and as a short reminder so the

976
00:56:43,269 --> 00:56:51,939
the TPL PMT algorithm built with finding

977
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,489
the right MTU of a path so the

978
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:58,650
factorization layer knows how to make

979
00:56:54,489 --> 00:57:04,359
the packet it sense next slide please

980
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:06,519
and so what we have done is on what

981
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:10,960
we're doing is we are implementing this

982
00:57:06,519 --> 00:57:14,078
for HTTP for a code base that is shared

983
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:14,650
between the free PD FreeBSD kernel and a

984
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,279
user space

985
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:22,749
SCTP implementation called user SCTP and

986
00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:27,099
the implementation is used in most web

987
00:57:22,749 --> 00:57:30,609
RTC implementations including Firefox

988
00:57:27,099 --> 00:57:35,349
and Chrome it supports a CTP over ipv4

989
00:57:30,609 --> 00:57:39,730
and ipv6 and also a CTP over ut2 UDP and

990
00:57:35,349 --> 00:57:42,640
Achillas currently our focus is on ipv4

991
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:46,680
ipv6 we haven't tested it

992
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:50,529
ing TLS part yet next slide please so

993
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:54,190
where we started is about one and a half

994
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:57,370
years ago Dana vanilla the first the

995
00:57:54,190 --> 00:58:00,610
initial implementation of DP OPM tud for

996
00:57:57,370 --> 00:58:02,259
SCTP and basically all of the

997
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:05,460
sterilization work that has been done so

998
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:08,860
far is based on her implementation so

999
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:12,760
her work is very only on this so it

1000
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:18,160
hadn't been up streamed and next slide

1001
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:21,700
please what we do basically is we take

1002
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:25,750
her changes from back then and merge

1003
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:28,960
this to a current version of the FreeBSD

1004
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:33,310
kernel and we're getting it working

1005
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:35,980
there and so what we also do is we then

1006
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:38,140
update her her work to the latest -

1007
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:40,720
online draft version and we're still

1008
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:44,140
checking updates to the draft and along

1009
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:46,410
the way we have fixed some box next

1010
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:46,410
slide please

1011
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:52,660
so these are some some considerations

1012
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:55,210
for implementers who want to implement

1013
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:57,310
the algorithm for their own transport

1014
00:58:55,210 --> 00:59:02,650
protocols own transport implementations

1015
00:58:57,310 --> 00:59:05,259
so we've seen that the semantics of MTU

1016
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:09,610
changes are different for PL p.m. PUD

1017
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:13,090
because in PMT ug the MTU of a pass can

1018
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:17,320
only shrink while in PL p.m. PUD it can

1019
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:20,800
also grow this might make some some

1020
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:24,130
things slightly different um changes the

1021
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:27,910
semantics of of some functions a bit and

1022
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:30,610
also you should note that the in the

1023
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:32,920
probes in DP LP mu T our congestion

1024
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:35,320
control and not read control so they

1025
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:38,710
should not trigger a congestion control

1026
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,300
response when they are lost I'd also

1027
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:44,200
want one thing we're currently seeing in

1028
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:47,920
our implementation is that if we see a

1029
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:52,509
MTU path and do you change the frequency

1030
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:55,480
with which we see our TT updates

1031
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:56,260
decreases but this is most likely just

1032
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:58,750
in the implementation

1033
00:59:56,260 --> 01:00:03,520
but we still have to figure out next

1034
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:06,070
like this so this also makes me to do

1035
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:09,070
what we still have to do it's only once

1036
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:11,859
I'd figure out what is wrong with this

1037
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:14,080
back and also we still have to fix some

1038
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:16,450
real names to be fully draft compliant

1039
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:18,490
and also we still have the test with

1040
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:21,939
ipv6 and again the because we only have

1041
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:24,100
tested with ipv4 so far and we have to

1042
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,440
make sure that everything works well

1043
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:30,368
with all platforms that are supported by

1044
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:32,980
a user HTTP and we are still and we're

1045
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:35,760
also thinking about a way to do

1046
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:41,560
automated MTU testing in order to

1047
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:45,940
faciliate tests for DTLS and UDP okay

1048
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:47,770
thank you okay thank you very much I

1049
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:50,770
think we're going to quickly bash the

1050
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:53,140
agenda and go straight from here to the

1051
01:00:50,770 --> 01:00:55,090
main peel a datum and peel PMT you

1052
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,529
Deidre draft to try to avoid induce you

1053
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:59,830
too much whiplash we'll pick up the

1054
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:01,660
third SCTP draft after this now let's

1055
01:00:59,830 --> 01:01:03,060
even get the slides up that we came up

1056
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:07,379
last time

1057
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:12,009
yeah that would be these wouldn't it

1058
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:13,359
okay right time I am Corey Ferris being

1059
01:01:12,010 --> 01:01:16,390
gory Ferris nothing

1060
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:18,490
editor of this document this is dead

1061
01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:22,810
grand packetization layer path MTU

1062
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:26,049
discovery it should be a presentation of

1063
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:29,890
0 9 that's the document that we as

1064
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:32,680
editors have I'm an idiot I don't know

1065
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:36,160
how to make XML to RFC work with ref 3

1066
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:39,850
so I couldn't post it sorry didn't know

1067
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,100
how to put the SVG files and so there's

1068
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:45,640
something just a little bit coming along

1069
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:46,960
in a moment and but DPL PM tud version 8

1070
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:49,990
which is reacting the working group for

1071
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:55,570
a while is a complete document next

1072
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:57,729
slide we moved to xml v3 with SVG

1073
01:01:55,570 --> 01:01:59,460
diagrams because our ad thought it was

1074
01:01:57,730 --> 01:02:03,280
an interesting experiment for us

1075
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:04,810
thanks ad this is testing the ID

1076
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:09,220
submission process because it doesn't

1077
01:02:04,810 --> 01:02:09,999
work for me anyway and if you 0 8 we

1078
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:12,118
started the

1079
01:02:09,999 --> 01:02:14,649
experiment then the table of contents is

1080
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:16,209
rendered as two lines for each line so

1081
01:02:14,649 --> 01:02:16,868
it all looks terrible that's not our

1082
01:02:16,209 --> 01:02:19,149
fault

1083
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:21,069
there's a good HTML somewhere if you

1084
01:02:19,149 --> 01:02:23,049
follow the link here if you're not in

1085
01:02:21,069 --> 01:02:24,729
HTML and everything's okay

1086
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:27,189
the diagrams are okay the ASCII hearts

1087
01:02:24,729 --> 01:02:29,198
okay and it hasn't changed a lot so

1088
01:02:27,189 --> 01:02:31,388
let's talk about what the diagram looks

1089
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:34,989
like the core diagram looks like this

1090
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:39,819
this was redrawn again in 0-8 without

1091
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:42,759
changing the spec to make this clear we

1092
01:02:39,819 --> 01:02:44,499
hope and simple we hope because actually

1093
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:49,089
the core of this mechanism is quite

1094
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:50,558
simple basically you enable PL PMT UD by

1095
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:52,239
moving out of the disabled state by

1096
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,119
knowing you have connectivity and doing

1097
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:58,209
initial probe you then reach a base MTU

1098
01:02:55,119 --> 01:03:02,589
you check that works you then try and

1099
01:02:58,209 --> 01:03:05,649
search to increase your MTU sending a

1100
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:09,939
number of probes each time a probe

1101
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:12,939
succeeds you increase the path MTU if

1102
01:03:09,939 --> 01:03:16,509
you if the probe succeeds and then

1103
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:18,609
subsequently fails for a larger size you

1104
01:03:16,509 --> 01:03:21,639
carry for a certain number of attempts

1105
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:24,219
to send other probe packets these probe

1106
01:03:21,639 --> 01:03:26,679
packets may be the same size larger

1107
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:29,169
which would be foolish or smaller which

1108
01:03:26,679 --> 01:03:31,329
might be smart but there you send a

1109
01:03:29,169 --> 01:03:32,828
certain number of probes if you don't

1110
01:03:31,329 --> 01:03:36,429
get response to anything bigger than the

1111
01:03:32,829 --> 01:03:38,259
last one that worked you give up the

1112
01:03:36,429 --> 01:03:40,569
original version of the algorithm

1113
01:03:38,259 --> 01:03:42,639
suggested a value of 10 for the number

1114
01:03:40,569 --> 01:03:45,519
of probes you send after you've found a

1115
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:47,529
new value and then one that failed we

1116
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:51,008
think that a value of 3 is probably more

1117
01:03:47,529 --> 01:03:52,959
conservative as a recommended number the

1118
01:03:51,009 --> 01:03:56,409
document does not define this search

1119
01:03:52,959 --> 01:03:59,439
algorithm my personal opinion is any

1120
01:03:56,409 --> 01:04:01,299
algorithms probably okay except for the

1121
01:03:59,439 --> 01:04:03,848
stupid one of trying to increase by 1

1122
01:04:01,299 --> 01:04:05,979
byte every packet which I hope no one is

1123
01:04:03,849 --> 01:04:09,069
even so stupid as to try and think will

1124
01:04:05,979 --> 01:04:12,698
be useful jumping to large sizes is

1125
01:04:09,069 --> 01:04:14,439
probably very smart because and in the

1126
01:04:12,699 --> 01:04:16,029
Internet as a whole people have deployed

1127
01:04:14,439 --> 01:04:17,919
infrastructure which has certain limits

1128
01:04:16,029 --> 01:04:20,139
or use certain tunnels so you can more

1129
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:21,690
or less guess good values to increase

1130
01:04:20,139 --> 01:04:23,910
too

1131
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:26,730
if all things go wrong you return to the

1132
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,649
base are you start from a bottom thing a

1133
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:30,180
bottom path end to you which you know

1134
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,700
should work are you trying to increase

1135
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:34,440
again if really it's seriously wrong

1136
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:37,109
because the base doesn't work you moved

1137
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:37,980
to era the document does not define what

1138
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,650
you do in era

1139
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:42,870
it makes suggestions you could try and

1140
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:45,360
keep the link open you mainly could try

1141
01:04:42,870 --> 01:04:47,609
enabling fragmentation in v4 you could

1142
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:50,160
try this stuff but this is below what

1143
01:04:47,610 --> 01:04:52,410
you said should work if you work a team

1144
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:54,540
implement era has just give up that's

1145
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:56,040
also allowed so IRAs kind of this

1146
01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:58,680
unknown state where you could be really

1147
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:01,020
smart and ply lots of heuristics but we

1148
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:05,100
don't really say the simple algorithm is

1149
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:06,509
quite simple periodically when

1150
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,810
everything's working normally you've

1151
01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:13,080
been a such complete state and after a

1152
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:14,580
period of time which is minutes you go

1153
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,560
back to the searching state and send a

1154
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:21,450
probe message to continue your search if

1155
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:23,759
you are totally clueless about what your

1156
01:05:21,450 --> 01:05:27,120
transport is doing like your a tunnel or

1157
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:29,040
maybe just a UDP based transport with no

1158
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:30,990
connection state so you don't know

1159
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:33,060
what's going on at that point you should

1160
01:05:30,990 --> 01:05:35,279
also check that the current path is

1161
01:05:33,060 --> 01:05:37,410
supporting the current path MTU that

1162
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:40,410
you've discovered all of this is written

1163
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:42,600
in the spec what's changed recently we

1164
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:44,129
added this connectivity section that has

1165
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:46,560
to precede everything to each

1166
01:05:44,130 --> 01:05:48,420
packetization layer in the description

1167
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,840
this made it slightly more modular to

1168
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:53,790
describe a new packetization layer we

1169
01:05:51,840 --> 01:05:55,530
added text that we thought was obvious

1170
01:05:53,790 --> 01:05:58,650
but we thought we should really add

1171
01:05:55,530 --> 01:06:01,740
which ISM you have to tell the path MTU

1172
01:05:58,650 --> 01:06:04,020
cash in your host your node at your

1173
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:06,390
equipment to not use the cash value when

1174
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:09,360
you're sending a probe and also to not

1175
01:06:06,390 --> 01:06:12,540
use that cash when it receives path to

1176
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:14,460
big packet to path to pack it to big

1177
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:18,450
messages for your path I can never do

1178
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:20,340
that because if you let PMT UD control

1179
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:22,470
what's going on you get the wrong result

1180
01:06:20,340 --> 01:06:24,300
so you have to tell the network layer to

1181
01:06:22,470 --> 01:06:28,259
disable this for this particular flow

1182
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:30,630
and Julius who we saw online has been

1183
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,850
implemented this in SCTP and has been

1184
01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:35,089
telling us where we where he found

1185
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:37,219
things which were rather confusing

1186
01:06:35,089 --> 01:06:40,249
fortunately this was near Manley text

1187
01:06:37,219 --> 01:06:44,719
and we fix this in 0-8 and some final

1188
01:06:40,249 --> 01:06:46,279
fixes in zero 9 this relates to a number

1189
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,599
of documents which is why I'm going to

1190
01:06:46,279 --> 01:06:49,460
motivate in a moment that we should

1191
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:52,789
working grid last call the next version

1192
01:06:49,460 --> 01:06:55,819
M it's an update for 8 to 1 which was

1193
01:06:52,789 --> 01:06:58,400
mainly focused on TCP this focus is not

1194
01:06:55,819 --> 01:07:03,170
on TCP it focuses on things that aren't

1195
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:06,259
TCP interior fragile and is a document

1196
01:07:03,170 --> 01:07:08,719
aiming at BCP now in RFC id2q

1197
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:11,210
which says you should do this where you

1198
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:13,910
can in your protocol to enable us to

1199
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,660
work without requiring fragmentation in

1200
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:16,819
the network layer

1201
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:18,649
therefore this little document is held

1202
01:07:16,819 --> 01:07:21,440
up waiting for us to complete her work

1203
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:22,729
here and the quick transport is not held

1204
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:26,239
up because he's not yet ready for

1205
01:07:22,729 --> 01:07:28,609
publication it will be ready soon guys

1206
01:07:26,239 --> 01:07:31,009
yes and it refers to this so we should

1207
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:33,259
do it for a quick transport UDP options

1208
01:07:31,009 --> 01:07:35,960
is our own working group item here that

1209
01:07:33,259 --> 01:07:38,359
also defines it and there's a draft that

1210
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,249
Tom and I have co-authored which defines

1211
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:42,828
little pieces that go with UDP options

1212
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:46,038
to add that to UDP options in the future

1213
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:49,819
when your new DP options is finished and

1214
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:52,069
of course SCTP is implementing this at

1215
01:07:49,819 --> 01:07:55,130
least in one user space and kernel

1216
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:56,779
implementation and hopefully setp will

1217
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,359
follow this for other implementations

1218
01:07:56,779 --> 01:07:59,960
setp defines something like this from

1219
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,578
the beginning

1220
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:03,710
it just didn't have the details which

1221
01:08:01,579 --> 01:08:06,229
are in this particular spec so several

1222
01:08:03,710 --> 01:08:08,450
documents refer to this or will refer to

1223
01:08:06,229 --> 01:08:10,788
this very soon we have some

1224
01:08:08,450 --> 01:08:12,680
implementations just because I know Devi

1225
01:08:10,789 --> 01:08:14,509
is going to have to write this up in the

1226
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:18,349
future if we go for a last call there's

1227
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:20,149
FreeBSD there is some rebn ESD work with

1228
01:08:18,349 --> 01:08:23,779
UDP options and there's partial

1229
01:08:20,149 --> 01:08:25,219
implementations with quick and we b'keen

1230
01:08:23,779 --> 01:08:26,960
to work with other people to try and

1231
01:08:25,219 --> 01:08:29,420
make more quick implementations do this

1232
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,639
please talk to us and there's been three

1233
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:33,649
custom implementations along the pathway

1234
01:08:31,639 --> 01:08:37,609
to get here not of which have been

1235
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:41,028
upstream we had early reviews from last

1236
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:42,710
Thank You Lars wherever you are yeah he

1237
01:08:41,029 --> 01:08:44,420
spotted some shoulds that should be must

1238
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:46,520
and must it should have been shuts and

1239
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:49,309
all the good things that we should do so

1240
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,839
we will fix these in version 9

1241
01:08:49,309 --> 01:08:54,440
they're in the Attic 2q once we learn to

1242
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:57,769
use XML to RSC revision3 we will publish

1243
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:59,960
those and I think from the author's

1244
01:08:57,770 --> 01:09:02,989
point of view we've had our initial

1245
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:05,809
review all the people are referring to

1246
01:09:02,988 --> 01:09:07,428
this we think the works done so we'd

1247
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:09,529
like to suggest this is ready for a

1248
01:09:07,429 --> 01:09:11,059
working group last call all right

1249
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:12,710
think of that as a Christmas present

1250
01:09:11,059 --> 01:09:19,099
don't know whether it's gonna be early

1251
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:21,589
or late though and it is UTP chairs here

1252
01:09:19,099 --> 01:09:23,869
what kind of skid so nice not CTV either

1253
01:09:21,589 --> 01:09:26,210
quick chairs here and somebody or

1254
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:30,339
somebody who knows what schedule the

1255
01:09:26,210 --> 01:09:30,339
quick transport draft is likely to be on

1256
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:39,078
somebody must be brave enough to talk to

1257
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:40,908
that one no we can go talk okay okay we

1258
01:09:39,078 --> 01:09:43,460
got somebody yeah it's an easy quick

1259
01:09:40,908 --> 01:09:45,500
question mark so I we haven't talked

1260
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:49,328
about this interim in Cupertino there's

1261
01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:55,070
a hope of week working group last call

1262
01:09:49,328 --> 01:10:00,670
soon ish which I'd say maybe Vancouver

1263
01:09:55,070 --> 01:10:02,989
maybe even earlier but there's there's a

1264
01:10:00,670 --> 01:10:06,380
strong expectation that will not be the

1265
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:08,690
real us call that that in fact there

1266
01:10:06,380 --> 01:10:17,570
will be a lot of comments and then we'll

1267
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:19,730
requires from rework inevitably so yes

1268
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:21,530
so so we anticipate better way to say it

1269
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:23,480
thank you Brian so there's going to be

1270
01:10:21,530 --> 01:10:26,800
more than one working group flask almost

1271
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:29,928
certainly however the first one is is

1272
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:32,090
probably in the next quarter or so okay

1273
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:33,770
that's helpful because I don't think

1274
01:10:32,090 --> 01:10:36,980
we're quite as optimistic about the UDP

1275
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:44,599
options draft which is why the UDP

1276
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:47,419
options material for a DLP MPT UD you

1277
01:10:44,599 --> 01:10:48,619
know what whatever that Crenn is I could

1278
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:52,099
apply one of these one of these times

1279
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:54,348
what why the options work for Datagram

1280
01:10:52,099 --> 01:10:56,329
path MTU discovery has been separated

1281
01:10:54,349 --> 01:10:58,159
into a separate draft that way we can

1282
01:10:56,329 --> 01:11:01,940
last call this one and publish it

1283
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:03,059
without having it wait for the main UDP

1284
01:11:01,940 --> 01:11:06,870
option strap there's a set

1285
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:09,420
that covers the use of UDP options for

1286
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:10,950
for this purpose and presumably this

1287
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:15,660
whole when did this all then gets

1288
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:18,690
referenced from the SCTP piss draft yeah

1289
01:11:15,660 --> 01:11:21,690
and and I suspect the text for quick is

1290
01:11:18,690 --> 01:11:23,730
going to be the correct text for quick

1291
01:11:21,690 --> 01:11:25,559
because the stuff in this document is

1292
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:27,809
fairly generic in transport and I think

1293
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:28,860
it's stable but this is why we would

1294
01:11:27,810 --> 01:11:30,720
like to coordinate the wicking route

1295
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,250
last call with quick the details of that

1296
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,860
are in creek itself because that's where

1297
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:38,250
it belongs so I hope there's no real

1298
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:39,900
dependency either way but we want to

1299
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:49,170
align these two to make sure that they

1300
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:50,940
really publish together yeah I have I

1301
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:52,470
have trouble believing that anything

1302
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:56,790
will change at this point is gonna have

1303
01:11:52,470 --> 01:11:57,360
any impact on an MP Dietl thank you that

1304
01:11:56,790 --> 01:12:00,570
was useful

1305
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:01,710
okay David and that's it do you want to

1306
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,469
ask any other questions to the work new

1307
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:07,860
part kind of sit down I think you can

1308
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:09,270
sit down well we will probably expect a

1309
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:12,360
little last call on the strap in your

1310
01:12:09,270 --> 01:12:13,910
future you want to get some reviewers I

1311
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,710
[Music]

1312
01:12:13,910 --> 01:12:18,630
cannot I'll last does anybody wish to

1313
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:19,770
review this and could raise their hand

1314
01:12:18,630 --> 01:12:33,690
because it would help us with the

1315
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:35,250
process Martin oh yeah if it see what

1316
01:12:33,690 --> 01:12:37,830
it'll they might have both volunteered

1317
01:12:35,250 --> 01:12:39,240
but they did anybody else wish to review

1318
01:12:37,830 --> 01:12:40,380
this of course this will be a review

1319
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:42,780
where we're looking for comments for

1320
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:44,640
anybody in the working group we think

1321
01:12:42,780 --> 01:12:47,610
this is a useful thing to do please read

1322
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:49,170
it it's we accept comments on saying on

1323
01:12:47,610 --> 01:12:51,269
any part of the document even

1324
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:53,670
readability so please read the document

1325
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:55,890
thank you okay so I'm gonna know Martin

1326
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:57,930
Duke and Ian sweat is having volunteered

1327
01:12:55,890 --> 01:12:59,460
to review so we'll get least to work

1328
01:12:57,930 --> 01:13:02,210
best core reviews thank you thank you

1329
01:12:59,460 --> 01:13:02,210
very much both here

1330
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:17,250
okay now let's see we're gonna have to

1331
01:13:10,630 --> 01:13:17,250
go hang on push that button go back here

1332
01:13:19,290 --> 01:13:31,210
alright so I don't believe we have

1333
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:32,949
slides for this this next item we saw

1334
01:13:31,210 --> 01:13:39,880
I'm gonna put up the piece of the agenda

1335
01:13:32,949 --> 01:13:41,230
this is 4.4 apparently let's see Nagesh

1336
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:43,750
you're on I'm gonna push the red button

1337
01:13:41,230 --> 01:13:53,369
and maybe you can say a little bit about

1338
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:53,369
the 4895 dis draft anybody out there

1339
01:14:04,860 --> 01:14:15,730
okay sorry let me push the red button

1340
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:22,090
one more time just in case anybody out

1341
01:14:15,730 --> 01:14:23,320
there all right well we will try to pick

1342
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:25,239
this up on Thursday and maybe we'll have

1343
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:28,299
slides there and also let me quick

1344
01:14:25,239 --> 01:14:29,830
quickly apologize it looks like a spell

1345
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:46,139
checker got your last name that will be

1346
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:46,139
fixed okay so next up is nqb yeah well

1347
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:55,199
says he

1348
01:14:48,360 --> 01:14:57,179
to the queue all right from problems I

1349
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:59,099
can't I can't see the queue on my on my

1350
01:14:57,179 --> 01:15:09,719
screen here for some on the screen here

1351
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:14,130
some reason all right let's get the nqb

1352
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:40,020
slides up here it's one of these tabs

1353
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:44,159
which one do we put it in those right on

1354
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:46,020
cue all right okay Nagesh we will pick

1355
01:15:44,159 --> 01:15:47,638
you up after Greggy son speaking in QB

1356
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:55,320
since we've gone to all work to get his

1357
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:56,210
slides up thank you Greg white in

1358
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:01,730
CableLabs

1359
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:04,380
presenting update on the nqb PHP draft

1360
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:10,980
on behalf of also my co-author Thomas

1361
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:13,710
facility from our next slide sort of

1362
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:15,780
small font but this is light I present

1363
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:19,770
one update of a slide I presented last

1364
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:22,050
time the goal of the nqb PHP is to

1365
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:25,350
enable low latency and low loss for

1366
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:27,449
sparse traffic flows and the idea is to

1367
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:29,340
define a code point that describes

1368
01:16:27,449 --> 01:16:32,099
verifiable behavior so it's not a value

1369
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:35,040
judgments not saying that these flows

1370
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:39,540
are or higher priority then in both data

1371
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:43,619
flows or or actually have a little

1372
01:16:39,540 --> 01:16:46,050
latency or little loss sensitive these

1373
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:47,699
two lates your loss truly is about the

1374
01:16:46,050 --> 01:16:50,610
behavior of the application is a sparse

1375
01:16:47,699 --> 01:16:52,888
is it able to coexist with other sparse

1376
01:16:50,610 --> 01:16:55,980
closed it not cause latency when it does

1377
01:16:52,889 --> 01:16:59,280
so so the idea is that there is no

1378
01:16:55,980 --> 01:17:01,639
incentive to miss mark Backus both the

1379
01:16:59,280 --> 01:17:05,620
fact that it's

1380
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:06,830
you cannot indicating the desire for

1381
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,110
priorities

1382
01:17:06,830 --> 01:17:14,240
intended to be verifiable behavior that

1383
01:17:09,110 --> 01:17:15,980
network can can examine and and act on

1384
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:18,889
if it sees behavior that's inconsistent

1385
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:21,320
with the label of non key building so

1386
01:17:18,890 --> 01:17:26,330
the applicability of this that the main

1387
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:29,450
driving use case really is in the l4s

1388
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:33,380
scenario or you have two cues one for

1389
01:17:29,450 --> 01:17:38,030
the l4s flows new congestion control

1390
01:17:33,380 --> 01:17:39,830
flows and that can you know as Bob

1391
01:17:38,030 --> 01:17:41,719
discussed earlier provide altra

1392
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:42,920
low-latency for congestion controlled

1393
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:45,530
applications

1394
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:46,850
didn't identify flows that are not

1395
01:17:45,530 --> 01:17:51,080
congestion control that could coexist

1396
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:54,050
with those l4s flows and then also

1397
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:59,180
potentially for links that have the

1398
01:17:54,050 --> 01:18:01,790
ability to optimize access to the

1399
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:05,270
channel for for sparse traffic a couple

1400
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:07,460
of examples of use cases their cable

1401
01:18:05,270 --> 01:18:10,610
broadband links so we're intending to

1402
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:13,610
support this PHP in what we call Lillian

1403
01:18:10,610 --> 01:18:15,769
t DOCSIS in the near future seen this

1404
01:18:13,610 --> 01:18:17,469
back currently and and products are

1405
01:18:15,770 --> 01:18:20,600
being built that's back currently and

1406
01:18:17,470 --> 01:18:22,580
expect to see that rolling out around

1407
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,150
the world in the next year or so

1408
01:18:22,580 --> 01:18:28,610
also LTE and 5g links there's my

1409
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:31,670
co-authors representing GSM a side of

1410
01:18:28,610 --> 01:18:34,009
this and bringing in use cases there and

1411
01:18:31,670 --> 01:18:37,160
an interest in supporting this PHP as

1412
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:39,290
well on on LTE and Phi G links in terms

1413
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:42,230
of application use cases they're

1414
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:44,510
generally sparse flows of any type

1415
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:47,509
really could label their their packets

1416
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:49,430
is nqb the main ones that that are

1417
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:51,350
driving the development of this are the

1418
01:18:49,430 --> 01:18:54,470
ones that that users care about having

1419
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:56,510
low latency low loss in particular and

1420
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:59,180
focus more on the residential and then

1421
01:18:56,510 --> 01:19:01,940
user environments rather than enterprise

1422
01:18:59,180 --> 01:19:03,910
Varmus so gaming both the traditional

1423
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:07,549
multiplayer online games as well as the

1424
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:09,230
cloud gaming applications mainly for the

1425
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:13,160
uplink side of that which is low data

1426
01:19:09,230 --> 01:19:16,990
rate traffic on the upstream and also

1427
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,990
voice over IP and voice chat kind of

1428
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:24,290
so status here is I presented this the

1429
01:19:21,620 --> 01:19:28,870
last GSP working group meeting last ITF

1430
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:32,540
and I was adopted after that meeting

1431
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:34,160
immediately after adoption one of the

1432
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:35,900
chairs requested that some edits be made

1433
01:19:34,160 --> 01:19:41,349
prior to uploading it as working group

1434
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:45,530
draft there were four items there I

1435
01:19:41,350 --> 01:19:46,310
think we can move on so continuing the

1436
01:19:45,530 --> 01:19:47,780
status

1437
01:19:46,310 --> 01:19:50,180
there were additionally some mailing

1438
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:53,059
list comments about the individual draft

1439
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:56,360
around the adoption and then shortly

1440
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:58,460
after he had made option in particular a

1441
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:01,480
couple of kind of structural comments on

1442
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:03,500
the drafted that it the individual draft

1443
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:06,339
wasn't really written like a PHP

1444
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:09,650
definition it was written more as a

1445
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:10,910
motivation for a PHP and included a

1446
01:20:09,650 --> 01:20:14,349
section on comparison to other

1447
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:17,269
approaches also those comment that the

1448
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:20,150
suggested district code point of 2a

1449
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:22,910
would likely get bleached at ISP ingress

1450
01:20:20,150 --> 01:20:25,429
and a suggestion for another code point

1451
01:20:22,910 --> 01:20:27,290
that might survive the response to that

1452
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:30,890
was maybe that's actually a feature or

1453
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:32,930
not a bug and ISPs that have the ability

1454
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:34,910
to support the PSB

1455
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:38,390
in their network and provide that

1456
01:20:34,910 --> 01:20:40,550
service to their customers and can

1457
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:43,460
actively disable bleaching for that code

1458
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:46,460
point and and get the benefit and those

1459
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:48,650
that don't have such a an ability in

1460
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:51,590
their network maybe it's okay they they

1461
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:53,389
bleach it you know there's also some

1462
01:20:51,590 --> 01:20:54,560
concern some is probably an

1463
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:56,210
understatement concern about the

1464
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,580
interoperability with Wi-Fi both on the

1465
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:01,640
enterprise side and residential I've got

1466
01:20:58,580 --> 01:21:04,390
a slide later on that gets into that so

1467
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:07,940
finally understand us up uploaded the

1468
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:09,860
initial working group draft just at the

1469
01:21:07,940 --> 01:21:12,080
deadline for this meeting included those

1470
01:21:09,860 --> 01:21:14,780
four items that the Dave black had

1471
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:18,040
requested as well as restructuring the

1472
01:21:14,780 --> 01:21:20,570
draft to be more in line with PHP draft

1473
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,019
expectations next

1474
01:21:20,570 --> 01:21:24,410
[Music]

1475
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:28,980
so increment of what the PHP is

1476
01:21:24,410 --> 01:21:31,530
requirements that are in the draft or or

1477
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:33,120
these and just a start off to say this

1478
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:36,179
this is not intended to be a guaranteed

1479
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:38,599
service it's not it's not debt net this

1480
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:42,360
is providing and you again focused on

1481
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:45,540
residential applications and providing a

1482
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:49,219
benefit to these sports sports flows but

1483
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:53,250
not not scheduling access for them

1484
01:21:49,220 --> 01:21:54,720
specifically in providing guarantees if

1485
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:58,770
one must statement and the rest are all

1486
01:21:54,720 --> 01:22:00,630
should I think some of these are under

1487
01:21:58,770 --> 01:22:02,310
debate as to should they be something

1488
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:04,830
stronger than I should and should they

1489
01:22:02,310 --> 01:22:07,260
be must and it's up to the working group

1490
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:09,750
I just to reach a consensus on that the

1491
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:12,960
must statement is that a node that

1492
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:14,790
supports this PHP must cue the nqb

1493
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,730
traffic separate from the QB from the

1494
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:21,269
cue building traffic and then it should

1495
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:22,769
that follow that or that the nqv traffic

1496
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:24,300
should not be rate limited or really

1497
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,130
separately from the cue building traffic

1498
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:29,760
of equivalent importance and that term

1499
01:22:26,130 --> 01:22:33,120
is defined a little bit later on next

1500
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:34,350
one is we should give equal priority to

1501
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:36,349
these two classes of traffic

1502
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:40,020
assuming they have equivalent importance

1503
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:41,340
and then the next bullet is almost the

1504
01:22:40,020 --> 01:22:42,840
same think of maybe leborgne a little

1505
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:45,060
bit more specific should provide a

1506
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,820
scheduler that allows these two classes

1507
01:22:45,060 --> 01:22:50,190
of traffic to share the link in a fair

1508
01:22:47,820 --> 01:22:52,730
manner and provides an example of a

1509
01:22:50,190 --> 01:22:55,019
scheduler that they could do that and

1510
01:22:52,730 --> 01:22:56,849
then finally get to the definition of

1511
01:22:55,020 --> 01:23:00,390
what it means to have equivalent

1512
01:22:56,850 --> 01:23:03,300
importance should treat traffic mortgage

1513
01:23:00,390 --> 01:23:05,610
defaults so DCP 0 as cue building

1514
01:23:03,300 --> 01:23:11,160
traffic having equivalent importance to

1515
01:23:05,610 --> 01:23:13,370
the nqb more traffic then should have a

1516
01:23:11,160 --> 01:23:15,300
buffer for the end qbq that is

1517
01:23:13,370 --> 01:23:20,010
significantly smaller than the cue

1518
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:21,780
building traffic gets and finally should

1519
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:24,120
support this mechanism that the draft

1520
01:23:21,780 --> 01:23:25,710
talks about called formerly called queue

1521
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:28,760
protection now called traffic protection

1522
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:31,560
and they this gets back to that

1523
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:34,680
verifiable application behavior

1524
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:36,060
verifiable traffic behavior an algorithm

1525
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:38,010
that can monitor the flow

1526
01:23:36,060 --> 01:23:40,200
that are entering that non cue building

1527
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:42,060
cue verify that they actually are non

1528
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,389
cue building they're not causing cue

1529
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:47,790
growth and causes agency and if they are

1530
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:50,220
redirect them to the class acuity that

1531
01:23:47,790 --> 01:23:51,930
cue building cue we have an example of

1532
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:55,800
an algorithm that we're using in low

1533
01:23:51,930 --> 01:23:59,310
latency DOCSIS that's provided in the in

1534
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,020
the draft the only requirement to just

1535
01:23:59,310 --> 01:24:03,090
requirement around that is it should be

1536
01:24:01,020 --> 01:24:05,010
objective and verifiable based on the

1537
01:24:03,090 --> 01:24:08,340
flow behavior not on application layered

1538
01:24:05,010 --> 01:24:10,820
constructs question David Brock speaking

1539
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:14,880
from the floor again about the very last

1540
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:17,400
bullet here there's an open should

1541
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,960
versus must but I want to make a couple

1542
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:22,049
want to make something else clear about

1543
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,050
that which is it is possible that the

1544
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:30,210
word node in that very last requirement

1545
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:32,130
might be able to be removed because one

1546
01:24:30,210 --> 01:24:34,320
possibility is to do what DOCSIS has

1547
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:36,990
done and and to have a function that

1548
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:40,530
operates at the node level to evict Q

1549
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:42,150
building traffic from from an QB q 2aq

1550
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:44,370
where it would wear it go ahead and

1551
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:47,129
build a queue and the other is that you

1552
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:50,309
might be able to bring some form of

1553
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:54,000
admission control and edge classifying

1554
01:24:50,310 --> 01:24:56,910
and filtering to bear on this the

1555
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,220
concern is that if you don't have what's

1556
01:24:56,910 --> 01:25:01,710
called traffic action over a property of

1557
01:24:59,220 --> 01:25:07,850
the pH B this starts to look an awful

1558
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:10,350
lot like an awful lot like EF okay I

1559
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:13,470
think I agree that that may be something

1560
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:15,680
that can be made more flexible certainly

1561
01:25:13,470 --> 01:25:19,320
the node that supporting the PHP has

1562
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:23,970
better visibility into what traffic is

1563
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:27,450
causing queuing and and and likely has

1564
01:25:23,970 --> 01:25:29,490
it has more higher fidelity in terms of

1565
01:25:27,450 --> 01:25:34,110
traffic protection but it may not be the

1566
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:37,959
only place yeah it's good just wanted to

1567
01:25:34,110 --> 01:25:41,900
come back on the thing about node

1568
01:25:37,959 --> 01:25:43,340
in order to be verifiable yeah to know

1569
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:44,780
whether it's building a cure it sort of

1570
01:25:43,340 --> 01:25:47,479
has to be on the node that has the cue

1571
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:51,469
that's that's sort of the point about

1572
01:25:47,479 --> 01:25:53,059
verifiability so it's um it's a bit it's

1573
01:25:51,469 --> 01:25:56,829
different to the diffs of architecture

1574
01:25:53,059 --> 01:26:00,590
where you can have edge traffic

1575
01:25:56,829 --> 01:26:02,449
protection or policing because they're

1576
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:04,070
you're policing against a contract and

1577
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:09,228
we're not talking about a contract here

1578
01:26:04,070 --> 01:26:12,259
I still think there's I still think that

1579
01:26:09,229 --> 01:26:14,900
there's some flexibility possible here

1580
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:16,639
and this this is more of just a justjust

1581
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:18,228
just a heads up more adventure come on

1582
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:22,400
that but on on that last item

1583
01:26:18,229 --> 01:26:24,260
you ready yeah please use the list to

1584
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:26,179
talk about this because I'm we only just

1585
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:29,199
adopted it so there's plenty of time to

1586
01:26:26,179 --> 01:26:32,150
talk about it you have to continue yep

1587
01:26:29,199 --> 01:26:34,129
so what is a non-key building flow so I

1588
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:35,570
already mentioned a couple of times it's

1589
01:26:34,130 --> 01:26:38,199
non congestion control so it's not

1590
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:40,639
seeking the capacity of the link it's

1591
01:26:38,199 --> 01:26:45,379
typically application limited low data

1592
01:26:40,639 --> 01:26:47,150
rate sparse flows by labeling itself as

1593
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:48,559
non queue building its claiming that

1594
01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:51,320
it's not going to cause a queue and that

1595
01:26:48,559 --> 01:26:53,900
in the network so it's expecting to

1596
01:26:51,320 --> 01:26:58,249
remain below the available capacity in

1597
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:59,869
the path and if it eventually does cause

1598
01:26:58,249 --> 01:27:02,630
you build up it's going to suffer

1599
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:06,380
potentially some consequences for doing

1600
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:08,659
that in the l4s architecture if queue

1601
01:27:06,380 --> 01:27:10,639
protection is supported actually not

1602
01:27:08,659 --> 01:27:16,339
necessarily specifically to l for us but

1603
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:17,840
in a dual queue device or a device

1604
01:27:16,340 --> 01:27:20,479
support in the PHP that has queue

1605
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:23,510
protection or traffic protection this

1606
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:27,079
result in the MIS marked packets getting

1607
01:27:23,510 --> 01:27:28,610
reclassified into the other queue so

1608
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:30,438
they may see higher latency as a result

1609
01:27:28,610 --> 01:27:32,449
of that they may arrive out of order

1610
01:27:30,439 --> 01:27:34,010
because that decision may be done on a

1611
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:38,030
packet by packet basis rather than a

1612
01:27:34,010 --> 01:27:39,349
flow by flow basis in LTE and Phi G I

1613
01:27:38,030 --> 01:27:42,320
think there's still some discussion

1614
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:45,889
within a GSM a on how exactly to

1615
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:48,499
configure this on those links I think in

1616
01:27:45,889 --> 01:27:51,280
some of those configurations a miss mark

1617
01:27:48,499 --> 01:27:53,160
flow would see higher loss

1618
01:27:51,280 --> 01:27:55,570
in others it may have the exact same

1619
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:57,430
ramifications as I would listed above

1620
01:27:55,570 --> 01:28:03,009
higher latency potentially and out of

1621
01:27:57,430 --> 01:28:06,220
order delivery all right subject to

1622
01:28:03,010 --> 01:28:08,230
Wi-Fi so this has been quite a bit of

1623
01:28:06,220 --> 01:28:10,930
discussion on the mailing list about how

1624
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:13,870
this works with Wi-Fi the first point

1625
01:28:10,930 --> 01:28:17,950
Wi-Fi can be a bottleneck and so support

1626
01:28:13,870 --> 01:28:20,710
for this nqb on Wi-Fi links is highly

1627
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:23,019
desirable and particularly ISPs that are

1628
01:28:20,710 --> 01:28:24,490
intending to roll this out for their

1629
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:28,350
broadband customers want to make sure

1630
01:28:24,490 --> 01:28:30,670
that the benefits that come from

1631
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:32,980
segregating on queue building traffic on

1632
01:28:30,670 --> 01:28:35,320
the axis network link are not lost when

1633
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:38,830
that traffic goes across a Wi-Fi link in

1634
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:41,530
home so a future Wi-Fi equipment could

1635
01:28:38,830 --> 01:28:45,850
support the nqb PhD requirement says

1636
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:48,519
there written I believe but current

1637
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:49,230
Wi-Fi equipment does not so what can we

1638
01:28:48,520 --> 01:28:53,080
do

1639
01:28:49,230 --> 01:28:55,990
so Wi-Fi ayo to 11 essentially supports

1640
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:58,720
4 qs background best-effort video and

1641
01:28:55,990 --> 01:29:01,240
voice the vast majority of traffic in

1642
01:28:58,720 --> 01:29:03,670
residential situations uses the best

1643
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:07,269
effort access category the others are

1644
01:29:03,670 --> 01:29:09,430
lightly used or nearly unused so this

1645
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:11,530
you must queue separately requirement

1646
01:29:09,430 --> 01:29:14,070
seems like it's sort of possible there

1647
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:17,710
at least multiple queues to choose from

1648
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:19,599
but by default they are statistically

1649
01:29:17,710 --> 01:29:21,940
prioritized so voice is the highest

1650
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,580
priority over video over best effort

1651
01:29:21,940 --> 01:29:26,320
over background so the the should

1652
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:29,410
requirement of giving equal priority is

1653
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:32,200
a little bit harder to implement on

1654
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:33,790
existing Wi-Fi equipment some options

1655
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:35,200
that have been discussed one of them is

1656
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:37,740
to use one of the other access

1657
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:40,410
categories so you get the queuing

1658
01:29:37,740 --> 01:29:42,910
separate from the best effort traffic

1659
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:44,920
and configure the channel access

1660
01:29:42,910 --> 01:29:47,830
parameters edca parameters for that

1661
01:29:44,920 --> 01:29:49,060
access category to match the parameters

1662
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:53,710
that are used for best effort so

1663
01:29:49,060 --> 01:29:55,660
eliminating the priority over access

1664
01:29:53,710 --> 01:29:57,640
category is chosen and the pan best

1665
01:29:55,660 --> 01:30:01,599
effort and that's a configuration that

1666
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:05,960
is tested by WFA for all of the Wi-Fi

1667
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:07,850
certified equipment so

1668
01:30:05,960 --> 01:30:10,610
at least all equipment does support that

1669
01:30:07,850 --> 01:30:12,380
configuration I think the test point of

1670
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:14,240
the test case for that configuration

1671
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:17,810
probably leaves a bit to be desired in

1672
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:20,870
terms of actually verifying that that

1673
01:30:17,810 --> 01:30:24,200
they do get exactly equal priority but

1674
01:30:20,870 --> 01:30:28,610
unless it it is the potential option

1675
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:31,820
more likely useful for a Wi-Fi AP that

1676
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:33,860
is deployed by the ISP where they have

1677
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:38,870
control over those EDC parameters

1678
01:30:33,860 --> 01:30:42,250
probably not quite as useful for an AP

1679
01:30:38,870 --> 01:30:45,260
that is customer owned and operated and

1680
01:30:42,250 --> 01:30:51,080
what the user may not be able to adjust

1681
01:30:45,260 --> 01:30:53,960
those parameters or understand the need

1682
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,940
for doing so second option is to use the

1683
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:58,280
video access category which again is

1684
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:59,900
higher priority than best effort but do

1685
01:30:58,280 --> 01:31:02,690
something to make sure that the traffic

1686
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:07,240
that is marked as nqb and as using that

1687
01:31:02,690 --> 01:31:11,360
access category remains sparse so that

1688
01:31:07,240 --> 01:31:14,120
best-effort traffic is not unduly harmed

1689
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:17,030
by the presence of low data rate traffic

1690
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:19,070
in the video access category and then

1691
01:31:17,030 --> 01:31:22,700
also don't expect traffic protection on

1692
01:31:19,070 --> 01:31:24,110
these Wi-Fi ApS so yes you can choose a

1693
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:26,870
different access category to put this

1694
01:31:24,110 --> 01:31:29,389
nqb traffic in but it's not solely for

1695
01:31:26,870 --> 01:31:33,530
nqb traffic any application could mark

1696
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:35,150
its packets and to use the same access

1697
01:31:33,530 --> 01:31:38,809
category could be queue building traffic

1698
01:31:35,150 --> 01:31:42,080
so nothing's guaranteed so some caution

1699
01:31:38,810 --> 01:31:43,930
is needed for using you're trying to

1700
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:50,120
configure existing Wi-Fi networks to

1701
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:52,550
give the benefits of nqb without

1702
01:31:50,120 --> 01:31:56,599
fundamental changes to the software on

1703
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:58,990
those devices and I guess caution both

1704
01:31:56,600 --> 01:32:03,020
from their respective of the operator in

1705
01:31:58,990 --> 01:32:04,790
may be managing the traffic that uses a

1706
01:32:03,020 --> 01:32:07,880
different code point from best effort

1707
01:32:04,790 --> 01:32:10,820
and also may be setting expectations for

1708
01:32:07,880 --> 01:32:13,730
customers that this is not the

1709
01:32:10,820 --> 01:32:15,380
performance this is not guaranteed so

1710
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:17,360
the open question as to what the draft

1711
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:18,740
but more the draft should say to ensure

1712
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,660
that that caution is you

1713
01:32:18,740 --> 01:32:23,290
used there's some text that was quoted

1714
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:26,420
from RFC 83 25 which talks about

1715
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:29,510
interactions of diffserv and and wmm

1716
01:32:26,420 --> 01:32:30,890
Wi-Fi multimedia it looks like pretty

1717
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:33,800
good text me we could pull some of that

1718
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:37,400
into this draft an open question is is

1719
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:39,350
that sufficient that leads to the next

1720
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:42,740
slide I see a couple is this a

1721
01:32:39,350 --> 01:32:45,980
clarification I just thought it's

1722
01:32:42,740 --> 01:32:48,650
worthwhile to note that I think there is

1723
01:32:45,980 --> 01:32:51,650
some Wi-Fi equipment that can already

1724
01:32:48,650 --> 01:32:55,040
meet the nqv requirements with that

1725
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:56,740
possible make jonathan was pretty close

1726
01:32:55,040 --> 01:33:01,610
to it

1727
01:32:56,740 --> 01:33:03,469
okay Thomson Morton here I thought it

1728
01:33:01,610 --> 01:33:05,299
worthwhile to note that I think there is

1729
01:33:03,470 --> 01:33:08,570
some Wi-Fi equipment that can already

1730
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:11,000
meet the nqp requirements but without

1731
01:33:08,570 --> 01:33:15,380
eating to recognize the actual code

1732
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:26,030
point and this is things like ass 9k and

1733
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:28,540
ass 10k and I think MT 76 when driven

1734
01:33:26,030 --> 01:33:33,650
through a recent version of Linux

1735
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:39,980
because they implement FQ Caudell on a

1736
01:33:33,650 --> 01:33:41,420
per station basis and let's see airtime

1737
01:33:39,980 --> 01:33:45,500
fairness and things like that

1738
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:51,250
okay enough below also it's a useful

1739
01:33:45,500 --> 01:33:55,370
data point I think Andrew McGregor the

1740
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:59,270
Wi-Fi max behavior varies in many other

1741
01:33:55,370 --> 01:34:00,860
parameters between these cues so for

1742
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:04,010
example you would not want to put m QB

1743
01:34:00,860 --> 01:34:05,839
in QB traffic in the vo q because it

1744
01:34:04,010 --> 01:34:09,890
also changes the aggregate building and

1745
01:34:05,840 --> 01:34:12,560
many other things and so will demolish

1746
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:15,590
the performance of the network if you do

1747
01:34:12,560 --> 01:34:18,320
so I think in QB and the Wi-Fi queuing

1748
01:34:15,590 --> 01:34:20,420
are kind of orthogonal which seems to

1749
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:23,080
indicate that we probably actually want

1750
01:34:20,420 --> 01:34:26,690
more than one in QB k brain

1751
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:28,010
unfortunately because you're likely

1752
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:32,139
don't want to distinguish between Q

1753
01:34:28,010 --> 01:34:32,140
building and not traffic in the VI q

1754
01:34:32,149 --> 01:34:39,860
40 this is diffserv no problem well yes

1755
01:34:37,099 --> 01:34:41,629
exactly but just saying that that there

1756
01:34:39,860 --> 01:34:42,619
are other characteristics that are

1757
01:34:41,629 --> 01:34:43,879
different between these that the

1758
01:34:42,619 --> 01:34:47,929
aggregate building parameters are

1759
01:34:43,879 --> 01:34:49,969
different the vo q can't build

1760
01:34:47,929 --> 01:34:52,820
aggregates and therefore is much less

1761
01:34:49,969 --> 01:34:54,919
efficient on the wire on that on the

1762
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:58,249
medium and that's that's due to

1763
01:34:54,919 --> 01:34:59,989
configuration where the TX up size exit

1764
01:34:58,249 --> 01:35:02,228
that those configuration changing that

1765
01:34:59,989 --> 01:35:08,360
configuration is not meaningful because

1766
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:12,189
much hardware can't do it we need to

1767
01:35:08,360 --> 01:35:16,159
move on fairly quickly here if we can so

1768
01:35:12,189 --> 01:35:20,749
alright so that leads into the diff sort

1769
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:22,969
of code point recommendation so in Wi-Fi

1770
01:35:20,749 --> 01:35:24,709
is an important factor here and also

1771
01:35:22,969 --> 01:35:26,389
keep mine this is talking about

1772
01:35:24,709 --> 01:35:29,059
residential Wi-Fi and not enterprise

1773
01:35:26,389 --> 01:35:31,610
Wi-Fi where today there is not a lot of

1774
01:35:29,059 --> 01:35:35,079
usage of the other access categories

1775
01:35:31,610 --> 01:35:38,268
besides best-effort so by default

1776
01:35:35,079 --> 01:35:39,860
residential APs and stations use the IP

1777
01:35:38,269 --> 01:35:42,260
precedence bist so that the top three

1778
01:35:39,860 --> 01:35:44,598
bits of the the code point district o

1779
01:35:42,260 --> 01:35:47,599
point to select the access category

1780
01:35:44,599 --> 01:35:52,999
default tables is given there on the

1781
01:35:47,599 --> 01:35:55,209
right so choosing a code point and you

1782
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:59,320
know that that maps into one of these

1783
01:35:55,209 --> 01:36:02,719
access categories could help make things

1784
01:35:59,320 --> 01:36:05,449
work for at least as well as they can

1785
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:07,399
with existing Wi-Fi equipment there was

1786
01:36:05,449 --> 01:36:09,919
a feature in 802 11 called cross map

1787
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:11,329
which defined which allows the AP to

1788
01:36:09,919 --> 01:36:14,689
define a different mapping of code

1789
01:36:11,329 --> 01:36:16,039
points in to access categories my

1790
01:36:14,689 --> 01:36:19,219
understanding is that that is not

1791
01:36:16,039 --> 01:36:21,018
mandatory for wf8 certifications so

1792
01:36:19,219 --> 01:36:24,860
there's an open question as to whether

1793
01:36:21,019 --> 01:36:27,590
that's supported on on stations or even

1794
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:29,209
on 180s I don't have any data on that

1795
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:32,149
but it'd be interesting to know if

1796
01:36:29,209 --> 01:36:34,579
that's an option to affect that that

1797
01:36:32,149 --> 01:36:38,030
mapping on residential Wi-Fi networks

1798
01:36:34,579 --> 01:36:42,829
and then there's been some discussion

1799
01:36:38,030 --> 01:36:44,869
about you know the safety of of putting

1800
01:36:42,829 --> 01:36:45,740
nqb traffic on a different code point

1801
01:36:44,869 --> 01:36:47,690
and what happen

1802
01:36:45,740 --> 01:36:49,340
if it's there isn't this traffic

1803
01:36:47,690 --> 01:36:52,580
protection function and you've got a

1804
01:36:49,340 --> 01:36:56,210
Miss marked flow that's actually a boat

1805
01:36:52,580 --> 01:36:58,250
traffic that could swamp out my sex I

1806
01:36:56,210 --> 01:37:02,960
put on the video access carry that could

1807
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:04,160
swap out best ever traffic and a couple

1808
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,470
of points there so one is on the

1809
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:08,540
downlink direction so from the isp into

1810
01:37:06,470 --> 01:37:11,150
the users home network and the isp could

1811
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:12,860
certainly remark that traffic they could

1812
01:37:11,150 --> 01:37:17,269
also perform some other functions

1813
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:20,750
potentially to monitor the volume of

1814
01:37:17,270 --> 01:37:23,660
that traffic and remarket if needed and

1815
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:26,900
then on but on the upstream side so

1816
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:31,340
uplink traffic from end stations you

1817
01:37:26,900 --> 01:37:33,019
know game consoles and pcs that option

1818
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,190
isn't available right so so we need to

1819
01:37:33,020 --> 01:37:36,890
pay a code point that works well for

1820
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:38,629
those uplink applications and I think

1821
01:37:36,890 --> 01:37:41,900
that's not it's not been controversial

1822
01:37:38,630 --> 01:37:44,540
at least that I've seen to recommend a

1823
01:37:41,900 --> 01:37:46,250
code point that maps to the video access

1824
01:37:44,540 --> 01:37:49,370
category for uplink traffic it's really

1825
01:37:46,250 --> 01:37:51,260
this downlink question of who's ensuring

1826
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:53,269
that that it's that the traffic remains

1827
01:37:51,260 --> 01:37:55,310
for us in the downlink direction coming

1828
01:37:53,270 --> 01:37:58,010
from the ISP so the graph currently

1829
01:37:55,310 --> 01:37:59,690
recommends a code point to a that it is

1830
01:37:58,010 --> 01:38:01,550
a currently unassigned pool one code

1831
01:37:59,690 --> 01:38:03,259
point that could be assigned for this it

1832
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:05,480
does map to that video access category

1833
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:07,190
on residential Wi-Fi there are a few

1834
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:11,120
alternative proposals on the mailing

1835
01:38:07,190 --> 01:38:15,019
list one from Sebastian molar suggesting

1836
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:18,099
two different code points six I think

1837
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:23,480
for traffic going across interconnects

1838
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:25,040
and to e4 at the ISP would map at a 2e

1839
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:27,769
before it goes into the home network and

1840
01:38:25,040 --> 01:38:31,790
potentially to e for upstream traffic as

1841
01:38:27,770 --> 01:38:33,530
well I think that was a bit unclear - we

1842
01:38:31,790 --> 01:38:36,110
actually already assigned to expedited

1843
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:39,440
forwarding so I'm not sure why that was

1844
01:38:36,110 --> 01:38:43,000
- isn't over to a value 7 was also

1845
01:38:39,440 --> 01:38:45,410
mentioned that's unfortunately a pool to

1846
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,120
the first District code point so it's

1847
01:38:45,410 --> 01:38:51,980
signed for local use not for standard

1848
01:38:47,120 --> 01:38:54,110
action right yeah and then one was also

1849
01:38:51,980 --> 01:38:56,209
suggested primarily for enterprise

1850
01:38:54,110 --> 01:38:57,490
environments enterprise Wi-Fi

1851
01:38:56,210 --> 01:38:58,790
environments

1852
01:38:57,490 --> 01:39:01,700
[Music]

1853
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:05,090
that's also already assigned to another

1854
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:08,660
use three discussion here is going to

1855
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:09,980
continue on the list I'll point out that

1856
01:39:08,660 --> 01:39:11,960
one of the things that happened on the

1857
01:39:09,980 --> 01:39:14,780
list is I speak idli mark downlink

1858
01:39:11,960 --> 01:39:16,460
traffic looks like the looks like the

1859
01:39:14,780 --> 01:39:18,290
most important defense here if you don't

1860
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:19,790
know what the Wi-Fi is gonna do don't

1861
01:39:18,290 --> 01:39:23,060
send it stuff it's going to do bad

1862
01:39:19,790 --> 01:39:24,410
things with and I owe a note to the list

1863
01:39:23,060 --> 01:39:25,880
Greg and I had interesting especially

1864
01:39:24,410 --> 01:39:30,650
this morning that might close out the

1865
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:32,030
rest of Sebastian's concern so let's Bob

1866
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:33,799
would prefer not to have a discussion

1867
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:36,380
here if we can avoid one because we we

1868
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:40,670
are we we are into negative time at this

1869
01:39:36,380 --> 01:39:42,820
point so you get one quick remark yes I

1870
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:45,410
just wonder whether we ought to be

1871
01:39:42,820 --> 01:39:46,639
agreeing the requirements for what Co

1872
01:39:45,410 --> 01:39:48,860
point to use rather than just keep

1873
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:52,250
sending send that note to the list

1874
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:54,860
please we can have discussion there okay

1875
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:57,140
next slide last slide just lists the

1876
01:39:54,860 --> 01:39:59,210
open items these are listed directly in

1877
01:39:57,140 --> 01:40:01,100
the draft as well so obviously no time

1878
01:39:59,210 --> 01:40:02,720
for discussion on those but that's what

1879
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:05,180
the bailing was just for so yeah please

1880
01:40:02,720 --> 01:40:07,000
take to the mailing list and maybe at

1881
01:40:05,180 --> 01:40:09,890
the next one we would like to know

1882
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:12,020
reasons why you would choose a good dscp

1883
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:13,970
code point and reasons why you choose a

1884
01:40:12,020 --> 01:40:16,670
bad one and hopefully we home in pretty

1885
01:40:13,970 --> 01:40:18,650
quickly on the one we want they must be

1886
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:23,500
IETF assigned I'm not used by something

1887
01:40:18,650 --> 01:40:28,160
else okay do we have slides from nagesh

1888
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:39,710
all right let's go see if we can find

1889
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:47,660
them probably should we watch hang on

1890
01:40:39,710 --> 01:40:49,970
yeah I gotta hit reload I think you just

1891
01:40:47,660 --> 01:40:52,580
you may just dismiss and I guess you

1892
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:58,070
need to rejoin the queue now and then

1893
01:40:52,580 --> 01:40:59,360
unmute yourself yeah alright okay I've

1894
01:40:58,070 --> 01:41:01,660
decided during the queue and I hit the

1895
01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:01,660
button

1896
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:14,420
all right hang on we'll try this again

1897
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:24,599
hello okay we finally got it good

1898
01:41:19,950 --> 01:41:27,960
afternoon all its negation today I want

1899
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:30,330
to present the the changes of which we

1900
01:41:27,960 --> 01:41:33,540
think should be done for the RFC for

1901
01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:36,260
igniting fight and and the changes are

1902
01:41:33,540 --> 01:41:38,930
motivated based on the implementation of

1903
01:41:36,260 --> 01:41:43,970
RFC for eight nine five

1904
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:48,750
RFC to implement a DPL s over HTTP for

1905
01:41:43,970 --> 01:41:50,970
our products the first point which I

1906
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:53,610
want to mention here is with respect to

1907
01:41:50,970 --> 01:41:55,470
the earth negotiation procedure the

1908
01:41:53,610 --> 01:41:57,360
current RFC doesn't have any section

1909
01:41:55,470 --> 01:42:00,480
explaining how the negotiation should

1910
01:41:57,360 --> 01:42:04,320
happen if a particular peer doesn't

1911
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:07,139
support it though the the the chance

1912
01:42:04,320 --> 01:42:09,330
that's present in RFC's as upper two

1913
01:42:07,140 --> 01:42:11,490
weeks as one zero so the receiver is

1914
01:42:09,330 --> 01:42:13,050
free to ignore the parameter and go

1915
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:16,769
ahead with the normal establish of the

1916
01:42:13,050 --> 01:42:19,650
Association if a kind support the auth

1917
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:21,600
and server doesn't support it then it so

1918
01:42:19,650 --> 01:42:24,150
the then it gets you into a situation

1919
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:25,890
where the client is assuming that the

1920
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:29,099
connection is in the auth mode whereas a

1921
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:32,520
server isn't and adding to the problem

1922
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:35,400
if a client asks specifically 2:04 to

1923
01:42:32,520 --> 01:42:38,010
include data and sack shank to be sent

1924
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:40,110
in an authenticated way then the server

1925
01:42:38,010 --> 01:42:42,210
would be sending data in in a normal

1926
01:42:40,110 --> 01:42:43,170
mode and the client keeps dropping this

1927
01:42:42,210 --> 01:42:45,330
data forever

1928
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:47,370
so eventually the connection would get

1929
01:42:45,330 --> 01:42:51,230
closed without any meaningful data

1930
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:55,140
transfer that happened between the peers

1931
01:42:51,230 --> 01:42:58,080
the in one of the extra extension RFC's

1932
01:42:55,140 --> 01:43:01,560
a socket AP exchange and as a method for

1933
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:04,769
a client to query to check if the auth

1934
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:07,200
negotiation is successful but the but as

1935
01:43:04,770 --> 01:43:08,580
for me the problem is may not all

1936
01:43:07,200 --> 01:43:12,630
implementation might have implemented

1937
01:43:08,580 --> 01:43:15,960
this extension so there was there's no

1938
01:43:12,630 --> 01:43:18,720
way for the client to know if that earth

1939
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:21,150
has gone through or normally so adding

1940
01:43:18,720 --> 01:43:22,350
this section in the RFC would eventually

1941
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:25,019
clear out all the

1942
01:43:22,350 --> 01:43:27,150
problems and both the end points by the

1943
01:43:25,020 --> 01:43:29,130
time they exchange in it and in attack

1944
01:43:27,150 --> 01:43:31,679
shank would know whether the earth has

1945
01:43:29,130 --> 01:43:33,860
been negotiated successfully between

1946
01:43:31,680 --> 01:43:33,860
them

1947
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:40,100
next slide please the second point which

1948
01:43:37,770 --> 01:43:43,530
I want to mention is with respect to

1949
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:44,790
support for the exchange in parameter it

1950
01:43:43,530 --> 01:43:48,120
would be all know that extension

1951
01:43:44,790 --> 01:43:50,850
parameter was added in RFC 5:06 one and

1952
01:43:48,120 --> 01:43:54,780
earth RFC which is four eight nine five

1953
01:43:50,850 --> 01:43:57,120
was introduced much earlier to that so

1954
01:43:54,780 --> 01:43:59,790
or the for a time fight doesn't ask the

1955
01:43:57,120 --> 01:44:02,990
support for this extension parameter and

1956
01:43:59,790 --> 01:44:06,210
if we see the major implementations like

1957
01:44:02,990 --> 01:44:07,710
LK CTP and FreeBSD FreeBSD doesn't

1958
01:44:06,210 --> 01:44:10,800
mandate the client to send this

1959
01:44:07,710 --> 01:44:13,380
parameter but whereas LK CPP mandates so

1960
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:15,120
if our client which is connecting to lk

1961
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:19,290
CTP server doesn't include this

1962
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:21,510
extension parameter then the serve lk

1963
01:44:19,290 --> 01:44:23,220
CTP server will will drop the connection

1964
01:44:21,510 --> 01:44:25,620
and will not let the connection to go

1965
01:44:23,220 --> 01:44:27,300
through so this forces our client to

1966
01:44:25,620 --> 01:44:29,460
include the supported extension

1967
01:44:27,300 --> 01:44:34,620
parameter even when the client doesn't

1968
01:44:29,460 --> 01:44:37,140
it support RFC 5:06 one so so what I

1969
01:44:34,620 --> 01:44:39,809
feel is we can add this extension

1970
01:44:37,140 --> 01:44:43,560
parameter support for RFC four eight

1971
01:44:39,810 --> 01:44:46,710
nine five which I feel is a desirable

1972
01:44:43,560 --> 01:44:48,300
one and which would probably make most

1973
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:53,040
of the interworking smooth without

1974
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:55,200
having much of the issues the next

1975
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:56,970
optimization of an exchanges which I

1976
01:44:55,200 --> 01:44:59,970
feel should be added to the four eight

1977
01:44:56,970 --> 01:45:02,430
nine five RFC is with respect to the

1978
01:44:59,970 --> 01:45:06,840
support for H Mike identifier if we see

1979
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:09,150
the request chunk for HVAC identifiers

1980
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:11,130
mentions that they can be more than one

1981
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:15,599
H Mike identifier to be present but

1982
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:19,350
whereas the error response supports only

1983
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:22,860
a single H Mike I need for a parameter I

1984
01:45:19,350 --> 01:45:26,310
agree the the current RFC supports only

1985
01:45:22,860 --> 01:45:29,509
sha-1 and short of six as options but in

1986
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:32,210
reality we have much more than these

1987
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:33,330
variants of H map which is available and

1988
01:45:32,210 --> 01:45:35,100
moreover

1989
01:45:33,330 --> 01:45:36,119
sha-1 is something which is already

1990
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:38,340
duplicated

1991
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:41,219
most of the implementations which has to

1992
01:45:38,340 --> 01:45:45,419
shout to physics as default so I feel

1993
01:45:41,219 --> 01:45:48,119
that extending the HVAC identifier error

1994
01:45:45,419 --> 01:45:50,729
caused to include more than one HVAC

1995
01:45:48,119 --> 01:45:53,039
identifier would probably make it easier

1996
01:45:50,729 --> 01:45:55,189
to exchange the RFC in food future

1997
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,869
whenever we have a use case to include

1998
01:45:55,189 --> 01:46:02,340
other variants of HVAC other than the

1999
01:45:57,869 --> 01:46:04,558
sha-1 and sha-256 next please

2000
01:46:02,340 --> 01:46:08,099
the next point is with respect to

2001
01:46:04,559 --> 01:46:10,919
handling of the chunks in the chunks

2002
01:46:08,099 --> 01:46:13,619
parameter which is invalid or unknown to

2003
01:46:10,919 --> 01:46:17,459
the receiver let's say for example the

2004
01:46:13,619 --> 01:46:20,159
client implements a stream reconfigure

2005
01:46:17,459 --> 01:46:23,039
option which is 6 5 - 5 RC and whereas

2006
01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:25,888
the server doesn't implement it and if

2007
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:27,688
the client includes his reconfig chunk

2008
01:46:25,889 --> 01:46:29,369
also as one of the change to be

2009
01:46:27,689 --> 01:46:32,159
authenticated to be sent in an

2010
01:46:29,369 --> 01:46:34,589
authenticated way then the server would

2011
01:46:32,159 --> 01:46:36,919
not be able to understand this reconfig

2012
01:46:34,590 --> 01:46:39,829
chain type in the change parameter and

2013
01:46:36,919 --> 01:46:43,739
the RFC also doesn't explain how to

2014
01:46:39,829 --> 01:46:45,780
address how the server should handle

2015
01:46:43,739 --> 01:46:48,928
such kind of chunks when it receives in

2016
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:53,159
the chunks parameter so adding a section

2017
01:46:48,929 --> 01:46:55,409
in the existing RFC which explains the

2018
01:46:53,159 --> 01:47:01,348
handling would be something which I feel

2019
01:46:55,409 --> 01:47:04,829
is required the next point I it's it's

2020
01:47:01,349 --> 01:47:06,269
more of editorial than issue is with

2021
01:47:04,829 --> 01:47:09,929
respect to the support for the random

2022
01:47:06,269 --> 01:47:12,959
parameter the section 3.1 of the RFC

2023
01:47:09,929 --> 01:47:15,059
mentioned that the random parameter can

2024
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:16,919
be of n bytes but whereas in the

2025
01:47:15,059 --> 01:47:19,829
subsequent section in the for the

2026
01:47:16,919 --> 01:47:22,619
procedure clearly mentions that the

2027
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:26,009
parameter should be of 32 bytes in in

2028
01:47:22,619 --> 01:47:28,739
the context of the current RFC so they

2029
01:47:26,010 --> 01:47:30,809
were couple of doubts which was raised

2030
01:47:28,739 --> 01:47:33,148
on the RFC mailing list for the same

2031
01:47:30,809 --> 01:47:36,419
point which the people who have read the

2032
01:47:33,149 --> 01:47:38,999
RFC got into a inter confusion whether

2033
01:47:36,419 --> 01:47:41,999
it should be a n bytes or a 32 bytes so

2034
01:47:38,999 --> 01:47:44,820
adding a section or a statement saying

2035
01:47:41,999 --> 01:47:47,789
that it should be 32 bytes in the car in

2036
01:47:44,820 --> 01:47:49,650
the context of this RFC would actually

2037
01:47:47,789 --> 01:47:53,880
clear all the doubts

2038
01:47:49,650 --> 01:47:56,429
next night the next point is with

2039
01:47:53,880 --> 01:48:00,330
respect to the formation of the by

2040
01:47:56,430 --> 01:48:02,900
tractor the RFC just says that both the

2041
01:48:00,330 --> 01:48:05,820
client and the server should concatenate

2042
01:48:02,900 --> 01:48:07,860
the parameters random chunks and the

2043
01:48:05,820 --> 01:48:10,380
HVAC algorithm to form the by tractor

2044
01:48:07,860 --> 01:48:14,790
but it doesn't explain the order of

2045
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:17,130
concatenation so there is a there can be

2046
01:48:14,790 --> 01:48:19,710
a possibility where the server and

2047
01:48:17,130 --> 01:48:24,230
client concatenates these parameters in

2048
01:48:19,710 --> 01:48:26,730
a different way so thus creating in a

2049
01:48:24,230 --> 01:48:28,349
situation where but the shade key might

2050
01:48:26,730 --> 01:48:31,320
not be the same the by tractor would not

2051
01:48:28,350 --> 01:48:33,480
be the same so adding a section or a

2052
01:48:31,320 --> 01:48:35,250
statement in the RFC which explains the

2053
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:37,830
order of concatenation of these

2054
01:48:35,250 --> 01:48:42,720
parameters to form the by tractors would

2055
01:48:37,830 --> 01:48:43,470
clarify this doubt thanks very much the

2056
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:46,010
presentation

2057
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:48,600
sorry for the delay in getting you to

2058
01:48:46,010 --> 01:48:50,550
present but we appreciate it actually

2059
01:48:48,600 --> 01:48:54,390
having a presentation thank you for

2060
01:48:50,550 --> 01:48:58,380
preparing this my first sure comment is

2061
01:48:54,390 --> 01:49:00,690
some of these additions you recommend

2062
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:03,120
could actually filed as errata possibly

2063
01:49:00,690 --> 01:49:06,509
and I think that the normal procedure is

2064
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:08,550
to find a file an errata and find if

2065
01:49:06,510 --> 01:49:11,070
this consensus around the errata for the

2066
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:12,900
smaller issues particularly obsolete in

2067
01:49:11,070 --> 01:49:16,590
sha-1 is obviously something we should

2068
01:49:12,900 --> 01:49:18,660
do you know so I think we you need to

2069
01:49:16,590 --> 01:49:20,700
work with the original editors if

2070
01:49:18,660 --> 01:49:23,190
possible but file it Arata for the

2071
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:25,620
things that can be have perhaps have

2072
01:49:23,190 --> 01:49:27,660
filed against them does that seem a

2073
01:49:25,620 --> 01:49:29,550
great starting point and then see what

2074
01:49:27,660 --> 01:49:30,540
else is on the list and we can decide

2075
01:49:29,550 --> 01:49:33,600
what to do next

2076
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:36,390
definitely agree with your comments

2077
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:37,740
thank you and and we would take

2078
01:49:36,390 --> 01:49:39,000
questions now but I think we'll take

2079
01:49:37,740 --> 01:49:41,160
questions on the list because we're

2080
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,960
short of time so thanks very much for

2081
01:49:41,160 --> 01:49:45,750
the presentation yeah thank you

2082
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:47,670
right this is David I think the the deal

2083
01:49:45,750 --> 01:49:51,510
is far the route of the can be filed and

2084
01:49:47,670 --> 01:49:54,360
then work with the other folks in CTP

2085
01:49:51,510 --> 01:49:56,370
community and we can decide probably in

2086
01:49:54,360 --> 01:49:58,950
Vancouver timeframe whether what we want

2087
01:49:56,370 --> 01:50:00,630
to do is for the things that cannot be

2088
01:49:58,950 --> 01:50:02,800
dealt with as errata whether we want to

2089
01:50:00,630 --> 01:50:09,330
go ahead with a weir

2090
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:11,860
in group 4895 bits draft shell okay

2091
01:50:09,330 --> 01:50:13,690
now we're down to two we got two items

2092
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:24,670
left and got it got to figure out which

2093
01:50:13,690 --> 01:50:25,990
one to do we can do that yeah so that's

2094
01:50:24,670 --> 01:50:27,670
what we'll do we'll do Gauri's

2095
01:50:25,990 --> 01:50:29,889
presentation here and we will try to

2096
01:50:27,670 --> 01:50:31,810
find some spare time on Thursday for

2097
01:50:29,890 --> 01:50:33,940
Marcus's presentation he was able to get

2098
01:50:31,810 --> 01:50:36,580
time and I see crg this morning which

2099
01:50:33,940 --> 01:50:40,389
was very helpful for that uh for that

2100
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:55,090
that group all right okay let's even get

2101
01:50:40,390 --> 01:50:56,620
Cory where you so this is me

2102
01:50:55,090 --> 01:50:59,410
I made the slide beliefs I remember I

2103
01:50:56,620 --> 01:51:00,910
was talking about hi I'm Cory Ferris

2104
01:50:59,410 --> 01:51:03,070
talking as an individual this is an

2105
01:51:00,910 --> 01:51:06,430
individual draft that has previously

2106
01:51:03,070 --> 01:51:07,960
been presented in TCP M the reasons that

2107
01:51:06,430 --> 01:51:09,040
might become apparent as we go through

2108
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:12,130
it

2109
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:15,280
this draft targets this working group ts

2110
01:51:12,130 --> 01:51:19,330
bwg with guidelines for how to do

2111
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:21,160
internet congestion control and we do

2112
01:51:19,330 --> 01:51:23,710
have stuff in RFC s that talk about

2113
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:24,910
internet congestion control so I guess

2114
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:25,750
the first question is why do we need

2115
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:33,340
guidelines

2116
01:51:25,750 --> 01:51:35,050
well next slide please or clicker so the

2117
01:51:33,340 --> 01:51:36,910
IETF has actually said quite a bit about

2118
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:39,670
congestion control over the years and

2119
01:51:36,910 --> 01:51:42,550
particularly about not causing

2120
01:51:39,670 --> 01:51:45,430
congestion collapse and there's a jury

2121
01:51:42,550 --> 01:51:47,530
recommendation in RFC 808 5 is to

2122
01:51:45,430 --> 01:51:49,660
leverage existing congestion control

2123
01:51:47,530 --> 01:51:51,940
methods and that was cool when we wrote

2124
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:56,170
the original UDP guides I think quite

2125
01:51:51,940 --> 01:51:58,660
cool then it maybe isn't quite so cool

2126
01:51:56,170 --> 01:52:01,060
at this moment in time when we're seeing

2127
01:51:58,660 --> 01:52:02,740
other transport frameworks emerge that

2128
01:52:01,060 --> 01:52:03,790
actually do have new ways of doing

2129
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:06,550
congestion control

2130
01:52:03,790 --> 01:52:08,620
so when maybe the best advice from the

2131
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:10,840
ITF isn't just go and use one of our

2132
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:12,190
existing congestion controllers please

2133
01:52:10,840 --> 01:52:13,390
do if you don't know how to design a

2134
01:52:12,190 --> 01:52:14,980
congestion controller

2135
01:52:13,390 --> 01:52:16,159
they're pretty difficult but if you know

2136
01:52:14,980 --> 01:52:19,400
how to what guy

2137
01:52:16,159 --> 01:52:22,429
do we have well Jonah and I sat down at

2138
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:24,289
the quick interim in London and had a

2139
01:52:22,429 --> 01:52:26,150
little bit of a chat and we thought I

2140
01:52:24,289 --> 01:52:28,849
said bravely it's probably just about

2141
01:52:26,150 --> 01:52:30,589
four pages of text in in really in

2142
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:32,719
recommendations this isn't too difficult

2143
01:52:30,590 --> 01:52:35,329
and do you want to write down Janet or

2144
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:37,820
do you want me to and Jonah being smart

2145
01:52:35,329 --> 01:52:41,869
said oh you just do that gory and then

2146
01:52:37,820 --> 01:52:43,639
I'll have a look at it um yeah so so I

2147
01:52:41,869 --> 01:52:44,749
read all the RFC's I could find about

2148
01:52:43,639 --> 01:52:46,369
congestion control

2149
01:52:44,749 --> 01:52:49,340
maybe I've missed some so that's always

2150
01:52:46,369 --> 01:52:51,919
a good call and the RFC already say a

2151
01:52:49,340 --> 01:52:54,229
lot of this things we want to say but it

2152
01:52:51,919 --> 01:52:56,150
took more than four pages in fact it

2153
01:52:54,229 --> 01:52:58,909
took four sections but they're not very

2154
01:52:56,150 --> 01:53:00,860
big sections and I produce zero zero

2155
01:52:58,909 --> 01:53:02,808
which you presented previously zero one

2156
01:53:00,860 --> 01:53:05,478
was a slightly more coherent version of

2157
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:08,959
this and then zero two was me fixing the

2158
01:53:05,479 --> 01:53:11,090
annoying typos in zero one zero three

2159
01:53:08,959 --> 01:53:13,610
which is approaching where we are now at

2160
01:53:11,090 --> 01:53:15,199
and I added more text on starvation

2161
01:53:13,610 --> 01:53:18,110
because I think that is an important

2162
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:20,089
thing that protocols have to avoid when

2163
01:53:18,110 --> 01:53:22,070
we design a congestion controller we

2164
01:53:20,090 --> 01:53:25,039
have to avoid starvation and we have to

2165
01:53:22,070 --> 01:53:27,349
avoid congestion collapse and I try to

2166
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:30,169
differentiate these I got feedback from

2167
01:53:27,349 --> 01:53:32,630
various people and I'm calling provided

2168
01:53:30,169 --> 01:53:34,610
feedback on FEC in particular and I said

2169
01:53:32,630 --> 01:53:38,179
yeah yeah we should talk a bit about FEC

2170
01:53:34,610 --> 01:53:39,860
we pointed to RFC five 783 if you don't

2171
01:53:38,179 --> 01:53:42,590
know what it is go look it up it's a

2172
01:53:39,860 --> 01:53:45,380
dressing RFC and then we published zero

2173
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:47,719
four which is where we are today we

2174
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:51,829
published us I published by the IETF as

2175
01:53:47,719 --> 01:53:53,510
an individual the big thing in this

2176
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:57,079
document is section 3 which is

2177
01:53:53,510 --> 01:53:58,969
principles of congestion control and it

2178
01:53:57,079 --> 01:54:01,308
comes across as a number of different

2179
01:53:58,969 --> 01:54:03,050
things that you should understand if

2180
01:54:01,309 --> 01:54:04,760
you're talking about building a new

2181
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:08,050
congestion controller understand these

2182
01:54:04,760 --> 01:54:11,419
things first and then look at these RFC

2183
01:54:08,050 --> 01:54:12,889
principles when you design it and the

2184
01:54:11,419 --> 01:54:15,019
stuff here which I hope is

2185
01:54:12,889 --> 01:54:16,579
non-controversial there's a diversity of

2186
01:54:15,019 --> 01:54:18,380
path characteristics in the internet

2187
01:54:16,579 --> 01:54:20,959
it's actually much more diverse than you

2188
01:54:18,380 --> 01:54:24,189
would ever imagined fluor multiplexing

2189
01:54:20,959 --> 01:54:26,800
and congestion can be annoying

2190
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:29,110
they are not catastrophic but they are

2191
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,789
certainly annoying to users both the

2192
01:54:29,110 --> 01:54:32,499
multiplexing aspect in terms of jitter

2193
01:54:30,789 --> 01:54:34,900
and the congestion in terms of queues

2194
01:54:32,499 --> 01:54:37,269
the most important thing however is to

2195
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:39,789
avoid congestion collapse starvation and

2196
01:54:37,269 --> 01:54:43,840
the variants thereof which block users

2197
01:54:39,789 --> 01:54:45,489
from actually creating new flows and so

2198
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,479
what are the guidelines well there's

2199
01:54:45,489 --> 01:54:49,089
something I'll congest you in

2200
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:52,449
initialization talking about how you

2201
01:54:49,090 --> 01:54:54,400
start up what I want to do an animation

2202
01:54:52,449 --> 01:54:57,219
here it didn't work okay using path

2203
01:54:54,400 --> 01:54:59,499
capacity is another thing and avoiding

2204
01:54:57,219 --> 01:55:01,209
bursts and this mitigation was very

2205
01:54:59,499 --> 01:55:03,849
controversial it's being written in

2206
01:55:01,209 --> 01:55:05,320
RFC's for a while and I think quick

2207
01:55:03,849 --> 01:55:06,969
resisted it for a little while but it's

2208
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:09,669
in there now so everything is all

2209
01:55:06,969 --> 01:55:11,260
hunky-dory and transmitting excessive

2210
01:55:09,669 --> 01:55:13,179
bursts in the network is actually a

2211
01:55:11,260 --> 01:55:15,699
little bit bad for things for good

2212
01:55:13,179 --> 01:55:17,099
reasons and timers and retransmission

2213
01:55:15,699 --> 01:55:19,719
have to be handled very carefully

2214
01:55:17,099 --> 01:55:22,419
because the diversity of things that go

2215
01:55:19,719 --> 01:55:24,699
on along paths responding to potential

2216
01:55:22,419 --> 01:55:28,239
congestion and how you respond to ecn is

2217
01:55:24,699 --> 01:55:30,879
something you must do how well look at

2218
01:55:28,239 --> 01:55:32,829
the guidelines using more capacity than

2219
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:35,800
you're currently using it's something

2220
01:55:32,829 --> 01:55:36,880
that's not as easy as people think there

2221
01:55:35,800 --> 01:55:39,579
are good ways to do this and there are

2222
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:41,409
bad ways to do this slow start was a

2223
01:55:39,579 --> 01:55:43,329
good way up to a point

2224
01:55:41,409 --> 01:55:45,999
now let's set an envelope for doing this

2225
01:55:43,329 --> 01:55:49,150
and net wave signals are the solution to

2226
01:55:45,999 --> 01:55:50,499
everything if you can trust them and so

2227
01:55:49,150 --> 01:55:52,929
far we're struggling to work out how to

2228
01:55:50,499 --> 01:55:54,938
trust them but yep some network signals

2229
01:55:52,929 --> 01:55:56,590
might add value there's a trust but

2230
01:55:54,939 --> 01:55:57,880
verify bit in here as well which we

2231
01:55:56,590 --> 01:56:01,119
could probably take forward in the

2232
01:55:57,880 --> 01:56:03,729
future and protocol messages requires

2233
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:06,848
some sort of protection and a new thing

2234
01:56:03,729 --> 01:56:08,169
to the transport area but yeah people

2235
01:56:06,849 --> 01:56:11,320
might try and do bad things with your

2236
01:56:08,169 --> 01:56:12,369
congestion controller so one look at

2237
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:15,159
what to do when you receive information

2238
01:56:12,369 --> 01:56:16,659
on path and off paths trying to be quick

2239
01:56:15,159 --> 01:56:18,369
what's the purpose this documents to

2240
01:56:16,659 --> 01:56:21,728
draw a big red box around these things

2241
01:56:18,369 --> 01:56:24,159
but TCP in it everything we say in this

2242
01:56:21,729 --> 01:56:26,949
document should not live at TCP in any

2243
01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:29,409
way as currently specified but quicking

2244
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:31,598
this box well the intention is that

2245
01:56:29,409 --> 01:56:34,929
quick fits in this box this box is not

2246
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:36,460
narrow and it's not short it's a big box

2247
01:56:34,929 --> 01:56:38,050
and quick I hole

2248
01:56:36,460 --> 01:56:40,179
will fit into this box if that's

2249
01:56:38,050 --> 01:56:41,949
controversial then we should talk about

2250
01:56:40,179 --> 01:56:44,770
this because that's the intention and

2251
01:56:41,949 --> 01:56:47,710
other transports we specify here should

2252
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:50,020
fit within this box and the box

2253
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:53,199
currently is set by BC p41

2254
01:56:50,020 --> 01:56:55,540
piracy to nine one four what with Sally

2255
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:57,639
and if you know Sally void if you

2256
01:56:55,540 --> 01:57:01,420
remember her and that that's no quite an

2257
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:05,020
old document this document if we go

2258
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:08,590
forward with it could change BC P 41 or

2259
01:57:05,020 --> 01:57:10,030
may even replace it um we have to figure

2260
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:13,080
this as we go forward you could have

2261
01:57:10,030 --> 01:57:15,340
more than one hour I've seen its mbcp

2262
01:57:13,080 --> 01:57:19,059
question to the working group trying to

2263
01:57:15,340 --> 01:57:21,159
be very quick here um has anyone read it

2264
01:57:19,060 --> 01:57:24,100
does anybody care will anybody help me

2265
01:57:21,159 --> 01:57:25,330
if I try doing this I should I spend my

2266
01:57:24,100 --> 01:57:28,570
time doing other things I have plenty of

2267
01:57:25,330 --> 01:57:34,809
other things um and can we do this in TS

2268
01:57:28,570 --> 01:57:39,580
vwg should I just ask these questions

2269
01:57:34,810 --> 01:57:41,590
David lets you go get good to the mic I

2270
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:43,900
will go ahead and volunteer myself as it

2271
01:57:41,590 --> 01:57:45,699
was once I survived getting getting the

2272
01:57:43,900 --> 01:57:47,469
transfer header encryption draft done

2273
01:57:45,699 --> 01:57:50,980
yes I'm interested in this but I gotta

2274
01:57:47,469 --> 01:57:52,409
get survive that draft first and I see

2275
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:57,909
bunch we were going to the mic so uh

2276
01:57:52,409 --> 01:57:59,379
let's have at it John I and God thank

2277
01:57:57,909 --> 01:58:02,530
you for doing the work on this gory so I

2278
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:04,840
did read the draft as promised it took

2279
01:58:02,530 --> 01:58:12,460
me a lot less time to do that then it

2280
01:58:04,840 --> 01:58:16,090
took you to write it over for me but I

2281
01:58:12,460 --> 01:58:17,770
do want to say that there's this I have

2282
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:19,360
very specific comments about the draft

2283
01:58:17,770 --> 01:58:22,480
itself which I don't want to spend time

2284
01:58:19,360 --> 01:58:24,309
now at the mic talk to you offline about

2285
01:58:22,480 --> 01:58:25,959
those yeah I just interrupt to this

2286
01:58:24,310 --> 01:58:27,429
point I mean I want to take questions

2287
01:58:25,960 --> 01:58:28,929
about whether we should do this work and

2288
01:58:27,429 --> 01:58:33,370
not or whether recommendations are

2289
01:58:28,929 --> 01:58:36,790
correct yeah fair enough I think that

2290
01:58:33,370 --> 01:58:39,790
the the work I think that the work

2291
01:58:36,790 --> 01:58:41,199
should be done in part because as you

2292
01:58:39,790 --> 01:58:43,719
said and you didn't quite say it this

2293
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:45,940
way but we've done we written a lot of

2294
01:58:43,719 --> 01:58:47,500
text about condition control guidelines

2295
01:58:45,940 --> 01:58:48,610
and principles and this that and the

2296
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:50,409
other and none of them really have

2297
01:58:48,610 --> 01:58:53,469
guidelines or principles or

2298
01:58:50,409 --> 01:58:55,210
useful as far as I can see so when

2299
01:58:53,469 --> 01:58:57,190
looking into all the texts that we've

2300
01:58:55,210 --> 01:59:00,310
produced I find it difficult to find

2301
01:58:57,190 --> 01:59:02,230
real recommendations that I can pull out

2302
01:59:00,310 --> 01:59:04,570
of them so I think there's a big gap

2303
01:59:02,230 --> 01:59:06,879
here and I think we should provide

2304
01:59:04,570 --> 01:59:09,309
something in that gap precisely how that

2305
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:12,190
looks is not it's still not fully clear

2306
01:59:09,310 --> 01:59:16,150
to me but it's something more concrete

2307
01:59:12,190 --> 01:59:18,909
than 29:1 for because when a know just

2308
01:59:16,150 --> 01:59:21,330
lays out the space of things rather than

2309
01:59:18,909 --> 01:59:25,360
actually give very precise guidelines

2310
01:59:21,330 --> 01:59:27,489
and it should be less I think it needs

2311
01:59:25,360 --> 01:59:29,440
to be between that and actually

2312
01:59:27,489 --> 01:59:33,400
specifying exact behavior it needs to be

2313
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:35,888
somewhere in the middle there so I think

2314
01:59:33,400 --> 01:59:36,879
it's very relevant useful important to

2315
01:59:35,889 --> 01:59:38,830
have something like this especially

2316
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,600
given the flurry of work in congestion

2317
01:59:38,830 --> 01:59:42,969
control we are seeing I will just say

2318
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:46,389
one quick point that this should be

2319
01:59:42,969 --> 01:59:48,130
broad your box is talking about specific

2320
01:59:46,389 --> 01:59:50,260
transports and I agree with that the way

2321
01:59:48,130 --> 01:59:54,190
the text is written in the draft seems

2322
01:59:50,260 --> 01:59:56,230
to be very aligned with TCP I almost

2323
01:59:54,190 --> 01:59:58,989
think that this should be broad enough

2324
01:59:56,230 --> 02:00:01,690
that new condition control work that

2325
01:59:58,989 --> 02:00:04,178
happens anywhere should be able to use

2326
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:05,919
this not just within the IETF these

2327
02:00:04,179 --> 02:00:09,340
guidelines should be Universal in that

2328
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:10,870
sense I'm noting that Janice said

2329
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:14,199
offended me in any way

2330
02:00:10,870 --> 02:00:16,780
I like these ideas and if the last thing

2331
02:00:14,199 --> 02:00:19,210
was a criticism it's a criticism because

2332
02:00:16,780 --> 02:00:22,870
the existing RFC's were written mainly

2333
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:24,850
with TCP in mind many of the words in

2334
02:00:22,870 --> 02:00:26,949
there were taken more or less directly

2335
02:00:24,850 --> 02:00:29,840
from those RFC's because that's the only

2336
02:00:26,949 --> 02:00:34,940
starting point I believe we can have

2337
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:38,360
I mean next person please Marco yo have

2338
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:40,960
I read this really not but I took a

2339
02:00:38,360 --> 02:00:46,429
quick look at that of it and it looks

2340
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:50,929
useful so I care I hope many people here

2341
02:00:46,429 --> 02:00:53,360
care of it and it's true that the these

2342
02:00:50,929 --> 02:00:57,829
principles and what consistent controls

2343
02:00:53,360 --> 02:01:01,369
were - is also a sweat and 29:14 so it

2344
02:00:57,829 --> 02:01:03,650
spread all around so very careful

2345
02:01:01,369 --> 02:01:07,820
consideration should be taken to cook

2346
02:01:03,650 --> 02:01:11,388
all of that stuff but in particular what

2347
02:01:07,820 --> 02:01:14,630
else to include so there are

2348
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:17,570
experimental work and especially that

2349
02:01:14,630 --> 02:01:20,030
work should be taken very carefully all

2350
02:01:17,570 --> 02:01:21,619
very carefully whether - what to say

2351
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:26,389
about that because it's still

2352
02:01:21,619 --> 02:01:27,639
experimental hmm interesting

2353
02:01:26,390 --> 02:01:30,949
[Music]

2354
02:01:27,639 --> 02:01:32,480
Praveen Microsoft yeah I started reading

2355
02:01:30,949 --> 02:01:35,808
it I don't finished it I will send

2356
02:01:32,480 --> 02:01:37,369
ascender review to the mailing list yes

2357
02:01:35,809 --> 02:01:39,139
I care and I think it's really important

2358
02:01:37,369 --> 02:01:40,639
so I agree with whatever Jonah said so

2359
02:01:39,139 --> 02:01:42,320
it should be general enough to apply to

2360
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:43,309
all transports and I think this is

2361
02:01:42,320 --> 02:01:47,840
really really important

2362
02:01:43,309 --> 02:01:51,500
thank you Thanks all right but Briscoe

2363
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,849
yes it's important I think having done

2364
02:01:51,500 --> 02:01:56,389
the first round

2365
02:01:52,849 --> 02:01:58,880
it may be worth taking out stuff that

2366
02:01:56,389 --> 02:02:00,980
isn't really saying anything new just to

2367
02:01:58,880 --> 02:02:04,520
focus on the things that are updates if

2368
02:02:00,980 --> 02:02:08,269
you like and things that have changed

2369
02:02:04,520 --> 02:02:10,099
for instance the burst stuff is was

2370
02:02:08,270 --> 02:02:11,750
something previously we didn't really

2371
02:02:10,099 --> 02:02:13,520
think about because latency wasn't that

2372
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:19,039
you know which weren't trying to give it

2373
02:02:13,520 --> 02:02:20,929
that tight and as thick as machines have

2374
02:02:19,039 --> 02:02:23,360
need to go far and fast they've tended

2375
02:02:20,929 --> 02:02:25,610
to aggregate up and then burst and so

2376
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:27,259
that is something that's new I think

2377
02:02:25,610 --> 02:02:29,449
there's some new ideas coming out on

2378
02:02:27,260 --> 02:02:31,340
fairness as I mentioned you know CCR G

2379
02:02:29,449 --> 02:02:33,710
is a paper in hot Nets about how to

2380
02:02:31,340 --> 02:02:36,050
measure it and things like that so try

2381
02:02:33,710 --> 02:02:38,690
not to keep just repeating stuff from

2382
02:02:36,050 --> 02:02:40,510
the past but focus on the things that

2383
02:02:38,690 --> 02:02:41,780
may be more controversial

2384
02:02:40,510 --> 02:02:43,940
[Music]

2385
02:02:41,780 --> 02:02:45,320
we could probably add a section pretty

2386
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:46,759
quickly on what we think is the new

2387
02:02:45,320 --> 02:02:49,969
stuff and see how that goes

2388
02:02:46,760 --> 02:02:52,580
that would be useful yeah I you see that

2389
02:02:49,970 --> 02:02:55,400
I just would like to mention that's know

2390
02:02:52,580 --> 02:02:59,059
in DC p.m. we have our Tea Orchestra and

2391
02:02:55,400 --> 02:03:02,000
then as far as I can read the draft

2392
02:02:59,060 --> 02:03:04,430
there are several overlaps and then we

2393
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:07,610
already have a private chat but snow

2394
02:03:04,430 --> 02:03:09,800
if TS vwg will be the venue of this

2395
02:03:07,610 --> 02:03:12,889
draft no this working group should

2396
02:03:09,800 --> 02:03:15,200
decide how to you know Kogi's restore

2397
02:03:12,890 --> 02:03:20,440
merger should make some kind of decision

2398
02:03:15,200 --> 02:03:22,610
to come how to treat or do consider

2399
02:03:20,440 --> 02:03:26,179
Yoshi which you have to arch your

2400
02:03:22,610 --> 02:03:28,639
considerations yeah oh yeah okay got it

2401
02:03:26,180 --> 02:03:30,140
yeah so right okay I guess I should

2402
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:33,950
respond just to touch on RT or

2403
02:03:30,140 --> 02:03:37,280
considerations and this document was a

2404
02:03:33,950 --> 02:03:41,510
working document in T CPM and still is

2405
02:03:37,280 --> 02:03:44,000
and I expect is now complete I was

2406
02:03:41,510 --> 02:03:46,310
Speaker TCP I'm about this

2407
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:48,020
there is nothing cuz inconsistent

2408
02:03:46,310 --> 02:03:51,380
between that document and this document

2409
02:03:48,020 --> 02:03:53,960
so the overlap is purely restating stuff

2410
02:03:51,380 --> 02:03:55,760
here that mark also came to the same

2411
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:58,490
conclusion on I went carefully through

2412
02:03:55,760 --> 02:04:01,940
that and the overlap is is real overlap

2413
02:03:58,490 --> 02:04:04,250
is not a contention in their way so we

2414
02:04:01,940 --> 02:04:06,950
have decided document process if we

2415
02:04:04,250 --> 02:04:09,080
decide to do two documents how we manage

2416
02:04:06,950 --> 02:04:11,720
that but I will talk specifically about

2417
02:04:09,080 --> 02:04:13,309
RT or consider and yeah it is something

2418
02:04:11,720 --> 02:04:15,380
that we should reconcile between working

2419
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:22,970
groups does that answer the question

2420
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:27,560
yeah yeah okay I think I'm gonna do it

2421
02:04:22,970 --> 02:04:29,630
ts vwg can we adopt it I think we can do

2422
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:34,160
the working th pwg I think an adoption

2423
02:04:29,630 --> 02:04:37,670
call right now is a little premature I

2424
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:40,639
heard a bunch of people like a bunch of

2425
02:04:37,670 --> 02:04:43,480
people at the mic who are interested in

2426
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:48,410
supportive of working on this draft

2427
02:04:43,480 --> 02:04:50,179
let's plan on on some revisions from

2428
02:04:48,410 --> 02:04:53,570
view in the list and elect the adoption

2429
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:55,190
call in Vancouver a little bit early do

2430
02:04:53,570 --> 02:04:56,900
it of this right now yeah

2431
02:04:55,190 --> 02:04:58,370
that's fine and that's what I expected I

2432
02:04:56,900 --> 02:05:00,559
just want to make the question because

2433
02:04:58,370 --> 02:05:03,260
if it caused uproar about the idea of it

2434
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:05,090
then I'm not going to carry on I sent I

2435
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:06,980
hear positive noises and I'm looking for

2436
02:05:05,090 --> 02:05:08,960
people to actually talk to in the coda

2437
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:10,910
to try and work out how to pay that

2438
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:14,360
adoption request a real thing at the

2439
02:05:10,910 --> 02:05:17,360
next idea I'm sorry I'll commit to

say your name's slowly please

2450
02:05:38,870 --> 02:05:46,849
moderate Cukor yo thank you yeah I just

2451
02:05:44,810 --> 02:05:51,080
wanted to add an addendum to what I said

2452
02:05:46,850 --> 02:05:53,989
before even if you're pulling out things

2453
02:05:51,080 --> 02:05:56,239
that have changed we mustn't imply that

2454
02:05:53,989 --> 02:05:58,040
the previous advice isn't as important

2455
02:05:56,239 --> 02:06:00,709
as it used to be it's it's still

2456
02:05:58,040 --> 02:06:03,650
important you know the the congestion

2457
02:06:00,710 --> 02:06:05,330
control itself RTO and things like that

2458
02:06:03,650 --> 02:06:08,059
are all all important we just don't need

2459
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:10,989
to keep saying it saying it more yeah

2460
02:06:08,060 --> 02:06:13,190
and and I particularly but I've been

2461
02:06:10,989 --> 02:06:20,000
trying to think a bit about Sally Floyd

2462
02:06:13,190 --> 02:06:23,719
and she kept on with that and the fact

2463
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:26,440
that she kept on at it is possibly one

2464
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:30,820
of the reasons why so many people

2465
02:06:26,440 --> 02:06:35,509
understand it and if we stop saying it

2466
02:06:30,820 --> 02:06:37,610
there are a lot more or a lot of people

2467
02:06:35,510 --> 02:06:40,699
who won't understand it or won't

2468
02:06:37,610 --> 02:06:44,650
appreciate it's it's strange to have to

2469
02:06:40,699 --> 02:06:47,150
think about that and it's only when you

2470
02:06:44,650 --> 02:06:48,739
you know something's not happened you

2471
02:06:47,150 --> 02:06:50,360
start to get complacent about it but it

2472
02:06:48,739 --> 02:06:52,910
doesn't mean to say it won't happen and

2473
02:06:50,360 --> 02:06:55,070
Bob I assume you're you're you're

2474
02:06:52,910 --> 02:06:56,989
planning to work on this your copious

2475
02:06:55,070 --> 02:06:58,670
spare time it's not available other

2476
02:06:56,989 --> 02:07:00,620
drafts from all the other drafts you're

2477
02:06:58,670 --> 02:07:01,850
working on right I think Bob just won

2478
02:07:00,620 --> 02:07:03,890
endeared yeah I think Bob just

2479
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:05,780
volunteered I'm just I'm just putting on

2480
02:07:03,890 --> 02:07:07,730
my chair had and observing Bob's got but

2481
02:07:05,780 --> 02:07:08,370
Bob's already already got a lot of time

2482
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:11,370
that he

2483
02:07:08,370 --> 02:07:13,740
remember the dress I'd say maybe gaudy I

2484
02:07:11,370 --> 02:07:16,500
and Bob can try and find some time this

2485
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:19,260
week yes sort of sit down and beat this

2486
02:07:16,500 --> 02:07:22,260
out a little bit more seriously I I'm

2487
02:07:19,260 --> 02:07:24,360
doing this as an individual and I I'm

2488
02:07:22,260 --> 02:07:26,850
only going to continue this if other

2489
02:07:24,360 --> 02:07:28,650
people talk to me because I'm happy to

2490
02:07:26,850 --> 02:07:30,390
do some writing but this is something

2491
02:07:28,650 --> 02:07:34,980
that has to be written down together we

2492
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:36,720
have to define this box together and

2493
02:07:34,980 --> 02:07:38,280
with that I think we're done thank you

2494
02:07:36,720 --> 02:07:40,380
very much and yeah I will bash the

2495
02:07:38,280 --> 02:07:43,259
agenda to get Marcus's presentation in

2496
02:07:40,380 --> 02:07:45,300
on on the next session we do appear to

2497
02:07:43,260 --> 02:07:47,340
have some time although there are some

2498
02:07:45,300 --> 02:07:49,500
items on the agenda the capable capable

2499
02:07:47,340 --> 02:07:51,920
explain to consume all time available

2500
02:07:49,500 --> 02:07:51,920
and then some
