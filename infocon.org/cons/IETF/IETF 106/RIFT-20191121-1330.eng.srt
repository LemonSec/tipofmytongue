00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:39,430
hello everyone

3
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:49,500
welcome to the working group and we're

4
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:49,500
about to start the agenda for today is I

5
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,890
will have presentation applicability

6
00:04:56,350 --> 00:05:02,740
draft and then come talk about

7
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:05,919
multihoming and how to control this

8
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:20,980
aggregation and then Tony P will provide

9
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:22,510
latest update on the main spec and then

10
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,310
I have a couple of slides on their

11
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:26,469
applicability because I lick ability you

12
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,620
know we didn't get to write everything

13
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:31,210
so I just have two or three powerpoints

14
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,410
I can quickly talk about the issues that

15
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:36,729
we'll be putting into applicability

16
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:39,280
trough probably know just to make just

17
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,160
to press the time so are they part of

18
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,989
your slides or no it's it they kind of

19
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,880
part of Sandy's presentation because

20
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,170
she's driving the applicability draft so

21
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,969
we talked through all these things but

22
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,230
not everything made it made in you know

23
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,880
such kind of lucky

24
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:57,400
Luger hat have a receive the site yeah I

25
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:59,469
sent your slides I mean we have time if

26
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:05,469
we run out of time I'm cool I think

27
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:08,800
we'll have time so zero nine has been

28
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:11,640
posted we've issued the working group

29
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,590
consensus and waiting her write up

30
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:18,180
reviews her ongoing the document is long

31
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:23,380
so it takes a lot of time unfortunately

32
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:26,860
so we expect to finalize sometime

33
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:32,860
between Singapore Vancouver hopefully we

34
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:34,900
also plan to do land which I wouldn't

35
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,180
call it fixes but simplification so

36
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:39,130
we're still I'm still looking for

37
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:41,350
someone who is native speaker and you

38
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,840
know leisure person who could really

39
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,840
simplify the text

40
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:55,400
we have adopted an specification after

41
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:57,690
it has been updated to match 0-9 it's

42
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,650
pretty much ready for working with last

43
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:05,910
call more rocks me there's a multi

44
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:07,890
custom beer and listen PGP and segment

45
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,350
routing so it's all being planned we

46
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:15,060
also plan to recharge there before one

47
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:18,000
cover since main document is done we are

48
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,610
going to focus on progress ink and

49
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,170
finalizing the other documents of

50
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:32,370
specifically PGP segment routing the

51
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:35,340
multicast hi Rodney so since this went

52
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:37,800
through working west call

53
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,479
I am read the document and I'm not a

54
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:44,070
native speaker in case you want me to

55
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:48,390
read it but how are we in this question

56
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:53,760
maybe for you and the Shepherd and the

57
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:58,830
author's how are we reviewing the model

58
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:59,940
itself and in then we make it a

59
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:05,820
multi-part question

60
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:08,730
you mean 3v part of it yes so I noticed

61
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:10,980
that when we talk about you know doing

62
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:14,400
the modeling thrift which is fine yeah

63
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:16,610
that's perfect it's no problem but since

64
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,900
we're the first ones to do it

65
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,030
we're probably gonna have to go through

66
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,799
any growing pains that we have to go

67
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:28,200
straight so I noticed several things the

68
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,030
appendix is normative right which means

69
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,000
that it's fine but we should you know

70
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:35,309
make sure that the model is reviewed

71
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,480
somehow I don't know that we have anyone

72
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:41,579
who beyond the authors who know thrift I

73
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,980
mean we don't have a thrift doctor or

74
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,750
yang dr. sorry we don't have a thrift

75
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,010
doctor that could check the syntax and

76
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:54,420
everything else I noticed that the

77
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:57,170
reference that's in there is public

78
00:08:54,420 --> 00:09:02,420
which is good and

79
00:08:57,170 --> 00:09:05,209
I don't know that it's stable in the

80
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:09,260
sense that it seems to point to the LDL

81
00:09:05,209 --> 00:09:11,349
I think or the idea and when you look at

82
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:14,060
that page it's like well this is for a

83
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:16,430
specific version so I'm not sure that

84
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:18,859
because I just don't know if that makes

85
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:22,010
a difference going forward if at a

86
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:24,110
different version just going to be a

87
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:27,560
different result if that's going to

88
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:30,350
affect interoperability in the future or

89
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:32,410
not and and if you know the reference

90
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,300
gonna be stable enough for us to look at

91
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:38,120
which goes back to your reviewing the

92
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,760
synthesis itself right the fact that it

93
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:41,959
compiles and it runs and there are

94
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:45,339
multiple implementations doesn't this

95
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:47,810
really mean that it is correct right

96
00:09:45,339 --> 00:09:49,760
meaning we go through this all the time

97
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:51,859
with yang models so they compile and it

98
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,329
looks okay but then the young doctors

99
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,100
say well you should really format it

100
00:09:53,329 --> 00:09:59,859
this way or etc so much questions but I

101
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,060
think we need to think about this stuff

102
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,470
as we go through the process not bring

103
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,779
down this era but yes we go through the

104
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:09,250
process we need to have answers to all

105
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:12,170
that because I know that I can't review

106
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:17,029
the thrift same pians very valid concern

107
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:19,550
so I try to find people outside of ITF

108
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:23,060
fox general drift but the answer solves

109
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:24,829
why should they so I assume we are going

110
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,279
to iterate same way we do with young

111
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:31,130
models after we have published and if

112
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,839
you found by building new implementation

113
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:35,180
that something doesn't work we can

114
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,020
always risk pin and you know do quick

115
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:42,500
update yes but that doesn't

116
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:44,899
I understand but I mean obviously Tony

117
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,579
knows what's in it right but asking him

118
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:50,770
to review it it's like drinking so

119
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:50,770
kool-aid so it doesn't really help run

120
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:57,620
20p juniper

121
00:10:54,709 --> 00:11:01,670
so finding someone to review the thrift

122
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,920
is more up to the chairs okay the stones

123
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:07,010
of thrift in the industry are not

124
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,899
necessarily you know in our field now

125
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:10,939
why should they I don't know up to the

126
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,720
chairs to like do the salesman's job

127
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:16,849
as to the thrift compiler well we will

128
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,699
be facing the same problems GRP c2 and

129
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:21,769
the GRP c3 right if they move major

130
00:11:19,699 --> 00:11:28,279
version is like good luck to you

131
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:32,479
thrift has been very very stable because

132
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:40,369
Apache you know put that stuff away back

133
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:44,959
and the compiler has been stable there

134
00:11:40,369 --> 00:11:47,419
is no like official binding spec of

135
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,819
thrift language but neither there's of G

136
00:11:47,419 --> 00:11:54,799
RPC and I wish we had to yank that does

137
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:57,858
the job but we don't and maybe we'll

138
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:59,989
have long term right so that's about

139
00:11:57,859 --> 00:12:03,439
this best practical ascensor this can be

140
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:05,269
even right now right so I don't know if

141
00:12:03,439 --> 00:12:08,509
the ATF has done any formal

142
00:12:05,269 --> 00:12:10,339
specifications you see in G RPC so if we

143
00:12:08,509 --> 00:12:13,459
haven't then you know it doesn't matter

144
00:12:10,339 --> 00:12:14,539
the comparison but every other modeling

145
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:17,059
language that we have right we have

146
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:19,009
doctors to look at self now you said

147
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:22,009
something that I want to ask about you

148
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:23,809
said if Apache goes and changes a

149
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:26,149
compiler to some other major version or

150
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,738
something there may be issues meaning

151
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:29,389
that if you did your implementation and

152
00:12:27,739 --> 00:12:31,659
it did mine and I compile it with

153
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,799
something else we might not be able to

154
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:37,039
control it is that true or am i

155
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:41,899
understanding so I will just for a

156
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:44,869
second Bruin is amazing that's open so

157
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:48,529
Bruno I I jump in an approver can talk

158
00:12:44,869 --> 00:12:50,720
so first thing it's more subtle because

159
00:12:48,529 --> 00:12:53,479
the compilers deliver actually the code

160
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,809
in different target languages Umesh

161
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:58,479
issues between target languages welcome

162
00:12:56,809 --> 00:13:01,159
to the beautiful world of modeling

163
00:12:58,479 --> 00:13:02,749
that's why I'm so happy we have actually

164
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:04,369
three programming languages

165
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:05,809
implementations and each of them have a

166
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:08,749
different back-end code come from the

167
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:11,868
compiler and they all interrupt second a

168
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:14,179
bola will probably talk about it we very

169
00:13:11,869 --> 00:13:16,399
carefully checked whether what thrift

170
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:18,259
was promised is actually valid like when

171
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,029
we omit elements and the optional

172
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,859
without default and whether the stuff

173
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:24,410
really shows up and we can we can decode

174
00:13:21,859 --> 00:13:30,500
something we added an element and so on

175
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:32,810
so we did pretty I would say annal

176
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:34,490
checking with Bruno whether the stuff

177
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,989
holds up because otherwise you knew we

178
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:37,130
couldn't progress the model without like

179
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,670
doing go going through the major

180
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:43,430
versions but yes I mean Industries is

181
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:44,930
doing tons of ideal now it's all over

182
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,599
the place and we kind of have to catch

183
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:49,880
up and I I guess over time we probably

184
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,430
have to evolve evolve the yang if we

185
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,230
have the energy and the time to do those

186
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,579
things otherwise we have to you know

187
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:56,720
learn to live with all these ideal

188
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:59,860
languages sorry

189
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:03,860
so Bruin I can hear but cannot speak

190
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:05,810
he's saying that when he tried compiled

191
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,510
for another language he had some

192
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:10,550
problems with handling and a number soon

193
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,520
we'll see some minor issues between

194
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:17,630
languages but at least the songs that

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,920
have been test should be probably and

196
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:23,450
the interdependency

197
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:24,500
is not really idea domain right well

198
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:27,800
we're supposed to be producing

199
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,230
interoperable specifications right yes

200
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:36,109
vacations Interop about the companion

201
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:38,600
behavior to say is that all the first

202
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:40,220
two you know some other time that you

203
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,660
want to argue that with someone else but

204
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,330
what I was going to say is that we

205
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:46,100
should at least include I just look at

206
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:49,490
the draft and there's some there's an

207
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:53,510
implementation looks like maybe

208
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:55,340
considerations section maybe you wanted

209
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:58,490
to include an implementation status

210
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,020
section that talks about you know a

211
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,180
little couple paragraphs of what

212
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,800
implementations have already been done

213
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:05,060
yeah this compiled to this language that

214
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:08,329
compiled that other language you know

215
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,010
etc so that when people look at this at

216
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:13,940
least you know they may not have the

217
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:19,640
same thoughts or it might be easier to

218
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:28,340
go through in the same draft no in the

219
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:30,830
same oh so 7540 whatever there's an RFC

220
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:32,390
that talks about best practices in

221
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,640
indicate implementations so it's

222
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:37,319
basically a section that talks about the

223
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,569
current state and in fact if

224
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,970
is removed when the RC is published so

225
00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:43,800
it is mostly for information of the

226
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,510
reviewers and you know everyone else and

227
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,300
so when everyone starts saying we don't

228
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,470
have know where the heck this and you

229
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:52,469
know who reviewed it and whatever at

230
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:54,090
least we can say well but look it's

231
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,080
compiled in different languages and you

232
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,180
know whatever there's some inference

233
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,790
ations they interoperate I know that is

234
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,979
that doesn't mean that the objections

235
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,900
right it just means that yeah if this is

236
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,540
a moving target we could have some sex

237
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,939
idea our link to be KITT where describe

238
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:15,060
the link itself is immutable but the

239
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:20,340
content is true either way well

240
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:21,839
discussed Estonian so yeah okay no

241
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,640
problem let's put an implementation

242
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,190
section in that get basically nuked

243
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:30,360
before the stuff gets you know RFC as

244
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,300
proposed standard as a meta observation

245
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:36,030
this is not different than having an

246
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,329
implementation in the C compiler bug but

247
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:43,350
just a different level I mean it's not

248
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:45,450
like we fundamentally changing the world

249
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,490
right we're getting better tools and

250
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,140
each of the tools we'll have it quirks

251
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,940
and the quirks can affect that now the

252
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,590
resulting output and these quirks will

253
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,800
be fixed if enough people have interest

254
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:57,540
and run this stuff so it's not

255
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:03,420
fundamentally unfixable or moving target

256
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:05,849
I agree I just you know trying to guess

257
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:09,409
what issues may come later so that we

258
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:09,409
try and solve them now and not wait till

259
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:19,470
okay so points taking and so again for

260
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:22,139
three three views specifically if

261
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,329
someone can help you know I try to being

262
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,980
some people at Facebook no one wants to

263
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:35,270
spend their time on this unfortunately

264
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:35,270
and they they shouldn't really okay Dima

265
00:17:45,520 --> 00:18:05,050
i I want to discuss controlled

266
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:07,660
desegregation and multihoming in data

267
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:08,440
center networks it's not specifically

268
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:11,290
about reefed

269
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:13,090
but I want to go through the slides to

270
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:17,980
show problems which are difficult to

271
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:20,260
solve without reached so essentially why

272
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:23,080
we want to do this creation and

273
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,570
aggregation of course some problems

274
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:28,899
which are difficult to solve if we are

275
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:31,439
using BGP which is commonplace in a

276
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:35,140
really large data center networks now

277
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,830
that basically boils down to following

278
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,990
things in factory if we consider any

279
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,510
particular level it's completely

280
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,870
disjoint nodes don't know about each

281
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,890
other

282
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:52,030
and some decisions cannot be really made

283
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,990
using only local information but it can

284
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:55,480
be solved with reefed

285
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,460
and quite elegantly to limit the scope

286
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:59,580
of discussion we are talking about layer

287
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:02,770
three data center networks only

288
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,659
considering only enriched ability but

289
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,809
not considering the asymmetrical

290
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,520
bandwidth and we are not talking about

291
00:19:06,809 --> 00:19:13,809
details of rift implementation because

292
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:18,429
it was discussed many times before just

293
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:23,399
to remind the topology of the network we

294
00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:27,010
are talking about in examples I will use

295
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:32,050
these two spine levels and one Li for

296
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:37,540
totally level all the directions south

297
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:39,730
north east west and essentially we are

298
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:42,250
following quasi quasi core closed

299
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:44,040
building procedure recursively we are

300
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,590
taking some elements with some radix

301
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:49,570
combining them into Samson which we can

302
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,610
consider switch an element with higher

303
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:56,520
Alex and if that's not enough very

304
00:19:51,610 --> 00:20:00,030
repeated that's it and

305
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,280
basically different ways to scales and

306
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,250
data center networks we are usually

307
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,480
doing hire addicts and multiple levels

308
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:12,720
so viagra gate first of all it's to get

309
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:15,600
smaller state both for foraging and for

310
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:19,950
outing and second to potentially achieve

311
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,790
small breast rattles but there is a

312
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:26,250
problem potential problem when we

313
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:28,909
aggregate in multi pass routes

314
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:32,370
what kind of multiple routes we have and

315
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:35,370
how they propagated I'm talking about

316
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:38,129
propagation of routes to contrast what

317
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:40,139
we have this distance reactor and BGP to

318
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:44,610
what potentially can be done with drift

319
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:46,590
so what we have first is default or

320
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:50,580
entire data center network aggregate

321
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:52,860
which Kyocera seen it it's usually not

322
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,530
usually it's always owned north toward

323
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,409
top of fabric and it propagates south

324
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:01,730
from top of fabric it shouldn't

325
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:04,559
propagate north from some node on the

326
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,280
intermediate level and there could be

327
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:10,740
small aggregates situational they appear

328
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:14,100
in foreign cases when we do for example

329
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:18,240
host multihoming or when we introduce

330
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:20,689
extra mesh between spine levels or if

331
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:24,600
you're trying to do something like

332
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:27,950
redundancy on the top of Port lado which

333
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,199
some hyper scalars do it introduces

334
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:34,620
valley routing so basically a traffic

335
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,110
could go down to the leaf levels and

336
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:41,580
reflects back to spine one level and

337
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:44,159
then reflects back to correct leaf and

338
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,379
it's problematic because it has its own

339
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:51,660
corner cases those small aggregates

340
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:54,000
raise a point - it depends on the place

341
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:55,890
in the network say my points house they

342
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,230
might point north really depends on

343
00:21:55,890 --> 00:22:00,929
where we are in the network and then

344
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,809
normally propagates from the origin up

345
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:07,320
to the top of fabric then reflected and

346
00:22:03,809 --> 00:22:09,620
propagates nose or south to the rest of

347
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:13,200
the network

348
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:17,060
okay there are some positive things with

349
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:21,270
aggregation why we do disagree eight

350
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:24,929
basically the reason is when we combine

351
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:27,060
multipass and there is an aggregate this

352
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:33,120
aggregate covers multiple destinations

353
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:37,620
and we have favors somewhere not on the

354
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,810
dirac next-hop but remote favors reach

355
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,419
ability becomes a symmetrical basically

356
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:46,100
not all the intermediate next hops are

357
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:49,910
valid for all the remote destinations

358
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,560
and if we try to use only aggregate Road

359
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:55,020
what eventually can happen is that we

360
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,649
come to some node which originates that

361
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:00,780
aggregate but there is no way to go

362
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:05,370
further from that node does a particular

363
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:07,710
destination really need and says B : and

364
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:12,750
in particular if we consider cost

365
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:14,820
apology classical cost apology there is

366
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,730
specific property if you look from top

367
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,280
of fabric down to the leaves there is

368
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:22,440
only single pass from any particular top

369
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:26,220
of fabric node to any particular leaf

370
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,130
just single pass and if favor happen

371
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,590
along that path anywhere then that

372
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:34,590
particular top of fabric node becomes

373
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:37,169
ineligible for routing traffic towards

374
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:43,230
all the destinations which are behind

375
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:46,310
that leaf node and that means that we

376
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:49,770
can't really use default anymore because

377
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:52,710
some next hops are valid for all the

378
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,720
destinations and some next hops are

379
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:59,100
valid only for subset of destinations

380
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,660
and we do need to desegregate and of

381
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:04,080
course there is a fallback scenario

382
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,450
basically the simple thing to do we can

383
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:11,879
just start with disagree gated

384
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:14,220
everything never greg 8 it works but it

385
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,500
doesn't scale and essentially we are

386
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:21,020
leaving with the worst case scenario all

387
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,740
the time and really forwarding state

388
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,470
especially multiple

389
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:30,900
Fortin state can be a problem and I will

390
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:33,620
show that later so what can it be

391
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:37,850
decided based on the local information

392
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:41,428
we cannot decide ears following things

393
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,629
do we need to propagate some specific

394
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:53,010
routes which we received from notes

395
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:55,230
south from us because do we need to

396
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,750
propagate that specific because as notes

397
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:01,020
on our level advertise aggregate but

398
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:03,030
they don't have rich ability don't have

399
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,190
routes to that specific destination and

400
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:09,809
we really need to inject or propagate

401
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:13,110
specific or and another question is do

402
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:15,750
we have a full set of all possible valid

403
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:18,689
valid routes in the network is a current

404
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:26,370
moment because if we don't then we are

405
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:30,179
potentially broke hall in Samson of

406
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,100
course once again one of the potential

407
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:34,320
solution if we know all the destination

408
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,360
in advance in can distribute that to all

409
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,120
the nodes in the network so it could be

410
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:42,780
potential solution but it's really it's

411
00:25:39,120 --> 00:26:03,780
not feasible most of the time and here

412
00:25:42,780 --> 00:26:06,600
at some examples it works excellent so

413
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:09,899
what we have here is a stopper fabric

414
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:12,240
spine to note and we have Ferrer on the

415
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,780
wing from this node to the node on level

416
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,540
one that means that we cannot go from

417
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,910
this node to this node and this error

418
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:24,149
just shows a way we want to send traffic

419
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:27,330
so this particular form means that this

420
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,760
node and these links which with the

421
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:32,879
dashed lines they're ineligible they

422
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,079
invalid if you want to get to that

423
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:39,539
particular destination and that means as

424
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,729
three of the spine 1 notes these days

425
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:44,969
and these cannot really use the default

426
00:26:41,729 --> 00:26:49,379
is they need to have more specific

427
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:54,379
routes because they cannot send traffic

428
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:54,379
to this note via this top of fabric note

429
00:26:55,009 --> 00:27:05,219
what's interesting is if we have ferrous

430
00:26:59,209 --> 00:27:09,079
lower in the topology like anti note or

431
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:12,119
link from spine 1 down to tour note then

432
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:14,819
affected part of the topology is much

433
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:17,519
larger so boa Stratos is quite large and

434
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,889
that means that we need to disaggregate

435
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:21,569
not on the spinal arrows but we really

436
00:27:19,889 --> 00:27:26,879
need to disaggregate on the leaf layers

437
00:27:21,569 --> 00:27:29,759
all those leaves cannot select any note

438
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:31,498
from this plane to go to that

439
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:36,599
destinations they all need to go through

440
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:39,029
the hero plane that's also a property of

441
00:27:36,599 --> 00:27:41,339
PLAs topology because basically the

442
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:44,129
higher up you go in this topology then

443
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:46,440
narrower and the smaller subset of

444
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:50,458
remain Interpol Japan you can go and

445
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:53,339
once we select plane as it is so this we

446
00:27:50,459 --> 00:27:56,549
cannot switch to another plane we went

447
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:58,918
to this note we are confine it to this

448
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,629
plane and if it's a problem with the

449
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:09,690
connectivity from this plane to the

450
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:12,359
destination Belloc just be code and well

451
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:15,089
that's how it looks with 2 spine layers

452
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,009
situation becomes a little bit more

453
00:28:15,089 --> 00:28:19,379
interesting if you have more than two

454
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:21,899
spine layers but essentially the same

455
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:24,389
the lore is a little we we have failed

456
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:27,268
the largest by Australian small notes

457
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:34,289
need to disaggregate more notes cannot

458
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:37,289
use the default but really most of the

459
00:28:34,289 --> 00:28:39,719
deployments are fine with one or two

460
00:28:37,289 --> 00:28:42,840
spine levels very few deployments they

461
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:47,010
really need more than two spine nails

462
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,929
and another thing is favors and forward

463
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:53,490
and state problem is that in modern

464
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:56,370
switches especially if we are talking

465
00:28:53,490 --> 00:29:00,000
about commodity hardware S&P fortune

466
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:02,449
state is a scarce resource and it's not

467
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,730
vendor specific it's just how workups

468
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:08,430
lookups work essentially once we're

469
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,930
dealing with ECP after a longest prefix

470
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,920
match lookup you have a couple of

471
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:16,080
additional tables we have a simple group

472
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:19,290
table which in turn points to the block

473
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:24,030
of next hops and those resources are

474
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:26,520
limited so we should be careful and they

475
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:30,060
can be consumed quickly because usually

476
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:33,690
it's okay to have moderate number of

477
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,139
groups but especially of intermediate

478
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:39,840
spines which have very widely seen P

479
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,940
looking north the number of consumed

480
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,149
next hop entries is basically a number

481
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:47,880
of unique next hop groups multiplied by

482
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:51,540
the weeds or PCP and Boozer PCP could be

483
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:57,900
32 or 64 on modern switches so it's

484
00:29:51,540 --> 00:30:02,490
really scarce resource all the Leon

485
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:04,770
leaves on top of rack switches number of

486
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:06,840
potentially unique next subgroups is

487
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:08,629
usually limited by the number of

488
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,790
combination of next hop for example

489
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:16,350
typically if you have some slight 8 up

490
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:20,899
links there are only 2000 5256 potential

491
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:25,830
combinations of our valid and invalid

492
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:30,360
next hop so that's 256 next four groups

493
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:35,129
marks another situation where we have to

494
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,030
deal with aggregation and control the

495
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:39,180
disaggregation

496
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:42,060
is if we want to do host multiform and

497
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,610
and specifically a layer 3 host multi

498
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:48,330
forming so setup is 4 and we have a pair

499
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:51,300
of switches and a number of hosts our

500
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:55,740
door home to those switches each switch

501
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:59,730
is a bear originates the same obligate

502
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,920
and in this situation leaf or Torah

503
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:04,440
don't have enough local information to

504
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:07,890
figure out foreign things first if the

505
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:09,510
host is dead or it's just the link

506
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,970
towards earth crust is dead

507
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,850
locally we cannot really decide that

508
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:17,430
means that only horse decides and host

509
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:19,500
makes a decision to inject more specific

510
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:23,700
routes in case of one of the airplane

511
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:26,790
sparrow and another thing is that leaf

512
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:32,850
cannot decide locally if another leaf in

513
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:35,250
the pair is alive or dead and if you

514
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:37,290
have a bunch of specifics and we are

515
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:39,270
sure that another leaf is dead and not

516
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,980
an advertising the aggregate it's okay

517
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:44,850
to suppress that specifics those

518
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,770
specifics but if we don't we need to

519
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:52,649
propagate them and that decision cannot

520
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:54,720
be made locally that could be a really

521
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:57,510
serious problem because if you consider

522
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,270
a scenario with a power cycle or powerup

523
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:02,790
for pod or even entire data centers

524
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:05,220
switches in the prayer never comes up at

525
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:08,159
the same time and it can be a real

526
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,980
massive injection of specific routes so

527
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,770
how it looks

528
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:16,679
first consider that pair and just couple

529
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,590
hosts at such are patched and whatever

530
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:25,280
for on one of the links so both switches

531
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:29,129
but originated aggregate for the pair

532
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:33,899
they agree Braca been propagated north

533
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:36,780
and host x sees that it has lost one of

534
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:38,870
the op links and decides to inject more

535
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,040
specific routes and everything basically

536
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:45,090
works as expected because that specific

537
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:49,830
attracts all the traffic towards the

538
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:53,428
host but consider the situation when

539
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:55,830
entire switch goes down now or all the

540
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:58,590
hosts attached to the pair of switches

541
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:01,350
are injecting more specific routes

542
00:32:58,590 --> 00:33:04,159
because they locally decided that it's

543
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:08,449
time to inject specifics to be reachable

544
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:10,750
but in this case really switch eight

545
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:13,550
have to propagate also specific because

546
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:15,890
switch pin is down it doesn't recognize

547
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:18,320
aggregate it doesn't attract the traffic

548
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:21,410
so it's enough to only propagate that

549
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:23,360
aggregate but it's impossible to do that

550
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:30,140
decision locally without information

551
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:34,189
about neighbors so that basically

552
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:37,070
scenarios what's common in all of them

553
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:39,110
is that the proper decision making in

554
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,389
those scenarios depend on non-local

555
00:33:39,110 --> 00:33:43,729
information and it's very difficult to

556
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:47,660
achieve if we are using path vector

557
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:50,810
routing but it solves all scenarios

558
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:53,780
nicely in particular because of both

559
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:56,649
link state propagation north and south

560
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:59,000
reflection South's reflection allows to

561
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:03,140
distribute information about neighbors

562
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:06,020
on the same level so we know that if the

563
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:09,380
neighbor is alive or dead and what kind

564
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,780
of support information and what kind of

565
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:13,640
reach ability it has and it allows to

566
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:20,500
solve a lot of those problems without

567
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:23,239
some extra mechanism or trying to attach

568
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:24,980
finite States machine to the BGP or

569
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:36,649
whatever without some external

570
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:40,460
decision-making logic that's it Tony we

571
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:46,510
decided to let you talk now and then to

572
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,510
continuous applicability any questions

573
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:53,469
thank you Dima

574
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,819
so if you're interested in backup

575
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:05,700
section you could download slides it

576
00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:08,849
shows you how next web structure looks

577
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:19,439
like and I love to explain in details

578
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:21,060
what was told and I'm only told you half

579
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,369
the truth because they're doing very

580
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:28,920
interesting things yeah and actually

581
00:35:26,369 --> 00:35:30,960
it's a practical output from having

582
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,640
people lab that staff and looking like

583
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,260
this aggregation behavior right in the

584
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,750
cost of routes is that some people are

585
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:39,210
asking actually for knobs were at

586
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:42,240
between the leaf and the pod level

587
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:44,069
especially the run server they would

588
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,279
like to have the desegregation all the

589
00:35:44,069 --> 00:35:49,490
time because that singing 3 speeds up

590
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,260
you know link failure to the to the leaf

591
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:54,000
without actually being a big burden so

592
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:56,400
if you have a rack with 40 servers it's

593
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,780
like you know hundred addresses so they

594
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,490
would like to have to Don the server

595
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,960
always pretty for desegregated they

596
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,848
don't want to deal with the first link

597
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,380
failure whereas at higher levels of

598
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,599
course you can cause a lot of these

599
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,400
aggregation all right so I basically

600
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:10,470
tell you what was going on in nothing

601
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,420
too exciting specs done which is like

602
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:19,078
going through the motions documenting

603
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:20,700
more and more so the village sketches is

604
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:23,250
another thing so I just tell you what's

605
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,169
going on the review status so that's

606
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:27,450
like the second round we had actually

607
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:31,230
already a first round on the force stuff

608
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:33,000
done and now we progressed to the age so

609
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,920
from the security side we kind of

610
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,079
cleared everything up which I mean those

611
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,170
are the people most interesting

612
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:42,510
questions so that that stuff is all

613
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:44,369
wrapped up and all from the ops inform

614
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:47,250
the routing year we had basically you

615
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:49,760
know issues to clean up and on the Jen

616
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:55,260
art from sparks we got like not ready

617
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,760
and somewhat a larger discussion I talk

618
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,069
about a lot of although I improved on

619
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,020
the on the truss but basically the beak

620
00:36:59,069 --> 00:37:02,640
I'll talk talk also about what is

621
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,240
outstanding but would I not mention is

622
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,359
that from one reviewer came

623
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,930
well instead the spec that will work

624
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:17,820
right like it's under specified by my

625
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:20,490
feeling like yeah so the argument was

626
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,680
okay we have to and you know the spec is

627
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:25,618
not precise enough people will do weird

628
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:26,609
stuff so the best answer we had was okay

629
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:28,830
you have to interoperable

630
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:30,410
implementations fully document that you

631
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:32,430
know carefully it really lasts two years

632
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:34,529
look it up we have a circuit

633
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:37,410
implementation come going at least I

634
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:39,090
know over fourth and all the questions

635
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,629
these people ask can be basically

636
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:44,520
pointed at the spec so I asked for well

637
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:46,710
please please give me a measuring stick

638
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:48,900
right what you mean like the spec is

639
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:50,369
ready except your gut feeling and

640
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:53,119
nothing came back so I assume that it

641
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:55,980
will take care of itself

642
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,080
so let's look what I cleaned up and what

643
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:03,270
is still outstanding and where I asked

644
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:05,040
to like some participation so the Yaak

645
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:06,930
of way whatever is to contest that you

646
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,270
just remove it and the life goes on so

647
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:12,149
the requirements section it was not as

648
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:14,070
much as discussion of requirements but

649
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,109
like why is a requirement section in

650
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:19,530
there right so like well we removed it

651
00:38:16,109 --> 00:38:20,850
fine why should we care is that extra

652
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:22,320
came from two reviewers like one

653
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:23,670
reviewer and more had discussion if two

654
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:26,280
reviewers said like you know why is the

655
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:29,070
requirement section there though

656
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,990
requirement section is going the SR

657
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:32,730
extension section is gone because that's

658
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:34,410
in a different draft so they asked why

659
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:37,920
sits stuff overlapping and it's not

660
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:39,299
complete so that's removed and that was

661
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,280
actually fairly persistent that it's

662
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,650
very very much surprising because it is

663
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,869
very contrary to what I heard originally

664
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,540
from people which is that they like a

665
00:38:45,869 --> 00:38:51,750
narrative right explain it better and

666
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:53,970
please push the implementation super

667
00:38:51,750 --> 00:38:55,560
detail somewhere off so there was only

668
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:57,990
in appendices now two reviewers came

669
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,910
back and said like well I didn't even

670
00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,560
think this stuff works until I finally

671
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,540
arrived the appendices where I actually

672
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,600
could reach out the protocol works so

673
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,240
they wanted it Pauline so all the FSM

674
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:13,890
and all the procedures oh okay I pulled

675
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:16,859
it in so that has been done then there

676
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:19,410
was a lot of very good actually like

677
00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:20,319
three reviewers people really chewed

678
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:22,270
through this

679
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,220
one reviewer kind of you know ran out of

680
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,450
time of 3/4 of the document but two

681
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,129
reviewers really chewed through the

682
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:32,618
document like really really careful

683
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:35,350
reading and the glossary section has so

684
00:39:32,619 --> 00:39:38,380
no dag and ztp I think there was a

685
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:39,880
little bit of arrow but then they

686
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,650
hammered on the three-way well this is a

687
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,140
3-way which is a bi-directional idea

688
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:46,660
sincere i this is loose so that has been

689
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,319
specified out precisely there was

690
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:52,299
actually a SPF north and south split was

691
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,770
not specified so that is now in glossary

692
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,750
properly there was something more so

693
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,630
security and the law right they said

694
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,460
basically when you read it with with the

695
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,590
time it becomes clear but when you heat

696
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:07,840
it you don't know what it is so it makes

697
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:10,240
just lowers readability of the draft so

698
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:11,560
I thought it was it was really excellent

699
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,970
I mean there really must have gone

700
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:16,869
carefully through his stuff and thought

701
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:19,990
about it then another very good comment

702
00:40:16,869 --> 00:40:22,330
was that with the anti and estée people

703
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:25,209
were confusing anti with the node thai

704
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:26,830
because we have no north I note South

705
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,290
Thai and the one writer we started to

706
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:31,270
throw this entire nest ice and in some

707
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,759
examples people got confused so the

708
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,800
whole spec of the entire estée has

709
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:40,750
basically has been expanded to north or

710
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:43,210
south Thai it was it's a small thing but

711
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:48,150
two people said that you know that is

712
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:51,460
where the stumbled in a know mentally

713
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:54,340
the general topology they cross Bart bar

714
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,859
cross bars which you know is very key

715
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:01,380
but obviously not an easy read no matter

716
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:04,029
how well we try to put it out there that

717
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:05,830
has been what people nailed on it there

718
00:41:04,030 --> 00:41:07,750
was no terminology section so we were

719
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:08,920
kind of like introducing the terminology

720
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,119
as we went along and a bunch of

721
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:12,070
variables here and there so that has

722
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,140
been pulled up to make for a simple

723
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:20,260
reading and then you know these pictures

724
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:22,180
ASCII art right people were stumbling

725
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:23,920
because it's really complex stuff you

726
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,419
remember I told you the HH will confuse

727
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,800
the hell out of people let's make it an

728
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,510
O right so everything is going to

729
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,080
replace with a little dot because people

730
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:33,790
we have these 2h h for an rj45 jacks and

731
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:36,250
people stumble

732
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:38,770
like other one is this - or in our

733
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:40,600
pictures change it sounds trivial but

734
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:43,300
you get from two people means like yeah

735
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:49,660
it's a mental hurdle right to understand

736
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:51,190
this back then we had a lot of things

737
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:53,080
where things were still called spines

738
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:55,540
which is like a very very old staff

739
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:58,000
which were really top of fabrics so that

740
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:00,070
improve you know just properly named

741
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,800
things the way we introduced them on

742
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:06,850
readability of example there was I mean

743
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,580
that's an is is flavor respect so we

744
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:12,250
have these deep clauses and there were 1

745
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,860
point 1 point 2 point 3 / 4 and you know

746
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:17,710
after discussion with a reviewer eat

747
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:19,930
much better to like change the numbering

748
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:25,230
which to XML to RFC allows you so you

749
00:42:19,930 --> 00:42:27,879
have like you know number alphabet Roman

750
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:31,090
something right so it makes for like

751
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:33,760
easier discussion it doesn't needs but I

752
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:35,830
mean ultimately this thing if it comes

753
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:40,420
multiple times it will help people I

754
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:43,000
mean not a big price and then lots of

755
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:45,310
stuff on the normative so stuff like UI

756
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:50,470
6 T 4 you know those discussion I mean

757
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:52,480
the spec I agree we have been lent int

758
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:54,100
right so people start to point out well

759
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,140
that's really normative that should be

760
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,980
caps right so there was a couple of

761
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:01,660
cases that we corrected what fell out

762
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,280
was an interesting discussion and

763
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,720
there's more like open to the group I

764
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,090
mean we're very far where like in the

765
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,330
last things but taste so we're not an

766
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,400
immovable think the question was brought

767
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:14,230
up or do we should introduce something

768
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,290
into the schema to support the BFD

769
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,570
strict mode so I put a clarification in

770
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,620
how the PFT is supposed to work because

771
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,710
that wasn't clear

772
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,480
it wasn't breaking the spec but people

773
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,520
could do different things so there would

774
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,380
be mildly unexpected so at night

775
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,660
basically BFD behaves like all the

776
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,980
undocumented OSPF eyes eyes behavior

777
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,259
which is basically lengthy and you don't

778
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:37,630
wait for BFT and now the specs are out

779
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,720
with the BFD strict mode on bgp and I as

780
00:43:37,630 --> 00:43:43,000
I saw SPF right because it's somewhat a

781
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,220
real problem in certain deployments or

782
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,890
should we put something into the schema

783
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:50,890
still if you make it normative

784
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:54,460
you'll have to wait and strictly beeps

785
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:56,650
nowhere close to the top I don't know

786
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:59,860
it's a good I don't even know what the

787
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,720
strict mode has to be normative right so

788
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:03,280
like you can safely ignore it everything

789
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:04,450
will work but if you don't have to

790
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,540
indication you don't know whether the

791
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:09,700
other guy desires and strict so like you

792
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,259
have no signaling you you may ignore the

793
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,640
signal by you don't have to signal you

794
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:17,950
cannot know whether you're willing to

795
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,509
use it or ignore it just become and the

796
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:22,200
fact that it's optional doesn't mean

797
00:44:19,510 --> 00:44:25,900
that it doesn't need to be normal so

798
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:28,750
it's a separate draft on strict BD in

799
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:30,070
read yeah but you unique the information

800
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:33,070
element to indicate that you want it

801
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:36,220
strict which would basically necessitate

802
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:38,170
a minor schema revision and since we

803
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:39,899
know that RFC da to do with just one

804
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,340
little field so what's the big deal I

805
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:44,590
don't know just a question to the room

806
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:46,890
and after you know the reviewers went

807
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:49,660
through the stuff you know with pincers

808
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:53,620
then and that's a very interesting

809
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:56,740
discussion for Alvaro now I basically

810
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:58,990
the spec has somehow to pour the schema

811
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:02,500
into registries right because that's

812
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:06,669
what we have and our registry are only

813
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:09,400
built for maybe one small space with 200

814
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:11,170
numbers this schema is generating pages

815
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:14,470
and pages pages of requests right

816
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:17,800
because every schema element if you want

817
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:20,560
is its own namespace and it has elements

818
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:23,140
inside and each of them have a reserved

819
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,450
value possibly right so the first thing

820
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,129
is you have the schema element I wish I

821
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,470
would have and so now you have a

822
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:32,230
structure something and you like GRP see

823
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:33,549
every element is numbered so you have to

824
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:36,400
reserve those elements you have say I

825
00:45:33,550 --> 00:45:39,520
need a namespace for whatever tie an

826
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,220
entire I have four different elements

827
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,370
and they have numbering one two three

828
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:47,350
four so we have to reserve that and then

829
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,270
within that their structures again right

830
00:45:47,350 --> 00:45:51,310
so you start to generate pages I mean

831
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:53,290
knowing me I just wrote a small schema

832
00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,509
compiled on bank how he comes right here

833
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:58,630
is all my requests now he said the right

834
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:01,360
thing to do if you want to keep the

835
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:03,100
registries I do yes because otherwise we

836
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:07,180
basically have to say we don't use

837
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:10,480
registry the schema is the registry in

838
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:12,370
fact well so and here's one value of

839
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,290
registries I see a big value actually

840
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:16,540
because the schema could be the

841
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:19,570
normative registry there's comment from

842
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:21,880
Runa the registry is not the right place

843
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:24,250
to publish a model we don't public young

844
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:27,340
models in the registry do yeah so here's

845
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:31,750
observation brew noise is always almost

846
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:35,410
right he can talk and that's good so

847
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:38,590
there is a big value to the registry I

848
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:42,690
see and you will see that when so let's

849
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:47,740
say we have this schema version two and

850
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:49,870
now we go to version 3 so like yeah okay

851
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:52,930
so we have new set of registry for

852
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:54,490
version 3 right but mostly we go miners

853
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:57,669
like let's add a field that's an

854
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:59,529
optional field and those are the schema

855
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,720
goes from 2 0 2 to 1 which means that

856
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:03,670
anybody who runs to 0 will find a we

857
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,129
work is like a drusen I as I still tell

858
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:08,470
thee that you ignore but now we could

859
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:12,460
maintain in the schema something that

860
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:15,390
reserved structure but actually versions

861
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:18,760
with schema version supports this field

862
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:21,220
and now if an implementer that's really

863
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:24,610
really helpful because I can write an

864
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,259
implementation and I can look at the

865
00:47:24,610 --> 00:47:28,120
pack and go like ok it's comes with two

866
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,550
ones oh I know oh I can go and look at

867
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:33,850
this field and it comes with two zero

868
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,250
and now I know I don't have to but now

869
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,900
if you just have the previous document

870
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,640
with your schema to zero and then

871
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,740
another documents get probably with two

872
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,370
one you have to run a diff and hope for

873
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:44,770
the best

874
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:46,270
whereas the registry is very normative

875
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,130
it's very you can look at the whole

876
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:50,020
thing and see which version supports you

877
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:54,310
know which field so I think there's a

878
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:57,550
lot potentially lot of value having

879
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,220
registries running this way no because

880
00:47:57,550 --> 00:48:02,680
the histo histo Racal track is then very

881
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:04,629
normative very well controlled and what

882
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,750
also that can of course happen so let's

883
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:09,010
say you have the schema version 2 I'd

884
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,110
really are completely independent of

885
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:13,930
riffed if we go into now schema stuff

886
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,200
that's all just price of living right

887
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:17,500
for

888
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:19,390
luxury of avoiding 90% of the dumb work

889
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:21,540
we're doing manually that the schema

890
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:24,368
compiler does for us this is the price

891
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:26,500
so the other thing that the registry

892
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:28,510
will avoid is that we have a document

893
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,700
published to zero right and now two

894
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:32,980
extensions come up like two eyes I steal

895
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,618
these same thing and they basically

896
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:37,359
start to extend the schema and they go

897
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:39,550
like to one and the other one is to one

898
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:41,348
or even two too but they can collide by

899
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:43,960
taking a code point on the structure

900
00:48:41,349 --> 00:48:45,339
right so if you don't have anything you

901
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,150
may just happily progress those

902
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:50,560
documents and extend the schema and

903
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:52,510
everything hits the fan even publish

904
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:54,130
them and everything hits the fan where

905
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:57,160
people named implemented they say do

906
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:59,770
documents look the same code point right

907
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,868
even if the schema they even if they

908
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,490
talk to each other and they realize are

909
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:06,339
you thinking two one oh you better take

910
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:09,459
two - right now the two - does it imply

911
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:11,020
that - one is in it well maybe not even

912
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,540
right so now you have to synchronize the

913
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,609
guys who gonna do that they may talk to

914
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:17,259
each other if you're lucky but if they

915
00:49:15,609 --> 00:49:19,299
meet on the registry and they have to

916
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,650
ask okay I'm coming with the - one with

917
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:22,690
this field and the other people tell

918
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:24,819
them no not first two ones already taken

919
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:27,400
and second this field is possibly the

920
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:29,770
same value then you cannot devolved its

921
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,050
utilizes the schema evolution right

922
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:34,000
because the schema the beauties in like

923
00:49:32,050 --> 00:49:36,339
eyes I steal these multiple people can

924
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,980
progress it but ultimately when multiple

925
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:40,450
people progress eyes eyes extension they

926
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:42,040
have to go to the registry and ask for

927
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:42,848
the number and if the number collides

928
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:45,970
it's a no-go

929
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:48,190
and here the registry would play the

930
00:49:45,970 --> 00:49:50,770
same serialization right it will make

931
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,829
sure that the schema version progress in

932
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:55,359
a linear fashion and second that you

933
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:59,650
will not have a collision of the code

934
00:49:55,359 --> 00:50:01,930
points so I think there's value I learn

935
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:03,010
what do you think I mean it starts a

936
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:05,609
discussion

937
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:09,160
years ago right how we're going to

938
00:50:05,609 --> 00:50:12,670
normatively what are we doing with the

939
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:14,319
schema so the document right now has a

940
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:16,230
long iron a section I'm assuming that

941
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:20,079
you're doing registers right now right

942
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:21,670
well which is a news item generated I

943
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:23,140
compile the schema and I produce this

944
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:25,300
wonderful Lyanna section but it's all

945
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:27,368
the same reason that you just said avoid

946
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,300
collisions and in case of extensions

947
00:50:27,369 --> 00:50:32,980
something that

948
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:36,160
I agree I have no idea how often major

949
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:38,380
schema verses are gonna come by yeah or

950
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,700
anything like that because if it's every

951
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:42,640
six months then who cares

952
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:45,160
I just engine stand I think things are

953
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:47,350
really make sense so either this stop

954
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:49,870
will be not successful which means quiet

955
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:51,549
life or otherwise if this thing becomes

956
00:50:49,870 --> 00:50:54,670
let's assume it becomes wildly

957
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:56,890
successful just like is Isis then I mean

958
00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,810
what is the resolution I mean how often

959
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:03,750
do we extend eius eius so command like

960
00:50:58,810 --> 00:51:07,410
six months jabber come in from Bruna

961
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,640
so I'm Jeffrey so they say I'm a green

962
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:12,220
let's just serialize the models

963
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:14,859
themselves her publishes Model T one

964
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:18,629
first wins the other party has to fix

965
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:21,400
the merge conflict and publish to the to

966
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:23,110
yeah but then you know how do we publish

967
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:24,760
models because right now it's just part

968
00:51:23,110 --> 00:51:26,740
of a document I stuck it isn't append

969
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:29,700
exist at the right way or maybe we have

970
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:37,629
a special registry type called schema I

971
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:39,310
know but I mean we I think we won't be

972
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:45,640
able to avoid the benefits of schema

973
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:46,750
longer term alright so I just set it out

974
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,540
there in the room that was what was

975
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:52,120
going on then a very good comment

976
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,830
someone read the math section of the

977
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:55,330
sequence number and realized that I was

978
00:51:53,830 --> 00:51:56,770
full of it when I called in all the

979
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:59,590
relations symmetric so they needed

980
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:03,700
fixing so there is the two to do store

981
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:06,340
out there so one observation was that

982
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,230
it's very cute that I'm giving them a

983
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:10,210
dot thing and you can run into a dot

984
00:52:08,230 --> 00:52:11,800
compiler and look at the FSM but it's

985
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,900
not like you know the most beautiful

986
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,360
thing in the world we have the version 3

987
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:18,790
and exactly one RFC published so it's

988
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:21,130
like going because I think we looked at

989
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:25,750
it six months ago it wasn't there yet so

990
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:28,120
I have to put the SVG in which we have

991
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:31,150
right off the FSM and publishes as as

992
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:34,270
version 3 in PDF with the pictures so

993
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:39,010
that's something isn't it the second one

994
00:52:34,270 --> 00:52:41,170
is basically simplify the language right

995
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,070
you know that the famous thing like so

996
00:52:41,170 --> 00:52:43,270
the same

997
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:45,910
who said the speck it maybe

998
00:52:43,270 --> 00:52:47,920
underspecified heads said that it's too

999
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:49,509
much text maybe it should be simpler so

1000
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,200
it's like the the Mozart movie you know

1001
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:56,140
where after the opera the Emperor tells

1002
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,509
Mozart you know too many notes a great

1003
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:01,359
thing was just too many notes right so

1004
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:03,010
we but we have to tie it in the language

1005
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:04,860
I mean I'm sympathetic with that which

1006
00:53:03,010 --> 00:53:07,090
means probably shorter sentences

1007
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:10,020
smoothing over the declaration you know

1008
00:53:07,090 --> 00:53:13,720
the the some of the descriptive text

1009
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:16,380
volunteers highly desire right and it's

1010
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,520
basically just reading and just

1011
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:20,350
smoothing the language into more

1012
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:22,120
readable text it wasn't like it's

1013
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:23,799
factually wrong or you know it's very

1014
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,920
unclear some of the sound like can you

1015
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,570
at this and the other but basically

1016
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:30,730
smooth this thing for easier reading

1017
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,400
sentence is too long maybe no little bit

1018
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:36,540
on complexity sometimes you know context

1019
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:41,470
may be better clarified so that's just

1020
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:43,680
no no magic just need some good reader

1021
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:48,220
who is willing to discuss stuff a little

1022
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,620
my scale here the RFC editor is usually

1023
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:53,140
fantastic at helping doing this I mean

1024
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:56,140
could we just open up a bit the envelope

1025
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:58,150
of what we ask from them and say eh

1026
00:53:56,140 --> 00:54:00,279
in this case you're allowed to look a

1027
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,440
bit more into the working of our

1028
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:06,580
sentences because they help already

1029
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:07,630
doing this no okay Adrian off you know

1030
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:12,670
something I don't know

1031
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:14,170
well Adrian is editorially true the RCO

1032
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:18,220
does a wonderful job all the time

1033
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:19,960
however we need document to be readable

1034
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:24,100
and reviewable by a bunch of other

1035
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:28,600
people so I would prefer if it's Jeff's

1036
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:29,620
just before if this was done before in

1037
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,870
other words we don't want to just leave

1038
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:32,770
everything to the editor because you

1039
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:35,410
know they have a lot of work done

1040
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:37,060
hundred and fifty four-page spec writes

1041
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:39,580
and I also think it's non-productive

1042
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,500
right because what you want is sit there

1043
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:43,569
and have someone read and ask question

1044
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:45,220
and smooth it it's not like you throw it

1045
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:47,020
over to the editor it comes with a bunch

1046
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:51,580
of question he's like hungry 140 pages

1047
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:53,920
right so I mean I got these comments and

1048
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:55,900
it wasn't like it's unusable

1049
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,390
it's more like well

1050
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:00,609
no it could be smoother all right

1051
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:05,368
sentences sometimes too long edging on

1052
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:08,410
here get on the grammar look at stuff so

1053
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:10,029
no I need volunteers who are willing to

1054
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:11,828
sit in a room no in a room for an hour

1055
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:13,390
and read through sound as well that

1056
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:15,549
doesn't read well can you like smoothie

1057
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,200
I mean I'm not I'm not I'm doing the

1058
00:55:15,549 --> 00:55:19,630
editing so not a big deal but it just

1059
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:21,910
needs someone who will put the brain to

1060
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:25,000
look you through another lens okay

1061
00:55:21,910 --> 00:55:28,000
comment from Bruna I suggest just given

1062
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:29,770
up on going SVG diagrams ATF to support

1063
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,349
that's not good enough it is a huge

1064
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:35,230
hurdle in reading text version let's

1065
00:55:32,349 --> 00:55:36,309
just do ASCII art fsm diagram instead I

1066
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,910
can do it

1067
00:55:36,309 --> 00:55:41,890
not really but next week sure I mean

1068
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:43,569
these things are complex so I don't know

1069
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:45,430
whether we can squeeze in ASCII well I

1070
00:55:43,569 --> 00:55:47,349
assume Bruno can or we can break it up

1071
00:55:45,430 --> 00:55:49,538
into multiple HSV's just subsets of

1072
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:51,760
transitions publish these things are so

1073
00:55:49,539 --> 00:55:53,529
bloody rigid you touch anything you know

1074
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:55,420
you have to manually update it but yeah

1075
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:57,250
so I don't know how good these days VG

1076
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,650
stuff I just started and I saw that it's

1077
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:01,720
pretty arcane but I assume it works if

1078
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:03,819
it doesn't and of course you know it's

1079
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,480
much less fun alright

1080
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:10,089
and the last one was people pointed out

1081
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,950
that more stuff should be normative and

1082
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:15,549
that's again you know we really need

1083
00:56:11,950 --> 00:56:17,078
yeah just quick question format its

1084
00:56:15,549 --> 00:56:19,480
document already in version 3 or just

1085
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:21,339
relationship no I started on version 3

1086
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:26,260
and I look for example I realized this

1087
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:28,690
one RFC published in version 3 right the

1088
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:31,510
one and he doesn't have any picture so

1089
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:33,220
like yeah yeah exactly so then I started

1090
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:36,010
to look at Wade's document and how you

1091
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:40,058
put a picture in and it could be the

1092
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:43,119
first yes it looked fairly arcane but

1093
00:56:40,059 --> 00:56:45,190
you know my mana if you know good well a

1094
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,279
well meant assumption was that the stuff

1095
00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:50,260
actually works well I think I'll be

1096
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:52,420
pushing the curve and Bruno does the

1097
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:54,880
ASCII art we see where we end ok

1098
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:57,069
and don't fine-tooth comb on the

1099
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,839
normative that more stuff needs to be

1100
00:56:57,069 --> 00:57:01,240
normative I got one two examples which

1101
00:56:58,839 --> 00:57:03,130
were correct right but it's again

1102
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,899
reading and thinking through the stuff

1103
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:08,829
that's probably less for people who just

1104
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:09,800
enjoy you know and English and smooth

1105
00:57:08,829 --> 00:57:11,270
English that's more

1106
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,890
the people who are actually well in the

1107
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,950
protocol for a bit because it can lead

1108
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:18,319
to discussion because the protocol is

1109
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:20,810
because it's very free routing is

1110
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:24,230
extremely permissive compared to normal

1111
00:57:20,810 --> 00:57:26,360
stuff we allow tons of stuff because

1112
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,310
well do what you want you can break it

1113
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,270
like you know replace your algorithm

1114
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:32,690
what do we care

1115
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:34,370
right which normal protocols don't but

1116
00:57:32,690 --> 00:57:36,830
there were a little bit of discussions

1117
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:41,240
but that's pretty much the output from

1118
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:44,900
them from the reviewers so basically I

1119
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:48,379
think that I addressed except the Jen

1120
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:51,710
art which was Sparks and possibly I

1121
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,180
think the ops dear gave me some of these

1122
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:54,160
readability comments which I have to

1123
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:58,910
address yeah

1124
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:01,690
John you Tony Jones cutter it occurs to

1125
00:57:58,910 --> 00:58:03,799
me that since you spent so much time

1126
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:06,320
intimidating people by mentioning the

1127
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,620
page count on your document and then

1128
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:13,670
saying that you want detailed review

1129
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:15,109
lots of these appendix don't worry and

1130
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:19,420
since you're so good at parallelism

1131
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:21,740
maybe you know it might work I mean it's

1132
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:24,110
you get a certain quality of review this

1133
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:26,000
way but to the extent that what you're

1134
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:27,950
trying to do is smooth out sentence as

1135
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,080
it could work as you could farm out you

1136
00:58:27,950 --> 00:58:32,330
know sections to different reviewers so

1137
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:34,730
maybe I don't have time to do 150 pages

1138
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:37,250
for you but maybe 20 pages would be

1139
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:39,200
pretty easy to a certain extent I think

1140
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:44,120
the introductory I mean so I have been

1141
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:48,830
misled by this group who was originally

1142
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:50,870
very you know insistent that they like

1143
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:53,029
in their ativ rather than the drawers

1144
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:56,000
back and then their ratings do not

1145
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:59,030
paralyse that well but you know they're

1146
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:00,440
the narrative' is the front so I don't

1147
00:58:59,030 --> 00:59:02,420
think that can be practically split up

1148
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,560
especially it has to like lead one into

1149
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:05,930
the next you have to understand why you

1150
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,790
desegregate and you understand what is a

1151
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:10,009
Fallen Leaf and why you need negative

1152
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,900
but from their own yeah like ztp could

1153
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:14,330
be probably just completely ripped out

1154
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:17,450
and reviewed separately John have you

1155
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:21,040
just volunteered to to review it hugely

1156
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:21,040
without a commitment to a date

1157
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:30,900
for the purposes of the minutes I have

1158
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:32,549
absolutely not agreed to do that but

1159
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:35,970
Tony can buy me a beer later and we'll

1160
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,680
talk so it surprised it's not with Joey

1161
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:39,180
where's like that you ply him with beer

1162
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,140
or beverage of choice and hope for the

1163
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:45,180
best okay so that's pretty much the

1164
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:48,450
status on the documents I think we're in

1165
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:50,520
a good spot just grinding forward until

1166
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:55,189
the reviewers are a happy bunch I think

1167
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:55,190
I don't think the reviews have been um

1168
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:01,860
half of them were fairly stringent which

1169
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,990
is a good thing all right

1170
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,670
but I think they can be satisfied and

1171
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:07,259
rolled forward I mean there's no road

1172
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,970
blockers like major stuff except this

1173
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,320
one comment like is it the specification

1174
01:00:08,970 --> 01:00:11,700
good you know for which I get no answer

1175
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,760
like you have two implementations now

1176
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:19,220
what you're looking for an IQ spec where

1177
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:25,200
ITF right so okay questions

1178
01:00:19,220 --> 01:00:27,660
encouragement bribes no all right I'm

1179
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:31,109
done good working thank you for

1180
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:33,240
addressing terrorism time and we are

1181
01:00:31,110 --> 01:00:35,990
moving to the applicability statement

1182
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,990
presentation

1183
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:59,099
so yeah I wonder if it works which one

1184
01:00:55,789 --> 01:01:05,009
the door Mike no not the Mike the

1185
01:00:59,099 --> 01:01:08,630
clicker oh it stopped working okay

1186
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:10,799
so now going to the applicability draft

1187
01:01:08,630 --> 01:01:13,589
basically we are talking about updates

1188
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:17,038
since the previous a Jeff and next step

1189
01:01:13,589 --> 01:01:19,589
so what was changed and mostly not

1190
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:22,579
changed most landed as well escaping

1191
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:24,779
examples please

1192
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:30,869
especially with miss cabling between

1193
01:01:24,779 --> 01:01:33,719
layers ipv4 over ipv6 fabric no home in

1194
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:35,930
summers fabric with a controller we

1195
01:01:33,719 --> 01:01:38,579
scrapped off options where to attach it

1196
01:01:35,930 --> 01:01:42,269
submit mismatch and addressed feminists

1197
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:47,160
and any cost consideration next light

1198
01:01:42,269 --> 01:01:50,399
please so here we mostly have diagrams

1199
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:53,249
from the applicability draft and from is

1200
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:57,150
cabling we consider interaction between

1201
01:01:53,249 --> 01:02:00,209
ztp in particular and not only but also

1202
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:03,029
ztp and mascara in between levels which

1203
01:02:00,209 --> 01:02:05,160
is in rate apology so what kind of miss

1204
01:02:03,029 --> 01:02:08,819
cabling can we have and how pruning

1205
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:11,249
works in that case because if it's not

1206
01:02:08,819 --> 01:02:16,769
part of well it apologies that link

1207
01:02:11,249 --> 01:02:21,419
should be pruned next place before will

1208
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:25,618
be six so basic idea is drifted in

1209
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:31,289
advertising before prefixes and using v6

1210
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:34,619
network same as our C 55 for 49 for

1211
01:02:31,289 --> 01:02:38,969
example so using online v6 topology and

1212
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:41,819
using it as next hopefully for and it's

1213
01:02:38,969 --> 01:02:45,359
expected that Intel fabric you supports

1214
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:47,219
at the same time of just families but

1215
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:50,308
it's possible to indicate what kind of

1216
01:02:47,219 --> 01:02:54,410
rotors families no supports so it is

1217
01:02:50,309 --> 01:02:56,339
possible to have two different

1218
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:58,558
topologies for different addressed

1219
01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:01,308
families on top of the same physical

1220
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:01,309
topology

1221
01:03:03,859 --> 01:03:11,750
also there is a section for doorman

1222
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:14,549
servers and disaggregation scenarios I

1223
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:21,119
relapsed a lot is what I discussed it

1224
01:03:14,549 --> 01:03:23,819
before and also options for touching the

1225
01:03:21,119 --> 01:03:26,309
controller which can be attached as if

1226
01:03:23,819 --> 01:03:30,119
from the top so top of fabric notes or

1227
01:03:26,309 --> 01:03:35,490
from the bottom of the fabric there are

1228
01:03:30,119 --> 01:03:37,980
some things to consider when we are

1229
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:41,308
touch controller to the top and when it

1230
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:44,759
loses some as a connectivity to the top

1231
01:03:41,309 --> 01:03:47,730
and nasan unusual when we attach in

1232
01:03:44,759 --> 01:03:49,859
controller from the leaf because sorry

1233
01:03:47,730 --> 01:03:52,349
it's more benign situation essentially

1234
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:59,788
because every scene is distributed

1235
01:03:52,349 --> 01:04:02,700
across the entire fabric also was that

1236
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:10,440
it subnet mismatched and addressed

1237
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:12,750
families and next slide please so any

1238
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:15,559
cost considerations and the reference to

1239
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:20,069
the policy guided practice prefixes

1240
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:22,529
because normally if you have any caste

1241
01:04:20,069 --> 01:04:25,920
and look from the top of fabric it's

1242
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:29,160
essentially multi pass route there is no

1243
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,880
way to sit in a particular node we have

1244
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:32,450
no way

1245
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:35,730
one for them to disk in Russia if it's

1246
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:41,569
just multi pass or single destination or

1247
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:45,450
E or any caste but there can be well it

1248
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:47,940
situation and we might want to

1249
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:50,549
specifically guide traffic for example

1250
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,950
if we inject traffic from some leaf

1251
01:04:50,549 --> 01:04:56,549
nodes and we have any kind any cars

1252
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:58,589
destinations behind some other leaf

1253
01:04:56,549 --> 01:05:01,500
nodes we essentially want to distribute

1254
01:04:58,589 --> 01:05:03,420
it to do Rio anycast and if there is

1255
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:05,130
another leaf with any cost

1256
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,230
destination attached within the same

1257
01:05:05,130 --> 01:05:10,019
port we will never reach they remain in

1258
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:12,660
nodes normally because it will be

1259
01:05:10,019 --> 01:05:13,689
shortcutted inside the port we don't

1260
01:05:12,660 --> 01:05:16,210
want to that

1261
01:05:13,690 --> 01:05:20,890
and to avoid it there is an option to

1262
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:24,369
use policy guided practices and I guess

1263
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:27,009
that's it yeah want comments

1264
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:31,000
there are also some to-do items on the

1265
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:32,109
applicability draft so I guess there

1266
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,990
will be at least one more iteration

1267
01:05:32,109 --> 01:05:37,480
before adoption 'but one I record least

1268
01:05:34,990 --> 01:05:45,240
for circular sections we used to do

1269
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:45,240
items that's it any questions comments

1270
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:53,500
okay thank you and we are done for the

1271
01:05:51,700 --> 01:06:08,919
SE TF will continue working

1272
01:05:53,500 --> 01:06:11,410
dony d ma I swear at it if you have a

1273
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,299
minute this is Bess Callaghan so I

1274
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:16,000
understand for the anycast sometimes you

1275
01:06:13,299 --> 01:06:17,799
don't want to route down within the pod

1276
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,750
you want to go to the other pod room

1277
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:21,700
yeah yeah we want to go to all the

1278
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:26,349
destination and distribute traffic more

1279
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:28,149
or less equally if you have some anycast

1280
01:06:26,349 --> 01:06:30,130
destination which is very close to us

1281
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:32,049
basically try and normally traffic

1282
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:35,200
routes shortcut to it yeah yeah and

1283
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:38,079
that's because we actually put in the

1284
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:40,089
rib the the information from the pod

1285
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:42,250
itself and we had the discussion about

1286
01:06:40,089 --> 01:06:43,930
tunneling a long time ago and maybe you

1287
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,809
will resurrect those ideas in a separate

1288
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:49,149
draft but there might be cases where are

1289
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:51,279
you in the in the top of that you don't

1290
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:52,779
want you learn this thing from the

1291
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:54,670
flooding but you actually don't put it

1292
01:06:52,779 --> 01:06:58,029
in your writing table you just pass it

1293
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:59,380
up sort of yeah and if you do that then

1294
01:06:58,029 --> 01:07:00,910
you get the kind of results you want

1295
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:04,359
right because because you don't have the

1296
01:07:00,910 --> 01:07:06,160
rot self to the unicast address there

1297
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:08,049
are cases for me the case was more

1298
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,190
mobility if things move very rapidly you

1299
01:07:08,049 --> 01:07:10,839
might want send them to the tough

1300
01:07:09,190 --> 01:07:14,049
because maybe I need a tough as a real

1301
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:16,319
state of where things are yeah that's

1302
01:07:14,049 --> 01:07:20,440
basically because we have ties which

1303
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:23,079
prescribe to which direction we can bind

1304
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:26,680
the route if it were talking about

1305
01:07:23,079 --> 01:07:27,970
anything not using some direction for

1306
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:30,990
any

1307
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:33,490
go to the top of fabric and then go

1308
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:36,399
other option is essentially to say in

1309
01:07:33,490 --> 01:07:38,890
designs and network around so we have

1310
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,630
this unicast destinations not in the

1311
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:45,670
same ports where very generate traffic

1312
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:47,740
that's also violet of course 20 P or

1313
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:49,030
otherwise you know we can have something

1314
01:07:47,740 --> 01:07:50,500
I mean we have communities on the

1315
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:52,360
prefixes right so you can put the

1316
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:54,340
community on the prefix do not install

1317
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:58,570
in the rip unless you're tough we can

1318
01:07:54,340 --> 01:08:04,840
just reserve a community does a very

1319
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:06,280
simple solution right precisely but I

1320
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,170
mean we already have met guys we could

1321
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:09,610
very easily use for this so that's

1322
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:11,950
probably one of the sections which

1323
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:15,460
should be modified because sent in any

1324
01:08:11,950 --> 01:08:22,540
caste is when a real problem in data

1325
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:30,010
center fabrics proper handling click

1326
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:31,720
here isn't working just comment so next

1327
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:33,430
one so basically did a couple of

1328
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:35,049
pictures to show you like to three

1329
01:08:33,430 --> 01:08:36,760
things what we talked about so there's

1330
01:08:35,049 --> 01:08:38,529
still a good amount of sections like t4

1331
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:40,210
from the leaf differ from the toff that

1332
01:08:38,529 --> 01:08:42,219
needs to flesh out and these kind of

1333
01:08:40,210 --> 01:08:43,870
discussions are ongoing and they come

1334
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:45,730
from like depending people play with it

1335
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:50,549
in laps and you know people thinking

1336
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:54,219
through the issues so next one so so

1337
01:08:50,549 --> 01:08:55,600
we'll show you quickly there well

1338
01:08:54,220 --> 01:09:00,780
without pictures doesn't work because

1339
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:06,700
all about pictures all of our pictures

1340
01:09:00,779 --> 01:09:14,830
can you hook up mine no well glorious

1341
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:25,139
failure in a couple of pictures without

1342
01:09:14,830 --> 01:09:27,590
pictures you want to stick now just give

1343
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:30,840
PowerPoint

1344
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:30,840

[Music]

1346
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:57,340
12 megabytes that thing dead was what

1347
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,469
did it in

1348
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:00,470

1349
01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:37,469
[Music]

1350
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:37,469
nope thing is unhappy otherwise you can

1351

[Music]

1352
01:10:49,410 --> 01:11:08,530
yeah got a picture here's a flip forward

1353
01:10:53,469 --> 01:11:12,120
to the picture please alright so here

1354
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:12,120
are my book beautiful pictures oh oh

1355
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:23,469
yeah okay so that's the dot all right

1356
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:25,960
I'll if you know the cage so that shows

1357
01:11:23,469 --> 01:11:29,500
you some of the configuration so what is

1358
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:31,900
the v4 of a v6 thingy so basically what

1359
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:36,520
happens is that if you come up and you

1360
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:39,219
only have v6 and D right you only have

1361
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:42,520
link local addresses and that's it

1362
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:44,170
and what riff does for you it indicates

1363
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,790
on the link whether the link is v4

1364
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:47,650
forward incapable because otherwise how

1365
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:50,620
do you know what they can do v4 over v6

1366
01:11:47,650 --> 01:11:52,660
or you can't alright so in case you know

1367
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:54,580
it is v4 capable and you have to link

1368
01:11:52,660 --> 01:11:55,389
locals and nothing else but it's of

1369
01:11:54,580 --> 01:11:57,309
course how you optimize your

1370
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:59,710
implementation you know you may be very

1371
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:01,750
smart about what you have v4 next so v6

1372
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:04,150
link law calls but let's say you know

1373
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:06,520
you have a link loco and you won't

1374
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,259
before and nothing else then what you'll

1375
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:11,370
have on your side of the implementation

1376
01:12:08,260 --> 01:12:14,170
you will have v6 table which is

1377
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:17,260
resolving Linley a link-local you know

1378
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:18,310
the B to the Mac and that's really

1379
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:20,380
everything that you need if you

1380
01:12:18,310 --> 01:12:22,480
implement it well so you can push a

1381
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:25,090
frame towards the v4 destination through

1382
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:27,699
this link and there's a gateway Mac you

1383
01:12:25,090 --> 01:12:33,070
just use the Mac of v6 and that works

1384
01:12:27,699 --> 01:12:35,990
just fine so that is what section of the

1385
01:12:33,070 --> 01:12:38,540
black ability document talks about

1386
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:39,920
now do you have to do it that way no I

1387
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:41,360
mean the implementation is fairly

1388
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:43,160
lengthy ain't right but it's like a

1389
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,950
technique that you can use that makes

1390
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:47,690
especially since we've forcing CTP so

1391
01:12:45,950 --> 01:12:49,880
much on the protocol that is such high

1392
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:52,629
demand that makes for very nice et PV

1393
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:56,050
for support on the fabric which is

1394
01:12:52,630 --> 01:13:00,940
basically no addressing just comes up v6

1395
01:12:56,050 --> 01:13:03,410
and the other one is so there is this

1396
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:05,240
problem that now so let's say you run

1397
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:07,670
your BGP in data center right so you run

1398
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,559
a v6 session and the v4 session or do

1399
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:11,300
you run one session with multiple next

1400
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,400
stops your divert eyes the same previous

1401
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:15,170
ones with the v4 necks or v6 next hops

1402
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,059
do you want to share fade if the session

1403
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:19,130
falls down both address families right

1404
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:21,320
so RIF gave a lot of consideration

1405
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:22,940
people playing the labs so they could be

1406
01:13:21,320 --> 01:13:26,000
blistex session I mean that's not part

1407
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:27,049
of the spec because kind of the spec is

1408
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,390
self-evident

1409
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:31,460
if you implemented it but if you didn't

1410
01:13:29,390 --> 01:13:33,410
then you know when they applicability

1411
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:36,590
document is very helpful because it

1412
01:13:33,410 --> 01:13:39,080
explained to you that the way that rift

1413
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:40,850
works is that you have multiple address

1414
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:42,880
families but they do not share faith

1415
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,940
right because we have two types of lies

1416
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:48,920
there's a v4 lie and a v6 lie and the

1417
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:50,599
point of those lies is that that's how

1418
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:52,880
you get the source address of the other

1419
01:13:50,600 --> 01:14:00,410
guy because you have to resolve the next

1420
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:02,420
hop now so that's well here that's what

1421
01:14:00,410 --> 01:14:04,220
I omitted right you get from node B when

1422
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:06,470
you get the lie with the v4 capable

1423
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:09,050
that's also how you know what his

1424
01:14:06,470 --> 01:14:10,550
address is right source address and then

1425
01:14:09,050 --> 01:14:12,890
you can resolve it to the Mac that you

1426
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:15,560
use it as his gateway to point as to him

1427
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:17,660
as a gateway but in this case something

1428
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:20,000
funky can have happen people can change

1429
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:22,849
configuration and all of a sudden the v6

1430
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,950
address he said the subnet mismatch and

1431
01:14:22,850 --> 01:14:27,110
there's a really dump idea to forward

1432
01:14:24,950 --> 01:14:28,849
through subnet mismatched links which is

1433
01:14:27,110 --> 01:14:31,280
is also used to do and but there are

1434
01:14:28,850 --> 01:14:33,680
documents explaining what happens if you

1435
01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:36,860
do that so you better not so you

1436
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:38,660
probably go and check subnets and if you

1437
01:14:36,860 --> 01:14:39,980
check the subnet what can happen is then

1438
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:43,550
we'll check the something that you will

1439
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:47,780
lose the v6 but the adjacency will stay

1440
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:49,460
up because the v4 is still up and drift

1441
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:51,830
document however says

1442
01:14:49,460 --> 01:14:55,700
that we do not remove a F's once we have

1443
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:57,470
them right because otherwise you end up

1444
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:59,990
in a hot mess of a really complicated

1445
01:14:57,470 --> 01:15:02,630
FSN so if you really want to rectify

1446
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:04,280
this condition you really have to clear

1447
01:15:02,630 --> 01:15:06,530
digestion see I mean you can just give

1448
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:09,590
an alarm and say look the v6 got an

1449
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:13,179
address mismatch and the other thing

1450
01:15:09,590 --> 01:15:15,350
that next one Jeffries

1451
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:17,750
sorry I really have to be in front and

1452
01:15:15,350 --> 01:15:21,530
point to it so this is some of the stuff

1453
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:23,270
that we talk about the loot bags for

1454
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:26,269
controllers and controllers

1455
01:15:23,270 --> 01:15:28,220
consideration and basically it all boils

1456
01:15:26,270 --> 01:15:30,200
down to how much of internal reach

1457
01:15:28,220 --> 01:15:32,450
ability do you need on the fabric by

1458
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,320
internal reach ability I mean which

1459
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:38,990
nodes do you want to get to from where

1460
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:41,480
because in the most extreme case this is

1461
01:15:38,990 --> 01:15:43,429
a fabric and without glue bags without

1462
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:46,610
anything it's literally switching fabric

1463
01:15:43,430 --> 01:15:50,120
just comes up to switch on v6 and the

1464
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:51,650
stuff works but now you go well maybe

1465
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:54,260
I'm not that comfortable with it and I

1466
01:15:51,650 --> 01:15:56,710
want to get to those nodes by a loopback

1467
01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:59,480
or something and there's also the

1468
01:15:56,710 --> 01:16:03,020
attaching controllers and so on presents

1469
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:05,360
the same points to the same no problem

1470
01:16:03,020 --> 01:16:07,490
you want to hit a specific point on the

1471
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:09,080
fabric somehow so if you start to look

1472
01:16:07,490 --> 01:16:11,750
at the loopback reachability so when you

1473
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:14,240
go from leaf to leaf the green stuff

1474
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:17,810
link failures present no problems you

1475
01:16:14,240 --> 01:16:21,200
just you you pop up the default right

1476
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:23,570
and even if it isn't desegregated it

1477
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:25,280
means the default works because

1478
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:27,320
otherwise referal desegregate and guide

1479
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,849
you the right way and once you hit the

1480
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:30,799
top of the fabric the guy knows

1481
01:16:28,850 --> 01:16:32,750
precisely which ways are feasible to get

1482
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,130
you to the leaf so leave to leave no

1483
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:36,860
special consideration leave to leave

1484
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:39,380
loop X always work right without

1485
01:16:36,860 --> 01:16:42,139
actually on a seeing B loopback it's

1486
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:45,020
unnecessary you just send towards B and

1487
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:48,200
the fabric will figure it out but if you

1488
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:50,630
want to go from bottom to top things

1489
01:16:48,200 --> 01:16:52,400
starts to get interesting right so

1490
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:55,250
that's kind of the North normal case and

1491
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:58,009
some people like that for bazillion

1492
01:16:55,250 --> 01:17:00,740
reasons now imagine someone wants to do

1493
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:03,290
egress engineering on the fabric because

1494
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:06,050
they go out at the top

1495
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:07,820
of people does that about half no so

1496
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:12,170
half of the people just leave to leave

1497
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:15,080
strictly to leave and some people like

1498
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:18,350
come from the top exit at the top and

1499
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:21,769
there is for example a desire to to

1500
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:24,410
figure to go out a certain gateway so

1501
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:27,080
now you have to heat from a either alpha

1502
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:28,849
or beta now think about it since it's

1503
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:31,700
all defaults it's not such a simple

1504
01:17:28,850 --> 01:17:33,620
thing because a sends it default but

1505
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:36,200
from here on it just has to defaults now

1506
01:17:33,620 --> 01:17:37,820
if it goes to alpha but it picks up the

1507
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:41,690
D for two hits to beat that do a black

1508
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:45,799
hole right so if you want that to work

1509
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:49,190
then you have to push the loop back of

1510
01:17:45,800 --> 01:17:51,110
the node one South which is no big deal

1511
01:17:49,190 --> 01:17:54,110
right with just like you advertise D for

1512
01:17:51,110 --> 01:17:54,500
out you just ad is more specific all

1513
01:17:54,110 --> 01:17:56,360
right

1514
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:58,820
it's not desegregation because we have

1515
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:01,790
special ties for this aggregation right

1516
01:17:58,820 --> 01:18:02,960
for computation purposes it's just you D

1517
01:18:01,790 --> 01:18:04,700
for doesn't have to be a default

1518
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:07,370
actually the applicability trough talks

1519
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:08,570
when is it that you really don't want to

1520
01:18:07,370 --> 01:18:10,700
advertise the D for you want to

1521
01:18:08,570 --> 01:18:13,070
advertise the internal fabric default

1522
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:14,870
right and it goes to its the role like

1523
01:18:13,070 --> 01:18:16,730
you may want to have more prefix if

1524
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:18,740
something like any caste or something

1525
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:20,299
like Emma was talking right like I like

1526
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:23,500
really this prefix from the top so I'm

1527
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:26,540
attracting this stuff and if link fails

1528
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:29,090
it may be actually not even enough right

1529
01:18:26,540 --> 01:18:32,060
because let's say I'm coming from down

1530
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:34,420
here and I want to hit alpha now if I

1531
01:18:32,060 --> 01:18:37,760
see default both ways and I hit it here

1532
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:39,650
either I will not have an alpha because

1533
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:42,380
this link broke only this guy who has

1534
01:18:39,650 --> 01:18:44,240
had an alpha which means that the top of

1535
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:46,400
the fabric loopback has to propagate all

1536
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:48,740
the way down for this stuff really to

1537
01:18:46,400 --> 01:18:50,839
work with link failures I mean that's

1538
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:52,969
that's just an example what goes into

1539
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:54,680
applicability draft in details right and

1540
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:57,320
how you achieve that you can do PGP you

1541
01:18:54,680 --> 01:19:00,680
can do multiple mechanism but that's

1542
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:02,210
basically how you deal with the internal

1543
01:19:00,680 --> 01:19:05,120
rich ability right do you want to come

1544
01:19:02,210 --> 01:19:07,250
from north to the south you know no do

1545
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,320
you want to go from the bottom to top do

1546
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:10,910
you will need loop X and so on so that's

1547
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,660
just something to flash it out a little

1548
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:16,790
bit makes it work Thanks there's many

1549
01:19:14,660 --> 01:19:17,249
more section we will be filling in and

1550
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:21,659
adding more

1551
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:24,900
pictures and whatever no not really a

1552
01:19:21,659 --> 01:19:27,690
question but a male comment when we

1553
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:29,728
inject in specific are basically horse

1554
01:19:27,690 --> 01:19:31,530
trout's on the back routes for top of

1555
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:35,070
fabric notes and propagating them down

1556
01:19:31,530 --> 01:19:36,869
it's much easier on the hardware

1557
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:39,420
resources because all those routes are

1558
01:19:36,869 --> 01:19:42,539
essentially unipass it's they're not

1559
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:44,280
consuming it simply resources so it's

1560
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:48,659
certainly not difficult to handle well

1561
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:51,509
not necessarily an order yeah

1562
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:53,759
depends also new implementation how you

1563
01:19:51,510 --> 01:19:56,369
pick it out right I mean but because if

1564
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,739
if beta advertises loop I get slots it

1565
01:19:56,369 --> 01:20:00,900
to everyone right so these well these

1566
01:19:58,739 --> 01:20:02,848
guys is unicast but if it floods farther

1567
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:06,869
down that the these guys will have

1568
01:20:02,849 --> 01:20:08,550
multiple paths as I said yeah it depends

1569
01:20:06,869 --> 01:20:10,650
on the topology in this one we have

1570
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:14,429
additional meshing between spine levels

1571
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:17,420
so yes there will be multi pass anyway

1572
01:20:14,429 --> 01:20:20,610
it's not going to be very wide at least

1573
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:23,099
well is as wide as you fan out in the

1574
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:24,420
port right yeah okay yeah also that you

1575
01:20:23,099 --> 01:20:28,889
concerned yeah yeah it would be like

1576
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:30,239
port file okay so yeah so that's I

1577
01:20:28,889 --> 01:20:31,889
assume this is applicability dropped

1578
01:20:30,239 --> 01:20:33,749
will actually take another at least two

1579
01:20:31,889 --> 01:20:35,639
revisions because more and more stuff

1580
01:20:33,749 --> 01:20:37,079
comes up the more people bang on it and

1581
01:20:35,639 --> 01:20:39,300
do lap things and think through the

1582
01:20:37,079 --> 01:20:40,969
stuff you know just which i think is

1583
01:20:39,300 --> 01:20:42,659
exactly what Alvaro desired you know

1584
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:45,769
because we have been called the

1585
01:20:42,659 --> 01:20:49,860
marketing document but you'd still this

1586
01:20:45,769 --> 01:20:51,989
okay thanks thanks good work and it's

1587
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:54,299
very useful to see the difference with

1588
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:56,400
other protocols and why would you deploy

1589
01:20:54,300 --> 01:21:01,769
one versus another and I mean it's good

1590
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:04,049
work on applicability statement so thank

1591
01:21:01,769 --> 01:21:06,679
you everyone and we will meet in

1592
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:06,679
Vancouver

1593
01:23:39,970 --> 01:23:42,030
you
