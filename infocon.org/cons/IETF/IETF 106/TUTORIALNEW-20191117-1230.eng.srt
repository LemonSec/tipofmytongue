for all of for those of us who've been

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:18,220
around for a while it's we're not really

31
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,729
the target audience and so what's useful

32
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:24,189
to us is not necessarily that so without

33
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:26,590

a number of activities that I'll go over

55
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,880
shortly so first off welcome this is

56
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:44,230
great we have a very large crowd this

57
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,480
time comparatively and I think it's on

58
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,489
the order of 200 first-timers looks like

59
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,119
most of you are in the room which is

60
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:55,000
nice so welcome we're glad to have you

61
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:58,270
and we hope you will contribute and

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,750
continue to contribute every meeting

63
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:05,230
every session at every IETF meeting and

64
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,870
the IETF meets three times a year starts

65
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:11,140
with these next two slides so this is

66
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:14,050
the very first session probably this is

67
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,239
the first time you'll see it there are

68
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:21,580
two and by Wednesday they sort of rush

69
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,690
to them by Friday everyone goes okay

70
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:26,800
you've already seen this before let's

71
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:31,060
get to all the work so this this this

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,250
slide identifies the policies and when

73
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,960
you sign in an attendance list you're

74
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,270
acknowledging that you understand the

75
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,490
note well it is called that note well

76
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:41,470
because it means hey note well that

77
00:03:39,490 --> 00:03:44,170
these are the policies under which we

78
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,140
operate and if this is a reminder of

79
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:50,950
what they are the fundamental ones are

80
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,670
if you say anything you should know that

81
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,940
it is public this is not a closed-door

82
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:01,030
industry working group form public in

83
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:03,850
that the meetings are recorded often

84
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:07,150
streamed live on the web

85
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:10,260
and they are archived on various video

86
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,260
channels there's a YouTube channel

87
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,520
personal information we try to respect

88
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,200
PII oh it's called PII personal

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,840
identifying information when you signed

90
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,450
in you got one of two colored lanyards

91
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,250
the blue says you can take my picture

92
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:29,260
there's a red one that says please don't

93
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:31,510
photograph me things like that these are

94
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,719
the specific policies again you don't

95
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:37,020
have to read

96
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:40,870
to understand but the important part is

97
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:44,469
the acronym BC P stands for best current

98
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:47,080
practice and this is an indirect layer

99
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:48,580
on top of the RFC series and talk about

100
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,240
the RFC series for those who don't know

101
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:58,080
later on BC p nine points to a specific

102
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:01,449
thing which is RFC 26

103
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,639
if the process gets changed in

104
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:06,669
twenty-six twelve becomes obsoleted by

105
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,009
RFC fifty to seventy five I'm just

106
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,409
making these numbers out of the air the

107
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:14,110
BC p9 will stay the same so it's you

108
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:15,789
know think of it as a symbolic link any

109
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,409
problem computer science can be solved

110
00:05:15,789 --> 00:05:19,628
by an extra layer of indirection this is

111
00:05:17,409 --> 00:05:21,639
an example these are the main policies

112
00:05:19,629 --> 00:05:23,889
that are appropriate it's at some point

113
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:25,419
you know worth skimming if you're trying

114
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:26,319
to avoid jet lag or you're trying to

115
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:29,460
cover from jet lag

116
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,460
you know skim through these things

117
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:36,879
newcomers activities we have many

118
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:39,490
activities planned for this this week

119
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:41,830
and as we do in previous weeks and we

120
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,180
will in the future the tutorial you're

121
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,149
getting off to a good start that's here

122
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:50,259
and now usually there are two presenters

123
00:05:46,149 --> 00:05:52,000
we split one one two three or one two

124
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,560
and then the first speaker again but

125
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,729
unfortunately this time you're stuck

126
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:59,580
with me for the full hour 45 minutes

127
00:05:56,729 --> 00:06:02,460
quick connections is also this afternoon

128
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,859
that I believe is in the Fairmont

129
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:08,770
ballroom Lobby there'll be a little

130
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:13,300
table set up they'll be experienced IETF

131
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:15,370
errs there myself Karen I think a couple

132
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:18,939
of many people and it's sort of like

133
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:20,770
speed dating go to a table talk about

134
00:06:18,939 --> 00:06:23,560
you know introduce yourself or get

135
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:25,389
introduced or we'll introduce ourselves

136
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,889
what are you looking for what kind of

137
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:28,810
areas are you interested in oh this

138
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:30,520
person over there is you know he's very

139
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,189
good that person over there is really

140
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,830
important about you know routing an ipv6

141
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:37,719
to pick an example the person running

142
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,729
the meeting guy named Paul routers will

143
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,879
you know every five minutes will say

144
00:06:39,729 --> 00:06:44,889
time and he move off to another table

145
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:47,350
the intent is you get a brief moment

146
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:50,080
people get a brief moment

147
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:55,570
- under you know to meet a couple of old

148
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:57,159
hands Greybeards if you will meet some

149
00:06:55,570 --> 00:07:01,090
peers who are also among the first

150
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:03,639
timers or newcomers and then you move on

151
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:04,960
and so on and then that leads there's a

152
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,470
short break and that leads into the

153
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,039
opening reception there's also a program

154
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:13,840
called the IETF guides mentoring we used

155
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,580
to call it ITF mentors we used to call

156
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,869
it ie TF guys we couldn't figure it out

157
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,280
so now we call it guides mentoring

158
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,130

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,020
the whole week I don't participate in

168
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,419

169
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:47,500

dinner Monday that is not you know

171
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,169

172
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,120
twenty-five dollars Singapore they're

173
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:54,639
joined and that's purely newcomers

174
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:57,840
chance to meet some of your people here

175
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,190
in the room or the 75 so who aren't here

176
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,429
as Karen mentioned there's a feedback

177
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,550
session that'll be Thursday morning all

178
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:07,930
of these items are listed on the agenda

179
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:10,090
um so you can find the specifics about

180
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,380
details and rooms I mean that's where

181
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,299
you can tell us hey you guys did really

182
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,860
good I was or how I was totally

183
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,260
unprepared by Tuesday I couldn't keep my

184
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:19,060
eyes open whatever it takes whatever

185
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,840
your information you have we take

186
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:24,340
feedback very seriously in that we

187
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,729
really listen to it we really encourage

188
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:29,679
it like we don't not everybody

189
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:31,659
participates in the surveys and so on so

190
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,969
if five people say you need to talk

191
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,469
about this some more we will revise

192
00:08:33,969 --> 00:08:37,690
these slides and make sure we talk about

193
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,289
it some more next time I should mention

194
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:43,360
the IETF definition of a newcomer is

195
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:44,860
five or fewer meetings which basically

196
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,150
since there are three meetings a year

197
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:48,640
that means you know for the first two

198
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,560
years you can if you'd like consider

199
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,029
yourself to be a newcomer feel free to

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,199
come to any of the kind of any of the

201
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:59,530
newcomer events okay

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,080
preparing so what's a little more detail

203
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:02,959
about

204
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,400
what I'm gonna talk about can someone in

205
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:08,840
the back row raise their hand just make

206
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:10,100
sure I can I'm being heard thank you so

207
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,460
the goal here is to present information

208
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,230
that is useful to you starting at the

209
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:17,960
end of this session running through the

210
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:21,410
week Friday afternoon um as you attend

211
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:24,290
your first first ish ITF session as you

212
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:27,469
move from being involved in some mailing

213
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,750
lists to day-to-day you know active

214
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,430
participation in the in room this we

215
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,190
call it to maybe going back and then

216
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:35,209
joining some mailing lists and so on we

217
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,070
want to teach you how to make the most

218
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,610
out of the meeting it's sort of the

219
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,210
unique the ITF is a unique experience

220
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,880
unlike you know John with one I Triple E

221
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:48,860
w3c a winner this doesn't talk about the

222
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,270
history of the ITF we used to talk about

223
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,590
that a lot mm-hmm

224
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:59,720
nobody really cares right the ITF is 32

225
00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:02,180
years old I believe many of the people

226
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,250
who roam the halls and attend the

227
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:07,550
meetings have been here for all thirty

228
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:09,770
years it's pretty impressive and talk

229
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,349
about some of the impacts from that

230
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:18,110
long-term involvement there is a YouTube

231
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:20,530
channel as I mentioned okay so now or

232
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:24,830
talk about the broader standards

233
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:26,300
ecosystem where the ITF lives the

234
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:28,130
mission and I'll just read this because

235
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,189
it's short and it's really sort of the

236
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:33,110
unusual kind of mission our mission the

237
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:35,780
IETF mission is to make the internet

238
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,100
work better that's the short very very

239
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:38,810
short summary we want to make the

240
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,300
internet work better how do we do that

241
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:46,339
we produce high quality relevant

242
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:49,310
technical documents in English that's

243
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:51,310
the language of the ITF notice it says

244
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:55,010
technical documents and not standards

245
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:59,300
the ITF doesn't produce standards in the

246
00:10:55,010 --> 00:11:02,540
way you might think of ISO C or ISO C++

247
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:05,060
or your local building codes determine

248
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,860
you know how much steel you need to put

249
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:09,380
in a high-rise we don't do anything like

250
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:13,640
that none of it is enforced by

251
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:17,060
regulation the way it's enforced

252
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:19,550
is we design doctor we build documents

253
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:23,569
that influence the way people design use

254
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,130
and manage the net okay so it's purely a

255
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:27,680
matter of well this is the way

256
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,060
everybody's doing it if you want to do

257
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,079
it with everybody else here's what you

258
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,369
should do you know sometimes depending

259
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:38,180
on the working people often hear the

260
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:42,290
phrase we're not the protocol police if

261
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:45,529
you do if you're writing a web server

262
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:48,500
and you understand you have get and you

263
00:11:45,529 --> 00:11:51,649
spell it with lowercase nobody's gonna

264
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:55,760
come work with you if you change get to

265
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:58,399
take nobody will complain but your code

266
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,630
won't work with the browser right so

267
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,430
that's the goal you want if you want to

268
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,790
interoperate and work with the rest of

269
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:08,870
the world out there you know follow the

270
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,699
RFC s they are written in English they

271
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,000
are which means the human language which

272
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,480
means there are ambiguities we have an

273
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,550
errata system where we can put where

274
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:24,800
people can point out errors Corrections

275
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:29,390
we revised standards so we had HTTP 0.9

276
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:35,719
1.0 1.1 2 and now we're developing HTTP

277
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:36,260
3 for example TLS 101 1 1 2 1 3 it's

278
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,670
hard

279
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:41,329
TLS didn't want to change the first

280
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:47,060
number and HTTP has no qualms 1 2 3 1 .

281
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:50,449
1 1 whatever the mission of the IETF is

282
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,939
described in an RFC 39:35 as you attend

283
00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,880
meetings throughout the week you'll hear

284
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,370
people say things like oh you know

285
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,070
that's really not compliant with RFC 26

286
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:03,500
12 and the rest of the room will go hmm

287
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:04,970
yeah that's the trait what the hell is

288
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,480
26 12 and you might have to look it up

289
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:10,130
I'm long I'm like that I can't I'm bad

290
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,570
enough with names that alone are seen um

291
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:13,130
so I'm always impressed when people can

292
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:15,620
just spout off these four digit numbers

293
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,640
or now five digit numbers and everybody

294
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:21,890
instantly knows what it means so what is

295
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,930
the ITF where standards development

296
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:25,579
organization notice the previous slide

297
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,079
didn't say standards it says technical

298
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:27,420
documents but we recognize that what we

299
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:29,579
do

300
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:32,610
our develop standards no implementation

301
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:35,610
force behind them other people pick them

302
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:37,110
up and publish them as standards we no

303
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,210
problems with that our documents are

304
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:41,210
openly available freely reusable

305
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:48,420
referenceable it's self selected in that

306
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,939
anybody wants to join all you have to do

307
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,829
is sign up to the mailing lists that

308
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,150
you're interested in there are about a

309
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,200
hundred and thirty groups they're about

310
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:01,140
a hundred and fifty mailing lists read

311
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,200
participate write mail and so on we

312
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:06,480
don't do formal voting for example many

313
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,030
national standards bodies or the

314
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,100
International like I so each country

315
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:13,949
gets a vote or each company gets a vote

316
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,050
each member in w3c gets a vote we just

317
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:19,020
do things by what's rough called rough

318
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,030
consensus and I'll talk about that more

319
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,579
detail talk about humming which is kind

320
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,160
of a strange thing and we'll do an

321
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:29,310
example of that there's a formal

322
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:32,610
government role the US government used

323
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:36,839
to host what was the ITF and host what

324
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:38,850
was ICANN and the number Authority those

325
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:43,020
are all spun off as separate things the

326
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:44,640
IETF is now a nonprofit organization you

327
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:48,030
can donate money and get a tax benefit

328
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:50,550
if you're in the u.s. we're driven by

329
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:54,150
market adoption so unlike some other

330
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:57,660
organizations you can't come in and make

331
00:14:54,150 --> 00:15:00,780
the IETF standardize what you're working

332
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,819
on to develop market some others are

333
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:05,490
what's called pay-for-play you pay the

334
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,680
membership to work on a standard for of

335
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:10,320
whatever you want we're focused on the

336
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,300
internet and we're bottom-up in other

337
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,670
words the people who are in this room

338
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,569
and on the mailing lists are the people

339
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:21,349
who determine what the IETF produces

340
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:23,850
there's no arching oh there are some

341
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:26,790
general Architecture boards and

342
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:28,500
technical reviews pardon me but it's the

343
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:30,480
people working you know in the trenches

344
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:33,090
as the phrase goes who do that kind of

345
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,780
stuff and we'd like to think we're

346
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:40,290
pretty unique the ITF is divided into

347
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:44,220
eight areas seven areas

348
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,449
this is called an eye chart in that you

349
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,059
know people sitting in the room there

350
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:49,978
you're not expected well this is kind of

351
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:52,618
legible you're not expected to read and

352
00:15:49,979 --> 00:15:54,899
understand all of it take a picture the

353
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,749
slides are available online and as I

354
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,689
just shown on the first slide but

355
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:03,209
everything falls into an area my

356
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:05,488
particular focus is on security but

357
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:08,508
routing how the packets get from you

358
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:11,839
know one gateway to another gateway

359
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:15,809
Internet is defining the IP and TCP

360
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,209
protocols transport is the congestion

361
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:19,559
control what happens when the receiving

362
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,199
side says oh I can't take all your

363
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,850
packets anymore you know buffer bloat is

364
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,139
a common thing right when you see when

365
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,759
you're trying to watch a video and you

366
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:29,069
see that little circle going round and

367
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:30,479
round and round congestion that's the

368
00:16:29,069 --> 00:16:34,160
kind of thing that the transport works

369
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:39,419
on applications in real time art is

370
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,709
things like HDPE WebSockets so on for

371
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,089
the most part you don't have to care you

372
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,978
can think just look at the working

373
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:46,350
groups but understand it in the

374
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:47,939
organization there's the working groups

375
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:51,199
feeding up into the areas and then

376
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:55,169
there's the steering committee on top as

377
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:57,139
I mentioned we work by consensus the ITF

378
00:16:55,169 --> 00:16:59,939
loves this quote it was by Dave Clark

379
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:02,009
MIT professor one of the first IETF

380
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:05,069
developers for a while he was like the

381
00:17:02,009 --> 00:17:07,169
chief protocol scientist it was the

382
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:10,500
starter project we reject Kings

383
00:17:07,169 --> 00:17:13,110
presidents in voting it's everyone you

384
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,789
know for themselves rough consensus and

385
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:17,969
running code that's the important part

386
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:20,490
rough consensus means everything has to

387
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:24,709
be addressed it doesn't have to be

388
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:27,809
accommodated we can disagree but and

389
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:29,250
running code you know the ITF over the

390
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:31,980
past couple of years has added

391
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:35,760
hackathons the weekend before so

392
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,019
yesterday and today and that wins you

393
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,120
know if someone says I keep this is

394
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,139
completely unemployment Abul and three

395
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,139
other people say it's completely

396
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:47,330
unemployment alone it's unlikely to get

397
00:17:43,139 --> 00:17:51,269
evolved as an IETF standard spec humming

398
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,639
I've talked about the session chair in

399
00:17:51,269 --> 00:17:57,680
this for example I am the chair of this

400
00:17:53,640 --> 00:18:00,270
rushon sitting at the front of the room

401
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,610
we're responsible for the building or

402
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,520
talking about what content determining

403
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:09,120
what consensus is every working group

404
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,340
has a mailing list and the mailing lists

405
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,020
or where the official work is done so

406
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,879
when we say oh we have consensus in the

407
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,770
room they will then say okay we'll take

408
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,140
it back to the list to confirm which

409
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,940
means someone one of the chairs will

410
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,420
post this a you know short description

411
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:26,010
we decided that we need eight bytes for

412
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:29,100
the session identifier does anybody

413
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:31,500
disagree so you know discuss it on the

414
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,510
mailing list or confirm and so on of

415
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:38,810
course there's an RFC that talks about

416
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:41,370
consensus and humming ITF culture

417
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:46,470
passionate smart vocal people which is

418
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:49,409
to say you know networking nerds people

419
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,790
love t-shirts people get free t-shirts

420
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,130
and many people walk around with

421
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,700
previous IETF t-shirts as a badge of

422
00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:00,180
honor it's fine just casually just

423
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,820
comfortably you know business casual

424
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,800
hotel casual native dress whatever is

425
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,620
appropriate I would not recommend

426
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:11,100
walking you know barefoot speedos

427
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,290
topless things like that the key point

428
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:17,730
is what we care about is technical

429
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:21,000
excellence we recognize that many

430
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:23,880
non-native speakers many people are shy

431
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,260
many people have other concerns or

432
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,570
issues might prevent them from speaking

433
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:31,320
up but as long as you can make a

434
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:34,050
technical technical contribution that's

435
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:38,070
good that advances the cause of what the

436
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:39,360
ITF does I mentioned before some people

437
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:40,889
have been coming for the past thirty

438
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,479
years they meet it's like family

439
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:48,720
reunions right hey you know hey Mike how

440
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,280
you doing Bob you know whatever I see

441
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:56,160
Karen you know three times a year

442
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:57,750
more often than I see my sisters okay

443
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:03,000
some of the alphabet soup this is the

444
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:04,560
broader ecosystem of the ITF the thing

445
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,440
that looks like a cell over here on the

446
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:11,010
right left your right

447
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,680
that's CI that's the ietf what you think

448
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:15,270
of as the ITF each of the areas and

449
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,840
there's three bubbles there there's no

450
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:20,790
should be seven or eight has within it

451
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,629
working groups every working group is

452
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:28,200
assigned to an area each area has two or

453
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,420
three area directors area directors are

454
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:32,730
responsible for monitoring the progress

455
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:34,470
of the working groups creating new

456
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:36,810
working groups creating birds of a

457
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,340
feather sessions to determine whether or

458
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:42,690
not a group should be created and so on

459
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,389
the area directors all collectively form

460
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,430
the steering group internet Engineering

461
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,590
steering group iesg

462
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:52,800
that's the technical leadership of the

463
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:56,659
ITF it's appointed there were

464
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,360
overlapping two-year terms every year

465
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:03,270
new people about a third of the ISD is

466
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,780
reappointed the black box is the

467
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:11,010
nonprofit corporate identity for example

468
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:13,830
when the ITF sets up arrangements to

469
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,210
have a meeting in a hotel somebody has

470
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:17,129
to put down the deposit

471
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:18,420
somebody has to sign the hotel contracts

472
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,670
and somebody has to make all the

473
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:22,200
logistics arrangements for example

474
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:24,360
dealing with the livestream and video

475
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,870
recording fine folks in the back of the

476
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,490
room you know you can't just have a

477
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:32,250
thousand people show up and say I'd like

478
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:34,290
a room please at the same time oh and by

479
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:39,150
the way I want 30 breakout session rooms

480
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:41,190
it just doesn't work the IRS G internet

481
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:42,660
research steering group a parallel

482
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,030
organization they're trying not to

483
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:48,150
deliver standards but to discuss and

484
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:50,190
promote research there's a crypto forum

485
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:53,010
group there is a networking protocols

486
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:57,180
group there is a privacy impacts of the

487
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:59,370
ie2 internet protocols group the IAB

488
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:03,780
is sort of an oversight of both of those

489
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:06,659
things the irst in the iesg the RC

490
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:10,970
editor is a paid set of professionals

491
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:13,740
who do the final document production

492
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:16,380
Ayana internet assigned numbers

493
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,200
authority is also paid they do

494
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:21,380
professionals who do things like OD NS

495
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,230
goes on port 53 HTTP

496
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,820
port 80 and here are some extensions

497
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:27,950
defined for TLS they just keep the

498
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:32,090
records of what all the numbers are so

499
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:36,460
they don't overlap I just talked about

500
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,629
who does what okay now for the fun part

501
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:40,630
I'll talk about what the week is like

502
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:47,600
there are many things going on the IETF

503
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:49,190
the iesg among their over included in

504
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,100
their oversight is organizing the

505
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:54,200
overall meetings we have about a hundred

506
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:56,570
and thirty working groups about 80 of

507
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,299
them meet and any given meeting there

508
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:01,240
are birds of a feather it's from the

509
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:03,710
saying birds of a feather flock together

510
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:06,049
that's where we get people who have like

511
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:08,690
interest to decide do we want to proceed

512
00:23:06,049 --> 00:23:11,570
with a formal working group there is a

513
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:13,150
working group some Monday on the

514
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:16,490
mathematical mesh there's another

515
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:18,320
working group on web packaging which is

516
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:21,770
sort of think of it as Google's amp

517
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,450
project evolved and I forget there are

518
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,700
three or four other working groups as

519
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,289
well offs as well

520
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,090
RTF meets at the same time may have open

521
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,400
sessions crypto sessions as I mentioned

522
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:34,340
those are the ones interest to me there

523
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,289
is a plenary which is this time it's

524
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,110
just a management plenary plenary is a

525
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:40,340
Latin word that means all together

526
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:42,530
nothing else is scheduled opposite the

527
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,199
plenary it's in the ballroom and it'll

528
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:47,418
be like an hour two hours of here's what

529
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:50,809
our budgets like any questions for the

530
00:23:47,419 --> 00:23:52,250
iesg any questions for the IAB a lot of

531
00:23:50,809 --> 00:23:53,870
people sit in the back of the room and

532
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:54,650
make snide comments to each other on a

533
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:58,580
you know

534
00:23:54,650 --> 00:24:01,820
gerrae back-channel hackathons and code

535
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,340
sprints the developing work on the

536
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,908
standards or on the tooling that's the

537
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:10,070
weekend before there are social events

538
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:12,890
this year this meeting I forget it's at

539
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:18,230
the some fancy new you know high-tech

540
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:20,630
park tutorials this what the other one

541
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:22,850
is deep dives we're not having one this

542
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:25,400
year there's lunchtime sessions some

543
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:28,510
other social things tonight is the hot

544
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,559
RFC hot requests for you know topics

545
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:33,100
people get ten minutes to talk about

546
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,180
something that's interest and then it's

547
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,070
that's it move on to the next one

548
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:39,080
- next one so you can see things that

549
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:42,409
aren't currently ietf activities that

550
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,730
might be in the past I've picked up two

551
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:47,750
or three of the stalks and brought them

552
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:50,030
into Acme the working group by chair so

553
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:52,640
it can be a source of interesting you

554
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:56,600
know it's the advanced rnd technology if

555
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,540
you will side meetings open time every

556
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,090
morning this session this week is set

557
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:04,970
aside for unscheduled meetings sometimes

558
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:06,379
you sleep late sometimes you just get

559
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,030
together with colleagues for breakfast

560
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:11,870
and talk and then the working groups

561
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:14,360
actually started 10:00 there are other

562
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:16,459
activities not on the agenda hallway

563
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,800
meetings which means often at the end of

564
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:20,900
the session people gather outside talk

565
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,060
about something or capture the you know

566
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:25,460
talk to the working group chair or the

567
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:27,620
people who presented the tutorials are

568
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,810
different from working groups in that

569
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,090
it's usually just the chair who talks is

570
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:37,429
in me we have an app it's worth getting

571
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:41,000
if you go to the place you know Play

572
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,920
Store or Apple Store ITF app it lists

573
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,690
all the schedule it lets you highlight

574
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:49,190
sessions that you're interested in I

575
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:51,640
think then iPad Apple one is integrated

576
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:56,330
with the calendar the Android one map

577
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,460
the agenda across from the registration

578
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,730
desk there are bulletin boards where

579
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,230
updates to the agenda are posted that'll

580
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:04,940
also remind you where the rooms are but

581
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:07,280
you know get the app sometimes I guess

582
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:11,900
again this year we're having paper

583
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:13,580
handouts of the sessions working group

584
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,010
okay this is the main point this is why

585
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,179
you are all here you got sponsor for

586
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:19,820
your employees paid you to come here

587
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:21,620
this is where all the work is done the

588
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,929
rooms look like this there's somebody

589
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:27,649
speaking people running the meeting the

590
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:28,790
chairs or sitting here there's mics you

591
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,160
see there's one in the middle of the

592
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:35,210
room there if people have questions you

593
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:37,280
go to the mic and so on the sessions are

594
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:39,350
streamed by the fine folks of you know

595
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,930
line speed meet echo they're always

596
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:45,260
sitting there in the back of the room

597
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,690
often there's a pink box around the mic

598
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,940
here so that if you are presenting you

599
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:51,320
know where to stand so

600
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,440
you can be beamed out over the internet

601
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,389
or recorded on YouTube mideco is for

602
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:58,820
online remote participation that's at

603
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:00,890
the far the smaller screen over there on

604
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:03,260
the right when people want to talk

605
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:05,510
you'll see them come up to the mic the

606
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:07,460
chair has a handy red button they can

607
00:27:05,510 --> 00:27:09,440
push and recognize someone and then they

608
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,790
get to talk just as if it were somebody

609
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:15,740
local talking there

610
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:18,649
birds of a feather more informal

611
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,390
precedes a working group they'll be

612
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,310
often at the reception there will be

613
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:26,270
poster boards scattered around the room

614
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:27,710
about the different offs people running

615
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:32,240
them have signs as they asked me about

616
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:35,030
my bath I gave my sorry pins I gave my

617
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,000
pin to the guys actually the technical

618
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:40,340
lead of it and so on bath meets once

619
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,680
sometimes it meets twice and then at the

620
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,840
end of that with the area directors in

621
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:47,330
the and the bath folks determine if

622
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:52,220
there is consensus to do you know create

623
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:55,490
a working group i RTF is officially part

624
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,700
of the IAB the oversight group focused

625
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,560
on research they meet at the same time

626
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:03,320
of course there's an RFC seventy four

627
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,679
eighteen one of the things they do is

628
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,320
they present a networking prize the one

629
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,810
of the one or two I think sometimes it's

630
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,360
been three of the best papers on

631
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:17,230
networking how I can fool the router

632
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:21,590
into sending all my packets to you know

633
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:23,390
India for example they get sponsored to

634
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:24,740
come to the IETF to present their paper

635
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:28,580
it's kind of cool stuff it's a way to

636
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:33,290
get some academic involvement applied

637
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,110
networking research workshop it met last

638
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:39,830
IETF it meets annually in conjunction

639
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:42,860
with the IETF first two days it's very

640
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:46,370
it's part of the ACM Association for

641
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:48,699
Computing Machinery very much a academic

642
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:51,439
organization even more so than the IRT F

643
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,550
think I RTF is advanced research and

644
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,820
development in an engineering

645
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:59,750
organization and our W is actually

646
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:01,580
academic no cost free to attend highly

647
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:02,509
worthwhile presumably it'll be at the

648
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,369
next

649
00:29:02,509 --> 00:29:11,239
one away I figure out what that is

650
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:14,119
think California the plenary as I

651
00:29:11,239 --> 00:29:17,209
mentioned take the ballroom up and this

652
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,978
time there's no technical part of the

653
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:21,199
plenary it's just administrative and

654
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:27,259
management of the organization's

655
00:29:21,199 --> 00:29:31,279
themselves hackathons the hackathon

656
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:33,289
meets Saturday and Sunday no cost if you

657
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,579
had signed up or next time if you want

658
00:29:33,289 --> 00:29:37,699
to come and work on something you sign

659
00:29:34,579 --> 00:29:38,959
up you get you know the t-shirt free

660
00:29:37,699 --> 00:29:40,879
food

661
00:29:38,959 --> 00:29:44,149
I think about two three hundred people

662
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:47,779
are the current one this year there will

663
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:49,518
be a small reception with the best

664
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:52,759
results of the hackathon you know prizes

665
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:55,159
handed out and so on the way it works is

666
00:29:52,759 --> 00:30:04,309
there's a wiki page where you sign up

667
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:06,619
for topics or you sign up for topics or

668
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:10,099
you join or you sign up to work on

669
00:30:06,619 --> 00:30:12,619
existing projects there have been a lot

670
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,939
of interrupts sessions OTL s13 was at

671
00:30:12,619 --> 00:30:16,698
the hackathon for a number of times

672
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,879
quick is currently at the hackathon dns

673
00:30:16,699 --> 00:30:24,339
privacy dns over TLS things like that

674
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:28,899
are there networking in social events

675
00:30:24,339 --> 00:30:31,668
the ITF attendees list 106 attendees

676
00:30:28,899 --> 00:30:34,549
mailing lists right now it's about to

677
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:36,649
switch over from what's the best way

678
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:38,899
from the airport through customs to the

679
00:30:36,649 --> 00:30:40,579
hotel and now the main discussion will

680
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:41,958
be hey anybody have a social ticket can

681
00:30:40,579 --> 00:30:45,440
I buy a social ticket can I sell a

682
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:47,629
social ticket this one was from

683
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,629
Singapore two years ago is the aquarium

684
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:53,478
I forget the name of the part that

685
00:30:50,629 --> 00:30:57,529
attacked this time the picture on the

686
00:30:53,479 --> 00:30:59,839
right yeah right that's from the ietf

687
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:01,909
sisters that is an organization of

688
00:30:59,839 --> 00:31:05,599
people who identify as women Dyna Phi is

689
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:08,329
female they have a social lunch which

690
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:10,129
anyone you know who feels appropriate

691
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:12,168
can sign up they also have activities

692
00:31:10,129 --> 00:31:14,529
during the week that are all listed in

693
00:31:12,169 --> 00:31:14,529
the agenda

694
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:20,669
more side meetings ongoing experiments

695
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,429
with the agenda to find more

696
00:31:20,669 --> 00:31:26,850
unstructured time some working groups

697
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:29,580
don't like constrained in meeting and

698
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:33,418
think it's all waste a time it's better

699
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,100
to have more hallway conversations more

700
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:40,230
one-on-one more sit down together in

701
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,719
small study groups so and I mentioned

702
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,909
the tutorials no deep dive this year

703
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,090
this meeting and the hot RFC this igloo

704
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:52,770
okay

705
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:53,760
meeting adequate etiquette behavior when

706
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:56,039
you're attending a working session

707
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,270
general you probably know for the most

708
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,390
part what working groups you're

709
00:31:57,270 --> 00:32:01,590
interested in you know while you're here

710
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:05,090
it helps to read the documents

711
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:09,330
beforehand behave respectfully

712
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,980
tolerantly talk listen enjoy yourself

713
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:15,049
get some sleep that's a silly thing but

714
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,400
the meetings you know the day starts at

715
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:21,240
you know breakfast is it or eight or

716
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,860
nine side meetings you may or may not

717
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:25,169
have any the first time around and then

718
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,949
the sessions run until 6:00 or 7:00 at

719
00:32:25,169 --> 00:32:31,500
night and then the bob off start which

720
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:35,880
is a informal gathering let's go to a

721
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,789
bar in the past the IETF has drained the

722
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:45,150
hotel's of all the beer they have right

723
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:47,870
maybe not here but you know and that

724
00:32:45,150 --> 00:32:50,850
runs you know until 11 o'clock at night

725
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:53,939
I learned this really great finished

726
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:55,949
drinking game where you sing a song and

727
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:57,659
say new everybody drinks and by the

728
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:59,130
second or third round you stop singing

729
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,860
you just say new when everybody drinks

730
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:03,840
but it's fun and you know you're working

731
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,149
with colleagues so it's not just you

732
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,500
know drinking to get drunk but if

733
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:11,370
there's a lot of technical discussion

734
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:14,070
going on the whole day is involved with

735
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,320
technology and protocols and networking

736
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,299
and it extends through dinner and

737
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,980
through the night so even if you're not

738
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,260
physically tired or even if you're not

739
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:27,380
physically jet-lagged your mind is

740
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:31,250
exhausted I guarantee it get some sleep

741
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:33,140
respectfully in tolerantly we try to all

742
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,340
be adults and there's some things about

743
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:40,480
a code of conduct that I'll mention

744
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:43,429
later on Newark the IETF is always

745
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:47,270
looking for areas where we can help make

746
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:50,120
the internet better if there's some idea

747
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:56,020
of some protocol that makes sense to

748
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:59,300
evolve we do less well with api's but we

749
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:00,710
but if their protocols or work where you

750
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,850
want to communicate over the internet

751
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:05,810
doing something you know

752
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:08,719
videoconferencing multi conferencing

753
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:10,639
that stuff is WebSocket space here's how

754
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:15,290
to do it I'll just skip over this one

755
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,750
since it's unlikely to have pretty

756
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:20,870
unlikely to have you know I like to have

757
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,469
new ideas coming forward the slides we

758
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:32,060
gave a tutorial on it one year ago in

759
00:34:24,469 --> 00:34:34,850
Bangkok session etiquette okay that's yo

760
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:37,699
who will co-chair back me he won't be

761
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,679
here you didn't make it over from Israel

762
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,290
this time speak directly into the mic

763
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,100
you'll often hear the phrase especially

764
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:45,440
if you're not used to it

765
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,610
people go eat the mic eat that mic and

766
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,970
that means you know you've got to get

767
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:52,370
really close it mics here or good in

768
00:34:49,969 --> 00:34:53,989
other in other venues they've been not

769
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:57,109
so good

770
00:34:53,989 --> 00:34:58,700
say your name every time you speak part

771
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,300
of the reason the main reason why that's

772
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:04,970
done is there somebody typing it so it's

773
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:08,390
visible online so that people who are

774
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:11,000
watching remotely say via medical and

775
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:13,400
with the illogical live streaming they

776
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,960
know who's talking after a while you can

777
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:17,270
tell there are certain people like and

778
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,280
people will go you know by Tuesday

779
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:24,770
they'll be yeah Rick sells Akamai and I

780
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,980
want to say that you know it's hard it's

781
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:32,090
also to encourage you know to you have

782
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,590
to acknowledge and take credit blame or

783
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:36,560
be associated with the things that are

784
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,210
said at the mic blue sheets it's on blue

785
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,710
sheet of paper historically it was

786
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,400
always on blue sheets we just like

787
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,279
traditions

788
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,349
kept it you sign in and when you sign in

789
00:35:43,279 --> 00:35:47,450
you agree to follow the practices of the

790
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:50,049
note well which you all remember was the

791
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:52,189
first two slides or slide saying for

792
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:55,279
technical questions and comments are

793
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,440
always welcome not and that means not

794
00:35:55,279 --> 00:36:01,190
like you know that's really a stupid

795
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,950
idea but have you considered that maybe

796
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,789
eight bits for a network is not wide

797
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:10,669
enough that's a better way of saying on

798
00:36:07,789 --> 00:36:13,010
the other hand people have known each

799
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,510
other for decades so there will be

800
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,890
people who come to the mic and go

801
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,020
because I've known you for 20 years

802
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:20,779
that's really stupid you should do it

803
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:23,750
this way don't listen to them don't take

804
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:27,230
their you know don't think that behavior

805
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:29,569
is the way to go every working group has

806
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:34,160
backed a back channel side channel

807
00:36:29,569 --> 00:36:39,160
instant messaging jabber mention that in

808
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,808
a little more detail later on resources

809
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:44,149
people the key people are Secretariat

810
00:36:41,809 --> 00:36:47,319
this is the paid the paid staff who

811
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:49,970
handles all of the all of the logistics

812
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:53,329
you see a picture of them there they

813
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:55,399
wear these blue polo shirts they run

814
00:36:53,329 --> 00:36:57,039
they're often seen at the registration

815
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,450
desk swear you picked up your bed

816
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,490
they'll run around the meetings if you

817
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:03,950
have any problem with logistics or you

818
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:06,229
like you're completely lost they will

819
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:07,788
answer you on Friday as the meeting

820
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:09,890
begins to wind down they all change into

821

I chair a working group the color codes

866
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:17,880

867
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:21,000

somebody who's a chair and if you look

869

in the upper left corner of the upper

870
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:28,710
right corner there's a smiley face I

871
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:30,410
didn't see many of those I mean they're

872
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,120
not doing it but that normally means

873
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:36,509
come and ask me questions about the IETF

874
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,359
I'm happy to answer your questions if

875
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:42,180
you don't see those anybody with a dot

didn't they're in a leadership positions

879
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:55,680
part of what leaders do oh ribbons

880
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,780
there's a sore ribs at the bottom you

881
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,250
know probably God are seeing the new

882
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:02,100
comers attendees

883
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:04,050
there's also nowadays a jar of ribbons

884
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,509
and markers to the side and people can

885
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:08,190
write their own jokes and paste them to

886
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,829
the bottom of their label

887
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:13,079
um by the end of the week and certainly

888
00:40:10,829 --> 00:40:16,829
by the after your second and third IETF

889
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:20,160
there are no funny jokes it's just no

890
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:24,539
same ones over and over new comers

891
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,098
resources the Dow of the ITF what it

892
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,160
means to have rough consensus and

893
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:31,500
running code deliberately modeled after

894
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,319
you know the Buddha philosophical

895
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:37,470
document of how the ITF works this

896
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:46,440
newcomers page there'll be a newcomers

897
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:49,200
page for every IETF so on tutorials more

898
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,920
meeting resources there's a wiki the

899
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,288
wiki before the meeting is usually done

900
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,490
monitored especially by local people who

901
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:58,950
will tell you the best way to get from

902
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:03,299
the airport to the hotel how to use the

903
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:05,549
MRT in this case there's a first-time

904
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:09,030
attendees mailing list if you're not on

905
00:41:05,549 --> 00:41:11,490
it consider it joining it the ITF

906
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:14,960
sisters as I said is a support group for

907
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:17,189
women people who present as female women

908
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,980
and there's other mailing lists the

909
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:22,440
social lists travel companions we have a

910
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,410
slight lightweight program for spouses

911
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:27,000
significant others you know our social

912
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:33,720
activities for them to keep them busy

913
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:35,339
while you're busy nerding out all the

914
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,089
information so there are two websites

915
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:43,230
listed here the top one and the one on

916
00:41:39,089 --> 00:41:47,520
the right the data tracker or also known

917
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:49,440
as DT IETF org that's the site where you

918
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,450
will find everything about the working

919
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,380
groups everything about the drafts

920
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:57,770
everything about the RFC's who's come

921
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:00,000
now who's car and all the mailing lists

922
00:41:57,770 --> 00:42:01,680
every mailing list has a charter that

923
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,660
says you will you know by the end of

924
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:05,098
first quarter will do this by the end of

925
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:08,848
second quarter will do that but in the

926
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,170
third quarter will do that no working

927
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,089
group ever meets its deadlines

928
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:15,829
milestones they always get revised

929
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:20,910
they're the phrases it's aspirational

930
00:42:15,829 --> 00:42:24,480
but DT that IETF that org /wg

931
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:28,980
/ and then the working group named TLS w

932
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,570
ugh DNS op mmm whatever and that will

933
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:32,880
bring you to a page that looks like the

934
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:36,180
one you see here multiple tabs talk

935
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,490
about the specific overall working group

936
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,109
the stuff the tab default startup tab is

937
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:41,970
all the documents that are working and

938
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:44,820
you can see when it started how many

939
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:46,680
pages it is what the status is if it's

940
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:50,690
still a draft of it's been waiting for

941
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,700
you know review and so on the tools page

942
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:56,970
links at the bottom page pages to the

943
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:58,770
left is of less importance this is for

944
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:01,490
folks who want to know well which RFC

945
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:05,610
was cited the most by any other RFC or

946
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:09,120
where can I find tooling on how to turn

947
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:12,380
you know markdown or XML into an RFC

948
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:15,660
document that stuff's on the tools page

949
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:17,250
more and more people or users are more

950
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,160
and more people are migrating from using

951
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:24,690
the tools to using github which we're

952
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,359
developing better tooling for if you're

953
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:30,180
if you know so you can saw often many

954
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:33,000
groups now are putting their documents

955
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:35,100
on github periodically taking a snapshot

956
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,980
and posting it to the data tracker for

957
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:40,259
official IETF release so github is like

958
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:41,700
the author is working copies and people

959
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,940
can make pull requests and raise issues

960
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,859
on github they get addressed or they get

961
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,980
delayed or that discussed in the mail in

962
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:52,320
the working room email and then a draft

963
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:57,000
is posted you know periodically to the

964
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:00,840
data tracker remote participation the

965
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,030
fine media core folks attended to the I

966
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:04,740
face-to-face attendance is not required

967
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,900
only if you want to serve on the

968
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:09,379
nominating committee but you had to have

969
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,330
attended among three out of five

970
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:16,530
meetings to get to know people we

971
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:20,029
support remote attendants completely it

972
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,410
generally works seamlessly these days

973
00:44:20,030 --> 00:44:26,660
you can see the remote stream over there

974
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:29,879
on the far right me deco is a tool it's

975
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:32,930
browser-based so on it works really well

976
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,180
the network

977
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,040
if you haven't already there are

978
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:42,200
multiple networks this you know

979
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:46,340
encrypted legacy ipv6 ipv4 the name and

980
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:48,410
password for all of them is IETF the

981
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:50,540
only reason to have a name and password

982
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:55,520
is so we can encrypt it to keep private

983
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:59,720
keep your privacy it's really fast it's

984
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,030
free in this hotel you know the Swiss

985

and is cheap as it is the ITF meeting

989
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:18,650
local hosts and the sponsors you know

990
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,930
bring in equipment and donated if you've

991
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:23,840
noticed you might see for example if you

992
00:45:20,930 --> 00:45:25,970
go to web search engines right now it

993
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:29,030
might think that you're in Zurich or

994
00:45:25,970 --> 00:45:31,609
Prague because the IP addresses haven't

995
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:33,380
been updated to geolocate properly it's

996
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:38,210
the same equipment that was in Prague

997
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:39,770
back in March there's quiet space called

998
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:42,800
the terminal room for historical reasons

999
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:44,360
there are no terminals this power wired

1000
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,730
Ethernet connectivity there's a help

1001
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,650
desk and a printer in the registration

1002
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:50,720

boarding pass right on Thursday that's

1004
00:45:50,720 --> 00:46:01,459
what everybody does jabber

1005
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:03,860
every working group so DNS op the DNS

1006
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:07,730
Operations Group will have a jabber room

1007
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:11,060
at group chat at DNS off at Jabra ETF

1008
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:12,620
org you just you know search for jabber

1009
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:14,299
client there's a number of free ones

1010
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:16,400
there's a number of phone ones available

1011
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:19,280
you have to get an account on a server

1012
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,330
somewhere and then you can participate

1013
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,480
one of the things at every meeting is a

1014
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:28,460
jabber scribe will write down in the

1015
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,520
room the name of who's speaking at the

1016
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,830
mic the page number of the slides that

1017
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,220
they're on so people who are remote can

1018
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:40,069
follow along if somebody remotely says I

1019
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:42,319
want to say something at the mic they

1020
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:44,660
type it the jabber scrub gets to cut to

1021
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:46,270
the front of the line and say relaying

1022
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:49,960
for

1023
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:56,470
holder's this DNS record is invalid

1024
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:59,650
whatever the comment is above all above

1025
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:01,779
anything else enjoy the fireworks we

1026
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:04,810
actually had fireworks in Prague four

1027
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:06,430
years ago two years ago that was a

1028
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:08,279
really nice social event the one this

1029
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,190
year is supposed to be pretty nice too

1030
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,830
lots of smiling faces lots of enthusiasm

1031
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:17,080
you can see the guy in the blue t-shirt

1032
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:21,040
there is making a point to one of his

1033
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:24,580
colleagues it is a pretty amazing and

1034
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,820
pretty unusual time it's not like a

1035
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:29,980
regular conference technical conference

1036
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:31,570
the work that we do and the quality and

1037
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,310
the breadth of the work we do will

1038
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:35,050
depend on you as well as everybody else

1039
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:38,830
who's here I think is about a thousand

1040
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:41,250
people eleven hundred those kind of

1041
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:47,290
stats will be presented at the plenary

1042
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:49,360
have fun it's a good time be nice you

1043
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:51,100
know fill your head full of lots of cool

1044
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:52,570
technology and come away with wow I

1045
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:55,569
really want to do this this isn't this

1046
00:47:52,570 --> 00:47:57,750
and then slow down and figure out you

1047
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:01,990
know what's actually manageable

1048
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:05,200
questions your feedback the link on the

1049
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:07,629
slide title is wrong it's off by one it

1050
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,430
should be 106 that's what the survey you

1051
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:13,540
know the link in the main body the slide

1052
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:16,810
is correct there is a team at U for

1053
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:20,320
educational we run the Karen and I are

1054
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:23,290
the co-chairs we run these tutorials we

1055
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:24,400
have a chair we organized a lunch for

1056
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,830
the working group chairs

1057
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,950
we meet every session that talked about

1058
00:48:26,830 --> 00:48:31,600
what's new and talked about other issues

1059
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:33,399
we help do the deep dives and someone

1060
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:37,029
like that we're very much interested in

1061
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:38,950
what feedback you have to give one

1062
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:43,060
session we got like three people

1063
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:45,160
feedback then I think the past now we're

1064
00:48:43,060 --> 00:48:48,610
running between one and two dozen people

1065
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,740
actually fill out the survey and it's

1066
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:52,180
not a contest but I always look to see

1067
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,720
if we got better ratings than any of the

1068
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:58,830
other groups in the ITF so be honest you

1069
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,830
don't have to tough things up

1070
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:06,960
oh okay so let me mention humming

1071
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:10,210
there's a number of reasons why we hum

1072
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:13,299
for example you can't look around and

1073
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,309
see who you know if we raise hands and

1074
00:49:13,299 --> 00:49:19,029
say you know okay how many people found

1075
00:49:15,309 --> 00:49:21,069
this worthwhile you know you could be

1076
00:49:19,029 --> 00:49:24,069
intimidated or coerced into voting for

1077
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:25,839
someone else or not encouraged to vote

1078
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:29,579
the same way somebody else does you

1079
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:32,589
can't see who's really humming you can't

1080
00:49:29,579 --> 00:49:34,839
we want a rough consensus of the room we

1081
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:39,640
want to know how most of the people the

1082
00:49:34,839 --> 00:49:42,219
room feel and it's really hard to you

1083
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:43,960
can't hum loudly I mean probably here at

1084
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:47,229
the mic I can hum loudly than any of you

1085
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:49,150
out there but you know so the way

1086
00:49:47,229 --> 00:49:52,328
humming works is we'll say okay we're

1087
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:54,219
gonna do a consensus call and so the

1088
00:49:52,329 --> 00:49:56,289
chair will say what the options are and

1089
00:49:54,219 --> 00:49:59,670
it will typically be did you find this

1090
00:49:56,289 --> 00:50:05,259
session useful and the choices are yes

1091
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:08,319
no or I need more information okay so

1092
00:50:05,259 --> 00:50:13,119
you can vote more than once hum more

1093
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:14,650
than once so less how many people you

1094
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:20,859
know did you find this session useful

1095
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:25,779
please hum now if the answer is yes okay

1096
00:50:20,859 --> 00:50:27,700
please hum now if the answer is no so

1097
00:50:25,779 --> 00:50:32,769
and please hum now if you don't have

1098
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:35,109
enough information to decide okay great

1099
00:50:32,769 --> 00:50:36,700
so most people know so we we had a rough

1100
00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:38,529
consensus most people seem to think it

1101
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:40,269
was useful we'll confirm that on the

1102
00:50:38,529 --> 00:50:41,589
mailing list we won't but that's what we

1103
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:44,738
would do next is we'd say most people

1104
00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:46,299
found this session useful valid reason

1105
00:50:44,739 --> 00:50:49,059
to say I don't know yet is you know ask

1106
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:51,819
me at the end of the week but that's the

1107
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:56,559
way you know all consensus questions and

1108
00:50:51,819 --> 00:50:58,210
humming works that way okay with that we

1109
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:00,819
got about three or four minutes left are

1110
00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:06,789
there any questions if so just you can

1111
00:51:00,819 --> 00:51:09,009
come to the mic I try to

1112
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:10,509
such a bow but it seems like that does a

1113
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:12,549
process I said a problem actually you

1114
00:51:10,509 --> 00:51:16,209
cannot purchase that ji d I don't know

1115
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:18,099
why um if you search for like free

1116
00:51:16,209 --> 00:51:20,739
jabber account you should be able to

1117
00:51:18,099 --> 00:51:23,739
find some you don't have to register on

1118
00:51:20,739 --> 00:51:25,390
the ITF server a jabber server anywhere

1119
00:51:23,739 --> 00:51:27,819
you can get you an account that will

1120
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:30,009
then let talk to the ITF server so look

1121
00:51:27,819 --> 00:51:32,558
for like free jabber account and you

1122
00:51:30,009 --> 00:51:36,999
should get like a dozen sites you can

1123
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:40,109
sign up on come to the helpdesk or come

1124
00:51:36,999 --> 00:51:40,109
see me I can help you with that

1125
00:51:45,219 --> 00:51:49,479
Travis Spencer quick question will there

1126
00:51:47,349 --> 00:51:54,160
be like tutorials this week on writing

1127
00:51:49,479 --> 00:51:57,308
RFC's like the details of that no there

1128
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:59,399
are there aren't maybe yes there are

1129
00:51:57,309 --> 00:52:03,579
going there is a in the video library

1130
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:06,549
there is a section on like the mechanics

1131
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:09,569
of how you write a tutorial the

1132
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:12,609
structure of the XML or the markdown

1133
00:52:09,569 --> 00:52:14,409
there are some in the past we've had

1134
00:52:12,609 --> 00:52:18,279
tutorials on how you do the Security

1135
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:20,439
section security considerations area in

1136
00:52:18,279 --> 00:52:23,859
general the best way to learn is like we

1137
00:52:20,439 --> 00:52:25,629
in existing RFC an area or you know read

1138
00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:29,949
the drafts the progression is the

1139
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:32,109
working group has drafts the drafts our

1140
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:36,339
editors or authors are picked by the

1141
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:38,979
chairs they progress through multiple

1142
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:40,719
revisions and so reading and commenting

1143
00:52:38,979 --> 00:52:46,149
on drafts is you sort of pick it up as a

1144
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:47,890
side note we can consider general you

1145
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:50,109
know guidelines on how to write RCS we

1146
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:55,629
might we'll take that back and you know

1147
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:57,400
look at it the slide on the app part try

1148
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:59,699
to search for write on the Playstore I

1149
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,699
could not

1150
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:10,119
the simplest way to find it is if you go

1151
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:12,430
to the meetings page on the IETF website

1152
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:16,240
it'll have a direct link I think to the

1153
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,710
naps there are two I know in the Android

1154
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,470
store there are two apps one of them

1155
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:24,900
ends you install it and it says IETF 99

1156
00:53:20,470 --> 00:53:31,660
that's the wrong one it should okay I

1157
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:34,119
can try a screenshot if you want all

1158
00:53:31,660 --> 00:54:07,118
right we basically ended on time thank

1159
00:53:34,119 --> 00:54:09,269
you very much have a great week see you

1160
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,269
