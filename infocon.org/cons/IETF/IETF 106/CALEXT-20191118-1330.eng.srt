1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:16,390
I might as well join that generally as

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:16,390
West yep and we are

3
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:59,960

00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,009
all right well it is time so welcome

6
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,570
everybody to the collects working group

7
00:01:04,009 --> 00:01:09,680
at ITF one or something what it says on

8
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,619
the slide is not what it says in the

9
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,450
Java room denote well is here I'm sure

10
00:01:12,619 --> 00:01:17,140
everybody in this room is well aware of

11
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:24,380
the note well and what it means to you

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:27,220
don't be bad and copyrights apply etc

13
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,770
snow snow submarines no bad submarines

14
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:34,130
this is the draft agenda that I've put

15
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:40,459
together do we have any changes any

16
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:43,300
suggestions to this I think's Ken says

17
00:01:40,459 --> 00:01:43,300
he can't hear anything

18
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,099
can you hear me now in the other one

19
00:01:53,500 --> 00:02:06,229
yeah maybe we'll see see where we get to

20
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:09,739
cool I guess we can scribe things for

21
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:14,030
Ken if he's stuck or can try plug me in

22
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:15,800
your headphones or something well if we

23
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,480
use more time on event up we'll use less

24
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:26,050
and other things it'll all come together

25
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:26,049
Mike also does not hear anything on

26
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:33,250
that's me yelling into the microphone

27
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,840
pretty loud and this is Barry at the

28
00:02:33,250 --> 00:03:00,130
floor mic checking whether you can hear

29
00:02:34,840 --> 00:03:02,920
that alright while we deal with

30
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:06,820
technical details let's at least bring

31
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:21,609
up the event pub page so people can read

32
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:22,899
it and get talking about your eyes you

33
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,610
while were just trying to wait till Mike

34
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,900
gets on because Mike's the one who needs

35
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:30,340
to respond to it

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:43,990
mike has tried reconnecting and does not

37
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:47,920
have sound possibly this is the first

38
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:52,990
meeting in this room so clear this

39
00:03:47,920 --> 00:04:00,458
sounds working in here but Lucas says

40
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:02,820
audio works okay alright Mike is that

41
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:02,820
any better

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,010
blue sheets hello hello reverb people

43
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,289
know there on the front on the front

44
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,719
hall ah don't trust don't trust my

45
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:33,140
co-chair it doesn't know what he's

46
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,140
talking about

47
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:46,530
alright ah it was definitely an

48
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:52,200
employment with it okay you can trust

49
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:55,039
him again now what is going on here I

50
00:04:52,200 --> 00:05:01,430
already put your name on push it

51
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,430
alright um still no sound for Mike I

52
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:12,000
guess we're gonna have to transcribe in

53
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:18,960
and out of the Java room yeah yeah Bob

54
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:27,420
made her car already aware I was just

55
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:28,909
gonna take notes yeah I have pen and

56
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:36,060
paper

57
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:38,160
stashed away all right we'll give maybe

58
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:46,370
another two or three minutes for Mike to

59
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:47,830
sort out his sand issues yeah

60
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:55,580
[Music]

61
00:05:47,830 --> 00:06:09,950
candy cane also has no sound hmm and Ken

62
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:12,580
had sound in dispatch earlier yeah Tim

63
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,580
can you hear us

64
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:26,580
gotta love technology

65
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:15,590
all right max just disconnecting and

66
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,590
reconnecting by looks of things

67
00:07:22,070 --> 00:08:03,409
I can go was no point asking there's mic

68
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:25,310
switch to firefox and has sound there

69
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:29,630
you go all right

70
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:31,160
so Mike's back ken is hopefully gonna

71
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:32,510
start soon but let's get started since

72
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,550
we've got Mike here barrage do you want

73
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:49,010
to talk about the URL and event

74
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:51,050
publishing ok this is Barry liebe I

75
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,670
don't know if we have critical mass here

76
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,069
and was really hoping that this would

77
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:57,079
have gotten discussed at Cal connect

78
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,910
where the right people are really there

79
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:07,810
for it but the the gist of my discuss on

80
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:11,630
this is that there there's a lot of

81
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:14,630
malware and spam and other crap coming

82
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:19,720
through calendar things that calendar

83
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:23,960
clients often automatically resolve

84
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,690
dereference you are eyes and there have

85
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,940
been generally limited use of you are

86
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:29,600
eyes in in the calendar standards to

87
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,900
this point

88
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,790
this draft add the whole boatload of new

89
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,060
you are eyes into this

90
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:40,550
I'm really concerned about what will

91
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,969
happen if calendar clients start

92
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:47,780
dereferencing them left and right and

93
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:50,570
and they're the places that the URIs are

94
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:53,510
in are our places that I think would be

95
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:56,600
likely to have clients automatically do

96
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:58,030
you reference them so we need to say

97
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,100
something about that

98
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:04,250
my my first preference would be to

99
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:08,320
change the draft to not have URIs in

100
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,320
places where it's not really necessary

101
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:13,880
if we can't do that if that's not

102
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:18,230
practical or don't meet doesn't meet the

103
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,910
needs of the users or whatever then the

104
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:23,600
next best thing would be to have a very

105
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:27,319
strong very strong advise against

106
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:30,080
dereferencing these things without user

107
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,770
interaction and warnings to the user

108
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,410
that this could cause bad which is

109
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:42,920
a technical term so I'll stop talking

110
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:46,300
and you can let Mike talk that's you

111
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,640
hear me yes yes we can Oh amazing

112
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:58,209
technology's wonderful isn't it yeah we

113
00:10:49,640 --> 00:11:01,819
did talk about this my feeling is this

114
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,330
there's a weird echo going on here is it

115
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:09,200
me

116
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:12,320
it sounds great to us so okay good is I

117
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,380
I do agree with your points but there's

118
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:20,210
URLs that could be automatic dereference

119
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:26,140
turnip all over the place and I I just

120
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:29,810
don't feel that in your the event pub

121
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:31,880
draft slash spec is is the is the best

122
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:33,619
place to deal with it we talked about

123
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:40,610
this as that possibly what we probably

124
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:45,080
need to do is come up with a say I know

125
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:48,460
some some know best practices thing that

126
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,460
is standing

127
00:11:50,830 --> 00:12:00,330
I hope yeah it's still sounds fine great

128
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:08,830
some kind that that deals with what what

129
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:12,580
a clients do when they get links to

130
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:15,070
things and you know they can have an

131
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,690
email they get open link headers there

132
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:23,080
they can turn up in all sorts of places

133
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:25,300
and and yeah i i i guess i guess the

134
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,800
event pub draft does add some i don't

135
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,560
think it I don't think it there's an

136
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,079
explosion there there in your if you've

137
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:36,099
got a location that's based on a vCard

138
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:40,050
it's a reference to the V card and but

139
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,750
we've had them all the time in in in

140
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:47,589
encountering we had the the river it's

141
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:50,860
called the URI property which you know

142
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:53,410
clients could have followed blindly but

143
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:55,120
there's no guidance for that and I I I

144
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,790
get your point but I just don't think

145
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,670
it's the best place to deal with it so

146
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:02,050
I'll agree with this not necessarily

147
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:05,560
being the best place to do it

148
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:08,319
i I think the idea of doing a BCP about

149
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,599
this is a good one but I would want this

150
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,810
document to block on that and not be

151
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,510
published until it's ready because I

152
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:22,150
really think advice is important III

153
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:27,330
obviously I disagree with I but I would

154
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:31,630
I would I would be happy to to add a

155
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:34,420
very large section on warning if we can

156
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,100
move ahead with it but I might you know

157
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,740
saying we're gonna put together

158
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:43,690
something I think we you know a warning

159
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,820
on okay well let me come up with

160
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,130
something yeah I I could live with that

161
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,040
if we had a strong warning and a

162
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:53,110
statement that we're working on a BCP or

163
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,089
something like that I could live with

164
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:58,380
that and that would work Daniel you had

165
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:58,380
your hand up

166
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:10,490
oh sorry Mike you're breaking up okay

167
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:16,939
yes I was able to say I think can you

168
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:19,670
save me now yeah I would say I I we need

169
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,709
a commitment to do something to follow

170
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:25,310
on so we can put that into the into the

171
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:34,540
spec and and if affecting reference that

172
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:37,939
I think I wanna said the the main

173
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,110
problem one is the style description I

174
00:14:37,939 --> 00:14:41,569
think it's called in here which is

175
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:44,750
basically lets you put in an HTML

176
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:47,870
version of the message body or calendar

177
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:51,850
description which a bunch of people are

178
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,810
doing anyway just in the regular

179
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,459
description property even though it's

180
00:14:53,810 --> 00:15:01,219
meant to be plain text what's unclear to

181
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:04,689
me is why that is I think that one will

182
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,350
be better not being your I both because

183
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:08,000
because that's the one you have to

184
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,259
actually fetch to display the event when

185
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,809
you open it everything else I don't

186
00:15:09,259 --> 00:15:13,790
think you necessarily do but that one

187
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:15,620
you do and also it means it can't just

188
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,490
be arbitrarily changed without actually

189
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:20,930
updating the event data later which is I

190
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:22,699
think a good thing I don't think you

191
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,008
want we wanted to just randomly change

192
00:15:22,699 --> 00:15:26,620
under you each time you open it for spam

193
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:30,800
scanning all sorts of things like that

194
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:33,769
if nothing else and in jeaious calendar

195
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,819
we let you set the content type of the

196
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,319
description so you can put an HTML

197
00:15:34,819 --> 00:15:38,420
description in but it's not your I

198
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:47,779
reference it's just you can embed HTML

199
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:50,269
in there if you really want to so the

200
00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:52,250
question I had is that can is that

201
00:15:50,269 --> 00:15:59,980
reasonable view that we do without any

202
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:59,980
you arise here even pub

203
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:07,329
Mike did you want to come back in again

204
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:15,940
because to me if there is one that it's

205
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:20,870
the same as if we have a lot of those so

206
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:25,040
is it possible to to pull the you our

207
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:28,100
eyes out of this and rev this after the

208
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,420
BCP to put them back in or does that

209
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,230
just not make sense

210
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,229
Mike

211
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,300
well here's a long history behind all

212
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:51,230
all this but the the the idea was to try

213
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:57,550
to make locations and and participants

214
00:16:51,230 --> 00:17:00,050
and all this - it'd be based on

215
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:03,319
information that came out of things like

216
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:07,869
vCard right that's where the information

217
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:09,980
is is in directories and you know

218
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:12,829
they're they're promised at you if you

219
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:17,660
copy information into something like it

220
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:20,119
like a a counter event it neva tably

221
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:22,850
gets out a date you don't have any idea

222
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:25,809
of where you go to get the most

223
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:29,120
up-to-date version of that information

224
00:17:25,809 --> 00:17:32,780
that's what the URI is is where where do

225
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:38,750
I find the up-to-date version of of this

226
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:42,080
thing it can also be where do I find the

227
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:47,120
updated the up-to-date version of a lair

228
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,120
or whatever that or oh yeah to get that

229
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:58,370
but but I I don't I don't know that this

230
00:17:50,120 --> 00:18:02,620
is I don't I don't think this is a huge

231
00:17:58,370 --> 00:18:05,959
step from where we are in terms of risk

232
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:10,580
it there the problem at the moment is is

233
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:14,290
it's all over the place you know I mean

234
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,290
we already have in I found

235
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:19,470
attachments are generally just a URL to

236
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:22,980
where I can download this attachment

237
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:25,260
from that difference to me is that for

238
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:26,820
privacy anyway is that that is explicit

239
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,830
user action to download that or in it

240
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:33,689
almost everywhere there's no just I open

241
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,590
any of engineer shows yeah so and I

242
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,179
think there's a big difference being

243
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:37,770
between being able to refresh something

244
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:39,929
by giving the UI of where I can fetch an

245
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:41,549
updated thing at some point versus I

246
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:44,429
have to fetch this just to show it in

247
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:46,470
the first place so if you did include

248
00:18:44,429 --> 00:18:47,760
copy of the data but also you can

249
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:50,820
refresh the stage in case it's changed a

250
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:54,740
later point from this URL that's another

251
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,779
option that that would make me happier

252
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,730
especially that was a morning in the

253
00:18:57,779 --> 00:19:01,320
autumn about what a bad stuff can happen

254
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:05,250
if you're going and breaking you are

255
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:10,020
eyes so so I think the I think the way

256
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:12,630
forward right now is for Mike to try to

257
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:16,440
come up with some text that we can bat

258
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:19,230
around so Mike if you do some draft text

259
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:27,090
for the warnings that would go in here

260
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:28,649
and will start from that so just to be

261
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,439
here are we going to include the

262
00:19:28,649 --> 00:19:34,110
suggestion from nail because I think you

263
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:48,929
on the prod with that the content can be

264
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:51,750
added and refreshed on the yeah for the

265
00:19:48,929 --> 00:19:53,779
remote people that's can you just come

266
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:59,370
up and repeat that on the microphone

267
00:19:53,779 --> 00:20:01,080
yeah I think this is this is diverged a

268
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:02,879
bit from what's in desk calendar for a

269
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:04,470
similar kind of location object and

270
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,860
stuff which I expect it to kind of be a

271
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,840
mirror in that that tends to embed all

272
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:11,850
the information that you can can always

273
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,620
add links to external places if you want

274
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:15,990
to if the user wants to fetch more or

275
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,129
refresh or other stuff but is never

276
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:18,929
expect it there that's gonna be fetched

277
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,070
automatically just to show the event

278
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:25,050
because the information is already there

279
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:28,179
so that would make me much happier

280
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:30,879
having the information that you expect

281
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,270
to retrieve from the URI the current

282
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,220
version of that information in there

283
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,080
have the URI available to refresh it and

284
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:40,390
have a warning text in the document

285
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,370
about what can happen both from a

286
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,710
security and a privacy point of view if

287
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:47,729
you start going and doing that I I could

288
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:50,770
live with that that that would be good I

289
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,500
will so Daniel I also like the

290
00:20:50,770 --> 00:21:01,840
suggestion for mostly privacy reasons

291
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:03,960
and that's a very good one okay so I

292
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,959
think I think where we are right now is

293
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:09,400
that Mike Mike has an action item to go

294
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,590
off and try to write some checks out but

295
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,320
enough just given that to invite Jabba

296
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:16,300
and yeah might keep in touch with me and

297
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,980
we'll sort it out because I do want to

298
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:29,830
get this published I'm not trying to be

299
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:32,950
a dick so it's cool all right let's move

300
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,620
on to Jos calendar is there much to say

301
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:37,660
on this I gave it ten minutes but I

302
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:41,290
don't think we actually need ten minutes

303
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:44,410
it's been in last call since the

304
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,629
previous meeting basically what's what's

305
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,800
happened since then is mainly just

306
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,380
creating registries for everything as

307
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:52,720
discussed in Montreal so that it's

308
00:21:50,380 --> 00:22:00,160
easily extensible which is one of the

309
00:21:52,720 --> 00:22:01,510
goals of it so and I've had some good

310
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,640
feedback in the last call's have been a

311
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,570
few minor tweaks based on that but I

312
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,770
think I should publish the new version

313
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:12,010
with just the final tweaks that have

314
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:18,030
been made and hopefully we can push that

315
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:22,210
out yeah so Daniel

316
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:24,780
yeah regarding the registry I sent those

317
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:28,930
to the IANA for an early review I'm

318
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,970
realizing either mr. email or haven't

319
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:35,860
received any feedback so I have to check

320
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:39,650
that through the IANA yeah

321
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:43,520
so yeah so I hope we made the right

322
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:45,740
thing I think yeah most likely we even

323
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,090
do more because I don't think it was

324
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,150
pretty required to have all this

325
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,580
registries at the I knob so I think we I

326
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:55,210
mean we're good students at that point

327
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,889
but I'm waiting for confirmation and

328
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:01,220
once we have the confirmation as well as

329
00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,540
the IPR from Robert I wouldn't get a

330
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,060
cent but that's another problem it's

331
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:12,950
just it's resolved in a few weeks that's

332
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:18,379
a yeah yeah my my console is most with

333
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:20,930
the IANA and it's one of the document I

334
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,610
think we got the most review on so I

335
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:27,800
think it's a it's a good example cool no

336
00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:29,179
Alex Monaco I just reminded that you

337
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:33,620
might want to talk to our any people

338
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:36,260
this week I know that busy but you can

339
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,810
remind them that maybe it's a at the top

340
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:47,420
of your priority list so maybe they can

341
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:49,629
help you cool all right yeah

342
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,010
it just because it's on the slide

343
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,820
there's actually a second document being

344
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,350
discussed here which is the

345
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:56,179
informational one about translating

346
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:59,300
between J's calendar and I calendar

347
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:02,990
there's been no work on that since

348
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:04,940
Montreal but yeah I think Robert will

349
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:08,000
finish that off when he gets back in a

350
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:15,020
month or so and it doesn't need to hold

351
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,580
this up so just short update on that so

352
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,370
are you saying that the document is

353
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:22,159
gonna be ready in a month or no sorry

354
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:23,719
the J's calendar icon de I I don't know

355
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:25,370
I think it's fairly complete already it

356
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,390
just needs updating for the changes that

357
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,479
I made

358
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:32,870
I think Robert will do that I he's

359
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,940
currently where is he from off on

360
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:36,229
holiday somewhere and right when he gets

361
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:36,560
back in holiday we went to part of the

362
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:39,080
world

363
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,940
yes I've get him to hope you finish that

364
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:43,340
off and yeah but that's just an

365
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,140
informational one and I think you

366
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:46,550
shouldn't hold this up especially as we

367
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,750
need the final chess calendar and to

368
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:49,899
ensure that everything is covered in

369
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,900
there

370
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:54,470
mike has bad Network but he's been

371
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,730
working on the Java implementation of

372
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,230
this is quite a lot in the past few

373
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:02,560
weeks and says it's fairly complete now

374
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:09,890
so he's happy all right next is

375
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:20,149
subscription upgrade Mike I cop the

376
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:21,890
video it seems a healthy yep no as I

377
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,410
guess I've been working on the

378
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:28,790
implementation of other J's calendar

379
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:40,210
package with the intention moving on to

380
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:40,210
the G map stuff yep the next thing is

381
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:48,020
great I had a question about status

382
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:50,510
deleted and how that works for items

383
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:53,030
that have multiple recurrent so days do

384
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,030
you always have to send all the

385
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:57,790
recurrences if what any of them are

386
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,530
changed and if you're deleting a

387
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:02,120
recurrence to send the status to latest

388
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:06,430
occurrence ID or are you just sending

389
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,429
all of what's left for that recurrence

390
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:31,429
hear me out I cut my own video I can

391
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:39,320
still hear me yep okay hey I was gonna

392
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:40,790
say it's good question yes it's not in

393
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:42,560
the document so it will need to be

394
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:47,810
clarified I think certainly coming from

395
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:50,240
a Cal Bev view where each URI contains

396
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:55,280
all the recurrences for that particular

397
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:59,690
UID yeah I'd say what we're trying

398
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:01,840
trying to do is essentially create a so

399
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:08,660
a lightweight

400
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:10,699
webdev sink so we'll play follow sort of

401
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,050
what happened there but yeah that's

402
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,680
destiny I don't think I've thought about

403
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:17,510
yeah we need to address exactly what

404
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,060
needs to be cleared from the case if you

405
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:21,500
see something with the UID otherwise he

406
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:24,560
could have stale recurrence that is

407
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:31,870
lying around in the case and nowhere for

408
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:31,870
living them yep okay that's a good point

409
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:38,060
this is yeah I read through this is this

410
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:40,160
morning it seems mainly find there were

411
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:43,460
a few question does somebody else send

412
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:47,120
through to the list I thought the water

413
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:48,830
spirit was kind of section 7 is where it

414
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,209
says there's a number of different ways

415
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:51,530
you can get stuff you can get a card out

416
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,890
thing you can get a coward eye thing

417
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,570
with auth and they don't have almost no

418
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:57,800
description to them and they don't

419
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,330
actually currently have references to

420
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,080
the specifications which they definitely

421
00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,639
need yeah do we want to keep that in or

422
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,560
should this document you'll be tight if

423
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:23,630
it was just this enhanced to get method

424
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:27,280
I I don't know maybe the card I think so

425
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:31,910
I think that the point the point is that

426
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,010
when we started is is that we felt many

427
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:40,910
clients who servers already support

428
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:47,570
caldo so allowing a client to upgrade to

429
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:50,260
a full CalDAV was almost free so this

430
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:54,290
would be a way to advertise to do that

431
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:57,070
so is that better than having me enhance

432
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:02,120
to get them to actually enhance get was

433
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:06,340
the enhanced get was where I see that

434
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:11,300
being useful is is in relatively

435
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:15,290
primitive clients mostly you know in in

436
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:22,790
my implementations and deployments

437
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:24,879
we have a lot of web-based feeds that

438
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:27,980
can work very nicely with this that they

439
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,460
they just look for updates and and then

440
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:34,580
they update their view so our

441
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,710
lightweight synchronization process

442
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:39,320
works works pretty well you'd have to

443
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:43,940
implement CalDAV we told wrapping a

444
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,950
CalDAV subset for a while and then

445
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:47,810
decided that really what we should do is

446
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,350
just implement some you know did find

447
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:56,210
something that was more in line with

448
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:58,370
with typical web practice and then just

449
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,000
say if you don't if if you if you can do

450
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:03,080
CalDAV then Ducal that okay yeah I think

451
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,670
that's fine it just needs a little bit

452
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:10,460
more fleshing out than that sexually

453
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:13,700
okay the biggest change with the whole

454
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,970
thing is people realizing that the

455
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:19,640
biggest gain for this is in mobile

456
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,210
clients we sort of talking from server

457
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,750
perspective we started this I think the

458
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:29,680
biggest gain is for mobile clients that

459
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:32,210
are downloading huge these times and

460
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:35,120
upgrading to something more efficient

461
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:38,180
probably means battery savings and

462
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,679
goodness as Wells mmm okay sounds good

463
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,970
I'll send you my other feedback to the

464
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:48,980
list I don't think we need to discuss it

465
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:56,450
here it's more minor okay all right V

466
00:30:48,980 --> 00:31:01,610
alarm extensions the main issue with

467
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:05,060
this stuff was around the Geo privacy

468
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:08,860
stuff for location-based alarms so Ken

469
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:14,480
and Daniel were the main people on this

470
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:18,429
so what what we did is that we asked for

471
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:24,560
the GOP people so the former chairs of

472
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:28,370
that working group and he actually he

473
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:29,149
told us he well it advised us to to send

474
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:34,789
our comments on

475
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:37,939
mist which is not so much helpful for

476
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:40,700
now because I think the the real problem

477
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:42,349
is that if we have no perspective to end

478
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,879
up with that documents it's going to be

479
00:31:42,349 --> 00:31:46,759
hard to find it the resource and the

480
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:49,399
energy to move that document for one so

481
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:53,539
back to the comment we had regarding its

482
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:55,728
Joe privacy I think well there is a j.g

483
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:58,519
reprieve framework so we should not

484
00:31:55,729 --> 00:32:00,499
ignore that one and I think the previous

485
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:02,869
versions of the draft were a little bit

486
00:32:00,499 --> 00:32:05,859
ignoring this framework so I think we

487
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:10,459
should consider that framework but I'm

488
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:14,509
regarding - I mean if you're able to to

489
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:15,979
produce the localization aspect I think

490
00:32:14,509 --> 00:32:18,559
it's still better than having no

491
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:20,419
specifications so it's true that if I

492
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:25,119
provide you some indication about which

493
00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:29,089
time zone I am you can infer in some

494
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:33,259
some areas I could be but I think this

495
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:35,749
has also to be balanced with if we do

496
00:32:33,259 --> 00:32:38,179
not think while full GPS information is

497
00:32:35,749 --> 00:32:40,009
going to be provided so it's still

498
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,289
better and in most cases the people

499
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:45,019
you're providing you're asking for this

500
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:47,059
time zone are the same you're providing

501
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:51,559
your GPS information because they also

502
00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:54,830
map services so I think well privacy is

503
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:58,580
important but at that point we also have

504
00:32:54,830 --> 00:33:01,489
to balance with what's the impact of not

505
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:04,609
doing anything and what would be the

506
00:33:01,489 --> 00:33:06,979
impact given that it's not a single the

507
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:11,029
only application that use geo

508
00:33:06,979 --> 00:33:15,259
localization so my what I would like is

509
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:19,940
that we we make sure that this draft

510
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:24,889
could be moved forward with that

511
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:29,359
perspective and so I mean so can can

512
00:33:24,889 --> 00:33:31,279
work on that and I think what I'd like

513
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,139
to really to avoid is that we improve

514
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:35,570
the draft very close to and then we

515
00:33:33,139 --> 00:33:39,109
we're back - oh yeah but you leak some

516
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:42,349
information yeah we will need some so we

517
00:33:39,109 --> 00:33:42,918
should work on leaking the smallest

518
00:33:42,349 --> 00:33:46,009
amount

519
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:49,429
of those Alexei Melnikov I think in

520
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:52,580
general my advice would be state your

521
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:54,710
assumptions you know if you are saying

522
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,570
well if you are leaking this information

523
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:59,059
will read you leaking it throughout the

524
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,710
channels you know at least if you write

525
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:06,200
it down people might agree or disagree

526
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:09,230
with you and general I think people are

527
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,179
more tolerable to you stating that there

528
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:16,369
are certain limitations or certain risks

529
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:18,020
as opposed to saying nothing so honest

530
00:34:16,369 --> 00:34:24,790
honesty is the best policy

531
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:29,509
so document what you know all right so

532
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:30,819
can you have able to join us to talk

533
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:34,990
about this

534
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:38,719
are you falling asleep yet here it comes

535
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:51,678
if you need to kick mic and then add can

536
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:54,020
I think alright now I can again we're

537
00:34:51,679 --> 00:35:04,869
not hearing you I think we've lost him

538
00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:04,869
off the queue yeah can we

539
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:13,900
and we've lost him again

540
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,720
[Music]

541
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:52,670
so maybe we can really back to sure

542
00:35:41,720 --> 00:36:00,890
let's move on to series Mike do you have

543
00:35:52,670 --> 00:36:01,430
things to say about the series draft can

544
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:06,440
you hear me

545
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:13,250
yep yeah the audio is pretty bad it's

546
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:20,780
it's coming going the series draft I I

547
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:24,800
think it's surprising more complete than

548
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:30,310
I thought it would be it was a reaction

549
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:37,700
to the the the problems of recurrences

550
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:39,980
that recurring events the the the world

551
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,960
I live in mostly went with with things

552
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,960
it's public calendaring and

553
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:52,100
organizations tend to produce very

554
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:57,080
long-running recurring events in which

555
00:36:52,100 --> 00:37:00,109
every instance is modified but in

556
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:03,259
reality that's sort of true but meetings

557
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:08,060
where every occurrence every currents

558
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:10,810
has a has an agenda in it so the the you

559
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:13,130
know the the recurrence model as it was

560
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:17,029
works very well for something it doesn't

561
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:21,890
change much like birthdays it's very bad

562
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:24,080
for meetings and for the kind of thing

563
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:29,720
that libraries and places do which is

564
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:34,460
what they call a series so we it's it's

565
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:37,819
a different model and it treats each

566
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:43,450
recurrence as a as a separate event and

567
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:46,740
links them with the the related property

568
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:50,669
which is an extremely underused

569
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:56,810
property encountering but I believe it's

570
00:37:50,670 --> 00:38:07,500
a lot closer to what is happening life

571
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:14,130
so it I think the the attempts to

572
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:16,560
compress the the recurring events is is

573
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:19,680
is not going to work very well because

574
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,320
it's just a bad fit so a series I think

575
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,970
is about fit from that so what what

576
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,010
people are actually doing now that's

577
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:32,399
where it as the motivation as is Neil

578
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:36,630
Jenkins yeah I think this idea is good

579
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,910
I think draft definite needs some work

580
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:41,400
so I I thought I saw on the list

581
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:42,899
something about this being going

582
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,910
straight into last call which I think

583
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,420
must be a mistake because it's not ready

584
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:48,450
for that

585
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:55,310
yeah to be accepted into the working

586
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:57,868
group yes last call yet yeah yeah no I

587
00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,779
wouldn't III don't think it's ready for

588
00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:04,260
that I mean it's had its had a it we

589
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,750
exposed a little bit and in fact I just

590
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,770
spent one evening producing the entire

591
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:12,180
draft and it with had one small upgrade

592
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:15,480
since oh no I wouldn't believe that

593
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:19,680
either yes fine good

594
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,869
so yeah III said I think the idea is

595
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,960
good if we need it means various things

596
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:27,480
for start to make sure it's

597
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:29,520
interoperable and I think we want to be

598
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,869
clear how this interacts with CalDAV and

599
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,580
whether a service should be generating

600
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:34,080
these to me it has to be a server

601
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:36,029
generating these for it to be useful

602
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,500
it's it's kind of it wishy-washy at the

603
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,670
moment that a client or server may

604
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:42,900
generate these ahead of time there were

605
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:47,070
few other things I thought were a bit

606
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,880
unclear how the split concept I did not

607
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:50,160
understand at all

608
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,850
it didn't see what was going on there

609
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,680
and there was a discussion that the

610
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:58,920
series master is not a member of the

611
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,210
series which so it's like a template I

612
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:03,030
presume which makes sense

613
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,130
that's good but that means that you're

614
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,690
not meant to show that as an event but

615
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:10,320
any client that doesn't understand this

616
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:13,470
is going to show that an event no I I

617
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,300
think I think well yeah this is probably

618
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:18,330
not the best place to get into that

619
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:24,690
discussion but the the idea was to

620
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:28,609
attempt to prevent clients from seeing

621
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:30,839
these things so yeah I should different

622
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:32,848
top-level thing and rather than a V

623
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,230
event of the event template or vehement

624
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:41,849
series template or something so that the

625
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:44,609
car time yeah let's have a look and see

626
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:47,400
what's going on it the backwards

627
00:40:44,609 --> 00:40:51,390
compatibility thing was a lot the idea

628
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:54,390
was to try and and build this so that

629
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:56,848
clients have just this is actually the

630
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:59,670
missing thing from Cal dev is is the

631
00:40:56,849 --> 00:41:01,830
idea of an expansion where what you see

632
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:07,560
are just things that look like real

633
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:09,598
events and and so from from the

634
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,400
backwards compatibility point of view

635
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:16,260
you just see these things look like real

636
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:18,270
events and he just real events I think I

637
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,820
think it's a way of getting the server

638
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:22,859
to generate a series of real events

639
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:25,710
rather than the client interpreting

640
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:26,098
rules no master as I guess that's really

641
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:28,109
good

642
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:35,089
I just don't think I think we need some

643
00:41:28,109 --> 00:41:41,759
work oh I actually agree I think but

644
00:41:35,089 --> 00:41:43,290
yeah yes I agree okay well I guess I

645
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,730
guess probably better take this to the

646
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:54,570
list rather than us talking about it

647
00:41:44,730 --> 00:41:58,830
over yes I just have one question what

648
00:41:54,570 --> 00:42:01,950
is the overlap with reference that the

649
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:09,569
promoter occurrences the recursive work

650
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:13,859
really well if if nothing changes so if

651
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:17,670
you've got to say a birthday and and you

652
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:22,339
the rules the rules are exactly the same

653
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:28,709
but but in recurrences you produce

654
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:31,288
recurrences and so they're very

655
00:42:28,709 --> 00:42:35,129
lightweight if nothing changes but if

656
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:38,789
every instance has a change in it and

657
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:41,670
override then that turns up looking like

658
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:48,150
a real event and recurs recurrences in

659
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:50,999
icon or not a change the recurrence

660
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:54,359
override is actually a full copy of what

661
00:42:50,999 --> 00:43:00,299
the event looks like so if you if you

662
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:03,019
change every resource that it's

663
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:05,700
megabytes in size

664
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:08,569
Mike's breaking up maybe I'll just give

665
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,328
a quick explanation as I'm in the room

666
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:16,200
question was do we expect that one is

667
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:19,199
gonna replace the other know different

668
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:20,788
things this would be a good fit for a

669
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,739
number of situations where currently

670
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:32,519
recurrence is used and they don't work

671
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:38,819
great yep okay all right and the last

672
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:40,589
thing we've got is V polar belief so

673
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:45,029
this I believe some works been done on V

674
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:57,690
Paul but we didn't get ready for pushing

675
00:43:45,029 --> 00:44:02,910
a new draft but now is that okay so can

676
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:09,259
you unlike anything here no you're

677
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:17,098
cutting out a lot me I'm coming up yeah

678
00:44:09,259 --> 00:44:18,660
I am running eruptions here yeah hang on

679
00:44:17,099 --> 00:44:23,749
wait a minute see then cut my video

680
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:23,749
again yeah it keeps coming on again

681
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:37,629
maybe not say am i any better now great

682
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:46,250
now is that yes or no yes yes you bet oh

683
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:50,080
okay okay veto so yeah pretty much

684
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:52,480
finished the update the traffic our

685
00:44:50,080 --> 00:45:01,420
first participant

686
00:44:52,480 --> 00:45:01,420
and yet Candace has offered to help me

687
00:45:02,710 --> 00:45:11,830
work on that the problem we have is is

688
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:14,480
is largest structure the issue of

689
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:17,210
whether we produce a single document

690
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:21,140
that is V fo without any of the modes

691
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:23,150
and then and then have basic mode and a

692
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:29,359
few other modes are separate documents

693
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:33,410
or or M merge them into one it so I

694
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:42,650
think that's where we are still so sweet

695
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:45,319
I claims I'm shouting so I think I won't

696
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:47,270
just be ongoing work and the next little

697
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,150
bit which is good because the next thing

698
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:56,210
that we have on our slides is reviewing

699
00:45:50,150 --> 00:46:01,730
our milestones so running down what's

700
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:03,830
their attachments draft is done update

701
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:07,100
update milestones certainly needs to be

702
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:09,799
done again this is Barry I think there's

703
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:12,200
something quite ironic that the one of

704
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:15,200
the most outdated milestones is the one

705
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:20,240
to update the milestones yes we are

706
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:23,060
going back our relation draft jazz

707
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,060
calendar draft and event pub our

708
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:27,830
relations has been done I believe but

709
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:33,500
jazz calendar an event pub will update

710
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:35,750
them when do we expect to have a Jess

711
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:40,900
calendar we should be sending off very

712
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:40,900
soon so we could say that's by December

713
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,730
stayed up the send event publication

714
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:57,520
draft to the IAS G should be marked done

715
00:46:52,730 --> 00:47:00,319
I mean the the you have sent it to the

716
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:02,750
iesg there was the first thing we

717
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,000
discussed today yeah might discuss on it

718
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,750
so the fact that it isn't out of the

719
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,240
iesg

720
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:12,589
is irrelevant you have sent it to the is

721
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:15,290
G some are done yay cool is something

722
00:47:12,589 --> 00:47:17,900
with update milestones I can mark down

723
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:24,619
as well when oh well maybe just update

724
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:28,190
they to reach out yep so for the

725
00:47:24,619 --> 00:47:30,650
documents that we've discussed today on

726
00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,890
the list let's just zoom back to the

727
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:35,510
start here where the agenda is event

728
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:40,279
pubs been sent joyous calendar will be

729
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:42,500
sent subscription upgrade I'd say we

730
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:44,809
should aim to have that done by the next

731
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:48,049
HF so maybe February next year is that

732
00:47:44,809 --> 00:47:57,079
same realistic to people the

733
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:59,119
subscription upgrade yep of the year

734
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:03,109
chairs calendar is target Cindy already

735
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:06,770
yeah yep it's that that is done VL arm

736
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:08,240
extensions has the the privacy stuff so

737
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:11,000
it's every alarm extensions should be

738
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,930
soon as well yeah so maybe will target

739
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:18,940
that for the end of the year series

740
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:31,009
target from mid next year that same

741
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:35,930
about right yeah sorry yes Mike could I

742
00:48:31,010 --> 00:48:41,000
ask about IRA combs questioner dr rule

743
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:44,319
most plurals the question was multiple

744
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,319
errol's in je s calendar

745
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,589
no one else seems to want implemented I

746
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:05,640
guess it's a problem Mike because we've

747
00:48:59,589 --> 00:49:05,640
not I do I know I know

748
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,000
that's why five five four five changed

749
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:13,359
it from two to four five which I thought

750
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:15,339
it was to be one instead of multiple and

751
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:20,520
the reason the reason why that was done

752
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:23,560
that was because you you know user

753
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,710
applications didn't implement it and I I

754
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:29,950
get that hmm

755
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:34,060
but the reason that I always disagreed

756
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:38,140
with that and the thing that the reason

757
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:41,109
it came back to my mind was I had to

758
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:44,200
work on a bunch of data for some site

759
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:51,270
that I support and discovered they had

760
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:55,089
seven recurring events that all had

761
00:49:51,270 --> 00:49:56,200
slightly different recurrences and the

762
00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:58,299
only reason they did that is because

763
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:01,930
they could not express that with Nas

764
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:03,579
blah rule out of interest would that use

765
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:07,299
case have been better fit with series

766
00:50:03,579 --> 00:50:08,920
just know it would soon be the same

767
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,829
property you have to have multiple rules

768
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,420
to do it I'm saying suppose series

769
00:50:11,829 --> 00:50:17,800
supports multiple rules as opposed to

770
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:20,290
event so it's some template cat they'll

771
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:23,170
be sidestepping it's you because yes he

772
00:50:20,290 --> 00:50:29,170
would I could I could say in Susie must

773
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:30,790
support multiple URLs yes I do wonder

774
00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:35,800
whether yeah it makes more sense for

775
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:40,509
this template generation the point

776
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:43,630
things it is actually often easier to

777
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:45,640
express difficult things broken down to

778
00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:56,680
multiple rules than it is to express in

779
00:50:45,640 --> 00:51:00,400
one rule from the I I agree that say any

780
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:03,950
in the the commodity

781
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:08,930
application this sort of gret the usual

782
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:11,180
user type application simplification

783
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:14,270
probably works fine saying once a week

784
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:18,620
once a month whatever in an event

785
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:21,650
publication that's not the case if then

786
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:23,660
the publishers want complication okay

787
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:25,250
but you publish these events that's

788
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:27,170
going to be consumed by a consumer

789
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:28,460
application right that's generally

790
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,320
that's the point of publishing it and so

791
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,860
if it doesn't understand the multiple

792
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:36,830
currencies you can't publish it the

793
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:40,040
reality is that most clients will

794
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:43,000
actually display them correctly what

795
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:46,540
they won't let you do is not apply them

796
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:49,160
or I do not think either Google or

797
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,050
Microsoft's online services at least

798
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:54,230
support more current rules in their data

799
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:56,930
model if they're using iCal for J as

800
00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:01,790
their as their thing which they do they

801
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:06,560
will probably support it okay we'd have

802
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:09,110
to test that I like my trouble is adding

803
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:12,230
multi adding support for multiple makes

804
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:13,940
the the base case the common case more

805
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:15,710
complicated just just having single one

806
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:19,600
now the rich all it means is all it

807
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:33,160
means is turning to an array that's all

808
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:38,000
Tony for a yeah that's I guess I don't

809
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:40,069
think I things I I understand the point

810
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:43,550
of view of people who have to build UI

811
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:46,450
is the rest of it but I don't think the

812
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:54,410
data model should be driven by the

813
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:57,230
simplest case yep look I'm not strongly

814
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:58,549
opposed to it I think an array when

815
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:04,190
changing from the current recurrence

816
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:06,340
rules would not be a huge burden i I'd

817
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:11,530
be interested if any other people had

818
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:15,910
feedback I yes but yes we could do that
