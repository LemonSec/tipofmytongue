all right so few you know updates these

27
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,450
are the working of documents the first

28
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,829
one is the use of plane protocol and

29
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:58,829
architecture analysis on 3G 4G system

30
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:02,790
yes just a Hummer from entity I'm a cosa

31
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:05,780
of the 5g user prey on Isis draft so as

32
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:11,940
you may know 3gpp over they started

33
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:14,600
released 16 in say to the city city

34
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:20,399
groups we will finish the release

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:22,860
released 16 in London next much so we

36
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:30,950
the authors would like to decide the

37
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:34,440
range of the goal of this work so we

38
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:37,740
continue to update the draft within

39
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:41,640
ladies 16 and after that we'd like to

40
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:45,300
proceed it to the next step we believe

41
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:48,690
that this draft will be help for many

42
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:51,540
idea first to understand 5g architecture

43
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,560
and use a plane protocol so if possible

44
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:59,670
we would like to request working working

45
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,610
group last call informations draft I'd

46
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:04,020
like to know your opinion yeah sure I

47
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,660
think solutions also they're all

48
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,729
straight my opinion so yeah I understand

49
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,120
the status of that work in 3gpp for

50
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:14,250
release 16 right so I think we need to

51
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
look beyond I think the way I look at it

52
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,069
is like you know

53
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,979
so what we can do in the release 17

54
00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:23,699
timeframe that's that's my person I'm

55
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:24,599
not we have the working group but Suresh

56
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:27,210
is also there

57
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,340
let's hear what he thinks with ya

58
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,719
subscription responsibility right so I

59
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,919
think like you know it requires some

60
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,840
kind of review from the working group

61
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,460
right and one thing we can do to speed

62
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,780
up the process is we can send an LS

63
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,948
right like if the working group decides

64
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:41,219
to send earlier since statement we can

65
00:05:37,949 --> 00:05:44,120
write one and send it right but I cannot

66
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:47,160
see anyway this will be done by March

67
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,470
right of 2020 right like so because

68
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,759
there's like reviews from the working

69
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,660
group complete the working group last

70
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:53,610
call okay

71
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,770
then it needs to come to me get the

72
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,539
Directorate reviews go to ITF last call

73
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,530
and the holidays Christmas holidays come

74
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,020
in between right

75
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:03,119
so it's very unlikely that this is gonna

76
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:05,549
be done before that okay we can do as

77
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,500
fast as we can but I think if you want

78
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:09,479
to inform the 3gpp officially I think

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,009
the best way is a liaison statement but

80
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:12,900
but one comment before I give it to

81
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:15,360
settle yourself so it leaves the

82
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,008
dependencies from the spring those are

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,500
in a good shape right at least compared

84
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,979
to previous IETF 105 now we're in a

85
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,409
better shape yeah right okay

86
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:29,900
yes I think this case on our intention

87
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:33,810
is a kind of the year the others work

88
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:36,138
based on the end of the state of the end

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:41,130
of the March not to complete during this

90
00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:46,320
procedure or the ITF some procedure so I

91
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:48,870
the Kokua this time they'll be so we

92
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:52,229
won't also want to put the milestone two

93
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:56,400
to finish the walk based on the busy 16

94
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:58,789
if we they need to think the force

95
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,370
analysis based on the 17 that'll be

96
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,990
another chance to work so if it's like

97
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:08,460
wouldn't go process yet make sense you

98
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:14,789
can get it done I know if you need a

99
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:22,258
following lady 16 maybe 17 so we can

100
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:24,750
start as a new work okay now let's go

101
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,969
the the status of different working

102
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:28,860
group documents we talked about the user

103
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,990
plane protocol you

104
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,639
I don't believe your presentation slots

105
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:37,020
for this right now

106
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:40,110
for this one right the next one is the

107
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,930
signal routing for ipv6 for mobile user

108
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:49,319
plane I think there's a good amount of

109
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:51,599
what went in but any update on this son

110
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:53,430
this is a presentation start we will

111
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:56,400
review that it in your presentations

112
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,870
pocket then the FPC document I think

113
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,299
this is a really a bizarre situation

114
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:02,460
it's a credible amount of work went into

115
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,810
this FPC document but overnight it's

116
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:06,989
like a turning out the lights write

117
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:10,590
complete silence on this FTC stuff right

118
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:12,419
so I think the documents are expired and

119
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,979
you know the FPC work was on Charlie's

120
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,799
request and essentially we split that up

121
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:19,770
into the young the young portion was

122
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,789
separated out right but I think we need

123
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,258
a waveform for this so I think you will

124
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:27,930
give an update later for five minutes

125
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:32,640
update our yes sorry I tried to

126
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:35,010
summarize the yeah the update on the

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,948
Guardians PC I end up with this meeting

128
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:42,328
so so let's discuss on the how to

129
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:43,859
proceed or the fate I think we need to

130
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:47,910
one way or the other closing that's

131
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,310
that's the gist we did these are the

132
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:54,589
document that have asked what can you

133
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,910
last call I think you know one the

134
00:08:54,589 --> 00:09:01,910
migration is going towards Mike I think

135
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:04,620
the the chair the shepherd note meets we

136
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,990
yeah so for both of these actually the

137
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:09,000
first to like the the shepherd right up

138
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:10,260
is very bad it didn't summarize pretty

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,839
much anything about the working group

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:15,149
process and I really cannot put this in

141
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,279
front of the iesg in that state so I'm

142
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:19,709
whenever you one of you get a chance to

143
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,140
update the write-up I'll try to scale a

144
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:23,910
little shack and and carlos has been

145
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,500
really good catching up with the

146
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:28,769
Directorate reviews and addressing them

147
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:34,140
so so I think it's good and the last one

148
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:37,470
it's RC so it's like you know it's it's

149
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,220
a it has a number it's a number yeah so

150
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:42,570
so it's pretty much done deal right and

151
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,420
it's one of the first ones with the

152
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:49,500
three format of XML - rc3 commentary

153
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:53,910
yeah so he wrote the the shipper notes

154
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:55,530
on essentially in just a little bit more

155
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,120
detail right now because it has nothing

156
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,890
about the technical summary because like

157
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:07,830
people who read the Shepherd write-up

158
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:09,300
will not be kurta or a C number it's in

159
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:10,500
the still the publication queue but it

160
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,120
pretty much it's a done deal

161
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,990
it's done yeah good stuff Congrats to

162
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,420
authors on that one

163
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:23,070
and I think now you go to the the

164
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:25,199
individual work items right I think the

165
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:27,470
first presentation is from Pablo I

166
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,470
believe

167
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:32,329
[Music]

168
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:19,420
Pablo if you can also it's kind of a you

169
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:23,860
know that's what change yeah this is a

170
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,280
great this once okay so good afternoon

171
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,760
everyone

172
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,770
so I'm here percent elated for region of

173
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,080
productivity at sorry six more unusual

174
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:39,010
play since the nice meeting they're

175
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:41,920
happening to release its so that that

176
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,770
first revision was the relationships you

177
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,449
were reasonable 66 or meet any flex

178
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:48,370
resistant to do set my rocking and

179
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,500
Eric's version which possibly a drop

180
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,450
there's an employee base six months ago

181
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:59,260
such good progress is not we've decided

182
00:11:52,450 --> 00:12:01,150
to remove it and then they the next step

183
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:04,810
on the revision with one stories now

184
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:06,579
seven more person one so here in the

185
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,520
first changes that we have added a rocky

186
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:12,430
look so the rocking mode is a mode that

187
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:17,410
we have been using thought several demos

188
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:19,540
where we are just which is actually

189
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:23,439
different world where that's simply it's

190
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:25,209
just like they give you the signal

191
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:29,230
routing gateway because we are just like

192
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,240
we overlaid 476 with song and then we

193
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:35,920
are another star good way to reach

194
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:37,540
another you care which is more changes

195
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,339
that we also happen derivation of seven

196
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:41,829
we beat a lot of editorial updates

197
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,900
changes to the terminology some changes

198
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:46,300
to improve readability and unabated

199
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,770
referenced and then the last important

200
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,219
point is that we have removed the

201
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,230
support for an instructor to use so as

202
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:58,810
you know in 3gpp there are depending PD

203
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:01,300
users 346 either veteran instructor due

204
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:02,040
to some changes that we have having as

205
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,770
hobby six

206
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,260
particularly the conservation of

207
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:11,170
Internet videos now we can no longer

208
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,790
support a Star Trek videos this could be

209
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,180
done I will be to allocate a new

210
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:18,699
Internet Protocol number this content

211
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,709
year first eight address

212
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,900
a requirement from the operational

213
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:30,760
community to support it that we are open

214
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:32,890
to it or feedback salutes and then the

215
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,230
Yoast of how the wheels participated in

216
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:37,270
the hackathon this year we had a lot of

217
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:40,450
progress so finally after several

218
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,890
hackathons we have finished the DVDs

219
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:44,560
lamentations so we have a coupie

220
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:50,100
implementation of the code base in this

221
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:50,099
truck and we have submitted a disco

222
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,120
tutorial sucks when the next weekly

223
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:59,189
release that will be generating all this

224
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:04,270
good would be available to everyone and

225
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:07,240
that said we really want anyone to do

226
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:08,560
more comments I would be the draft even

227
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:13,780
though the progress being relatively

228
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,619
stable we believe that it's ready okay

229
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:17,230
thank you

230
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,570
so from your point of view it's pretty

231
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:22,450
much in a great shape right all the

232
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:24,550
changes any dependencies whatever other

233
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:27,130
groups to this document

234
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,390
like yes so that the biggest of NSA's do

235
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:31,480
you have a section of your programming

236
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:38,110
where we also proceeding with ask okay

237
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:39,970
so any questions comments so how many

238
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:46,120
people have read the latest version of

239
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:58,780
the document okay okay we need the few

240
00:14:46,120 --> 00:15:03,540
more reviews common area my I can do one

241
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:03,540
review yeah thank you Thank You Carlos

242
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:20,849
so this is a a new talk your topic

243
00:15:15,699 --> 00:15:24,059
this is uh it's still a I individual ID

244
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:31,480
right now use the plain message encoding

245
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:39,999
zero zero version yeah I think yeah if

246
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:42,610
you can introduce a copy what is it this

247
00:15:39,999 --> 00:15:50,709
is the new booty I use the previous is a

248
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:52,569
four e yeah yes the a motivation so

249
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,449
sweetie sweetie PB is a trainee to

250
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:58,870
suppose here user premises associated

251
00:15:55,449 --> 00:16:01,300
with you at the TTP youthful so in K in

252
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:04,809
the case of GSL switch to user day so

253
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,878
this message are also required with the

254
00:16:04,809 --> 00:16:10,240
user frame interlock with the HTTP you

255
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,730
so instead it has a community

256
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,220
definitions so author field has a

257
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:19,449
capable to indicate the a different

258
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:22,559
profile you it is SAT there also

259
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:26,758
oh isn't it here we have the capability

260
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:30,699
to not see a user community has a

261
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:35,290
capability to provide the a metadata to

262
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:38,378
see a polygon so this capability LTS

263
00:16:35,290 --> 00:16:43,750
rate should be leveraged to not hear you

264
00:16:38,379 --> 00:16:47,350
the pregnancy include it's a bit no so

265
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:50,579
so and also in this approach so there is

266
00:16:47,350 --> 00:17:02,829
no internal header or extension headers

267
00:16:50,579 --> 00:17:12,789
totality any user privacy yeah how to do

268
00:17:02,829 --> 00:17:17,198
that so here's the gdb message format so

269
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:18,459
or each user per message is indicated

270
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,589
with the a message file

271
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:21,460
so for example so include request is

272
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,710
using the

273
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:37,660
other message said and could apply is

274
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:41,520
using it to as a message that yes yes

275
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:44,170
yes single headed so single header has a

276
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,710
happiest definition so currently there

277
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:51,030
is no defined usage a usage of

278
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:55,720
destructive so obviously in university

279
00:17:51,030 --> 00:18:03,520
eternity a message that put here mobile

280
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:07,020
user Pegasus so she I see a encoding of

281
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,200
the atmosphere so we are using Apple bit

282
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:12,610
left

283
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:18,340
like most pulpit to in Kodiak user

284
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:22,600
communities so pizza or it won't hear me

285
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:30,040
- Sophia honey right and it would be

286
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:34,060
erotic papyrus work and this week and

287
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:36,070
also some of user Craig message recoil

288
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:37,000
is here some additional information

289
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:40,810
arrogance

290
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:45,040
so all this information element can be

291
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:47,340
encoded with the SLS Tier II so we are

292
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:52,930
proposing to at IPS container key away

293
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:56,590
as a little XD away and also this theory

294
00:18:52,930 --> 00:19:04,090
can can see a multiple of V DP acidity I

295
00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:10,860
eat here with so he is switching with

296
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:15,310
hear me so oh yeah it's a sub clearly

297
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:19,860
obvious VDS container theory so however

298
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:29,080
3d PPI ETA V should be full with the SVG

299
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:33,850
specifications so user per message can

300
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:34,990
be carried with the insulate aside what

301
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,899
is

302
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,899
you know the in order to carry a user

303
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:44,379
pay message although it is a bit narrow

304
00:19:40,899 --> 00:19:45,610
so instead it s on Heather must is

305
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,929
sustained here

306
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:53,918
although inside of TSA which never so

307
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:56,830
however so if enabling tear PSD so or in

308
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,850
select header is ophtho as he apparently

309
00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,570
signals so in order to avoid here this

310
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:04,928
problem

311
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:07,510
so one solution eg a PSP must not be

312
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,260
used in das a bitch now in order to

313
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,460
keratea

314
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:16,480
use a pregnancy or if in identity a PSP

315
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:19,870
so another internet should be added to

316
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:26,880
Cali ta use of a message on top of Gaea

317
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:31,209
author ID which in a war a celestial yep

318
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:35,340
so OT our next step will like to adapt

319
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:42,130
here this dots with your walking the dog

320
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:44,980
okay MA hi my name is Omar from future

321
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:47,620
USA I read the draft what is the main

322
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,330
use case I didn't understand for this

323
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:53,860
like you know you won't remove gtp

324
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:55,928
completely with us our v6 so some parts

325
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,668
are removed with the current last call

326
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:00,880
document right I think some part of the

327
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:02,919
gtp with that's our basics this is a

328
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:15,730
complete elimination of gtp you is it

329
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:17,640
character what is it TTP 60 dropping no

330
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:21,250

331
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:25,090
Nativity period for however so DD b 6e

332
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:27,929
neatly detail ATT here you'd follow so

333
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:31,000
we have to keep the required information

334
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:34,000
inside of it okay

335
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,440
also my was just like it's not written

336
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,200
what I was thinking is there any use

337
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,179
case you are thinking to send the

338
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,279
message with the gtp encoded message

339
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:43,929
right from the UE itself is there any

340
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:47,650
use case kind of that kind of thing you

341
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:49,360
are thinking or this is not from the you

342
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,730
a possibility right with this you have

343
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,969
the real possibility you extend all the

344
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:56,470
way till understood correctly is to you

345
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,760
know all the path management and all of

346
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,760
that stuff they want to put it back

347
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:10,300
Suresh suresh krisshnan Just Answer Roma

348
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:12,160
the reason why you don't want to do that

349
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,600
is like the spectrum is very expensive

350
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,760
right so you don't want to put in all

351
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,230
the headers from where the air interface

352
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,420
right that's why the gtp is starting

353
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:23,680
from the base station towards the core

354
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,690
network not from the UE that's correct

355
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:27,100
but you know I think that's only a

356
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:29,530
service six the only solution that's

357
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,820
really all the way can go to their UE if

358
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,700
you want it right there is no other

359
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,679
solution so but yes spectrum issue I

360
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,150
agree with you it's a good point I thing

361
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:41,700
you know you can explore int for the use

362
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,700
case so any any other comments questions

363
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:47,770
yes just I think the information that

364
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:49,660
gets carried on gtp either things like

365
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:52,840
the end marker etc they're only of

366
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,960
significance to the G note be that stuff

367
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,120
does not need to be extended to the UE

368
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,510
so any stuff it does need to be extended

369
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:05,889
to the U is done over the than the PD CP

370
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:08,500
layer so with respect to currently you

371
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:24,430
have the pad management that n marker in

372
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:27,280
marker it's not so but if you take the

373
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:29,170
the equate questi equal reply gtp is

374
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,490
number of options and all of them how do

375
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:36,940
you plan to carry all of those options

376
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:38,890
as I think this is a logical extension

377
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,690
to the earlier work I don't see any

378
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:42,550
problem I think this addresses rather

379
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,990
completes the whole world but we need

380
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:45,909
more feedback for the working group and

381
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,870
also you know from the ad and you know

382
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:55,060
to make this right I think my other

383
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,530
suggestion is engage without keeping the

384
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,210
world can like essentially like you know

385
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,620
we can in our trade off the document

386
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:01,620
okay thank you

387
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:07,470
any other questions call here done yes

388
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,469
that is it thank you

389
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:31,570
next one is a the transport network

390
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:35,940
considerations I think so this is not a

391
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,939
working document it's a proposal and

392
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:51,700
position with John McCauley in this

393
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:54,450
topic is transport network Abed Ruby

394
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,450
Papaji

395
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:05,070
it's looking iron

396
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:25,190
okay maybe a slight smell me

397
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,189
if you hold it

398
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:44,350
now let's give a subpoena okay just a

399
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:46,710
quick recap of this wrap this has been

400
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:50,980
presented first in 2018 I give honor to

401
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:55,030
0-0 version because later mean problem

402
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:58,030
and strong and solution also it started

403
00:25:55,030 --> 00:26:00,040
updated in after updated and present in

404
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,700
the night economy and a major update

405
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:06,070
happened in last night here with the

406
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,309
original solution and two approaches

407
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,260
that we presented to put a framework so

408
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:15,460
they were multiple options proposed to

409
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:18,129
canopy MCRD proposed like a header and a

410
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,570
tent in CID they were sort of discussion

411
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:21,070
happen and they've got a lot of inputs

412
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,480
not only from here and also from

413
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:27,040
peaceful and also offline discussion so

414
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,850
what we have done with this virtually is

415
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,800
this very unified locus and finalized

416
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,840
path forward for reducing the staff and

417
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,240
also we narrowed down the options for

418
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:42,820
carrying the MPM CIT

419
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:46,240
mix like okay just to the abilities of

420
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:48,428
the people who are not here just to do

421
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,679
the background and in the problems that

422
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:54,280
is being addressed in this fact we are

423
00:26:50,679 --> 00:26:57,670
no release 1555 to the 132 a speical

424
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,610
jocks picture and maybe SSST most new

425
00:26:57,670 --> 00:27:06,580
mobility modes which are not fitting not

426
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:08,889
4G per se one is more satisfying but the

427
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,550
problem is the transport networks

428
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:15,130
there's no transport Venice for some of

429
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:18,100
let's take some of the spheres so this

430
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:20,590
is gives a default mirror our voice

431
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,540
better like LTE it's not an issue but

432
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,459
different traffic characteristics are

433
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:26,649
needed from the transport network for

434
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,290
example low and deterministic latency

435
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,710
are real dimensions with a lot DPR

436
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:35,260
characteristics that need to be need to

437
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,929
be fulfilled for some of the traffic

438
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,629
capacity types transport network need to

439
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:42,490
be awareness will be there the current

440
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,179
approach is very good for deaf

441
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,730
illegalities

442
00:27:43,179 --> 00:27:48,100
so this is the one of the problem that

443
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:49,149
is being adjusted is fact and also there

444
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,029
is a unsteady

445
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:53,619
under specified Rafi function of a DB

446
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:56,139
PPD accession to the passport Qatar

447
00:27:53,619 --> 00:28:02,499
place where different kind of te

448
00:27:56,139 --> 00:28:05,289
technology supposed to in one of them so

449
00:28:02,499 --> 00:28:07,989
the proposed solution in the last one

450
00:28:05,289 --> 00:28:11,559
the last IDF to here this is the last

451
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:14,320
idea solution so we deduce the concept

452
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,739
of John novelist because the concept of

453
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,089
available context identified which

454
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:21,159
carries the to reflect the slice

455
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:23,049
characteristics like isolation man you

456
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:26,259
know that dealing at the sticks and

457
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:29,799
slice characteristics mapped in the PLC

458
00:28:26,259 --> 00:28:32,919
identifier and this MPN see added

459
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:35,499
permittivity in is expected hi packet it

460
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,659
could be a solution that ended SRB fix

461
00:28:35,499 --> 00:28:39,759
if it is the overall resolution GD you

462
00:28:37,659 --> 00:28:41,919
can be used and there are also other so

463
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:44,619
other possible solutions are listed we

464
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,849
also comment from DMM what you wrote

465
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:49,119
that you know we're going to use the

466
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:50,710
lower 64 bits of ipv6 address and some

467
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:52,418
of the comments from peace what you hope

468
00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:54,729
is why don't you use the fast because

469
00:28:52,419 --> 00:28:57,580
kind of solution that is which is this

470
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:59,229
big by giving six so all these comments

471
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:01,389
they have taken care and we come up with

472
00:28:59,229 --> 00:29:03,820
the final approach and the next slide I

473
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,988
think most of the solution that was put

474
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,589
forth by John McCauley

475
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,589
you will present

476
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,249
[Music]

477
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:23,030
so before we go into this one question

478
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,710
right so this mapping it's not a new

479
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:27,740
problem in that sense right you know

480
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,750
over delay to underlay mapping it's not

481
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:36,140
not a new thing it's not a new

482
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:38,750
requirement in solution 2016 Ferengi are

483
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:42,400
slicing solutions are deployed they are

484
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,400
using proprietary way of wrapping things

485
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:48,408
it's not a new problem

486
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:50,990
they were non standardized way of

487
00:29:48,409 --> 00:29:53,030
mapping in early 2016 slicing solutions

488
00:29:50,990 --> 00:30:07,549
we just streamlining this approach with

489
00:29:53,030 --> 00:30:10,940
standard interchange so as I mentioned

490
00:30:07,549 --> 00:30:13,730
there were two different solutions and

491
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,690
one of the suggestions was to come up

492
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,880
with one so we took the discrete and the

493
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:24,220
integrated once in the earlier one and

494
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:31,250
have one single approach a simple and

495
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:36,010
that's all in Chapter two and the second

496
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:39,080
part of it was what required more work

497
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:43,280
section two here carrying the transport

498
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:46,340
context invisible packet header so we

499
00:30:43,280 --> 00:31:07,070
had a number of options are here on gue

500
00:30:46,340 --> 00:31:08,959
and SR v6 I think so so maybe you

501
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:16,210
already did this transport context from

502
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,210
how do you so I can explain that

503
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:32,320
so here we have the four steps I think

504
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:35,680
the first step is partly 3gpp work and

505
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,570
we we have specified anymore they made

506
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:41,800
clear that we mentioned that it's not

507
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:44,980
idea to come up with this mapping so

508
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:48,639
somewhere I mean in 3gpp that there are

509
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:56,490
these functions like MSS and networks

510
00:31:48,640 --> 00:32:01,150
like that is defined in the kv-85 30 and

511
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:03,580
they identified the 3gpp and that's

512
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,770
whenever functions and a transport

513
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:08,679
network in between so that's roughly

514
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:11,889
what we've done if you look on both ends

515
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:15,370
there are the network functions P Prime

516
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:19,930
and the UPF function and a transport

517
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:25,770
network in between and the management

518
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:30,160
playing manages to select the slice

519
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:33,310
aspects for the function to be funky and

520
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:38,350
the transport I believe they have also

521
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:42,159
selected a CTN in terms of managing that

522
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:47,919
slice but the details of it are still

523
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:51,790
under work in 3gpp a meaning s f5 so

524
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:54,820
that's why we've put in here that the

525
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:58,899
TNF is a logical function and it's not

526
00:32:54,820 --> 00:33:03,040
something via specify the interface the

527
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:06,690
can see can is idea it's an idea I've

528
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:10,389
seen a 453 which programs the IP

529
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,730
backhaul so the problem in essence are

530
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:16,900
going back to series question is that

531
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,990
the 3gpp slice aspects the NSS ai the

532
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:23,230
networks like selection resistance

533
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:27,010
information is related to what a user is

534
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:31,120
supplying and so the customer for the

535
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:32,980
3gpp network is the UE and the customer

536
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,370
for the transport network is the 3gpp

537
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,440
provider so somehow has not been mapping

538
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:39,389
between

539
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,850
was offered to the customer in the

540
00:33:39,389 --> 00:33:45,000
treaty P become a plus is what the

541
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:47,039
transport network has to couldn't we

542
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,019
the those are not the same there is a

543
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,460
it's not a one-to-one mapping you know

544
00:33:52,019 --> 00:34:00,919
for example there may be a thousand

545
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:04,860
customers in green slices or slices in

546
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:07,889
so something has to be done and and

547
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,839
that's what is being I mean that part of

548
00:34:07,889 --> 00:34:13,710
how they estimate and manage that

549
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,449
nothing is in 3gpp and you know we're

550
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:20,040
not specifying that if we're just

551
00:34:15,449 --> 00:34:23,489
offering it as explanation assuming that

552
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,619
that has been done and now their

553
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:30,709
information is not programmed one at the

554
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:33,210
SMS to the Ryan and the UVF then

555
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:37,918
whatever has been programmed in the IP

556
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:42,389
network has got to be realized for every

557
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:44,969
IP packet that transits and that's what

558
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:47,550
we're trying to do I mean I think I've

559
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:49,379
now explained those four steps so on the

560
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:54,990
m4 or you what you are getting in the

561
00:34:49,379 --> 00:35:03,000
context is truly an end to the you note

562
00:34:54,989 --> 00:35:05,540
B so I think for the IETF side the the

563
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:10,200
T's work would be related to the SPL

564
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:15,000
SBHC and a CPA and here we can see that

565
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:18,450
once the information is in the G note B

566
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,119
and the UPF unfortunately it's got to be

567
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:25,259
conveyed in the active packet so that

568
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,390
whatever was promised can be provided by

569
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,310
the trust and there's an implicit

570
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:31,650
assumption that that context identifier

571
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:36,650
is the transport is aware of that okay

572
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:39,150
dangerous assumption yes we assume that

573
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:41,480
actually that that's a good question we

574
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:44,400
assume that it is not made third session

575
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:46,290
so the estimation of whatever there are

576
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,050
various functions which we typically

577
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:51,210
that estimate over longer periods of

578
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:53,339
Chinese and that's

579
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,400
programmed in the transport network so

580
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:58,880
when a session comes it doesn't try to

581
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,819
go and figure out other resources and

582
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,059
it's been allocated and in only the

583
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:07,770
mapping information is conveyed and so

584
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,369
maybe on elementary question right now

585
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:12,150
this is I'm going to understand you know

586
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,760
not a name

587
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,589
so today if you like DHCP and all of

588
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,470
that you do mapping at a session layer

589
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:21,450
alright so now we are dealing at a slice

590
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:22,859
level what are the pros and cons of what

591
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:29,640
does that burn days of being this way

592
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:32,670
versus on the session layer session is

593
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:48,058
fine except that if you go to the next

594
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:50,940
page I have yes okay so DHCP is not an

595
00:36:48,059 --> 00:37:00,270
immutable field so as long as there is

596
00:36:50,940 --> 00:37:01,829
an agreement so that's one of the even

597
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:07,920
more than that I think you know things

598
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:10,770
like failure or isolation and aspects

599
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,900
like that of our slice are not invaded

600
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:17,759
easy so that's one answer so we look

601
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:19,799
through a number of alternate is just to

602
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,710
see if we can use what exists you know

603
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:25,530
and even so that's how we're coming to

604
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:27,839
do so if you go through it this the tcp

605
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,339
is more beautiful VLAN

606
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,220
I suppose it works in some scenarios

607
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:34,500
where if you have a customer and the

608
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,939
provider in the same network it's okay

609
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:41,700
it's not they three PN's

610
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:43,589
use that I mean also works in some

611
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:46,049
scenarios but not in many others where

612
00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:55,440
you you know it's very rigid provision

613
00:37:46,049 --> 00:37:57,270
else time also should work but so it

614
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,829
works on the some scenarios but it's

615
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,950
harder to provision I suppose it's

616
00:37:58,829 --> 00:38:00,950
possible

617
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:08,069
GTP header

618
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,899
the problem is they may be a qfi in the

619
00:38:08,069 --> 00:38:13,380
count stream but not on the upstream and

620
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,829
in any case it's too deep for infection

621
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:24,030
and so that's what we were looking at in

622
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:25,530
terms of those video yeah I Know Who I

623
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:28,140
am so I won't say who I am for the

624
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:30,359
minutes but I'm doing this the

625
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:32,609
interesting thing here is is that source

626
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,180
port is normally used as a source of

627
00:38:32,609 --> 00:38:39,598
entropy for ecmp so I'm kind of

628
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:54,149
wondering how either you're turning ecmp

629
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:57,059
off or I'll keep my powder driving so

630
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:00,150
we're only using specific ranges which

631
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:06,569
immerse for that entropy and make sure

632
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:09,660
that there are no effect and also since

633
00:39:06,569 --> 00:39:18,058
it is gtp we can so we're not altering

634
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:20,819
the source port of the just a question

635
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:25,369
that's question auto farm so it's

636
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:29,160
interesting to to when we see the P out

637
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:34,339
to be able to look up the UDP source

638
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:38,009
code source port to handle which tries

639
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:40,380
pocket bringing bring doubt so on so

640
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:46,440
which working group will stand let

641
00:39:40,380 --> 00:40:00,240
somebody walk on the the dot P router to

642
00:39:46,440 --> 00:40:02,849
be able to handle source port so we do

643
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:08,939
not think of adding if there's something

644
00:40:02,849 --> 00:40:15,150
that needs to be done no my question is

645
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:17,010
ID mmm is a place to just on walk walk

646
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:20,160
on you yes on dot for the mobility

647
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:23,640
monument in distribution mana and act on

648
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,069
work on the truck engineering and you

649
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,598
now propose the UDP source port other

650
00:40:26,069 --> 00:40:33,180
yeah the ID to mapping the mobility

651
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:38,010
session to the transporter resource so

652
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:43,740
so which idea who are working group to

653
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:46,200
define that behavior there is no what

654
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:49,140
Cooper say here it's a local mapping

655
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:50,669
function and the PE nodes how do you map

656
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:52,379
the incoming session to this local

657
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:54,210
policy based routing right today to

658
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,400
falsely based routing based on various

659
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:58,380
packet fields you map this information

660
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,569
incoming traffic to map to the tunnels

661
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,130
so what we are suggesting is this it's

662
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:03,808
not a new thing putting in the UDP

663
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,660
source port that is used for today for

664
00:41:03,809 --> 00:41:09,030
the for example what Dave is asking for

665
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:11,098
load balancing at both English side and

666
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:13,049
that ran side are also on the UPF side

667
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:14,700
both sides so we are latching on to this

668
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:15,509
mechanism we are extending one more

669
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,058
indirection

670
00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:20,160
but some of this extra indirection we

671
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:22,049
created to encode this empty anxiety

672
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,578
indirectly so there is no working group

673
00:41:22,049 --> 00:41:24,900
it's already working on working fields

674
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:27,240
so that's why this approach we felt that

675
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:35,790
it's backward compatible even with

676
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:37,319
existing 4G slicing solutions yeah

677
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:38,970
suresh krisshnan so one of the things

678
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:40,349
that concerns me here is right you're

679
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:42,509
rewriting the UDP ports are you

680
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:44,220
calculating the UDP checksum again or

681
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:46,230
like you know how does it actually work

682
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:49,549
because unless you turn off the checksum

683
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:49,549
the packet is going to be dropped right

684
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,869
encoding happens at the G note P or the

685
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,279
UPF so we are not doing any additional

686
00:41:57,869 --> 00:42:01,559
stuff which if you see that what is

687
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,809
happening is this operator control this

688
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,700
particular range of the UDP port map it

689
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:07,290
to this particular empty and CID so

690
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:08,848
there's no rewriting the first time and

691
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,980
the GT encapsulation happens this

692
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:13,079
mapping happens so what happens in the

693
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,240
pierrot trees only lookup and map it to

694
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:17,609
the particulate eternal so there's no

695
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,899
okay make sense like it wasn't clear

696
00:42:17,609 --> 00:42:20,460
because it looked like you know it was

697
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,730
happening somewhere and in the wire

698
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,510
there some like between the P and the G

699
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:26,510
not be so

700
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:39,450
okay this is Yasuo and I think the

701
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:42,089
v/line eye team should not be excluded

702
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:44,730
in this solution because in the first

703
00:42:42,089 --> 00:42:51,140
hub from the run to the P note the

704
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:54,809
villain can represent the network slice

705
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:59,129
information and in the IP domain we can

706
00:42:54,809 --> 00:43:04,559
use other NATO slice encapsulation to

707
00:42:59,130 --> 00:43:30,050
respect the information so I think is a

708
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:45,299
reasonable solution to you Stadium name

709
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:49,410
yeah Mahoney purchases for correct

710
00:43:45,299 --> 00:43:51,930
understanding so the since UDP is a be

711
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:54,480
directional thing so both end points of

712
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:57,299
the GDP tunnel have to use the same

713
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,000
transport network identifier in the

714
00:43:57,299 --> 00:44:01,680
source port or is it can they be

715
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,559
different can you have multiple of these

716
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,930
identifiers to unambitious li identify

717
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:17,730
the slice that the traffic is associated

718
00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:19,710
with I think it's an important aspect

719
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:23,130
because for implementation you may have

720
00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:26,640
multiple IP endpoints through a

721
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:30,410
percentage GDP between 2 to same nodes

722
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,410
right followed balancing or whatever

723
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:49,319
if there is a maze electric that's that

724
00:44:45,089 --> 00:44:51,599
should not be is there any reason to not

725
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:58,470
use identifiers which are part of the

726
00:44:51,599 --> 00:45:00,779
gtp you header the upstream we don't

727
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:03,240
necessarily have to use energy 20 on the

728
00:45:00,779 --> 00:45:10,490
downstream as long as that translation

729
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:14,879
is mapped in note to mean the same thing

730
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:17,879
and they are and the advantage of using

731
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:21,410
this identifier instead of using for

732
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:24,599
example the T IDs in the GDP is to have

733
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:32,339
less keys to to look up for the

734
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:44,910
transport network we could get some

735
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:47,160
viewers information from the QD maps to

736
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:53,279
Barrow right you do get the the

737
00:45:47,160 --> 00:46:03,739
information transferred has no

738
00:45:53,279 --> 00:46:07,410
atmosphere hi I am Erin Kelly J so for

739
00:46:03,739 --> 00:46:10,499
UDP saucepot how does G never be knows

740
00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:15,118
it's Aussie OTP no are you going to use

741
00:46:10,499 --> 00:46:31,019
existing n2 and for interface with some

742
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:35,400
kind of extension should be handed by

743
00:46:31,019 --> 00:46:37,618
the IP in terms of how to as Dave asked

744
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,539
the question about how to handle entropy

745
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,029
and how to make sure that there are no

746
00:46:39,539 --> 00:46:44,130
rules

747
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:52,489
so you don't use existing 3gpp

748
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:52,489
controller function right p SG p okay

749
00:46:52,920 --> 00:47:05,730
okay thank you pretty much yeah great

750
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:09,030
discussion any any other comments

751
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:13,230
cushions so yeah this is a looks very

752
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:21,570
interesting but I think so just you know

753
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:24,360
you guys any other serration leave any

754
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:32,300
comments okay all right yeah again good

755
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:32,300
stuff yeah thanks so you're asking us to

756
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,740
so I think before that let us ask how

757
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:46,320
many people you know read the document

758
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:53,970
can you I saw one two three four okay so

759
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:58,050
I think maybe you know we can ask but I

760
00:47:53,970 --> 00:48:02,430
think you guys want to engage Carlos

761
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:06,420
erasure one comment I think the the last

762
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:10,080
part of the work the how to map in the

763
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:13,890
user plan from the run to the IP

764
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:16,529
backhaul I think this is whether this

765
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:19,160
part of work can be separated from the

766
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:22,140
current draft I think this is some

767
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:24,060
isolated work and this is very important

768
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:26,339
for the network slicing mapping

769
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:29,430
relationship you know data plan this is

770
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,620
just a suggestion so why are you say I'm

771
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:32,819
just curious on dirt so you want that

772
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:37,859
can be taken up in a separate document

773
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:41,310
and different working group I just think

774
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:44,100
this part of work is not so relevant to

775
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:46,560
the rest part of the I think it's not

776
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:49,020
connected very strictly together they're

777
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:51,840
just different work they are all

778
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:59,850
important but they can be existing in

779
00:48:51,840 --> 00:49:03,390
different drafts okay that's just the

780
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:06,210
user plan map your relationship the just

781
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:10,850
some solutions you list

782
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:21,750
in the previous slides which I comment

783
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:24,589
yes yes yes I can openers again I I can

784
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:25,890
also take a look and provide a review to

785
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:31,530
okay

786
00:49:25,890 --> 00:49:33,480
okay Carlos thank you so which truck do

787
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:40,020
you prefer informational or stone the

788
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:43,320
truck I think there's not they're not

789
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,240
defining new standards okay so we marked

790
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:50,640
it as informational but I'm not an

791
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:52,620
expert on this okay okay okay yeah yeah

792
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,470
let's make sure there's more discussion

793
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:56,670
and I think this good feedback but yeah

794
00:49:55,470 --> 00:50:12,330
yeah thanks thank you

795
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:14,280
Thanks next one is all textual

796
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:31,520
discussions on a survey six mobile user

797
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:39,300
plain from my name is MIA and I'm

798
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:42,930
presenting on behalf of so today I got

799
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:46,290
to talk about motivation oh and I fixed

800
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:53,009
our discussion and some execs occasion

801
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:54,720
and so the direct the motivation is

802
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:58,940
pretty much similar to the previous

803
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:58,939
presentation how to map the

804
00:51:02,610 --> 00:51:09,430
I'd like to address a candle with a

805
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,470
level 4 systematics I need to be looking

806
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:14,259
at the holistically and across layers

807
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:17,439
when drastic architectural transition is

808
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,660
required for example in the 5c era we

809
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,690
are various decisions are to be

810
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:25,359
supported and we are completely new data

811
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:27,700
intensive on services like an elastic

812
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:30,730
narrative is to get it within our soon

813
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:33,220
um this document discusses the

814
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:35,680
architectural implication of our prices

815
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:39,129
are the six memory user plain not

816
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:41,830
necessarily six button especially

817
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:45,610
regarding the possible optimization work

818
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:48,160
with existing conventional players yes

819
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,710
we hope it suggests that Excel basics

820
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,120
mobile user claim is a right afflicted

821
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:54,120
choice for E and Sierra

822
00:51:54,450 --> 00:52:02,790
so mobile network and the transport

823
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,790
network are separated by layers

824
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:10,630
convenient Food Network it's um under a

825
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:13,540
layer to the mobile network and GDP you

826
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:19,450
is an over a tonal in the movie team

827
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:22,990
network they have solved any problem but

828
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:26,620
each they are developed independently in

829
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:30,939
order to solve any programs which could

830
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:38,710
result in overall efficiency right like

831
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:41,950
I'm famous saying by Peter on in KT so

832
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:45,730
let's take an example of network slicing

833
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:49,299
into a network sizing so in typical TTP

834
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:52,990
you over IP MPLS SSL configuration are 3

835
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:56,800
GPP data-planet entity such as UPF is a

836
00:52:52,990 --> 00:53:01,689
c e to the transport networks are PE or

837
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:06,310
even needed extra see each lecture scale

838
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:14,490
on which of these are paper to analysis

839
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:14,490
easier in this nicely explained the

840
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:22,470
so with the current touch this since

841
00:53:19,589 --> 00:53:26,210
mobile network and transport network is

842
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:30,479
separated on which complicated

843
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:33,900
complicates the architecture so as we

844
00:53:30,479 --> 00:53:36,899
discussed in the previous presentation a

845
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:46,349
certain extra ID such as right william

846
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:50,809
NP or extra is needed for secure getting

847
00:53:46,349 --> 00:53:58,200
traffic and nothing also artistic sliced

848
00:53:50,809 --> 00:54:00,690
in the same week and also TLP is in ze

849
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:03,239
connection it's a sin organ failure and

850
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:07,319
so some form of be a leader you can see

851
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:10,799
using nothing protocol or ancillary kind

852
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:27,319
of things are required which complicates

853
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:27,319
the architecture fits right so and if we

854
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:38,609
then we can simplify the architects are

855
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:41,029
not and now that touch controls the use

856
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:46,529
of a separation it's a mainstream

857
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:50,489
practice and user training these are

858
00:54:46,529 --> 00:54:52,829
dedicated to father so in that case it

859
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:56,549
is reasonable to have 3gpp take a very

860
00:54:52,829 --> 00:55:04,259
entities like ups on the part of our

861
00:54:56,549 --> 00:55:07,200
health network this is AC TPP and it

862
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:11,999
says the controlling abusive em

863
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,910
separated and if we move to the border

864
00:55:11,999 --> 00:55:17,759
the main of this model is there's no

865
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:19,200
need for pece hierarchy but there's no

866
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:23,190
need for extracting

867
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:27,348
for traffic mapping and we can directly

868
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,349
control the underlying business

869
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:38,460
from the perspective of implementation

870
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:41,640
Cameron says it's unrealistic 630 PP SD

871
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:45,330
that don't care about resulting but I

872
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:49,370
would say it's realistic and even it's

873
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:52,350
more national in the new generation

874
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:55,529
since I still use cases in I own

875
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:57,690
flexibility of crowd negative and in the

876
00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,690
clouds negative as hugs mich Mich

877
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:04,830
deployments aside the cod proxy on the

878
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:06,450
same solution good or the second copula

879
00:56:04,830 --> 00:56:08,759
port would take care of the

880
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:13,529
communication thank you for coming for

881
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:25,920
more such kind of things so that service

882
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:29,040
can be cymatics and some may say that

883
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:33,930
the administrative domain itself I

884
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:37,680
reached and they don't more they may not

885
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:40,740
want to expose that to proceed but in

886
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,259
the case SL segment routing findings it

887
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:52,169
can be used if the protein is to be

888
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:53,880
hidden and for each computer um it's a

889
00:56:52,170 --> 00:56:56,280
v6 fictional traffic's general

890
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:59,640

for all freely describing instructions

892
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:06,629

it distributed computing in addition

894

since is a v6 can be accommodated rain

895
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:15,390
regardless of a domain such as access by

896
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:18,900
the area mobility or there is a

897
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:21,569
datacenter some spreads memory and some

898
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,760
Cheney that used to be concentrated in

899
00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:28,260
data center historically

900
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:31,980
can be expanded over our by the area it

901
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:34,710
is good for and with a certain six

902
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:39,870
system and the QoS information can be

903
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:41,340
exposed in the IP header which does not

904
00:57:39,870 --> 00:57:43,348
affect performance with

905
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:46,320
uh thanks to the wrong estimate genetic

906
00:57:43,349 --> 00:57:49,050
mechanism is I figured grunting so only

907
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:51,720
the services or applications will need

908
00:57:49,050 --> 00:57:55,470
to meet that information for granular

909
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:58,649
processing ah to look up that kind of

910
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:02,939
information so this would are effects

911
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:08,430
replacement oxide applications and for

912
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:12,240
you our energy into undeniable low-rated

915
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:21,840
that key issues for making the URL still

916
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:26,160
comments related see GTA V T in the

917
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:28,770
fantasy system however that solution

918
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:31,230
provided in such document are focused at

919
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:33,810
including the override protocol and the

920
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:39,810
limit to provide a few kinks in to hug

921
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:41,609
him out such a survey included and the

922
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:43,680
DA themes are based on the static

923
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:45,660
configuration or static mapping for

924
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,379
steering that over a parking garage

925
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:51,960
across medicinal and such solutions do

926
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:57,810
not scale and he does about economics

927
00:58:51,960 --> 00:59:02,099
and that document six one six two six

928
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:04,109
two four addresses the issues on how to

929
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:08,880
support redundant data transmission via

930
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:11,369
a single uvf and signal our landlord but

931
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:15,089
how to ensure that this do it fast

932
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:18,089
is not enough in the government it just

933
00:59:15,089 --> 00:59:20,810
says using different IP address or

934
00:59:18,089 --> 00:59:28,160
different ever instances but it's not

935
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:31,080
assure that the path is disjoint Hana

936
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,618
GDP data plane entities need to support

937
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:37,319
pack identification and elimination this

938
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:44,330
actually requires the modification of

939
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:48,859
gtp you protocol itself so if it need to

940
00:59:44,330 --> 00:59:54,290
evolve CPU independently but I would say

941
00:59:48,859 --> 00:59:54,290
it's not good it's too much

942
00:59:54,450 --> 01:00:07,000
the SLV six mobile user plain also has

943
00:59:58,090 --> 01:00:15,700
an advantage in this list you need to

944
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:25,420
order house it's okay I kind of made our

945
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:27,430
discussions or and and I hope this kind

946
01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,790
of discussion and comments discussion

947
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:33,060
I'll work on and I Drive I hope that the

948
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,060
Amen

949
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:42,390
Thank You Mia questions comments John

950
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:51,368
thank you good points on the URL LC in

951
01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:55,839
the complicated Network just a question

952
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:58,060
how does SR v6 allow the paths to be

953
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:00,510
disjoint you know can you elaborate on

954
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,509
that a bit

955
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:19,470
also it could provide the TRAF a which

956
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:24,009
assure the some fifty minutes they can't

957
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:27,910
importance and the point is that the SL

958
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:33,390
is all-aware entities can directly

959
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:33,390
control that kind of mechanism know

960
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:48,100
maybe the question I didn't put it

961
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:54,010
particularly I mean if we have the path

962
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:56,350
between the G note BN I UPF and PSA UPF

963
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:59,890
and there are two of them how do we make

964
01:01:56,350 --> 01:02:03,310
sure that these paths are disjoint using

965
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:04,660
a cell b6 maybe it's a detailed question

966
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:11,890
and you know

967
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:14,740
it's beauty obey some v6 fancy okay mini

968
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:16,720
John we can hire offline or because the

969
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:22,118
single topic right maybe I suggest I

970
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:24,399
think Suresh

971
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:27,250
yeah suresh krisshnan so one question

972
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,690
konasana like this is I understand why

973
01:02:27,250 --> 01:02:29,950
you are doing this right I'm trying to

974
01:02:28,690 --> 01:02:32,200
understand why it's a separate document

975
01:02:29,950 --> 01:02:34,390
so why is it not something that's folded

976
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,460
into the satoru sons document or homo

977
01:02:34,390 --> 01:03:19,480
sons document as like either an analysis

978
01:02:36,460 --> 01:03:21,849
either on the solution to say like ok I

979
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:23,589
I think though and that I think the text

980
01:03:21,849 --> 01:03:25,510
itself is useful I'm not sure about the

981
01:03:23,589 --> 01:03:28,869
form of how it needs to go so I think

982
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:31,359
it's probably worth my discussing how it

983
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:33,549
actually proceeds ok because like as you

984
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,900
like know right a lot of the times like

985
01:03:33,549 --> 01:03:38,500
you know when you have a document like

986
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:40,720
this which has like it's pretty

987
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:42,339
dependent on other stuff right so the

988
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:43,660
question is why should it be a separate

989
01:03:42,339 --> 01:03:45,130
document right and this is something

990
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,420
that comes up in the iesg I told

991
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:48,460
straight right like we have an IE AC

992
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:50,619
statement right on what is called

993
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,299
support documents so I would really like

994
01:03:50,619 --> 01:03:53,650
the working group to think about it and

995
01:03:52,299 --> 01:03:55,119
if the working group decides it needs to

996
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:56,980
be separate that's fine but I just want

997
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,049
to put it up there so you think about

998
01:03:56,980 --> 01:04:00,910
like why it needs to be separate and put

999
01:03:59,049 --> 01:04:03,038
it in the write-up 480 separate okay

1000
01:04:00,910 --> 01:04:04,750
thanks absolutely I think great points I

1001
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:07,990
think I'll just chime in there right I

1002
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,910
think you brought out number of good

1003
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:12,009
points there I think but salacious

1004
01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:13,180
cushion is a very fundamental to this in

1005
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:16,779
the sense that there's already two

1006
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:18,609
documents right now if we can fold some

1007
01:04:16,779 --> 01:04:20,230
things there it's great

1008
01:04:18,609 --> 01:04:21,970
if you still have some good stuff which

1009
01:04:20,230 --> 01:04:23,470
may you know if you're given justify

1010
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:25,720
that you know we need one good one

1011
01:04:23,470 --> 01:04:27,939
document which you know covers the

1012
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:31,299
overall thing if you can justify that we

1013
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:32,710
can but again yeah it's good stuff in

1014
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:36,460
there but let's get the feedback showing

1015
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:39,220
us here oh my name is sumo furious a so

1016
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:41,950
I read this document it's she's raising

1017
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:43,689
very interesting overall big question to

1018
01:04:41,950 --> 01:04:47,470
the community actually she's asking I

1019
01:04:43,690 --> 01:04:50,710
think now I understand better the second

1020
01:04:47,470 --> 01:04:52,390
presentation because it has this

1021
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:56,470
directly connection right like like you

1022
01:04:52,390 --> 01:04:58,299
can collapse gtp you and SR v6 and you

1023
01:04:56,470 --> 01:05:00,700
can have much more transport benefits

1024
01:04:58,299 --> 01:05:05,230
you can get that's all good but the only

1025
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:08,759
question I have is so that we are

1026
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:11,470
seeking like you know the it's kind of

1027
01:05:08,759 --> 01:05:14,230
envisioning in future only ipv6 based

1028
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:16,299
transport right so what happens to the

1029
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,890
backward compatibility these kind of

1030
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:20,109
things I said I think this recipe be

1031
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,210
stuck with gtp right like and with the

1032
01:05:20,109 --> 01:05:25,359
discussion started they were only using

1033
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:28,239
an S for new they move to a nine now and

1034
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:31,450
they were new they moved gtp u2f anew so

1035
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:33,849
they are expanding gtp usage while we

1036
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:35,618
are discussing you know how to give the

1037
01:05:33,849 --> 01:05:37,930
much more transport benefits right so

1038
01:05:35,619 --> 01:05:39,640
there's some tussle going on there so I

1039
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:41,950
think this is a good document I think

1040
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,650
you you laid out the points what s our

1041
01:05:41,950 --> 01:05:45,999
v6 can bring it to the network but it

1042
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:52,569
says much more bigger discussion I

1043
01:05:45,999 --> 01:05:54,999
should okay on a flight from Nokia in

1044
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:58,029
the slides you you mentioned service

1045
01:05:54,999 --> 01:06:01,509
miss you know I wonder what that has to

1046
01:05:58,029 --> 01:06:04,269
do with slicing I think it's more for

1047
01:06:01,509 --> 01:06:19,779
the control plane entities into a TPP

1048
01:06:04,269 --> 01:06:22,779
and its implementation so conventional

1049
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:29,140
thinking about thinking need to be

1050
01:06:22,779 --> 01:06:31,569
double negative okay but but what is the

1051
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:32,368
role of a survey six in with this

1052
01:06:31,569 --> 01:06:36,720
service

1053
01:06:32,369 --> 01:06:43,349
so that proxies I think we're talking

1054
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:46,200
about different player doesn't know

1055
01:06:43,349 --> 01:06:49,019
routing doesn't know it's not v6 that

1056
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:51,839
kind of argument could happen but I

1057
01:06:49,019 --> 01:06:59,038
would say just if there could be a kind

1058
01:06:51,839 --> 01:07:02,640
of proxy or sidecar which feat can only

1059
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:04,049
do the routing for getting stuff right

1060
01:07:02,640 --> 01:07:08,069
now rafting on the console

1061
01:07:04,049 --> 01:07:10,559
implementation so the application

1062
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:14,788
doesn't know the wrong thing but another

1063
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:20,009
thing sits in de host in that case we

1064
01:07:14,789 --> 01:07:24,660
can provide being probably from the host

1065
01:07:20,009 --> 01:07:26,789
okay I just want to respond to the same

1066
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,799
things approaching no Cisco so I think

1067
01:07:26,789 --> 01:07:32,930
it was actually really like that analogy

1068
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:35,640
of site car I related to this specific

1069
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:38,160
content in the drop because the site

1070
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:40,710
card this whole motion is to allow for

1071
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:42,359
the proxy to sit just sank to the

1072
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:44,759
application themselves so if you think

1073
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:46,319
about these different network functions

1074
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:48,900
these different functions related to the

1075
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:53,249
Ryan or than the FRG Seaside these

1076
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,809
functions are now capable of hosting

1077
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:56,488
where they are sitting which are hosts

1078
01:07:54,809 --> 01:07:59,160
now they can have these routing

1079
01:07:56,489 --> 01:08:02,519
according notes next to them just like

1080
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:04,470
what the on where the proxies do so the

1081
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:07,558
notion of having them adjacent to each

1082
01:08:04,470 --> 01:08:09,359
other clearly has tons of benefits as

1083
01:08:07,559 --> 01:08:16,859
proven in the cloud scale so thank you

1084
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:20,370
for actually including that site cars

1085
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:24,839
are functioning at the HTTP level not

1086
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:27,750
assert v6 which is quite low in in the

1087
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:30,509
protocol stack so I still I'm on the

1088
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:32,819
opinion that we are mixing things now

1089
01:08:30,509 --> 01:08:35,609
very bad if there is application level

1090
01:08:32,819 --> 01:08:38,250
routing HTTP level request routing

1091
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:40,949
that's the business of sidecar and then

1092
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:46,288
we have this services which is an IP

1093
01:08:40,948 --> 01:08:48,988
level or maybe even below it

1094
01:08:46,288 --> 01:08:51,028
indeed so there's also the notion of

1095
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:53,068
application routing so with HTTP then

1096
01:08:51,029 --> 01:08:55,920
there's a network services mesh which is

1097
01:08:53,069 --> 01:08:57,929
at IP so I think that that those lines

1098
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,960
have been blurring for for quite some

1099
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,960
time

1100
01:09:00,109 --> 01:09:04,589
suresh krisshnan just like closing off

1101
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:06,359
on this one all right like so the way I

1102
01:09:04,589 --> 01:09:09,689
understood it is right like you know the

1103
01:09:06,359 --> 01:09:11,549
the the cyclic pattern as a design

1104
01:09:09,689 --> 01:09:12,928
pattern allows for the application to be

1105
01:09:11,549 --> 01:09:15,118
unaware of what's happening underneath

1106
01:09:12,929 --> 01:09:16,949
right so as I said it's right now used

1107
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:18,328
for HTTP like certificate like offload

1108
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:21,028
and things like that for the security

1109
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:23,549
but I think konasana spoink was like you

1110
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:25,230
know if your s r v6 is like put in a

1111
01:09:23,549 --> 01:09:26,969
sidecar pattern then your application

1112
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:29,339
doesn't need to know about it so you can

1113
01:09:26,969 --> 01:09:31,589
take your vnf today is inside a vm and

1114
01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:34,170
you can continue eyes it and that can

1115
01:09:31,589 --> 01:09:36,328
take s r v6 asses and use it i think

1116
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:42,149
that's kind of a thinking that's how I

1117
01:09:36,328 --> 01:09:46,349
understood it ok any other final

1118
01:09:42,149 --> 01:09:48,778
questions cords ok thank you me I think

1119
01:09:46,349 --> 01:09:50,309
yeah this is again good work a lot of

1120
01:09:48,779 --> 01:09:52,230
good stuff in there like the previous

1121
01:09:50,309 --> 01:09:54,119
sir docker right I think we need more

1122
01:09:52,229 --> 01:09:57,329
discussions and we'll take it from there

1123
01:09:54,118 --> 01:09:59,518
I think the last comment is this

1124
01:09:57,329 --> 01:10:01,079
presentation - on this presentation are

1125
01:09:59,519 --> 01:10:07,260
very much connected actually what you

1126
01:10:01,079 --> 01:10:09,329
guys are trying right so one of the

1127
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,659
document this one more on a maintenance

1128
01:10:09,329 --> 01:10:29,268
track this is from mobility capability

1129
01:10:12,659 --> 01:10:29,268
negotiation protocols okay one second

1130
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:47,308
sorry thank you too much of our call

1131
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:54,379
last night no sheets please ok get

1132
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:54,380
everybody sign the blue sheets ok sorry

1133
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:19,849
turn it on is it okay thank you and the

1134
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:23,840
other authors of this draft isn't only

1135
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:26,780
from Hawaii and li geom her and actually

1136
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:31,940
I guess the UH noona has pride in did

1137
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:35,269
this draft last time and we did a lot of

1138
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:39,160
extensions and polish it a lot and now I

1139
01:11:35,270 --> 01:11:39,160
will introduce it here

1140
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:50,709
[Music]

1141
01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:13,860
and we all know that the ATF and other

1142
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:17,489
organizations has standardized my new

1143
01:12:13,860 --> 01:12:20,040
mobility management protocols and we can

1144
01:12:17,489 --> 01:12:21,839
put him into two categories the network

1145
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:24,360
based solutions and the host based

1146
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:27,870
solutions and in the network based

1147
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:32,000
solutions the main protocols other PM IP

1148
01:12:27,870 --> 01:12:34,800
based protocols and the extensions and

1149
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,659
similarly for the host based protocols

1150
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,219
and mainly based on the movie accurate

1151
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:50,849
six and some extensions so a question

1152
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:53,730
here is the item okay and the window

1153
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:56,030
mobile node access to the network maybe

1154
01:12:53,730 --> 01:12:58,559
the first time access all the handover

1155
01:12:56,030 --> 01:13:01,679
what kind of mobility management

1156
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:04,409
protocol can be used and because of the

1157
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,989
network may support some protocols and

1158
01:13:04,409 --> 01:13:09,900
the host miss supported some protocols

1159
01:13:06,989 --> 01:13:12,989
and maybe the host to pray for something

1160
01:13:09,900 --> 01:13:18,659
and different from the capability of the

1161
01:13:12,989 --> 01:13:21,780
network so this charter mainly research

1162
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:24,080
on this problem and to choose Portland

1163
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:35,070
negotiation of the mobility capability

1164
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:38,730
between the host and the network so we

1165
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:42,059
may have some basic principles here is

1166
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:44,489
that the first one is to during the

1167
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:46,739
negotiation when to follow the network

1168
01:13:44,489 --> 01:13:49,409
ability and the second is follow the

1169
01:13:46,739 --> 01:13:52,919
host preference and third a supporter of

1170
01:13:49,409 --> 01:13:54,269
functional extensions and the first one

1171
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,130
is to support the performance

1172
01:13:54,270 --> 01:13:59,159
enhancements for example some fast

1173
01:13:56,130 --> 01:14:02,179
handover or something like that and in

1174
01:13:59,159 --> 01:14:04,199
default in order to guarantee are the

1175
01:14:02,179 --> 01:14:07,110
performance of the mobility management

1176
01:14:04,199 --> 01:14:09,839
the network based schemes can be should

1177
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:12,299
be used if it can be supported so after

1178
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,000
the initial attachment of the mobile

1179
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:17,199
node a profile will be generated in the

1180
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,850
management store to recover the

1181
01:14:17,199 --> 01:14:21,190
selected I'll pray for the protocol of

1182
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:24,160
this host and when the handover happens

1183
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:26,379
the network network will check the

1184
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,719
selected or preffered protocol but the

1185
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:31,120
network also need to notify the host if

1186
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:39,219
the slack here the protocol cannot be

1187
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:41,830
spotted in the new area and we have some

1188
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:46,300
examples in the draft and I at least one

1189
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:49,360
example here is that a host and network

1190
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:52,239
post supports a network based protocols

1191
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:53,199
and for example when the host of support

1192
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,570
to the basics

1193
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:58,960
proxy mobile ipv6 and the network's for

1194
01:14:55,570 --> 01:15:02,799
some extension extension solves the

1195
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:04,929
based on the proxxon mobile ipv6 then if

1196
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,929
the extension protocol no parity

1197
01:15:04,929 --> 01:15:11,530
racing's has no requirement for the

1198
01:15:07,929 --> 01:15:14,170
mobile node in a moment it can be used

1199
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:16,929
and otherwise the basic theme of the

1200
01:15:14,170 --> 01:15:20,020
ipv6 should be used and the second case

1201
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:22,500
is is the item when the network and the

1202
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:25,750
host post is supposed some extension

1203
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:28,570
protocols and if the extensions are same

1204
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:31,210
it can be used otherwise the basic

1205
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:36,400
approximate actives proximity heuristics

1206
01:15:31,210 --> 01:15:38,650
can be selected and then we need some

1207
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:40,449
solutions here is that the signaling

1208
01:15:38,650 --> 01:15:42,989
messages should be exchanged between the

1209
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:46,299
host and the network to exchange this

1210
01:15:42,989 --> 01:15:49,178
preference and the ability and may be

1211
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:51,670
based on the extension of the icmpv6 or

1212
01:15:49,179 --> 01:15:54,489
some authentication messages and another

1213
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:57,190
problem we need to consider is who will

1214
01:15:54,489 --> 01:16:03,129
initiate this negotiation the host or

1215
01:15:57,190 --> 01:16:09,040
the network solution are you done with

1216
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:13,060
the presentation or last and we give out

1217
01:16:09,040 --> 01:16:18,460
a possible solution is based on icmpv6

1218
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:21,400
is a new option here is proposed on it

1219
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:24,280
namely mobility capability MC option

1220
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:26,650
with the corresponding flag in the eyes

1221
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:29,500
a message when the mobile node and

1222
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:31,179
network exchange of the eyes I a message

1223
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:34,090
the private

1224
01:16:31,179 --> 01:16:38,350
preference and the supportive protocols

1225
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:40,480
can be can be can be included in this

1226
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:44,260
option and then the protocol get

1227
01:16:40,480 --> 01:16:46,690
disliked either final yeah okay suresh

1228
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:49,480
krisshnan ass like responsibility here

1229
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:51,129
right so one of the things is that like

1230
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,299
everything you say has been tried before

1231
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:54,370
the idea

1232
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:57,969
yeah multiple times so if you go back to

1233
01:16:54,370 --> 01:17:00,790
like 2007-2008 the net lmm mnar

1234
01:16:57,969 --> 01:17:02,679
interface is exactly this okay except

1235
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:04,360
that it never worked because like a

1236
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:05,650
network usually decides if the network

1237
01:17:04,360 --> 01:17:06,790
decides is going to do some kind of

1238
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:08,469
mobility it's gonna do it

1239
01:17:06,790 --> 01:17:09,790
right so it's not going to negotiate

1240
01:17:08,469 --> 01:17:11,140
with the host why it's gonna do it

1241
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:14,080
that's kind of something we found out

1242
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:15,460
like as a result right it's not that we

1243
01:17:14,080 --> 01:17:17,820
didn't try so there's been multiple

1244
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:20,560
iterations of this I know there's one

1245
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:22,540
like Raj and I did for like you know see

1246
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,429
my purses pmf is something you tried

1247
01:17:22,540 --> 01:17:26,350
like she did some prefix coloring stuff

1248
01:17:24,429 --> 01:17:27,909
so there's been like multiple failed

1249
01:17:26,350 --> 01:17:30,969
attempts at this right

1250
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:32,679
mainly because of not technical reasons

1251
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:35,830
okay so there's like you know it doesn't

1252
01:17:32,679 --> 01:17:38,320
fit any deployment scenario there like

1253
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:39,699
so I'm positing that there's no

1254
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:41,139
deployment scenario where this would be

1255
01:17:39,699 --> 01:17:43,589
useful right because if you take the

1256
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:48,730
architectures none of them are made to

1257
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:50,199
allow this okay so if you can figure out

1258
01:17:48,730 --> 01:17:51,099
like you know where you would use this

1259
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:52,900
like you know who are the people

1260
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:54,730
interested in this I think we can pursue

1261
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:56,440
this but otherwise like we know there's

1262
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:58,299
like a lot of past history of failures

1263
01:17:56,440 --> 01:18:00,250
in this thing because the incentives are

1264
01:17:58,300 --> 01:18:03,489
not aligned for people to do this okay

1265
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:05,170
so think about it how you would apply

1266
01:18:03,489 --> 01:18:06,790
this where you would apply this I think

1267
01:18:05,170 --> 01:18:11,199
that could be very useful input for the

1268
01:18:06,790 --> 01:18:13,690
group to decide if it's useful Thanks I

1269
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:16,650
think that's a great time input I think

1270
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:20,710
mmm er interface document that was

1271
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:23,199
Julien published it and say I think the

1272
01:18:20,710 --> 01:18:25,239
network to end point interface was one

1273
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:27,339
thing we truly missed you know we don't

1274
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:29,379
have it even today right in any of this

1275
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:31,659
right having a standardized interface

1276
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:37,060
makes sense but we could not somehow we

1277
01:18:31,659 --> 01:18:38,379
always feel we tried but we fail so so I

1278
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:40,030
think it's the question is you know we

1279
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:42,639
need to see you know we need to look at

1280
01:18:40,030 --> 01:18:44,280
the previous work and see what we can do

1281
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:46,320
now is there

1282
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:48,420
the situation change can we push it now

1283
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:53,308
I do not mind an answer but what this

1284
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:58,949
was tried before it's continued last

1285
01:18:53,309 --> 01:19:00,210
night no okay okay so I think my

1286
01:18:58,949 --> 01:19:03,239
solution is I think you know you may

1287
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:05,340
want to you know work with few people

1288
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:07,230
you know get some more feedback and see

1289
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:09,199
if it has potential then invest time on

1290
01:19:07,230 --> 01:19:14,549
this otherwise you know what to think

1291
01:19:09,199 --> 01:19:19,829
that makes sense or not okay any other

1292
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:20,639
questions comments all right thank you

1293
01:19:19,829 --> 01:19:23,820
so much

1294
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:26,760
next is sort of a small will give an

1295
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:29,940
update on yeah just one quick one minor

1296
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:33,059
one Rajeev Cisco so if you think from

1297
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:36,780
the endpoint being attached to cellular

1298
01:19:33,059 --> 01:19:39,539
then I presume this message would go

1299
01:19:36,780 --> 01:19:43,889
from potentially the end point towards

1300
01:19:39,539 --> 01:19:46,190
the UPF of the side gateway in case of

1301
01:19:43,889 --> 01:19:49,889
the mobile area happening between

1302
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:52,379
cellular and say Wi-Fi then this message

1303
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:57,449
is assumed to be going from the endpoint

1304
01:19:52,380 --> 01:20:00,239
to where it's the same thing access

1305
01:19:57,449 --> 01:20:01,888
rotor it so there may be two distinct

1306
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:03,209
right excess water or in case of EP

1307
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:06,239
digit might be the same thing as a

1308
01:20:03,210 --> 01:20:08,849
psychic way when upstairs but then there

1309
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:13,428
are number of possibilities so this this

1310
01:20:08,849 --> 01:20:16,920
notion of having something in the RS an

1311
01:20:13,429 --> 01:20:20,250
RA would mean to allow for the nobility

1312
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:21,840
to work have to be comparable at not

1313
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:24,480
just within the cellular realm but

1314
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:29,400
outside as well potentially something to

1315
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:32,489
think about though I do like the fact

1316
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:35,789
that this is not a sari so it's really

1317
01:20:32,489 --> 01:20:39,089
low hangings small footprint in terms of

1318
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:40,860
protocols extension and thankfully

1319
01:20:39,090 --> 01:20:43,530
doesn't require anything to be done in

1320
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:45,119
the mobility protocol so that's one

1321
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:47,750
difference thing I see from the past

1322
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:47,750
Suresh

1323
01:20:59,239 --> 01:21:07,080
okay so why is sirisha sorry I don't

1324
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:08,549
have the background on this why the why

1325
01:21:07,080 --> 01:21:10,769
you said it's failed because it's a

1326
01:21:08,550 --> 01:21:12,119
security show Union to face it's always

1327
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,650
problematic right user to network

1328
01:21:12,119 --> 01:21:17,009
interface is it security is the main

1329
01:21:13,650 --> 01:21:18,929
thing or yeah I want to hear that sir I

1330
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:20,489
really think like you know this thing

1331
01:21:18,929 --> 01:21:22,920
was not anchored in architectures

1332
01:21:20,489 --> 01:21:24,239
anywhere site so somebody used to say

1333
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,710
like you know some wise people used to

1334
01:21:24,239 --> 01:21:27,839
say in the idea we do protocols he had

1335
01:21:25,710 --> 01:21:30,090
not architectures right so like for like

1336
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,710
good or bad the architectures are done

1337
01:21:30,090 --> 01:21:33,270
somewhere else right like so unless you

1338
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:34,949
go and anchor this like the other places

1339
01:21:33,270 --> 01:21:37,199
where like I think like you know I know

1340
01:21:34,949 --> 01:21:39,570
is like she has the same scars right so

1341
01:21:37,199 --> 01:21:41,159
we have to go to 3gpp go to 3gpp to like

1342
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:42,750
and everywhere to make sure that our

1343
01:21:41,159 --> 01:21:45,119
stuff is anchored there right because

1344
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:46,980
without that happening these things are

1345
01:21:45,119 --> 01:21:48,929
not going anywhere right so that's kind

1346
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,718
of the path that's really missing is

1347
01:21:48,929 --> 01:21:53,070
really the deployment support for this

1348
01:21:51,719 --> 01:21:55,949
thing so Security's like one thing we

1349
01:21:53,070 --> 01:21:57,690
can fix it so if you look at the Julian

1350
01:21:55,949 --> 01:22:00,089
and Pete's traffic I which is am an IR

1351
01:21:57,690 --> 01:22:02,638
interface like everything Rajeev said

1352
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:04,830
was actually looked at we spent like a

1353
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:06,690
couple of years on it address everything

1354
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:08,369
except that it was not deployed right so

1355
01:22:06,690 --> 01:22:11,369
it's I think it's mainly a deployment

1356
01:22:08,369 --> 01:22:12,540
issue the incentives are not right to do

1357
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:14,219
this like so nobody was really

1358
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,600
interested like for example like

1359
01:22:14,219 --> 01:22:16,739
Qualcomm was doing the chip and they

1360
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:19,080
didn't care about the network based

1361
01:22:16,739 --> 01:22:20,730
mobility right and the operators didn't

1362
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,860
want to have the you easter-egg mobility

1363
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:36,209
now themselves so the incentives really

1364
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:41,549
were not aligned very well okay thank

1365
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:46,500
you so much okay so yeah okay next is

1366
01:22:41,550 --> 01:22:48,090
not bleed on FPC so so this I think just

1367
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,699
you know a lot of work went into this

1368
01:22:48,090 --> 01:22:53,520
but it lately you know the document has

1369
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:56,129
expired and I think we thought it the

1370
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:59,280
work was done but it never you know you

1371
01:22:56,130 --> 01:23:03,469
know cleared last call yeah yes thank

1372
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:03,469
you on this is Satoru speaking I

1373
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:10,719
I try to describe the the little bit

1374
01:23:07,480 --> 01:23:12,580
background of the SPC work with him the

1375
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:19,510
course Marco

1376
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:22,239
Danny Rio and sorry so um the work had

1377
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:24,880
been started at I remember that around

1378
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:29,259
the twenty thirty and then first

1379
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:35,350
document submitted to DM a working group

1380
01:23:29,260 --> 01:23:38,070
on 2014 I think so

1381
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:40,690
DVM the mmm working group adopts that

1382
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:46,360
document as a working group document so

1383
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:49,919
we work a lot to to update the document

1384
01:23:46,360 --> 01:23:52,630
spec based on the our discussion how to

1385
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:56,050
configure the foreign policy for the

1386
01:23:52,630 --> 01:24:00,840
user playing data plan note so as a

1387
01:23:56,050 --> 01:24:07,389
result of the our discussion we are FPC

1388
01:24:00,840 --> 01:24:11,260
did not touch any outside what a wire

1389
01:24:07,389 --> 01:24:15,159
protocol so instead of that we defined

1390
01:24:11,260 --> 01:24:19,360
API to configure the user playing from

1391
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:22,599
the application so so that's the reason

1392
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:29,739
we decide we decide to define the we

1393
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:33,369
hang model to provide the API so after

1394
01:24:29,739 --> 01:24:36,250
the a discussion javi around the 2016

1395
01:24:33,369 --> 01:24:39,130
after the Bursar's working on meeting so

1396
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:42,699
we decided to change the data model and

1397
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:47,290
the information model to divide to the

1398
01:24:42,699 --> 01:24:52,089
topology and mobility and policy to

1399
01:24:47,290 --> 01:24:56,320
those three model conjunction to derive

1400
01:24:52,090 --> 01:25:00,040
the action forum post configuration to

1401
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:06,030
the to the data plane node so after the

1402
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:09,250
zero for revision we take that model and

1403
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:12,369
if you see document describing the

1404
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:16,139
information model of that and data mode

1405
01:25:12,369 --> 01:25:16,139
data model order by Jung

1406
01:25:16,219 --> 01:25:24,030
product information model so after that

1407
01:25:20,909 --> 01:25:26,070
decision we make bunch of the division

1408
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:31,230
maybe yes

1409
01:25:26,070 --> 01:25:34,829
yeah have a revision though I think it's

1410
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:37,280
being mature and live from Sprint take

1411
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:43,199
out with a walk to edit the document and

1412
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:45,719
the Chari volunteer to to divide the

1413
01:25:43,199 --> 01:25:48,928
young model from the main document to

1414
01:25:45,719 --> 01:25:50,969
make the documents short because the the

1415
01:25:48,929 --> 01:25:54,860
hold of the document becoming over the

1416
01:25:50,969 --> 01:25:58,679
hundred page so it makes the viewer

1417
01:25:54,860 --> 01:26:02,759
really difficult to make write comment

1418
01:25:58,679 --> 01:26:06,119
and to decide whether it'll be good or

1419
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:10,920
not so that's the latest status of the

1420
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:15,889
the FPC work after the the last update

1421
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:19,949
of the young model by charlie there's no

1422
01:26:15,889 --> 01:26:22,110
update happened so then the boss of the

1423
01:26:19,949 --> 01:26:24,449
information model document and yang

1424
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:27,000
model document is expires that's the

1425
01:26:24,449 --> 01:26:31,259
latest a total of the FPC

1426
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:34,860
so so the reason why I shared in the

1427
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:39,199
background of the FEC work after the

1428
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:42,929
long silence of of the last update so

1429
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:46,320
how to be happy to discuss whether we

1430
01:26:42,929 --> 01:26:51,199
proceed or not the defi C work into the

1431
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:56,730
DMM working group with with you guys I

1432
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:59,239
think many people put the much effort to

1433
01:26:56,730 --> 01:27:01,678
this work at the beginning of the

1434
01:26:59,239 --> 01:27:04,678
discussions a the control frame is a

1435
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:08,340
frame or data plane separation so I

1436
01:27:04,679 --> 01:27:10,739
think to be good outcome here but it

1437
01:27:08,340 --> 01:27:15,869
depends on the interest of the industry

1438
01:27:10,739 --> 01:27:19,308
or community for the mobility area I'd

1439
01:27:15,869 --> 01:27:19,308
like to hear your comment please

1440
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:38,140
that explains the interest so i'm

1441
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:40,000
co-author and I know that the work that

1442
01:27:38,140 --> 01:27:43,090
we put into this that would just been

1443
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:45,940
revised in details quite a lot and but

1444
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:49,630
it's pretty mature as well pretty stable

1445
01:27:45,940 --> 01:27:52,509
since a while it's a stable as drafts

1446
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:55,930
have been expired so I think there was a

1447
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:59,710
plan how to further progress the reviews

1448
01:27:55,930 --> 01:28:02,320
on these two documents now there are

1449
01:27:59,710 --> 01:28:04,720
there was one document which was version

1450
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:06,820
12 then we split it wait and I think

1451
01:28:04,720 --> 01:28:10,270
only the young part has been published

1452
01:28:06,820 --> 01:28:12,460
so far and as you said your opinion is

1453
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:15,040
that is pretty much sure so since we

1454
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:17,170
have to pretty much show parts I think

1455
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:20,350
what we still need to do is the review

1456
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:25,150
part but in my opinion we should

1457
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:28,480
progress these two drafts towards RFC of

1458
01:28:25,150 --> 01:28:32,250
course we need reasonable reviews and

1459
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:34,809
comments for moniker but I also think

1460
01:28:32,250 --> 01:28:36,490
it's reasonable work and a lot of work

1461
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:39,370
has been put into it so it would be a

1462
01:28:36,490 --> 01:28:41,950
pity to not progress these drums okay

1463
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:48,670
Thank You Marco that's more opinion and

1464
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:50,650
an author any other points okay so I

1465
01:28:48,670 --> 01:28:52,720
think we will confirm the same in the

1466
01:28:50,650 --> 01:28:54,129
mailing list if I think this sufficient

1467
01:28:52,720 --> 01:28:55,780
interest will move forward with the

1468
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:58,270
obligation process or a complete the

1469
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:59,769
last call forces but we definitely I do

1470
01:28:58,270 --> 01:29:01,690
