yeah if you could keep the blue sheets

2
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,930
circulating around the room your job is

3
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:25,060
to pass them on to the next row behind

4
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:36,329
you behind you

5
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:36,329

doctor Kanchana welcome and many here

10
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:07,299
I'm Jane I'm co-chair of Gaia and I

11
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,550
believe we have Leandro Navarro who's

12
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,380
the other co-chair on line here I can

13
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:16,080
see him

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,080
welcome give me one more second

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,030
so if you're sitting in this room

16
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:31,710
welcome to global access to the Internet

17
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,510
for all a group that was started by some

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,220
colleagues of ours from Oxford

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:39,240
University and Beyond and Cambridge

20
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:41,340
University I am Jane I am the co-chair

21
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,060
of Gaia with my colleague Leandro who's

22
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,610
with the University in Barcelona UPC we

23
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,950
often bring experts from regions

24
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,360
wherever we are to speak about some of

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,180
the connectivity projects they're

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,240
working on our objective is to bring in

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:00,840
real-life examples of the way you create

28
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:03,149
networks in rural remote and urban

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,000
underserved communities and in very

30
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:07,979
difficult places to connect last week I

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,720
was in Tbilisi Georgia where we have a

32
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:11,520
community network project with many

33
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,160
people in high mountain villages of

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,500
about 4,000 meters and up they're

35
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,620
actually using laura1 so when Jonathan

36
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,000
Brewer speaks about Laura this is very

37
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,790
much something that people are

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,550
implementing in real life in places that

39
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:29,480
are so remote that you have about 600

40
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:32,850
people in a very very very very very

41
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,070
complicated and remote area so it's

42
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,920
doable some of our teams have taken

43
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,660
helicopters some have taken horses to

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,559
bring equipment I know dr. Kanchana

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,209
sometimes is working with elephants

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,820
these are real-life solutions for people

47
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,640
who are not connected so we are

48
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:54,209
dedicated to connecting people obviously

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,829
the whole IETF focus is connectivity but

50
00:02:54,209 --> 00:02:57,840
many of you know what it's like to do

51
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,660
the real-life complicated things where

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,370
something may not work last week a

53
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:05,070
friend of mine had to hack a solar panel

54
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,600
because the solar panel wasn't working

55
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,760
through the throughput from the

56
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,290
batteries was just not working they

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,910
pretty much cut all the cables to all

58
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,250
the batteries and rewired the whole

59
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,260
thing on the side of the mountain not

60
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:18,600
even close to spec that had been

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,429
submitted so as many of you know you

62
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,620
often get some equipment that's a little

63
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,560
wonky maybe not working and you just

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,049
hack it on the ground so this is part of

65
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,120
what we do all of you do and we try and

66
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,709
support that with with the different

67
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,400
projects that I know Leon Joe and others

68
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,150
work with Leon drew is part of something

69
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,650
called Griffey

70
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,170
which is one of the largest community

71
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,280
networks in the world it's out of Spain

72
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:48,839
they have many many different users but

73
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,030
they also have fibre wireless and Wi-Fi

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,440
so they're using different technologies

75
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:55,560
they've actually trenched their own

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,940
fiber so these are very interesting at

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:59,849
communities that are being worked with

78
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:03,540
in Spain as well so on the agenda

79
00:03:59,849 --> 00:04:05,429
if you check online the first person up

80
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,230
is dr. Kanchana who's a good friend and

81
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,519
she's also an Internet Hall of Famer and

82
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:13,500
a Postell Award winner so I will also

83
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,019
just ask you it's protocol for me to

84
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:18,329
tell you to take advantage of the note

85
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,039
well which is online I'm not going to

86
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,889
show it here I people make fun of me for

87
00:04:20,039 --> 00:04:23,580
showing it so for those of you that

88
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,470
don't know what it is

89
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:29,159
take a look online it's the note well

90
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:31,020

knowledge in Thailand and I I've been

112
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:57,169
involved with building the network for

113
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:00,020
quite a long time knowing many people in

114
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:04,570
this room so I'm very happy with this

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:07,400
agenda that you have we have many more

116
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,510
presentation from the region like

117
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,810
Indonesia Philippines and so on so it's

118
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:19,849
brain it's placed back we can learn from

119
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:22,610
one another for the Thai case and I work

120
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:29,840
I myself work for the Asian Institute

121
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:34,730
technology and my team work with net to

122
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,479
home company and also mechanics company

123
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:43,930
which is the running the community IXP

124
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:48,950
so my job is to try to see how these two

125
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:52,340
community can find you know eventually

126
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:55,219
work one work with together so this is

127
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,140
the starting point of the collaboration

128
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:08,600
so I'd like to talk about that to the

129
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:11,800
next sorry there's always a little fun

130
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:17,960
with these lights there we go ok ok

131
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:22,220
rapid work that we set up is in that

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,750
province tak province which is on the

133
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:30,050
Burmese border we have you know our

134
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:33,650
northernmost network is kind of 60

135
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:38,210
kilometers from the rest and the rest of

136
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:43,880
them are in a you know small cluster in

137
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:47,979
an area north of Masad so we have at the

138
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:51,469
moment about almost 20 community just

139
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:55,510
getting become our member so we called

140
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,510
the whole group as attack net

141
00:07:57,489 --> 00:08:08,619
we started to work on this since 2013 we

142
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:12,039
went into a village next to Myanmar and

143
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:16,599
we found that within that village they

144
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:21,539
had only two ADSL line and they had to

145
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:24,669
pay $33 per month for subscription and

146
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:30,669
only less than ten people benefit from

147
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:34,179
that so we we went in and built our mesh

148
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:37,629
network in the village and try to can

149
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:39,938
use existing ADSL line to the line to

150
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:46,029
the Internet as the line to the Internet

151
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:49,089
and by today we have about 21 sites the

152
00:08:46,029 --> 00:08:52,779
internet cost is shared by the villagers

153
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:56,829
and it cost them $8 per month for

154
00:08:52,779 --> 00:09:00,389
subscription and we now have over 1,000

155
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:04,359
users next please

156
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:07,209
so this is a picture of our network you

157
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:10,389
have wireless mesh network inside the

158
00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:13,388
village and we have a gateway to the

159
00:09:10,389 --> 00:09:17,110
internet and buy today the Gateway to

160
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:20,610
the Internet is using the is commercial

161
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:25,060
ISP and they provide a fiber connection

162
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:33,000
and we have a small rasp I as a server

163
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:33,000
to perform Gateway management next place

164
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:45,579
now you in order to to to use the

165
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:49,689
internet connection and you know shared

166
00:09:45,579 --> 00:09:55,019
among commits among many people with a

167
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:55,019
subscription that we did we risk the

168
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:03,519
problem because the risk that the chance

169
00:10:00,129 --> 00:10:06,399
of being arrested because we were

170
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:10,510
selling the Internet services so we had

171
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:14,500
to register a company called net to home

172
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:19,060
and become illegal Internet service

173
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:23,140
provider provider and take charge of you

174
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:28,569
know administration of the network ok so

175
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:31,660
then at home is kind is an isp illegally

176
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:34,750
and it's called is the type one is P in

177
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:38,260
Thailand it means that you cannot own

178
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,020
any infrastructure you become you can

179
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,480
sell the internet without owning your

180
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:45,730
own infrastructure you can sell internet

181
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,430
access you can operate anywhere in in

182
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:52,540
the country and the type of users is

183
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:55,140
general so the to home company is you

184
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:58,689
know taking care of their financial

185
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:03,850
collection of the subscription and pay

186
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:07,840
to the ISP and it is open to the

187
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:13,360
community to share to to buy to become a

188
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:16,510
shareholder of the Company next place so

189
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:20,460
this is our net to home company at the

190
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:24,790
moment we'll concentrate on the western

191
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:29,110
border of the PAC net only but we plan

192
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:31,959
to to deploy the same model in many

193
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:38,100
different provinces in the near future

194
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:40,210
so the the idea is that we have internet

195
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:43,480
community network connects to the

196
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:46,450
commercial ISP who owns the network who

197
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,790
own the infrastructure so we don't need

198
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:53,230
to invest on the infrastructure

199
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:58,569
I mean long-haul infrastructure and we

200
00:11:53,230 --> 00:12:01,210
want to have community networks that our

201
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,880
member to talk to one another and

202
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:06,480
exchange information and we want our

203
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:14,140
community network to be able to share

204
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:17,470
common resources and besides the network

205
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,880
that we have at the moment depends on

206
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,360
who are the internet service provider so

207
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,720
some communities network joy

208
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:30,989
one provider another one join another

209
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,459
provider and sometime the provider that

210
00:12:30,989 --> 00:12:36,389
is two provider

211
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:39,988
do not talk to one another so it's hard

212
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:43,670
for us to manage the community so we

213
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:47,809
want to have more homogeneous

214
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:51,149
environment so we want in this way we

215
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:58,350
try to connect this is the reason why we

216
00:12:51,149 --> 00:13:04,439
want to connect everyone to one IXP next

217
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:08,360
place so we want to have yeah because of

218
00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:11,449
the problem of the I different

219
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:18,660
heterogeneous isp we want to have more

220
00:13:11,449 --> 00:13:24,229
common common ecosystem for all in the

221
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,230
come our members so we want to connect

222
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:35,459
everybody to a common I XP apart from

223
00:13:31,319 --> 00:13:39,868
having them talking to one another with

224
00:13:35,459 --> 00:13:43,109
a common i XP we can kind of take care

225
00:13:39,869 --> 00:13:47,879
of the control we can control the

226
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:51,749
routing so that if any problem arise we

227
00:13:47,879 --> 00:13:54,269
can easily understand what happened you

228
00:13:51,749 --> 00:13:57,119
know if we let them use the different

229
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:59,549
ISP and if something happened they'll

230
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:03,119
come and ask us and we'd have to pick

231
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:06,869
out what's wrong with this is with ISP

232
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:10,649
okay so we need to have common picture

233
00:14:06,869 --> 00:14:13,079
for all so this I stab people are

234
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:15,419
starting to communicate domestically

235
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:27,508
they don't use the internet to go out of

236
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:31,049
the country so our we tested our design

237
00:14:27,509 --> 00:14:35,759
and it works so next the next thing that

238
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:37,589
we want to do is to use this kind of

239
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:44,970
connection to the

240
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:48,600
- the IHP to provide more interesting

241
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:52,290
services to the community because right

242
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,949
now when we asked our user what kind of

243
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:56,759
application you are you want to have on

244
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:59,490
the Internet

245
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:03,449
they all want streaming they want to

246
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:07,620
watch television they will do you know

247
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:09,149
always video so of course we can tell

248
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,540
them this is not for it

249
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:15,480
you can't afford that but this is not a

250
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,240
long-term answer to them so we have to

251
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:22,470
work out how to handle streaming

252
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:25,680
application we have to do video so we

253
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:27,839
are working on that and we try to work

254
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,359
on you know using proxy and cache

255
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,480
servers which is like what we used to do

256
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,300
in the old days you know for Thailand to

257
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,629
connect to the internet we had really

258
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:43,258
limited bandwidth so we had to use

259
00:15:38,629 --> 00:15:45,720
proxies in the audience so I mean one

260
00:15:43,259 --> 00:15:48,509
common service so you want to provide

261
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:53,059
cloud in the future and we want our

262
00:15:48,509 --> 00:16:01,490
members to peer with other IXP members

263
00:15:53,059 --> 00:16:04,620
the next place so we don't own any any

264
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:10,589
fiber link we don't own any

265
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:16,250
infrastructure so how can we connect to

266
00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:21,300
IXP which is in Bangkok about 700 No 600

267
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:27,110
kilometers away so we want we decided to

268
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:31,469
use tunneling witches tunnel through

269
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:37,579
IASP that they are seeing connected to

270
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:42,420
and dude that tunnel ends at the our ixp

271
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:45,628
okay so next place so this is what

272
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:49,529
happened you have our community I would

273
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:50,670
call our is the ixp we are working with

274
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:56,010
mechanics

275
00:16:50,670 --> 00:17:01,490
also community IXP and with the

276
00:16:56,010 --> 00:17:06,660
community ixp in the top part of the

277
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:10,890
diagram you have city and international

278
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:14,000
City and members and we have also local

279
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:19,040
local content providers so you can have

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:24,209
TV channels that share contents to the

281
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:30,210
IXP and we also have different I SPE

282
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:33,480
okay is B on the left is P that our

283
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:37,530
members and the villagers connected to

284
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:43,490
them I XP on the right hand side those

285
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:45,960
who are not members of mechanics but our

286
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:51,929
religious had to connect to them because

287
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:56,970
no no other choice so with this design

288
00:17:51,929 --> 00:17:59,580
we have IP eternal the blue line to

289
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:04,410
connect each community with community

290
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:09,449
network to our net to home bottle get

291
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:14,460
body router and that body router talked

292
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:18,750
to IXP so this is how how it works at

293
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:26,280
the moment next place two minutes two

294
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:30,660
minutes okay let me mention our partner

295
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:37,080
B connects a little bit mechanics is our

296
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:44,190
community i XP j and help us set up this

297
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:50,149
B connects 2013 since 2013 so but it was

298
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:56,910
established in 2015 and now we have 29

299
00:18:50,150 --> 00:19:01,470
members and click topic is that 36 kick

300
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:04,470
an average traffic is 12 point two seven

301
00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:13,110
K and you can find more info

302
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:16,410
on this website okay so with that that

303
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:20,100
connectivity that we have succeeded we

304
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:25,400
are now working on content delivery in

305
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:30,000
to home to home is a company that

306
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:33,270
represent all the community networks on

307
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,660
the previous diagram so we have we are

308
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:41,960
working on how to cache popular content

309
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:47,100
that people are using and we also

310
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:50,640
working on reverse proxy how to take

311
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:55,610
gather content from the villagers and

312
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:59,580
upload to the Internet and we have our

313
00:19:55,610 --> 00:20:03,060
local working on our local service which

314
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:09,750
is a platform for resource sharing so

315
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:13,980

00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,450
through the same cycle

332
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,129
Kurtis you have a question can you

333
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,720
announce who you are when you step up to

334
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,210
the microphone You Don't Know Who I am

335
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,680
yes okay hi I'm Curtis I wrote the

336
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:21,640
University of Washington I can Shona

337
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:23,380
so I'm curious about you said that

338
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,030
you're doing some caching at your

339
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:29,350
community network like what are you

340
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:32,050
using for that because you have limited

341
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,360
bandwidth sure this is a more technical

342
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:38,020
question like what are you using like a

343
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,139
software stack what circle at the moment

344
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:43,060
we are evaluating many different we have

345
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:45,580
not decided at the moment if you have

346
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,080
any suggestion will be very happy I was

347
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,300
hoping to get the suggestions okay

348
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,949
we'll talk about it later okay we'll

349
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,350
have a caching conversation later thank

350
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:56,470
you very much Kanchana

351
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,469
[Applause]

352
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:03,220
okay on the agenda we have and next is

353
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,170
Jonathan Brewer and Jonathan's gonna

354
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,550
give us a bit more data on Laura Juan

355
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,550
which some of you knew something about

356
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:36,610
give it that clicker a try working or no

357
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:43,050
I love for different yeah well at this

358
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:43,050
laptop okay all right okay

359
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,040
Jonathan's at is a real thing this is

360
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:50,290
being deployed in community networks in

361
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:53,920
a lot of parts of the world yes indeed

362
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:58,180
so I'm John and I'm going to talk about

363
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,330
Laura Juan which is network and the

364
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:03,520
things network which is an organization

365
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:06,429
that offers the equivalent of a mobile

366
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:11,200
network controller for Laura when IOT

367
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:14,530
networks slide please so what does Laura

368
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,840
Laura is a physical radio protocol

369
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:20,080
designed for the Internet of Things it

370
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,480
operates in lower than 1 gigahertz is M

371
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:24,490
bands so whatever happens to be free in

372
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,420
your country in this part of the role it

373
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:30,020
tends to be around 923 megahertz in new

374
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:33,650
zealand's we have a band

375
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:37,970
from 864 to 868 we also have a band from

376
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:40,160
9:15 to 9:30 I should say that I am

377
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,400
staying in Singapore temporarily right

378
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,020
now but I live in New Zealand and you

379
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,750
can tell I'm from New Zealand because of

380
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:49,670
my accent now sorry I'm actually from

381
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:53,090
the States but New Zealand's been home

382
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:55,520
for a long time so Laura is a radio

383
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:57,350
technology its proprietary to a company

384
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,600
called sim tech and I know that kind of

385
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,699
sucks that it's proprietary but when you

386
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,350
look at things like Wi-Fi which is the

387
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,680
foundation of community networks all

388
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:08,149
over the place there is proprietary

389
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:10,670
intellectual property in Wi-Fi and

390
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:13,640
license fees gets paid through and so on

391
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:16,460
so it's not all that different so anyway

392
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,980
con China's network the tok net mesh

393
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:21,290
that's tens of megabits per second and

394
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:23,690
their backhaul is 200 200 so you're

395
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:27,020
talking broadband and this laurel and

396
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:30,410
stuff is like 250 bits per second to

397
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:32,510
maybe 22 kilobits per second but really

398
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,010
the topologies and the applications that

399
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:37,040
i've been working with over the past

400
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:41,830
four years have been in the range of a

401
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:41,830
kilobit per second or less next please

402
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,040
so what is lower when so lord is the

403
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,409
radio protocol and you don't need to use

404
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,420
Laura when to use Laura you can actually

405
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,700
make a point-to-point connection with

406
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,010
Laura modems some people use them for

407
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,710
controlling drones some people have used

408
00:24:55,010 --> 00:25:00,860
the Laura protocol for other network

409
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:03,590
types but Laura when is an open non

410
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,919
proprietary standard for a wireless

411
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:08,120
network and it as I said before the

412
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,680
whole thing with the mobile network

413
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,830
controller will Laura when ads

414
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:15,740
addressing mobility and localization -

415
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,030
Laura it adds this whole idea of you can

416
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:19,400
have a network with lots of base

417
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:21,350
stations devices that move from one base

418
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,020
station to the other and everything just

419
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:25,730
kind of holds together so with Laura

420
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:28,240
when it's pretty cool multiple base

421
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:31,520
stations can receive and process packets

422
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,590
like if this clicker were a Laura when

423
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,320
node like out there in the network he

424
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:38,540
sent out a message that message would be

425
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,120
picked up by any base station that's in

426
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,889
this room and all of those base stations

427
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,729
would relay the data to the mobile

428
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,470
network control

429
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:46,789
which would then say hey I've got a

430
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:48,980
whole bunch of packets of information

431
00:25:46,789 --> 00:25:52,850
these are the same ones it does the

432
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,649
deduplication and then it decides when

433
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,360
the network wants to talk to this little

434
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,039
clicker it decides well which of the

435
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,168
base stations was closest to this

436
00:25:58,039 --> 00:26:02,440
clicker and then routes the return

437
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:06,529
message through the nearest base station

438
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:09,409
Lauren also adds an adaptive data rate

439
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:12,440
scheme so that devices that are near to

440
00:26:09,409 --> 00:26:14,240
base stations talk with a very complex

441
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,080
modulation so the message gets through

442
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,880
really fast

443
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,830
devices that are really far from the

444
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,409
base station talk with a really simple

445
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,649
modulation really really slow lots of

446
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:27,350
airtime Laurel Ann also adds multiple

447
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:29,360
layers of encryption Network encryption

448
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,279
and application encryption the cool

449
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:34,250
thing about this I say I've been working

450
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:37,519
with Lauren for four years I've been a

451
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:39,889
network operator and I have no idea what

452
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:42,649
the end users of the applications are

453
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:44,750
doing because all I see is encrypted

454
00:26:42,649 --> 00:26:47,479
packets and metadata going across my

455
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,490
network I don't know what's in the data

456
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,639
and I can't because I don't have the

457
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:55,159
keys to unlock that data as the low-end

458
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:57,139
also supports time slot scheduling of

459
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:58,760
device transmission and you know makes

460
00:26:57,139 --> 00:27:01,010
everything harmonious when you've got

461
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,639
thousands of devices talking to a couple

462
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:06,889
of base stations next please

463
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:09,830
so the various entities in Ellora web

464
00:27:06,889 --> 00:27:12,229
network are inge devices which is my

465
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:14,029
clicker gateways which I don't know we

466
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:17,929
could call these massive chandeliers a

467
00:27:14,029 --> 00:27:21,260
couple of gateways then in a lot of

468
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:23,090
networks the gateways use LTE or 3G

469
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:25,940
backhaul but they could use fiber

470
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:28,850
backhaul ADSL backhaul whatever to get

471
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,130
into the network server in the case of

472
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:35,439
my network the network server is an

473
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:38,419
application that runs on AWS in our case

474
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,559
we use AWS Sydney for New Zealand

475
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:44,630
Network we use AWS in the Bay Area for

476
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,309
our Cook Islands for our Otunga network

477
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:50,480
and then there are applications and

478
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:53,090
applications could be separate from the

479
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,129
network server but in the case of most

480
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:57,500
Lauro and controllers applications or

481
00:27:55,129 --> 00:27:59,059
bits of code that sit inside of the same

482
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:04,399
computer that's running the network

483
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:06,080
server complicated next so I'm going to

484
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,449
give you a very quick Laurel an

485
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,668
architecture overview and this is based

486
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:16,220
on RFC 83-76 this is so appropriate for

487
00:28:13,669 --> 00:28:20,750
being at an IETF meeting I'm just gonna

488
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:23,330
walk you through Lauren based on the RFC

489
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:29,000
that that we're all writing our network

490
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:31,129
software to next so there's an end

491
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,500
device that's our clicker here sometimes

492
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:37,100
called a mote it communicates with the

493
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:39,200
gateways it never talks to another mote

494
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,899
never talks to another end device

495
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,149
everything is always through a gateway

496
00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:45,590
through a network controller to an

497
00:28:44,149 --> 00:28:48,080
application and then from that

498
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:51,199
application back down the chain to the

499
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,389
end device this guy has a unique

500
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,029
globally unique identifier called a

501
00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:59,149
device EUI and that's an i tripoli

502
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:00,919
number and it has a network unique

503
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:04,219
identifier called a device address

504
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:06,340
that's a 32-bit address we're talking

505
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,230
sometimes about sending like one or two

506
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,629
bytes of data so when you start adding a

507
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:13,159
32-bit address or a 64-bit address

508
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:14,600
you've got a lot of overhead there

509
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:17,809
anyway next

510
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,039
Suren devices here's an example of an

511
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:23,889
end device this is just an example next

512
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:27,500
people you can look at the slides later

513
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:30,229
there are three classes of devices the

514
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,919
ones that are used most often are Class

515
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:37,159
A communications is always initiated by

516
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,200
the end device it's a node it's out

517
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:40,759
there it decides hey I've got a bit of

518
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,169
data I want the rest of the world to

519
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:47,539
know about it sends the data Aloha based

520
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:48,710
so it could be that that data I guess it

521
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,840
doesn't get through the first time

522
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:53,029
whatever eventually it sends the data

523
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,580
and it's acknowledged and that's all

524
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:57,529
good after it sends the data it listens

525
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:59,629
to the network to see if the network

526
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:02,539
wants to talk to it so there's a time

527
00:29:59,629 --> 00:30:05,029
slot set up for the network to reply

528
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:06,919
back and say hey I got your data or hey

529
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:09,049
I got your data now go to sleep for the

530
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,630
next six months because I don't need you

531
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:15,500
for then or some other mess

532
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,120
now class so Class A is lowest power

533
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,440
class a is great for a battery powered

534
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,059
device that's out there in the

535
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:23,299
environment doing environmental

536
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:27,110
monitoring needs to last forever Class B

537
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:30,500
on the other hand listens to the network

538
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:32,840
on a schedule say maybe it wakes up once

539
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:35,630
an hour and listens wakes up once a day

540
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:38,059
and listens what have you very uncommon

541
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:39,860
Class B devices most commercial

542
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:42,649
implementations are either for Class A

543
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,110
or Class C now Class C is just fine if

544
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:46,790
you have solar power or electricity or

545
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,030
just some massive source of energy

546
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:51,770
because it stays awake all the time

547
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:55,340
listening to the network to say hey does

548
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:57,168
the network need me think about a farm

549
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,909
and you've got a whole bunch of Class A

550
00:30:57,169 --> 00:31:02,750
devices out there measuring soil

551
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:05,020
moisture and they're sending their data

552
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:08,390
up there all battery-powered whatever

553
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,879
but then you've got a solenoid or a

554
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:14,929
valve on the water system to add more

555
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,559
water that can't just be you know asleep

556
00:31:14,929 --> 00:31:17,840
all the time

557
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:21,200
it needs to know does the network want

558
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,830
me to turn on and water the grass so use

559
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:30,140
a Class C for a control mechanism on the

560
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:33,428
water next solar wine gateway it's a

561
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,140
radio on the infrastructure side these

562
00:31:33,429 --> 00:31:38,360
italicized are actually straight from

563
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:41,780
the RFC I've noted that I've actually

564
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,740
lifted phrases straight out of the RFC

565
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:44,178
to describe this

566
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,340
so sometimes gateways are called

567
00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:48,290
concentrators or base stations I use

568
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,780
base station and Gateway like

569
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,000
interchangeably they communicate with

570
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,918
end devices via the Lauro end protocol

571
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,669
and they communicate with a network

572
00:31:54,919 --> 00:32:00,740
server via tcp/ip in the case of the

573
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:03,679
base stations that I manage they use

574
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,990
WebSockets in the case of the original

575
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,720
implementation of the things Network

576
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:11,720
there were UDP packets going from the

577
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:16,910
gateways to the network server so

578
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:18,890
gateways I you can put a low end gateway

579
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:22,370
on a base station that's running other

580
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:25,080
things like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi

581
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:27,929
I have Linux boxes that run

582
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,480
Gateway's multiple instances on the same

583
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:32,490
box to deal with multiple radios and

584
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,160
they might run other things packet

585
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:37,470
processing software or Wi-Fi or whatever

586
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:41,940
it's just a software application that

587
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:44,670
interfaces with the radio next so here's

588
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:47,040
a few examples of Lauro and gateways and

589
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:49,170
yes I've used all of these little boards

590
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:53,159
and multi ticks and things networks

591
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:54,990
things and whatever next so a network

592
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:57,060
server is a piece of software it

593
00:32:54,990 --> 00:32:59,900
terminates the Laura and Mac layer even

594
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,280
though there's some tcp/ip in between

595
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:04,380
for n devices connected to the network

596
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,870
it's the center of the star topology

597
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,090
you've got stars of gateways and stars

598
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:11,790
of end devices the network server

599
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:14,610
decides what gateway is going to talk to

600
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,889
what ends device it's also going to tell

601
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:20,399
the end device what data rate it should

602
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:23,060
be transmitting at so that the Gateway

603
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:26,030
can best handle the amount of traffic

604
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:32,340
and the amount of signal coming from

605
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:33,990
close nodes and far nodes next so here

606
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,510
are some examples of Laura when network

607
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:40,050
servers the one I use in production is

608
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:41,790
Laura IOT which is a Swiss company but I

609
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:44,129
used the things network for training

610
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:46,500
workshops and I've got a things Network

611
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,840
connected gateway in my apartment in

612
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:52,710
Singapore now because I really love what

613
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,629
they're doing and I really like the

614
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:58,220
features of their network now four years

615
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,330
ago it wasn't an option for doing real

616
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:01,920
applications that you wanted to work and

617
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:06,330
today I think the things network is good

618
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:10,080
for anything next so a join server ok

619
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:12,449
this is super complicated devices have

620
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,199
sets of encryption keys going on a join

621
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:18,389
server is what allows devices to get on

622
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:22,109
the network go to the next it's usually

623
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:24,750
combined with a network server an uplink

624
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:27,030
message is when the node talks to the

625
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:30,360
network and yes the uplink can be

626
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:33,210
listened to by multiple gateways go on

627
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:36,330
next downlink message is when the

628
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,859
network is talking to the node and again

629
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:41,708
the network controller the

630
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:43,149
the network server is what decides which

631
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:45,009
gateway is going to send that message

632
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,569
it's also going to decide whether that

633
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:51,029
message is going to go to a single end

634
00:34:46,569 --> 00:34:53,498
device or to a group of end devices next

635
00:34:51,029 --> 00:34:56,440
now--all or when application is

636
00:34:53,498 --> 00:34:59,439
application layer code that's running on

637
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:01,660
the end device and it's application code

638
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,119
running behind the network server and

639
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:06,549
there's a set of encryption keys tying

640
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:10,660
these things together most end devices

641
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:14,049
will only ever run one application this

642
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,660
is kind of how laura when has evolved

643
00:35:14,049 --> 00:35:18,940
you have individual devices that do very

644
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,950
limited simple things and they only talk

645
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,359
to one application server so

646
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:25,209
applications typically run a network

647
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,979
servers applications do device

648
00:35:25,209 --> 00:35:27,999
management which devices are allowed to

649
00:35:26,979 --> 00:35:29,859
talk

650
00:35:27,999 --> 00:35:32,468
what are they allowed to do they route

651
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:34,930
data to external applications and that

652
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:37,900
means they offer up an API an API that

653
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:41,259
says write you can get data out of this

654
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:46,269
lorwyn application via WebSockets via

655
00:35:41,259 --> 00:35:48,880
MQTT via JSON via HTTP gets or what have

656
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:50,049
you so it is a misleading name we could

657
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,690
be calling these applications

658
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:58,119
application routers next encryption all

659
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,130
payloads are encrypted so I said I'm a

660
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:01,869
network operator I have no idea what my

661
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:03,699
end users are doing with the data that's

662
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:06,910
because the payloads are encrypted I

663
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:09,309
don't have the keys to open that there's

664
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,890
also data integrity so there's sequence

665
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:13,809
numbers that are encrypted that I don't

666
00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:17,348
know about but the application owner

667
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:19,779
knows about so someone can't record a

668
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:24,849
message and do a replay attack someone

669
00:36:19,779 --> 00:36:25,989
can't attempt to insert random messages

670
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:28,119
in there because they'll be out of

671
00:36:25,989 --> 00:36:31,390
sequence and they'll be rejected there's

672
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,489
also data integrity because there's

673
00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:35,410
check sums along with the encryption so

674
00:36:33,489 --> 00:36:37,029
you can't change the data in flight you

675
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:41,549
can't intercept you can't replay blah

676
00:36:37,029 --> 00:36:44,589
blah blah mac commands are protected so

677
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:46,809
nobody out there listening to the

678
00:36:44,589 --> 00:36:48,880
network can actually see any of the

679
00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:50,650
metadata associated with these

680
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,300
transactions in fact if they're just

681
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,060
listening without the

682
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:56,920
work encryption keys it's just noise in

683
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:59,080
fact a lot of times it's noise below the

684
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,910
noise floor so it is really almost

685
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:08,560
undetectable and impossible to see

686
00:37:03,910 --> 00:37:13,960
what's going on next almost done right

687
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:17,320
pre divined pre joined devices you have

688
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,710
ideas of devices that you joined to the

689
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,510
network once the end-user has the device

690
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:24,250
in hand and then you have the idea of

691
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,660
devices where the manufacturer of the

692
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:27,580
device joins it the network

693
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:30,490
ahead of time before they send it out in

694
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:32,230
the field and in this case the device is

695
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,229
pre joined to the network we put

696
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:36,940
symmetric keys to symmetric keys in the

697
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:38,920
firmware of the device before we send it

698
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:40,930
out to the field a network session key

699
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:43,300
in an application session key

700
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:46,779
these session keys start their session

701
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:48,940
keys so they can get rolled later so

702
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,970
they can get refreshed down the road and

703
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,290
frequently will get refreshed every time

704
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:56,709
they rejoin the network but this gets

705
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:58,990
them on the network to start next and

706
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:03,220
there's the idea of an over-the-air join

707
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:06,040
where the network operator will send out

708
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:09,490
a network session key and an application

709
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:11,259
key and the user will write those into

710
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:16,330
the firmware and then the device will

711
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:18,760
send its device EUI its app EUI and its

712
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:21,640
app key and the network will basically

713
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:23,860
derive app session keys and network

714
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,740
session keys those ones that if we did a

715
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:28,690
pre join like in the last slide the

716
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,669
network and the device derives those

717
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,220
things in a cryptographically secure

718
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:37,000
manner so that these devices can talk

719
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:40,390
right next so what is the things network

720
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,840
all of this complicated stuff to do with

721
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:46,210
the network server like this isn't easy

722
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:48,070
stuff and I've never run my own network

723
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:50,710
server although I've downloaded the code

724
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:54,640
and tried before the things network is a

725
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:56,860
free distributed network controller that

726
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,080
a group out of the Netherlands put

727
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,360
together so that people could have

728
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,590
community Laura when networks they said

729
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:04,840
we'll look we're going to write a

730
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,099
software implementation we're gonna make

731
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,039
it all open sore

732
00:39:06,099 --> 00:39:11,170
we're gonna have the community work on

733
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:14,079
it and we're gonna let anybody who wants

734
00:39:11,170 --> 00:39:16,960
to connect to our network server spin up

735
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,829
their own applications generate their

736
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:25,059
own keys and join their own devices to

737
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:27,819
these networks so TTN the things network

738
00:39:25,059 --> 00:39:30,369
it provides a network server join server

739
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:32,499
and application servers in one you have

740
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:35,890
a nice web interface a web platform that

741
00:39:32,499 --> 00:39:38,379
allows application owners to register

742
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,749
devices I could use the things Network

743
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:43,119
if I just had a login to create an

744
00:39:40,749 --> 00:39:45,308
application and some devices and I used

745
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,779
someone else's gateway in a lot of

746
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:49,119
cities in this world there are enough

747
00:39:46,779 --> 00:39:51,339
gateways that you don't need to run your

748
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,239
own or you can be like me here in

749
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:56,769
Singapore I provide a TT and Gateway out

750
00:39:55,239 --> 00:39:58,869
of my apartment but I don't actually

751
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,939
have any applications running on it I'm

752
00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:03,279
just running the Gateway because I can

753
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,460
and I like the idea of it and maybe I'll

754
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:08,319
run an application at some point all

755
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:12,009
gateways on the thing's network process

756
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,808
all traffic from all devices joined to

757
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:17,109
the things network so it is truly a

758
00:40:13,809 --> 00:40:20,079
communal thing in Europe they've got

759
00:40:17,109 --> 00:40:22,779
very strict restrictions on how much

760
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,749
airtime your device can use so that an

761
00:40:22,779 --> 00:40:29,229
individual device can't take up too much

762
00:40:25,749 --> 00:40:31,269
Network resource so TTN provides all

763
00:40:29,229 --> 00:40:34,390
this for free they also help communities

764
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:36,910
organize and communicate by giving them

765
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:40,118
space on their website and allowing them

766
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:43,660
to open up chat channels and post

767
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:46,029
notices of meetups and so on and linking

768
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:47,710
their profiles and so when I came to

769
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:49,779
Singapore I said what's the TTN

770
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:51,519
community in Singapore I went and I

771
00:40:49,779 --> 00:40:53,890
found people's LinkedIn profiles on the

772
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:55,149
TTN page I sent the message as I said

773
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:57,549
what's the story what are we doing when

774
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,609
our meetups and stuff same thing when I

775
00:40:57,549 --> 00:41:04,210
did a workshop in Santiago Chile last

776
00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:07,450
year I went to the TTN page I found that

777
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,049
they had a telegram group and the

778
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,468
Chilean

779
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:13,569
TTN community Laura when can be is just

780
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:15,940
fantastic there's like 30 people in the

781
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:18,430
telegram group there's new posts all the

782
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,990
time and if I spoke Spanish instead of

783
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,350
them to paste everything in Google Tran

784
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:25,180
it'd be really really neat so heaps of

785
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,279
TTN all over the world so where is the

786
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,839
things network yeah this is how many

787
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,720
there are there's more than 200 cities

788
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:37,869
and there's extensive coverage in some

789
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,970
cities it's pretty cool I know

790
00:41:37,869 --> 00:41:42,640
University of Hawaii is just spun up a

791
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:44,770
couple on my recommendation for some

792
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,100
data collection things because they

793
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:51,430
needed to do data collection and they

794
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:51,940
wanted an open platform so ttn what else

795
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:55,029
we have

796
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:56,860
you must be almost done next here's a

797
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:58,840
view of the console if you're logging in

798
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:01,690
that may be a bit small for anybody to

799
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:03,490
see but you can see my gateway there and

800
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:08,740
some of the things I can control in the

801
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:12,669
fact that there's a gateway ID there's

802
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:15,129
this gateway IDs and things next so what

803
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,510
does TTN integrate with TTN provides

804
00:42:15,130 --> 00:42:19,720
these applications and all the

805
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:21,670
applications do is route data so there

806
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,250
are cloud applications you can use to

807
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:28,710
talk to TTN and some of those include

808
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:31,119
Cayenne my devices open sensors mapper

809
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:32,980
colos I have know if it

810
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,760
most people some people in here will

811
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:41,740
know what if it is it's a platform that

812
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:45,190
allows you to do things based on data so

813
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:47,439
in addition to these integrations which

814
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:51,570
are like super easy to set up you can

815
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,770
also just get JSON data or just get

816
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:57,790
WebSockets data or whatever out of the

817
00:42:53,770 --> 00:43:00,190
controller next okay Brett that's it so

818
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:04,090
I've just got pictures of devices use

819
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:06,660
just scroll through that next one that's

820
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:09,400
the last slide all right so that's it so

821
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:11,470
yeah I guess any questions you have a

822
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:16,600
question for John we have a minute

823
00:43:11,470 --> 00:43:19,060
cool I have a question for you I saw

824
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:22,350
your map my question was about your map

825
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:25,359
like a few slides are good more ease I

826
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:28,299
see that you have some presence in North

827
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,400
America I've been part of a group who

828
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,869
started looking at communication in

829
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,819
northern Quebec and I see you have no

830
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:35,920
where no dots there northern

831
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:37,900
back by the way is eastern coast go up

832
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,809
up up and it's the big thing that's

833
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:43,539
right now there's no dots in it and I

834
00:43:40,809 --> 00:43:46,509
was wondering if you guys have thought

835
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:49,779
of your same type of communication in

836
00:43:46,509 --> 00:43:53,430
remote areas in Canada which will never

837
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:58,059
be served by any form of you know

838
00:43:53,430 --> 00:44:00,549
broadband traditional network yet have

839
00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:02,890
an incredible need for communications

840
00:44:00,549 --> 00:44:05,440
and and for access so I was just

841
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:07,449
wondering if you had plans in Canada I

842
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,150
see you have well how about yeah velasca

843
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:12,430
which is cool but nothing in my neck of

844
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:16,269
the woods this is a group of communities

845
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:19,598
and so if your community wanted to start

846
00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:22,419
a Laura Wynn network your entry cost for

847
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:26,199
a gateway is less than $100 I think it's

848
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:28,869
around $70 u.s. you can buy a gateway

849
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:30,999
and you need I P backhaul now the amount

850
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:33,519
of IP backhaul that you need to run this

851
00:44:30,999 --> 00:44:36,609
is in the kilobits per second so any

852
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:39,279
satellite connection would would solve

853
00:44:36,609 --> 00:44:41,499
this problem well actually one thing I

854
00:44:39,279 --> 00:44:43,900
wanted to well we can talk offline too

855
00:44:41,499 --> 00:44:46,238
but they in these northern communities

856
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,920
they always have credit unions and those

857
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,049
credit unions have some form of

858
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,420
connectivity and we had thought of using

859
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:55,959
them as hubs it's a very good idea to

860
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,140
use those and subs thank you okay thank

861
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:59,578
you

862
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:59,578
let's give John a round of applause

863
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:04,598
thank you John and John works with them

864
00:45:03,009 --> 00:45:06,489
and SRC sometimes they're a great

865
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:10,029
partner and dr. Kanchana knows them well

866
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:13,299
so the next speaker is an online speaker

867
00:45:10,029 --> 00:45:14,769
whose name is Francisco del Aguila and

868
00:45:13,299 --> 00:45:17,140
it probably not said that right because

869
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:23,919
he's from Barcelona Francisco can you

870
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:25,690
hear us yes Bravo okay so give me one

871
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:28,140
second to pull up your sides can you

872
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:33,279
introduce yourself

873
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:36,430
yes hello everybody my name is Francisco

00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:39,699
de la Isla and I am an Associated

875
00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:42,819
professor at University University at

876
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:45,150
politécnica de Catalunya I leave him

877
00:45:42,819 --> 00:45:45,150
Manresa

878
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:52,419
a city in Barcelona praveen's I managed

879
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:55,900
to deploy a fever optics net were in my

880
00:45:52,420 --> 00:46:04,150
neighborhood and I'm going to show you

881
00:45:55,900 --> 00:46:10,349
how was it at the screen cider up so go

882
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:15,490
ahead yes please could you could you put

883
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:17,920
in a size greater I can't with this

884
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:19,689
computer so I'm gonna have to ask you to

885
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:23,470
hang with me and just go with what we

886
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:26,380
got okay no problem

887
00:46:23,470 --> 00:46:29,500
a description of the initial context is

888
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:34,210
that Billa Lourdes is a small rural

889
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:36,990
nucleus of about 300 inhabitants 3

890
00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:39,160
kilometers from the city of Manresa and

891
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:42,819
Villa Doris is also considered a

892
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:46,420
neighborhood of Manresa with a nucleus

893
00:46:42,819 --> 00:46:51,339
with concentrated houses and also

894
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:55,359
scattered forces existing communications

895
00:46:51,339 --> 00:46:59,020
were very precarious ADSL with low

896
00:46:55,359 --> 00:47:02,470
bandwidth below 1 megabits per second

897
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:04,690
and with continuous fat and also the

898
00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:08,230
other possibility was WiMAX

899
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:17,589
communication with low capacity and high

900
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:20,470
prices next in 2010 there was an

901
00:47:17,589 --> 00:47:22,509
initiative to improve communications it

902
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:25,598
was a construction of a community

903
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:30,550
wireless network and the initial support

904
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:34,420
was about 12 houses this network has

905
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:37,150
been working since that moment and also

906
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:42,700
community maintenance was done in

907
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:44,500
associative way with person with

908
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,029
technical expertise to carry out the

909
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:55,560
maintenance every household did an

910
00:47:49,030 --> 00:48:01,020
initial contribution of 35 euros to get

911
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:01,020
and also to my initial equipment

912
00:48:02,029 --> 00:48:11,159
pre-beta cube equipment household first

913
00:48:06,449 --> 00:48:16,279
about 200 euros you and after five years

914
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:23,880
the final trooper was about 35 horse

915
00:48:16,279 --> 00:48:28,109
quotas for household where 40 euros per

916
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:31,189
semester and a creation of reserve funds

917
00:48:28,109 --> 00:48:38,929
to deal with extension and maintenance

918
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:42,328
was done based on surplus quarters next

919
00:48:38,929 --> 00:48:46,849
about the feasibility study phase of all

920
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:51,739
an estimation of course was done a

921
00:48:46,849 --> 00:48:56,279
budget for the creation of a figure to

922
00:48:51,739 --> 00:49:02,089
connect to the next point of common

923
00:48:56,279 --> 00:49:07,249
fiber network meters away was of about

924
00:49:02,089 --> 00:49:11,429
45,000 euros the priority was to set up

925
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:15,749
fiber backbone to reach the community

926
00:49:11,429 --> 00:49:19,139
where it was not the first phase was to

927
00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:22,589
obtain funding and reach the community

928
00:49:19,139 --> 00:49:25,319
node the second phase was to allow

929
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:33,659
planning to finance fibre to the

930
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:37,019
interest comes next about financing and

931
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:40,439
cost sharing between neighbors one of

932
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:43,609
the important things worse with freedom

933
00:49:40,439 --> 00:49:46,589
to choose between a mandatory

934
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:50,219
contribution from each home to build

935
00:49:46,589 --> 00:49:56,639
favourite things to the wireless note it

936
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:59,489
was 600 euros or optionally increase

937
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:08,459
contribution by anyone who wants favour

938
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:10,289
- to case it was 1,500 euros about 50

939
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:13,830
homes are required to carry on the

940
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:17,370
project and a survey was

941
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:21,240
done among neighbors few families

942
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:23,460
refused to contribute money one purchase

943
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:27,120
fiber to the wireless note another

944
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:31,910
purchase fiber to the home finally the

945
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:37,950
number of participants reaches around 50

946
00:50:31,910 --> 00:50:40,399
the surplus money reach 5000 errors and

947
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:44,310
becomes a buffer

948
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:47,610
they give ashes Association the current

949
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:55,020
provider he requested to contribute with

950
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:57,390
another buffer of 5000 euros more the

951
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:01,170
Spanish law allow individuals to the

952
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:07,170
Duke in donation made to foundation the

953
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:12,050
first 150 euros up to 75 percent above

954
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:15,540
this quantity the dilution is 30%

955
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:18,840
the hyphenate foundation did dedicate

956
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:22,200
donation we resolved it to the creation

957
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:26,250
of a communication network of universal

958
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:28,770
reach and available to everyone so

959
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:35,790
finally they will adore this project was

960
00:51:28,770 --> 00:51:38,280
activated the funding connection

961
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:42,240
collection phase was started as the

962
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:47,880
first action of the project execution

963
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,640
execution for two years 600 euros per

964
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:54,540
household is collected in the form of

965
00:51:50,640 --> 00:52:00,200
donation preferably of 2 people per

966
00:51:54,540 --> 00:52:06,840
household with 150 euros per person it

967
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:08,939
it is it works it is also accepted some

968
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:12,380
households do not contribute with this

969
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:17,460
amount in each age for contributing with

970
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:20,240
100 euros per year forever we have now

971
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:25,110
the table with the difference of

972
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:27,330
contribution options 2 of them to get

973
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:27,820
the fiber to the wireless node and 2 of

974
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:31,330
them

975
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:36,390
to get the fiber to the home in the

976
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:40,120
front row we have the years and between

977
00:52:36,390 --> 00:52:43,569
2016 17 and 18 the network world sways

978
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:48,759
in radio technology but at the end of

979
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:52,630
the 2018 if the network of fiber optics

980
00:52:48,760 --> 00:53:02,280
was built and we are enjoying this

981
00:52:52,630 --> 00:53:07,270
network today a next place in summer of

982
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:09,600
2018 a fiber installer is contracted to

983
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:14,259
carry out the deployment the

984
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:18,190
installation is the next year after the

985
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:20,370
donation of 600 euros households

986
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:26,470
committed to fever at home continue

987
00:53:20,370 --> 00:53:30,460
contribute until reaching 1,500 euros at

988
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:35,740
the end of the network installation 30

989
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:39,190
household made a donation of 1500 he

990
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:42,819
works at the beginning of the next year

991
00:53:39,190 --> 00:53:45,910
more or less nowadays 10 households more

992
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:49,020
are going to donate the total amount and

993
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:54,069
are waiting for the fiber installation

994
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:58,690
now you can see a summary table a final

995
00:53:54,070 --> 00:54:03,280
income and expenditure for example about

996
00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:09,070
income we have the quantity of in each

997
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:12,910
household with each option and finally

998
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:17,470
we get the amount of sixty one thousand

999
00:54:12,910 --> 00:54:23,319
euros about capital expenditure we have

1000
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:27,520
to pay the main backbone and also branch

1001
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:30,970
line of little village some fritters on

1002
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:35,920
a branch line towards the city of

1003
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:39,189
Manresa we have also for everyone who

1004
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:41,530
wants fever to the home we have to pay

1005
00:54:39,190 --> 00:54:47,140
for the drop

1006
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:50,080
it cost about 200 euros and the final

1007
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:53,890
amount you can see in the in this light

1008
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:56,380
finally you can you can observe that we

1009
00:54:53,890 --> 00:55:00,810
have a surplus to extend up optical

1010
00:54:56,380 --> 00:55:04,650
fever to other locations next please

1011
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:08,500
this is the map of the deployment and

1012
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:11,920
you can see very well but in the top of

1013
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:16,570
the map we have the point that the

1014
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:20,950
network is connected to a previous fiber

1015
00:55:16,570 --> 00:55:23,859
optics network and from the top to the

1016
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:31,200
to the bottom we have the main mud pony

1017
00:55:23,859 --> 00:55:37,630
and if you can see a blue line cable of

1018
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:41,529
48 fiber optics and the green one is a

1019
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:44,970
cable of 12 fiber optics you can see

1020
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:49,990
also the two branch line one of the

1021
00:55:44,970 --> 00:55:55,480
lovers in the right top map the words

1022
00:55:49,990 --> 00:55:58,149
some fritters and in the left bottom you

1023
00:55:55,480 --> 00:56:00,339
can see the branch line towards the city

1024
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:04,200
of Monterrey sir that you can see on the

1025
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:04,200
left of the of the map

1026
00:56:04,750 --> 00:56:15,849
next please you can see any example of

1027
00:56:10,859 --> 00:56:21,430
the deployment for example the building

1028
00:56:15,849 --> 00:56:24,910
for Cali with a connection box name of

1029
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:31,290
giving it that is the main is the

1030
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:35,799
project based on this deployment next

1031
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:38,050
you can also see the deployment based on

1032
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:47,710
pole installation with the connection

1033
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:50,830
box also next and nowadays we are in the

1034
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:55,150
maintenance stage and we have an

1035
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:57,610
agreement with its darlin

1036
00:56:55,150 --> 00:57:01,330
six dollars of a commitment for

1037
00:56:57,610 --> 00:57:04,480
repairing when any failure a monthly

1038
00:57:01,330 --> 00:57:10,020
donation of CCA groups is made as part

1039
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:13,900
of an economic maintenance I mean

1040
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:17,680
operation I credit event the resulting

1041
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:26,110
fee to the user if he choose if he was a

1042
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:29,040
loose Association fifteen six euros of

1043
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:31,960
maintenance fees is already included

1044
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:34,680
internet access is achieved through a

1045
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:38,770
regional optical but born over a

1046
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:41,259
wholesale only fiber operator connected

1047
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:45,100
to a shared pool of inter internet

1048
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:50,230
career in Barcelona both operated an

1049
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:53,410
infinite foundation and finally the

1050
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:56,140
conclusions it is possible to have a

1051
00:57:53,410 --> 00:58:00,009
broadband communication in rural areas

1052
00:57:56,140 --> 00:58:03,400
where traditional operators do not see

1053
00:58:00,010 --> 00:58:05,980
any kind of interest combinations

1054
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:09,370
between network is needed to provide the

1055
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:12,220
necessary funding it is necessary

1056
00:58:09,370 --> 00:58:16,720
flexibility for each individual to find

1057
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:19,930
a place in the project tax deductions

1058
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,240
are unit incentive since that leads to

1059
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:25,930
the final cost being approximately a

1060
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:28,029
quarter of the total amount the

1061
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:31,149
neighbors initiative has been possible

1062
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:34,000
thanks to the existence of the definite

1063
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:37,350
project with the presence of different

1064
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:40,150
actors such as the foundation and also

1065
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:44,370
associative operators as if he badges

1066
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:47,830
association the final existence of this

1067
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:52,839
network promotes other other neighbors

1068
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:55,690
preferring later the toll thank you for

1069
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:58,240
your attention thank you very much

1070
00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:00,360

Griffin at one of the largest community

1079
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:21,310
networks in the world and some of the

1080
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:23,250
people in the room Francisco are shaking

1081
00:59:21,310 --> 00:59:25,950
their heads because they know grief II

1082

thank you very much we appreciate your

1083
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:29,589
contribution and the slides are online

1084
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,110
already if anybody wants to take

1085
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:35,800
advantage of them

so gracias thank you thank you

1087
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:40,120
so if anyone's in the room that hasn't

1088
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:42,970
signed in with the blue sheets please do

1089
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:51,069
so they're circulating the next speaker

1090
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:53,799
on the agenda is Murrieta Reza Perez who

1091
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:56,110
is here with us in the room Maria

1092
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,910
Theresa Perez has ten minutes she's

1093
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:59,890
gonna stand on the X up here and speak

1094
00:59:57,910 --> 01:00:03,160
into the microphone the clickers not

1095
00:59:59,890 --> 01:00:17,529
working so I'm gonna help you if you're

1096
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:20,200
in the room you are here for Gaia there

1097
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:22,300
you are okay and so I just also want to

1098
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:25,629
recognize that many people who came here

1099
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:28,150
today from dr. Kanchana in Thailand well

1100
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:30,190
Francie's go through the the beauty of

1101
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:32,860
the internet is speaking with us from

1102
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:34,510
Spain we had John who's originally from

1103
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:36,100
New Zealand but lives here in Singapore

1104
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:38,680
and we have Maria Teresa from the

1105
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,029
Philippines we soon will have Ono who I

1106
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:43,029
believe is from Indonesia

1107
01:00:40,030 --> 01:00:44,800
so you're seeing local people and others

1108
01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:48,850
who are connecting through Gaia and

1109
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:51,010
other ways at IETF and through different

1110
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:52,810
organizations to learn more from each

1111
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:55,180
other about the deployments that they're

1112
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:57,549
actually making to connect people in

1113
01:00:55,180 --> 01:01:02,529
really remote rural and sometimes urban

1114
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:04,420
poor situations so over to you okay hi

1115
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,940
i'm maria teresa paris from the

1116
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:09,160
university of the philippines my talk is

1117
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:11,830
about community cellular networks and

1118
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:15,100
the philippines experiences from the v

1119
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:18,850
BTS project so the outline of my talk

1120
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:22,220
will be as follows next I'll be talking

1121
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:25,460
about Cece ends in the Philippines and

1122
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,740
our deployments I will show you are a

1123
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:30,200
challenges to sustain these sites and

1124
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:33,919
what do you think is the future of CCS

1125
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:36,470
in the Philippines next so as we move

1126
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,869
towards digital society and Internet

1127
01:01:36,470 --> 01:01:41,810
connectivity there are a lot of people

1128
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:45,349
that are still not connected or do not

1129
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:49,549
have access for communication so gsmd

1130
01:01:45,349 --> 01:01:51,650
jsm a data shows that as of 2018 the

1131
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:57,109
Philippines subscriber penetration is

1132
01:01:51,650 --> 01:02:00,520
only at 64% of the population next this

1133
01:01:57,109 --> 01:02:03,890
is especially true for rural remote

1134
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:07,400
areas because of the following reasons

1135
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:10,759
first most barangay lack red power

1136
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:13,280
there is also high installation cost of

1137
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:15,980
traditional base station deployments and

1138
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:18,910
it is considered unprofitable fertile

1139
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:23,900
coast due to small subscriber population

1140
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:26,690
next so what we did is to partner with

1141
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:30,730
telco and local communities to deploy

1142
01:02:26,690 --> 01:02:32,750
community cellular networks so CCN is a

1143
01:02:30,730 --> 01:02:34,670
cellular technology

1144
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:37,580
at a tenth of the cost of traditional

1145
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:40,820
base station deployments so it is low

1146
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,880
cost low power accuses alternative

1147
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:46,190
sources of power in our case solar it is

1148
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:48,859
customized network for small communities

1149
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:51,050
and it is being managed locally with the

1150
01:02:48,859 --> 01:02:54,230
cooperatives with the help of the local

1151
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:56,030
government unit it is an it has a

1152
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:59,750
community owned model for the community

1153
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:04,310
owns operates maintains and repairs the

1154
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:08,030
CC ends next so here is the basic v BTS

1155
01:03:04,310 --> 01:03:11,089
diagram you have the gsm 2g base station

1156
01:03:08,030 --> 01:03:17,060
antenna the power source and the visa to

1157
01:03:11,089 --> 01:03:20,830
connect to the cloud next so but before

1158
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:23,960
we can even start deploying these boxes

1159
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:28,640
we had some pre deployment challenges

1160
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:30,440
first with our telco partner since 2g

1161
01:03:28,640 --> 01:03:34,609
frequency bands and the Philippines are

1162
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,720
assigned to incumbents we had we needed

1163
01:03:34,609 --> 01:03:38,090
to

1164
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:41,209
an agreement with the telco operators

1165
01:03:38,090 --> 01:03:43,580
and this took shape for around two year

1166
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:47,390
of negotiations but with that agreement

1167
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:50,359
we had an 80/20 revenue sharing 80 for

1168
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:52,819
the community and 20 for the telco

1169
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:55,700
operator they are the ones handling the

1170
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:57,560
regulatory permits we have we had to get

1171
01:03:55,700 --> 01:04:00,830
the SIM cards from them and they also

1172
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,020
handled interconnect also we also had a

1173
01:04:00,830 --> 01:04:05,509
problem with the regulatory since we

1174
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:07,880
initially set to use experimental

1175
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:12,530
network in a box solutions that we also

1176
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:14,390
develop a new P but we were regulatory

1177
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:18,800
or we were restricted to use type

1178
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:22,339
certified boxes our network equipment in

1179
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:25,040
the course of our deployment so next in

1180
01:04:22,340 --> 01:04:27,200
our in the course of our deployment we

1181
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,060
have an in going impact study of

1182
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:32,598
first-time access to mobile

1183
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:34,460
communication in rural areas it uses

1184
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:39,890
randomized control trial to determine

1185
01:04:34,460 --> 01:04:42,170
these seven pilot communities next the

1186
01:04:39,890 --> 01:04:44,680
communities we serve are remote and

1187
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:47,000
isolated coastal communities with around

1188
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,819
typical villages around two to three

1189
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:54,200
hour boat ride from the nearest mobile

1190
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:56,300
phone tower next they are fishing and

1191
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:58,759
farming communities and the locals

1192
01:04:56,300 --> 01:05:01,190
travel for several hours to use their

1193
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:03,980
mobile phones on the other hand the

1194
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:07,180
local government unit uses their high

1195
01:05:03,980 --> 01:05:11,619
high frequency radio links for emergency

1196
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:16,490
next so the timeline of our deployments

1197
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:19,070
from September 2017 to January 2019 we

1198
01:05:16,490 --> 01:05:22,009
were able to install and deploy in seven

1199
01:05:19,070 --> 01:05:26,349
sites in seven communities in our rural

1200
01:05:22,010 --> 01:05:28,609
province next this is our typical

1201
01:05:26,349 --> 01:05:31,930
installation you have the solar the

1202
01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:37,040
equipment inside the shelter we sat and

1203
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:41,480
the picture of our cell site next so the

1204
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:44,630
status of CCN we have seven community

1205
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:47,119
sites we have around 2,000 or more than

1206
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:49,760
2,000 subscribers in our two year

1207
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,980
operation our monthly

1208
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:57,230
traffic is around 10,000 Voice Minutes

1209
01:05:51,980 --> 01:06:00,020
and 2,000 SMS average next so here are

1210
01:05:57,230 --> 01:06:02,720
the observations we had in our sights

1211
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:04,820
so SMS is the predominant traffic with

1212
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,750
equal volume in both directions and

1213
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:10,609
inbound call traffic is almost six times

1214
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:13,430
the outbound call traffic this is an

1215
01:06:10,609 --> 01:06:15,740
indicative behavior of a call me

1216
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:17,779
behavior because subscribers found out

1217
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,549
that they are aware that they could save

1218
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:22,609
by letting their contacts call them

1219
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:26,810
instead so just to note that we do not

1220
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:29,509
have promos yet in these sites so other

1221
01:06:26,810 --> 01:06:32,420
observation it is they have a peak usage

1222
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:36,800
in the evening so subscribers prefer to

1223
01:06:32,420 --> 01:06:39,680
call after work hours next other

1224
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:42,109
observations we do not have promos yet

1225
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:44,060
but there are frequent increase on the

1226
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:45,140
future availability of promos and

1227
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:49,940
Internet access

1228
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:51,950
notably Facebook so other demands and

1229
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:54,830
service availability changes as time

1230
01:06:51,950 --> 01:06:57,319
goes on so people are now becoming

1231
01:06:54,830 --> 01:06:59,840
accustom to the presence of our service

1232
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:04,250
so there is an increased sensitivity on

1233
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:07,850
our service disruptions so next so here

1234
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:09,980
are the challenges we think in in order

1235
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:12,230
for us to continually serve these

1236
01:07:09,980 --> 01:07:14,780
communities very first of course is

1237
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:17,359
regulatory because in our current

1238
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:20,780
structure it is highly dependent on

1239
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:23,960
telcos there the telcos expansion plans

1240
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:27,230
and priorities and we are heavily tied

1241
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:29,030
to the to the end of our agreement with

1242
01:07:27,230 --> 01:07:33,260
them especially now because we are

1243
01:07:29,030 --> 01:07:35,440
nearing the end of our agreement also we

1244
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:40,520
are regulatory also the equipment type

1245
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:42,710
certification and permits to purchase

1246
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:45,020
the only the only ones allowed to

1247
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:47,800
purchase possess and operate this

1248
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:51,050
network equipment are the taça operators

1249
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:53,780
apparition is the backhaul of

1250
01:07:51,050 --> 01:07:56,540
availability because currently we said

1251
01:07:53,780 --> 01:08:00,070
is the only solution feasible solution

1252
01:07:56,540 --> 01:08:04,150
for a true drop and operate deployment

1253
01:08:00,070 --> 01:08:07,380
next others other

1254
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:10,569
also in the service perceptions because

1255
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:13,750
there are higher expectations now on the

1256
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:16,778
operational hours and reliability and we

1257
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:19,960
are now being compared to the incumbent

1258
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:24,699
aminos and lastly since we heavily rely

1259
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:26,890
on the local partners on the ground we

1260
01:08:24,698 --> 01:08:29,769
are having a challenge and the personal

1261
01:08:26,890 --> 01:08:31,719
personnel retention as designated

1262
01:08:29,770 --> 01:08:34,120
maintenance officers that we also

1263
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:37,810
trained move to more rewarding

1264
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:40,059
livelihoods outside the community so

1265
01:08:37,810 --> 01:08:41,859
what what do we see is the future of

1266
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:44,500
community network in the in the

1267
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:47,080
Philippines we see the Internet as a way

1268
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:49,509
to move forward either as an added

1269
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:53,170
service through a cellular data or LTE

1270
01:08:49,509 --> 01:08:56,109
or an internet-only network but in the

1271
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:58,839
cellular data option you have we have we

1272
01:08:56,109 --> 01:09:00,909
will have a high dependency in telecom

1273
01:08:58,839 --> 01:09:03,880
partner and the cost of bandwidth is

1274
01:09:00,908 --> 01:09:06,309
also high to eliminate this dependency

1275
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:10,239
we are seeing that we need to have more

1276
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:13,630
policy revisions like hopefully we hope

1277
01:09:10,238 --> 01:09:15,790
to have a legal framework for cc ends as

1278
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:19,569
a mode of community-based social

1279
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:21,549
entrepreneurship also we want the policy

1280
01:09:19,569 --> 01:09:24,759
revision that we have a reform of the

1281
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:27,759
system that hopefully they can allocate

1282
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:30,609
spectrum and license towards the

1283
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:34,689
designation of a social use frequency

1284
01:09:30,609 --> 01:09:36,850
for the CC ends that we have and for the

1285
01:09:34,689 --> 01:09:38,769
internet only Network we see that the

1286
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:41,650
eventual phase-out of 2g and the

1287
01:09:38,770 --> 01:09:44,500
proliferation of internet capable phones

1288
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:47,019
point points us to a internet only

1289
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:49,719
network but Internet in the last mile

1290
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:52,420
areas are not cheap so efficient

1291
01:09:49,719 --> 01:09:55,210
bandwidth utilization like what with

1292
01:09:52,420 --> 01:09:56,980
what was discussed before we are also

1293
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:59,590
exploring that the utilization

1294
01:09:56,980 --> 01:10:00,730
strategies for the bandwidth should also

1295
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:04,960
be explored

1296
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:07,570
so next this is my last slide so we hope

1297
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:10,030
that by sharing our experiences and we

1298
01:10:07,570 --> 01:10:13,049
BTS in the Philippines we hope to open

1299
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:16,000
more opportunities for these communities

1300
01:10:13,050 --> 01:10:17,200
expand coverage and connect more people

1301
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:23,230
to the rest of the

1302
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:24,639
thank you thank you that was great we

1303
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:26,500
have about a minute and a half or two

1304
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,820
minutes does anyone have any questions

1305
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:32,170
for Medea and I have to say something

1306
01:10:30,820 --> 01:10:34,540
you mentioned about the regulatory

1307
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:36,760
issues are major things that we see

1308
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:38,590
around the planet Mallory can you

1309
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:40,510
introduce yourself yeah hi Mallory

1310
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:42,670
knodel from article 19 really

1311
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:44,290
interesting work I was just wondering if

1312
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:46,240
you could give us a sense of where

1313
01:10:44,290 --> 01:10:48,370
you're at in the policy advocacy process

1314
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,440
in the Philippines like do you have

1315
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:53,620
draft laws do you have white papers

1316
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:57,400
what's happening there

1317
01:10:53,620 --> 01:11:00,250
we don't have policy draft yet so we

1318
01:10:57,400 --> 01:11:03,190
only have local copies of the draft we

1319
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:06,300
are trying to create but we are not yet

1320
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:09,339
in that stage thank you for that gushin

1321
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:11,110
we have a colleague named Noel who lives

1322
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:14,830
in Manila so we're gonna introduce you

1323
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:18,460
to her she's fabulous and but also you

1324
01:11:14,830 --> 01:11:22,269
mentioned a social purpose or social use

1325
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:23,530
there's a there is and thanks Mallory

1326
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:25,900
for that question because it's triggered

1327
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:27,849
a memory in Mexico they have a social

1328
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:29,469
purpose license which they were one of

1329
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,660
the first governments in the world to

1330
01:11:29,470 --> 01:11:34,390
actually do this to help indigenous kind

1331
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:37,030
of communities get connectivity so it

1332
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,830
allowed the network to exist which

1333
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:41,950
prevented the incumbent from killing it

1334
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:44,019
off in many countries the incumbents and

1335
01:11:41,950 --> 01:11:47,139
traditional mobile operators cannot get

1336
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:49,930
a return on investment in rolling out in

1337
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:52,120
communities of 5,000 and under so there

1338
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:53,890
you have this issue they can't get the

1339
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:56,019
return the community networks can't get

1340
01:11:53,890 --> 01:11:58,180
the regulatory licensing yet they can go

1341
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:00,820
into these communities at a lower cost

1342
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:02,020
so Mallory's question is super important

1343
01:12:00,820 --> 01:12:04,120
because this is something we're all

1344
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:07,390
dealing with with community networks and

1345
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:09,730
small operational networks where we have

1346
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:11,550
regulations for the old system the old

1347
01:12:09,730 --> 01:12:13,990
system doesn't reach the unconnected

1348
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:16,060
it's not cost-efficient the newer

1349
01:12:13,990 --> 01:12:18,340
networks and the cheaper guys with great

1350
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:20,680
equipment out there with your network

1351
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:22,330
and the others here can provide the

1352
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:25,120
connectivity and they just need the

1353
01:12:22,330 --> 01:12:27,940
backhaul on occasion so I'm gonna offer

1354
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:30,219
a modest proposal that a lot of

1355
01:12:27,940 --> 01:12:32,710
governments start to change the way

1356
01:12:30,219 --> 01:12:34,780
big operators can actually get licensed

1357
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:37,270
so that they are required to provide

1358
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:39,160
backhaul to the little guys because we

1359
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:42,219
are never gonna get people connected if

1360
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:43,630
we don't have a change so anyway you are

1361
01:12:42,219 --> 01:12:46,060
doing a great job thank you very much

1362
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:47,830
and Ono from Indonesia I believe you're

1363
01:12:46,060 --> 01:12:51,130
up next Thank You Maria we appreciate

1364
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:52,360
your time this is the cool stuff where

1365
01:12:51,130 --> 01:12:54,520
people are actually deploying networks

1366
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:57,460
in hard-to-reach places at low cost and

1367
01:12:54,520 --> 01:13:07,199
a lot of effort human effort which

1368
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:09,730
presentations first okay this one yes

1369
01:13:07,199 --> 01:13:13,089
you have ten minutes per presentation

1370
01:13:09,730 --> 01:13:15,489
but we have yes please

1371
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:17,770
so we have to be cognizant of time so if

1372
01:13:15,489 --> 01:13:21,070
you can take about I think around two

1373
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:22,480

1374

01:13:35,949 --> 01:13:45,190
next I will be very big provide broad

1381
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:48,969
overview of what we are doing some do

1382
01:13:45,190 --> 01:13:51,160
and don'ts and next IG will tell us

1383
01:13:48,969 --> 01:13:54,880
about his experience connecting about

1384
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:56,980
200 plus villages in the face in the

1385
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,320
last four years and he's actually

1386
01:13:56,980 --> 01:14:02,410
connecting like the neighborhood

1387
01:13:59,320 --> 01:14:04,630
neighboring municipal another 200 as

1388
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:06,550
well so total I think they are managing

1389
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:12,550
to connect around 1000 villages right

1390
01:14:06,550 --> 01:14:16,690
now 10x so in ratio we have 80,000

1391
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:18,219
village 9,000 in no signal no nothing 50

1392
01:14:16,690 --> 01:14:22,719
percent of the population is in the

1393
01:14:18,219 --> 01:14:24,969
village okay right now we have what

1394
01:14:22,719 --> 01:14:27,400
continent called community network we

1395
01:14:24,969 --> 01:14:34,480
have 60,000 community network Indonesia

1396
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:38,110
mind you it's all illegal okay so this

1397
01:14:34,480 --> 01:14:40,330
is what gin pushing how to push the

1398
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:41,380
government policy to be more propia

1399
01:14:40,330 --> 01:14:44,019
pro-people

1400
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:46,720
policy we have four options

1401
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:49,390
use power use money use mass or people

1402
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:51,370
and international acknowledgement use

1403
01:14:49,390 --> 01:14:55,810
power we have no power we use money we

1404
01:14:51,370 --> 01:15:00,430
have no money we broke we use mass we

1405
01:14:55,810 --> 01:15:03,250
educate people if we see the the next

1406
01:15:00,430 --> 01:15:06,100
presentation from aji we will see

1407
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:10,060
clearly how they actually educate a lot

1408
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:12,280
of people but it fail it's still we are

1409
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:15,760
having difficulty to push the government

1410
01:15:12,280 --> 01:15:18,460
policy having other people the most

1411
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:21,670
efficient way is international

1412
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:24,340
acknowledgement like this so we are very

1413
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:26,350
thank you to Jane and all of you to

1414
01:15:24,340 --> 01:15:29,350
invite us to give to be able to give

1415
01:15:26,350 --> 01:15:31,450
talk to all of you guys this actually

1416
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:33,250
creating a lot of pressure to the

1417
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:36,400
government that what we are doing is

1418
01:15:33,250 --> 01:15:42,790
actually right so we like to thank you

1419
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:45,490
about that next don't this is what the

1420
01:15:42,790 --> 01:15:48,820
most of the government done is top-down

1421
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:52,000
approach very much project pace and it

1422
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:58,799
costs us the internation 60 million u.s.

1423
01:15:52,000 --> 01:16:02,260
dollar and becoming scrap next they do

1424
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:06,280
very much committee base you can check

1425
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:08,770
on google the keyword is the in in

1426
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:12,429
addition language is Rajan Bullock in

1427
01:16:08,770 --> 01:16:15,490
English is wok for cooking and parabolic

1428
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:17,920
we mix together these two words becoming

1429
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:19,690
wok Pollock but we have to use the

1430
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,840
Indonesian words you can see a lot of

1431
01:16:19,690 --> 01:16:25,389
pictures of this type of antenna it's

1432
01:16:22,840 --> 01:16:28,540
becoming furry Indonesians

1433
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:31,420
style so the technology becoming owned

1434
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:34,060
by the Indonesian people ok you can

1435
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:40,120
check on Google Google notice it ok next

1436
01:16:34,060 --> 01:16:42,700
one is Kanchana use the word community

1437
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:44,769
network Indonesia we call it earth the

1438
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:47,170
arrow a nap which is neighborhood

1439
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:49,420
network if we enter the keyword

1440
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:52,210
Indonesian language at the air in it you

1441
01:16:49,420 --> 01:16:54,190
can see lot lots of innocent sites

1442
01:16:52,210 --> 01:16:57,550
carrying this this kind of technology

1443
01:16:54,190 --> 01:17:19,650
this is illegal though ok so

1444
01:16:57,550 --> 01:17:19,650
next is your issue

1445
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:33,400
the melon king in mother yep

1446
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:35,619
one second yeah did you see it in this

1447
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:41,409
download some of these ones do you see

1448
01:17:35,619 --> 01:17:48,460
it no hanging that's okay it's right

1449
01:17:41,409 --> 01:17:50,259
here I uploaded technical moment one

1450
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:52,300
thing I think that's very curious about

1451
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:54,179
most these community when you mentioned

1452
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:56,710
the word spectrum everybody gets excited

1453
01:17:54,179 --> 01:17:59,130
it's a very complicated thing with some

1454
01:17:56,710 --> 01:18:01,020
of the government's because spectrum is

1455
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:08,400
gotcha right there

1456
01:18:01,020 --> 01:18:10,780
perfect two seconds yes there you go

1457
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:19,000
the fact that these networks are illegal

1458
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:21,000
just makes me very cranky but no no I

1459
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:27,909
used to live in places to where that was

1460
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:33,520
normal that's okay you have I bet you

1461
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:38,429
have pictures it's okay it's coming to -

so we realize okay so while waiting for

1483
01:20:38,429 --> 01:20:45,630
the slide to load we may need to

1484
01:20:41,730 --> 01:20:48,000
negotiate with the government so to give

1485
01:20:45,630 --> 01:20:52,230
you some idea what what how tough our

1486
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,739
job is in the past Wi-Fi is not free we

1487
01:20:52,230 --> 01:20:57,718
have to pay about 2000 US dollar per

1488
01:20:55,739 --> 01:21:01,169
year per access point to the government

1489
01:20:57,719 --> 01:21:06,090
so we fight with them and finally 5

1490
01:21:01,170 --> 01:21:09,780
January January 2005 Wi-Fi is liberated

1491
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:13,320
so we can use Wi-Fi for free so all this

1492
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:16,580
network our Wi-Fi base we modify the

1493
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:21,230
antenna for long-distance connection and

1494
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:24,960
we are not using like Philippines

1495
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:31,080
cellular yeah but could this minutes to

1496

run now only girl thank you very much so

1497
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:38,130
could this Minister on cellular network

1498
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:42,750
in Papua for I don't know six seven

1499
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:46,710
years I don't know a couple of year yes

1500
01:21:42,750 --> 01:21:51,540
some years and becoming example for the

1501
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:54,440
nation government finally 2018 the

1502
01:21:51,540 --> 01:22:00,620
government sign an act that we can

1503
01:21:54,440 --> 01:22:00,620
experiment with any technology in rural

1504
01:22:01,699 --> 01:22:11,009
for free for experiment and Curtis and I

1505
01:22:06,870 --> 01:22:15,179
goes to the government and asking which

1506
01:22:11,010 --> 01:22:20,489
frequency we can use and the the officer

1507
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:21,900
tell us we can use any frequencies so

1508
01:22:20,489 --> 01:22:23,790
could this is very happy

1509
01:22:21,900 --> 01:22:26,450
so all because of course this he's the

1510
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:29,480
one who is responsible for this

1511
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:32,650
so frequency is free and we can use for

1512
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:36,110
experiment and now I don't know how many

1513
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:36,530
BTS is deployed but by you guys I don't

thank you in the section I will tell

1537
01:25:11,810 --> 01:25:20,600
what flop in the rural internet for

1538
01:25:14,090 --> 01:25:24,739
Milan City next okay this is Pamela

1539
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:28,670
Regency Milan is one latency of Central

1540
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:31,190
Java province of Indonesia which is

1541
01:25:28,670 --> 01:25:35,300
located on the north coast line at mr.

1542
01:25:31,190 --> 01:25:40,460
flea American city fat in the forty

1543
01:25:35,300 --> 01:25:46,850
district and 211 villages beside the

1544
01:25:40,460 --> 01:25:52,400
territory divided into la line and hike

1545
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:57,290
line next this is some images of plans

1546
01:25:52,400 --> 01:26:01,659
but area in black color this is lack of

1547
01:25:57,290 --> 01:26:08,409
a fractional area and cream color a

1548
01:26:01,659 --> 01:26:08,409
fractional area this next

1549
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:14,210
limiting that information the transfer

1550
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:18,590
that million transfer in communication

1551
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:21,200
with other is problem at the time to

1552
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:23,900
overcome this problem with develop the

1553
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:30,309
internet access to cover this area by

1554
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:34,269
funding society next this is some image

1555
01:26:30,310 --> 01:26:42,740
process of building internet access you

1556
01:26:34,270 --> 01:26:49,040
can see we work in general and some tool

1557
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:51,769
next this is document se we will in

1558
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:58,070
which we will tour in a free village

1559
01:26:51,770 --> 01:27:00,920
next and that map that monitoring map of

1560
01:26:58,070 --> 01:27:04,549
Internet connection using ubiquity

1561
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:08,080
network management system we use various

1562
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:11,330
technology to connection every village

1563
01:27:08,080 --> 01:27:13,610
with internet access to request was

1564
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:21,320
pulled we conduct two proper training to

1565
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:23,719
the community next this chart shown the

1566
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:32,860
training participant that consists of

1567
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:36,650
some element of CD next and the slide

1568
01:27:32,860 --> 01:27:39,679
shown some images of training activity

1569
01:27:36,650 --> 01:27:42,679
there were five time training tivity

1570
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:45,080
totally in one years every type of

1571
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:55,910
training was healed in three times

1572
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:59,809
meeting next okay this is the end slide

1573
01:27:55,910 --> 01:28:02,450
shown some images training network

1574
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:08,270
training activity you can see they are

1575
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:13,309
playing cable okay in this training we

1576
01:28:08,270 --> 01:28:18,410
talk about routing network maintenance

1577
01:28:13,310 --> 01:28:19,900
network design using its curve limp in

1578
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:30,510
with limitation

1579
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:30,509
IP address another next okay and this is

1580
01:28:30,690 --> 01:28:37,599
philic map training in this training we

1581
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:46,960
talk about silicon the race to make maps

1582
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:49,630
withdrawn another next this is in the

1583
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:54,280
sled some image of select information

1584
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:58,770
system try an activity we socialization

1585
01:28:54,280 --> 01:29:02,200
the system to the community next and

1586
01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:07,150
this is filling information system that

1587
01:29:02,200 --> 01:29:09,670
we create we call it she become / using

1588
01:29:07,150 --> 01:29:13,780
she become application now the village

1589
01:29:09,670 --> 01:29:25,150
is able to provide so some fast surface

1590
01:29:13,780 --> 01:29:27,670
to the community next okay this is basic

1591
01:29:25,150 --> 01:29:31,200
computer training activity in this

1592
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:36,310
training we talk about libera office

1593
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:43,110
tack impress Ritter all with discuss

1594
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:46,300
support a process application next and

1595
01:29:43,110 --> 01:29:50,110
we also held an early activity we call

1596
01:29:46,300 --> 01:30:00,810
it symbol a IT our information

1597
01:29:50,110 --> 01:30:05,259
technology in Jamboree next this is

1598
01:30:00,810 --> 01:30:07,720
social media website insurance it train

1599
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:09,580
activity we trained community apart

1600
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:12,240
using a social media who too many

1601
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:14,860
complaint ending in social media and

1602

internet-of-things

1611
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:47,989
training DVD we introduce several tools

1612
01:30:44,780 --> 01:30:50,320
such as Arduino spectral and several

1613
01:30:47,989 --> 01:30:55,968
sensor that can be implemented in

1614
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:58,489
villages agriculture etc we conduct all

1615
01:30:55,969 --> 01:31:08,989
the training for free on funding mostly

1616
01:30:58,489 --> 01:31:11,000
community next and into person acting we

1617
01:31:08,989 --> 01:31:14,900
achieve at the price in the sharing

1618
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:23,540
canola category worth it in EE sis in

Curtis I'm allowed to have questions so

1624
01:31:37,369 --> 01:31:41,480
Curtis hi Merle University of Washington

1625
01:31:39,139 --> 01:31:44,179
I'm curious about the use cases for the

1626
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:46,280
IOT I could you set people up with

1627
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:50,440
Arduino as all that did was there any

1628
01:31:46,280 --> 01:31:50,440
uptake or use of those in the network

1629
01:31:51,820 --> 01:31:58,820
it's a flip to answer your questions

1630
01:31:55,369 --> 01:32:00,880
okay to be honest what we are doing at

1631
01:31:58,820 --> 01:32:05,049
the moment still still in early stage

1632
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:11,409
but some of I have to show the video

1633
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:16,040
there is a junior high school girl

1634
01:32:11,409 --> 01:32:19,849
building an IOT for hydroponic farming

1635
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:21,949
and but but this one is not in their

1636
01:32:19,850 --> 01:32:24,800
area it's not far away from that area

1637
01:32:21,949 --> 01:32:27,138
actually in India carta in in the

1638
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,179
mountain in jakarta so yes they are

1639
01:32:27,139 --> 01:32:31,610
doing something like that in village

1640
01:32:29,179 --> 01:32:33,139
cool all right thank you but I like to

1641
01:32:31,610 --> 01:32:36,860
learn from John

1642
01:32:33,139 --> 01:32:39,080
actually Laura I

1643
01:32:36,860 --> 01:32:41,690
I skipped that that thing the other days

1644
01:32:39,080 --> 01:32:43,909
but after seeing your presentation I

1645
01:32:41,690 --> 01:32:46,519
think I will learn I will read a lot

1646
01:32:43,909 --> 01:32:48,049
about that let's go excellent

1647
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:49,970
we have someone at the microphone please

1648
01:32:48,050 --> 01:32:53,690
announce who you are Phillip mightiness

1649
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:55,550
from UB these are in what question I

1650
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:57,469
should ask where do you get your about

1651
01:32:55,550 --> 01:33:02,960
hole connection for the internet the

1652
01:32:57,470 --> 01:33:05,860
back hole yeah they are we are afraid to

1653
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:09,500
answer questions so basically they have

1654
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:12,380
they have a center they call it spin

1655
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:15,560
less data center organization and they

1656
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:18,620
they run some sort of internet exchange

1657
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:21,770
so a lot of connection is P connection

1658
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:26,120
to this one how big is the bandwidth you

1659
01:33:21,770 --> 01:33:28,280
have now hundred the total bandwidth

1660
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:32,540
hundred ten total bandwidth under ten

1661
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:35,179
but multiple ISP thank you and they

1662
01:33:32,540 --> 01:33:39,080
share it to the other villages and we

1663
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:41,030
run we run a lot of local server like

1664
01:33:39,080 --> 01:33:48,260
streaming video voice over IP

1665
01:33:41,030 --> 01:33:52,009
so all server locally we are yeah so we

1666
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:54,670
have a lot of local server so unlike

1667
01:33:52,010 --> 01:33:58,940
Kanchana who cares she's very polite

1668
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:01,100
caching the video we actually set up our

1669
01:33:58,940 --> 01:34:11,389
own streaming server some some we put

1670
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:17,510
the illegal video you gotta hack the

1671
01:34:11,390 --> 01:34:21,140
network right sir excellent well thank

1672
01:34:17,510 --> 01:34:24,050
you very much no no don't be sorry I

1673
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:27,470
think it's fabulous I may not look like

1674
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:30,230
a rebel but in my heart so I'd like to

1675
01:34:27,470 --> 01:34:32,540
just thank everyone for coming and we're

1676
01:34:30,230 --> 01:34:33,679
gonna have to wrap up but these fabulous

1677
01:34:32,540 --> 01:34:35,240
people who are actually building

1678
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:36,920
networks and very hard to reach places

1679
01:34:35,240 --> 01:34:40,700
with very little money and a lot of

1680
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:43,420
energy are here and they're learning

1681
01:34:40,700 --> 01:34:45,440
from many people here at the IETF

1682
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:47,090
they're here to talk about open

1683
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:48,589
standards because they're deploying them

1684
01:34:47,090 --> 01:34:50,270
in their networks these are actual

1685
01:34:48,590 --> 01:34:51,890
networks they're not high grade

1686
01:34:50,270 --> 01:34:53,480
commercial networks but they are good

1687
01:34:51,890 --> 01:34:56,150
networks in the regions and they're

1688
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:58,040
being developed in a very interesting

1689
01:34:56,150 --> 01:34:59,900
technical way because oftentimes they

1690
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,260
have to get hacked and oftentimes the

1691
01:34:59,900 --> 01:35:01,820
government

1692
01:35:00,260 --> 01:35:03,559
aren't allowing them in places where

1693
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:09,409
there is no connectivity go figure

1694
01:35:03,559 --> 01:35:12,170
so Leandro my counterpart from Griffey

1695
01:35:09,409 --> 01:35:16,098
is telling me that in Vancouver at the

1696
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:19,400
next IETF we are going to talk about the

1697
01:35:16,099 --> 01:35:21,920
importance of our next steps on hacking

1698
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:23,598
documents with you to discuss some of

1699
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:26,000
these networks and provide more examples

1700
01:35:23,599 --> 01:35:28,130
of these networks so if you'd like to

1701
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,710
join our mailing list you can find it

1702
01:35:28,130 --> 01:35:32,269
online that's the guy a mailing list

1703
01:35:29,710 --> 01:35:34,940
through the website and we're going to

1704
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:36,219
be looking at the interface between CNS

1705
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:38,900
and IXPs

1706
01:35:36,219 --> 01:35:41,210
wholesale operators for fiber which is

1707
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:43,759
like the gwee fee Network wholesale

1708
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:47,059
fiber different community networks in

1709
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:48,769
loora loora one wifey GSM and other and

1710
01:35:47,059 --> 01:35:50,420
so we'll be combining our efforts with

1711
01:35:48,769 --> 01:35:52,010
all of you from around the world please

1712
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:54,679
join the list we'll hack this together

1713
01:35:52,010 --> 01:35:57,829
and we'll do more at the next guy a

1714
01:35:54,679 --> 01:35:59,480
meeting in Vancouver so thank you for

1715
01:35:57,829 --> 01:36:01,489
your time if you haven't signed in on

1716
01:35:59,480 --> 01:36:03,709
the blue sheets please do that's much

1717
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:05,178
appreciated and just thank you for your

1718
01:36:03,710 --> 01:36:10,880
time because this has been really really

1719
01:36:05,179 --> 01:36:11,650
cool thanks and thank you to the person

1720
