45
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:57,610
[Music]

46
00:03:53,520 --> 00:04:21,940
we're still looking for a offer for a

47
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:26,770
note taker okay we can start let's start

48
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,060
and we are going to be short of time in

49
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:31,870
this session because we're going to

50
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:33,340
reduce an extra and presentation which

51
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:34,540
we have to skip from the previous

52
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,270
session because there was a lot of

53
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,640
discussion there so timekeeping is going

54
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:42,340
to be important and will remind people

55
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:44,320
of that it may be in your interest to

56
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,479
make sure that your talks allow time for

57
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,860
discussion rather than get cut off

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,790
before they finish so please make sure

59
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:56,890
that you keep the time I'm not well this

60
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,660
is covered by the ietf not well the

61
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:00,490
small print does matter if you haven't

62
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,580
read it including the anti-harassment

63
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,169
and many other useful things that are

64
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,349
written in here please have a look at it

65
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:10,659
and we're gonna get to have to stop

66
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,600
again because we do need a note-taker if

67
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,070
we have no note-taker then we won't be

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,840
able to proceed with any other

69
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,730
discussion with intent during the

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,739
meeting and that would be pretty sad so

71
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:30,430
please can we have a volunteer for a

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:32,380
note-taker Thank You Stuart is somebody

73
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,669
able to sit in Java and just check

74
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,880
whether there's anything come up from

75
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:43,000
Java Thank You Meera we can proceed our

76
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:45,730
agenda for today consists of UDP options

77
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,040
and this is a working group items to it

78
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,870
I just want to make a request since I'm

79
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:52,150
taking notes when you come to the

80
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,220
microphone to speak please say your

81
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,270
first name your last name and if

82
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,690
applicable the company you're

83
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,169
representing because if you don't I will

84
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:01,180
be trying

85
00:05:59,169 --> 00:06:02,650
to work out who you are and then I won't

86
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,210
listen to what you're saying and then it

87
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:06,159
won't be in the notes game I'm for

88
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:07,870
coordination Theresa is the backup not

89
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:11,139
taker so you might want to coordinate

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,060
with each other okay so um thank you

91
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:16,860
ever so much for volunteering to do

92
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:20,860
things and the DC CP multipaths will be

93
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:23,349
presentation written here and again we

94
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,860
need to keep to agenda time so keep keep

95
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,479
moving and l4s will be discussed the

96
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:31,389
three working group drafts will be

97
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,199
presented there will be the issues

98
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,550
discussed from following that and

99
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,860
there's an allocated set of time for

100
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:42,009
that we will use that time please focus

101
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,919
on the issues and SCE will discuss these

102
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,509
two individual drafts will be presented

103
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,049
afterwards and we'll take discussion

104
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:52,930
there so I think these agenda slides are

105
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:54,610
have been overtaken by events to borrow

106
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,110
a phrase no so I believe that the two

107
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,479
drafts we're going to talk about here

108
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:00,789
are the are the Martinez XI draft and

109
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,938
the cheap nasty queueing draft the

110
00:07:00,789 --> 00:07:06,219
Grimes T CPM draft is tomorrow morning's

111
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:08,020
adventure and T C p.m. but it's been

112
00:07:06,219 --> 00:07:10,089
included here on the agenda because if

113
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:11,529
you understand how us SCE works you

114
00:07:10,089 --> 00:07:13,409
really probably got to read that draft

115
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:17,349
for completeness

116
00:07:13,409 --> 00:07:20,438
David is correct and the qci draft will

117
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:22,300
get time and we'll talk briefly about QC

118
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:23,979
and diffserv mainly to bubble up the

119
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,360
discussion there because there are other

120
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,639
things that we'll have to go on before

121
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,550
we take that one forward

122
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,349
you don't talk okay and we're gonna try

123
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:33,849
to see there's normally the last half

124
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,740
hour of the session is these three

125
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,229
drafts now we know we're going to get

126
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:40,270
very very excited with the agenda items

127
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:42,520
have come just before this but at some

128
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:45,008
point we are going to call time to try

129
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,568
to get these folks at least at at least

130
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,919
a little bit of time even though they're

131
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:52,990
not going to get their 15 minutes of

132
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:56,490
fame are the last two drafts of the spin

133
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,199
bit on the diffserv in-band signaling

134
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,479
does anybody else want to try and bash

135
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,069
the agenda apart from the chairs is

136
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:05,068
there anything that we've missed

137
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:24,660
excellent then we shall begin I am

138
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:27,190
proxying for Joel hi I'm Cory um I'm

139
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:31,000
proxying for Joe touch on the UDP

140
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:32,740
options draft and I'm not in this

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,340
wonderful location on the site and in

142
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:40,720
Singapore UDP options is a working group

143
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:43,750
draft it's progressing and so Luke at

144
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,990
the draft please and one of the changes

145
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:50,200
was there was a proposed change of

146
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:54,490
status to BPS rather than experimental

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:57,550
and as ever the chairs have looked at

148
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,440
this but the final decision on the on

149
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,790
the status will come from feedback from

150
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,010
this group and our advice from our ad

151
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,620
but there has been that change so be

152
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:11,140
aware and there were some additions and

153
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,300
these four additions came directly from

154
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,220
the working group meeting last time so

155
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,620
your contributions by our email and at

156
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:22,150
the at the Mike have made a difference

157
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:27,760
and the jaws updated it to reflect the

158
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:29,850
OCS the SES post options must be 0 to

159
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,140
eliminate the idea of a side channel and

160
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,320
extended the format allowing more than

161
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,310
255 by options which allows for padding

162
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,550
top users next slide please David

163
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:40,550
[Music]

164
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,650
there's discussion about pattern versus

165
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:58,910
heart in other words the Paden option

166
00:09:54,650 --> 00:10:03,290
like similar to what we have in ipv6 and

167
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:04,819
whether we need that and Joe told me in

168
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,410
the discussion before we this was

169
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,970
presented that nobody really had

170
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,650
commented on the list after this was

171
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:12,350
discussed in the working group meeting

172
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:14,750
last time so if you're one of the people

173
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:17,540
who thought this was interesting even

174
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:19,610
important then please get back on the

175
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,260
list and comment on it because if George

176
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,890
doesn't get feedback it's Joe's opinion

177
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,990
that nobody really cares that much so if

178
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:29,030
you do care you'll please just speak up

179
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:31,520
there's a fight from a support

180
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:33,500
discussion as well and people thought

181
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,630
that that was really really interesting

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:38,360
and we could divide the option space

183
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,700
numbering perhaps to reflect those with

184
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,070
one number one said maybe the higher

185
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:46,580
numbers were required and the other ones

186
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:48,710
were not but did we really need that

187
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,010
again there wasn't much discussion on a

188
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,870
list after the discussion on the mic so

189
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,819
if we don't get feedback and discussion

190
00:10:53,870 --> 00:11:00,500
there's no way we can draw consensus to

191
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:02,540
add new things to the document the call

192
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,960
for use cases for these is unanswered in

193
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:10,640
other words and as such there was no new

194
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:15,050
text added by Joe next one path forward

195
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,360
and light and Frank integration was

196
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:18,920
going to be added in other words Joe's

197
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:23,420
responding to the request that we got

198
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,870
rid of the light as a separate feature

199
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,849
of UDP options and we simply allowed it

200
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,130
as a way of performing fragmentation so

201
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:33,950
remove the generic liked mechanism on

202
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:35,780
the basis that UDP Lite is only used in

203
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,880
very special deployments and we don't

204
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:40,240
need to support that in the UDP option

205
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,830
space that also could have some

206
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,440
simplification to the document so that

207
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:47,840
might come it responds to several

208
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,490
comments that people have made and that

209
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,330
means also that frag will then depend

210
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:55,750
upon something that's UDP light like

211
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,750
next one please

212
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:03,880
is that the end okay that's the end as

213
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:05,949
you can see Joe has a little bit of work

214
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:09,570
in the pipeline but if you want more

215
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:18,550
work then please comment on the list and

216
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:21,280
any questions some questions

217
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:29,620
oh no any questions on the UDP options

218
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:32,770
work yeah and please use the list and

219
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,360
Joe's not actually attending the ITF

220
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:36,610
which is why I'm standing up proxying

221
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,680
for him so he really needs input from

222
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,640
the list if there is going to be working

223
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,640
group contributions

224
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,949
good morning mark salmon from Deutsche

225
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,990
Telekom and today I want to talk about

226
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:57,210
multi pass DCP I had already the chance

227
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,500
at ICC Archy to present some results

228
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:01,240
some of the strands are also partner of

229
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,990
this presentation so I will skip them

230
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,270
because of time and but I want to focus

231
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:11,590
today a little bit on the traffic

232
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:14,980
updates we did since last time starting

233
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:19,000
with a short introduction with a short

234
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:22,420
recap why we are focusing on multiple

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,790
TCP we think there are multi

236
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:28,209
connectivity architectures already

237
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:30,040
specified or under specification like

238
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:34,420
three TVPA TSSs

239
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:37,060
and also VBF hybrid access which defines

240
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:42,060
multi connectivity between CPEs or

241
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:44,579
mobile phones and carrier networks and

242
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:48,069
we see they have a strong demand on

243
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:50,950
multipath proper call supporting UDP or

244
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:54,820
even IP there's already the multipath

245
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,630
tcp out but can which kinds of hot tcp

246
00:13:54,820 --> 00:14:00,760
but we see an increasing share of

247
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:03,189
European our networks because of the

248
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,830
quick and we think it would be good to

249
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,860
have multiple support for this as well

250
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:13,630
and the specific architectures like ATS

251
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:15,550
protects us we selected the DCC protocol

252
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:19,689
for that purpose because of its

253
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:22,030
unreliable maid nature but it keeps the

254
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:24,850
state and employs negation control what

255
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:30,160
we think is it's very useful so you find

256
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:35,380
some material materials which point this

257
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:39,120
out in detail why D CCP is from our view

258
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:46,990
the right protocol in in slides from ITF

259
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:51,810
104 and 105 I think that is the

260
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:55,060
framework we have in mind so it's mainly

261
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:58,989
relying on a multipass support for D CCP

262
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,280
extended by a multi path framework which

263
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:02,950
more or less means we have virtual

264
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:06,339
network interfaces where we can send IP

265
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:09,460
or UDP traffic in its encapsulated it's

266
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:12,460
transferred over the multi-party CCP and

267
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,990
then exit the virtual network interface

268
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:20,280
and receiver side again so pretty simple

269
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:23,380
there are three crafts related to this

270
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:29,589
and the work which has been done since

271
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:33,250
ITF 105 is mainly related to the multi

272
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:40,180
path DCP trough the the other two crafts

273
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:41,560
are more or less unmodified so in the

274
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,630
next slide I will explain a little bit

275
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:48,489
what has been done in the multi policy

276
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:51,040
CCP protocol we propose also we worked

277
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:53,170
on on implementation and generating

278
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,969
results but that I will more or less

279
00:15:53,170 --> 00:16:01,240
skip today because it was part already

280
00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:03,430
of the RCC achieve presentation one

281
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,660
important thing we also implemented in

282
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,650
the meantime that you can see in the

283
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:09,219
middle of the slide

284
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:11,410
EB are 40 CCP and maybe within the next

285
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,920
year we can also make this open source

286
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:13,920
let's see

287
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:21,700
okay now coming to the extensions we did

288
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,690
through the multi pass tcp draft it's

289
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,700
now

290
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:33,270
version 3 we added a multi-part capable

291
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:35,950
feature to the DC CP and also multi-part

292
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:42,699
option to exchange multi-part or

293
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:45,040
specific information we defined several

294
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:48,070
multiple options for setting up a

295
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,660
multiple TCP connection securely adding

296
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:51,780
or removing sub flows

297
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:54,790
securely and every receiver side

298
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,770
reordering which is one of the main

299
00:16:54,790 --> 00:17:00,130
critical points for an efficient

300
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,530
implementation we think and also giving

301
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,949
passed priority so you can see on the

302
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:10,629
right side which options we have defined

303
00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:13,660
so far and also we defined the handshake

304
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:15,939
procedure I will not go through it in

305
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:19,120
detail it's pretty similar to to

306
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:22,980
multiple TCP we think that in multiple

307
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,448
TCP they were was defined mature

308
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:32,140
handshaking mechanism for multicast

309
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:35,830
so be more or less adopted this okay so

310
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:38,800
that is the part where I usually plan to

311
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:42,820
present some updates on our

312
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:45,340
implementation and results I will go

313
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,830
through it quickly in the past or in

314
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,649
previous time and we already proved that

315
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,250
there's a possibility for seamless hand

316
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:56,020
over keeping IP connectivity when we

317
00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:00,210
switch from one access to the others

318
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:03,940
that you find in the slides from ITF 105

319
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:07,150
we also proved that it makes sense to

320
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:10,810
have a reordering on receiver side again

321
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:14,350
the details you find in the slides for

322
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:16,870
my ITF 105 and what is new now and I

323
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:21,580
already explained that a sec Archy that

324
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:24,300
we made a setup for testing real traffic

325
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:28,030
in that case we tested with YouTube

326
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:30,159
using quick transmission over or through

327
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:35,370
our multi-party CCP's that are be tested

328
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,370
under various path conditions

329
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:42,340
and the results of some of the results

330
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:46,719
you can find here on this slide we

331
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:51,310
proved for example that multipath or our

332
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:54,460
multi Party CCP solution always provide

333
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:57,490
a better performance over single path we

334
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,130
can also deal with change in path

335
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:03,130
characteristics so in this example which

336
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:06,250
we combine two paths with one megabit

337
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:11,890
and we changed on the one one of the

338
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:14,200
party the latencies after 60 seconds and

339
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:16,660
in the results you can see the the blue

340
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:21,550
dots that is single path or one megabit

341
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:29,470
only and all the other results red green

342
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:32,050
and grey that are different modes of our

343
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,590
multi-party CCP's setup using different

344
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:40,810
scheduler using reordering so we have

345
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:42,370
the SRT T that is pure scheduling

346
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:47,020
preferring the path with the lowest

347
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:52,510
latency and then we had two scenarios

348
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:55,270
with fixed round-robin a fixed ratio

349
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:58,660
schedule a sorry and it was an 80/20

350
00:19:55,270 --> 00:20:01,090
setup and one that if the active with

351
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,250
reordering and the passive without

352
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:07,270
reordering and we see a clear benefit of

353
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:10,120
having multi-party CCP with active

354
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:13,600
reordering on receiver side over all the

355
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,739
other scenarios we tested in future we

356
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,830
plan to extend this test with our

357
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:23,770
brand-new BB our implementation because

358
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:29,800
all the tests we did so far we're

359
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:32,410
relying on the CCI d2 and we think with

360
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,350
BB our we have some some benefits over

361
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:39,940
CCID too but I think that people see

362
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:41,620
next time conclusion the next steps so

363
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:44,440
our prototype implementation and

364
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,409
simulations we did so far show very good

365
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,000
shows very good first results according

366
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:49,960
to the demands of steering switching and

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,080
splitting or three chip

368
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,899
yes and hybrid exist defined at the

369
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:58,389
proton forum the key components we

370
00:20:55,899 --> 00:21:00,459
identified for efficient multi-part is

371
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:04,360
scheduling congestion control and

372
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:07,899
reordering we see a possible

373
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,539
interference between the congestion

374
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:13,779
control employed in the multiple TCP

375
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:16,210
setup and congestion control of

376
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:20,409
piggyback traffic that we addressed this

377
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:23,080
time at OCC Archie so I I will start

378
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:25,360
some discussions on that on the mailing

379
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:27,730
list soon we have now a PBR

380
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,299
implementation inside the Linux kernel

381
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:35,169
for DC CP available and we expect very

382
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:40,408
good results using DB r instead of CCID

383
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:42,760
to related to to multi pass purposes

384
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:46,840
several discussions with operators and

385
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,100
vendors have been initiated now in in

386
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,389
the context of 3gpp standardization

387
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:57,908
where we may very clear that we believe

388
00:21:54,390 --> 00:22:02,710
that it requires multiple support for

389
00:21:57,909 --> 00:22:04,779
the increasing UDP share that does not

390
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:06,460
mean that it ends up in a multi-party

391
00:22:04,779 --> 00:22:09,340
ccp's that have it could also be some

392
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:11,529
something else but at least to make the

393
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,289
ITF community aware that there is

394
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:16,149
something needed for that reason I think

395
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:17,950
the multiple CCP is a very good thing

396
00:22:16,149 --> 00:22:19,989
and at least the algorithm for

397
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:24,220
scheduling and and reordering could also

398
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:26,260
be used in any other protocol in case

399
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:28,210
you want to support us we want to

400
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,669
contribute you find all the related

401
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:39,520
multiple TCP troughs at github thank you

402
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:44,679
questions bless Katie did you implement

403
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,600
VB our version one yes okay then you

404
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:52,360
should also consider sending multiple

405
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:55,299
MPT CCP flows at the same time because

406
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:58,449
then the PBR model more or less breaks

407
00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:02,320
and this will at least double your RTT

408
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:03,490
and so on so either do it with version 2

409
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,550
or

410
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:08,380
yeah at least consider that bad things

411
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:11,590
may happen in case you have small

412
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:14,470
buffers maybe not in your case but yeah

413
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:16,840
yeah thank you for this comment so that

414
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:19,420
was a force a first step for us to

415
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:22,449
overcome the limitations of CCID - and

416
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,400
think even with the BB our version 1 we

417
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:29,980
can do it better better than with DC ID

418
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:33,190
- however we also consider PBR V 2 in a

419
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:35,860
following step and also maybe couple

420
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:37,660
congestion control my point is that I

421
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:42,159
expect very good results if you have

422
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:44,559
only one MPD CCP flow with BB arm that

423
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,750
works nicely yeah oh yeah and the model

424
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:53,139
fits but God as soon as you have

425
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:54,790
multiple flows yeah you have - yes I but

426
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,230
you have to see here we have a very

427
00:23:54,790 --> 00:24:02,770
dedicated focus on multi connectivity

428
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:06,490
between customer devices and carrier

429
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:09,100
network maybe that then this is not an

430
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:14,320
issue but we have to consider this thank

431
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:15,969
you Andrew McGregor firstly I wouldn't

432
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,389
quite characterize the way PPA goes

433
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:21,820
wrong is in exactly that way but the

434
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:23,200
point remains it does and strange things

435
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,220
happen with small numbers of flows and

436
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:33,059
certain certain networks so yeah it

437
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:36,280
it'll be a bit weird NB b r2 is better I

438
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:38,530
think this is valuable work there are

439
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,710
plenty of places where something like

440
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:43,780
this could be useful so yeah okay thank

441
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:46,030
you okay we'd like to get more

442
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:47,559
discussion of this going on the list and

443
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:49,990
but we'll move on to the next

444
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:51,639
presentation I'm gonna inject one last

445
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,980
closing comments as I'm sitting up here

446
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:56,410
I want to strongly encourage the work on

447
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:59,290
what is referred to as as congestion of

448
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:01,809
piggyback traffic this phenomenon where

449
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:03,909
we see stacked or nested congestion

450
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,520
control loops is turning up in multiple

451
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:08,320
areas of the IETF and some progress and

452
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:11,639
figuring out what's safe and what isn't

453
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,639
will be very helpful

454
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:37,909
but come again just start Bob tell us

455
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:42,139
about your your three l4s drops young

456
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:45,110
Griff items okay right

457
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:49,570
it's the names of three drafts to be

458
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:52,310
honest this talk is more about status of

459
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,889
what's been going on and implementation

460
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,780
and things like that than the drafts but

461
00:25:54,890 --> 00:26:05,900
there is a fair bit about the drafts

462
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:11,510
next there you go okay so a recap of

463
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:13,760
what l4s is that was a different meeting

464
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:16,340
so it's ultra-low queuing delay for all

465
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:18,050
the internet applications and including

466
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,149
capacity seeking ones so that means you

467
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:24,440
can have high throughput and very low

468
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:27,290
delay and the trick is to use congestion

469
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:30,310
control with small teeth what up shallow

470
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:34,730
queuing delay means is around a

471
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:37,159
millisecond but also it's very important

472
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,450
to get there the high percentiles low so

473
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,760
it's got to be consistent for real-time

474
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,280
applications because otherwise if some

475
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,030
packets are late they buffer to the to

476
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,770
the longest not the shortest and without

477
00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:51,830
looking at all the data in here this was

478
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:58,160
a large number of short flows and long

479
00:26:51,830 --> 00:27:02,570
flows and still getting very low queuing

480
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:03,860
day delay but I won't go into the exact

481
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,370
details because they've got a lot more

482
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,370
to do today

483
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:15,710
and the final introductory recap slide

484
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:17,240
is that those scalable congestion

485
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,820
controls that allow you to get that low

486
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:23,170
delay they also appear to be very

487
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:27,760
aggressive to a TCP friendly flow if

488
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:27,760
they're in an ACN queue together

489
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:35,220
so but if if they're in a non easy NQ

490
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:39,418
that's fine because you get a loss and

491
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:42,259
and the you can deal with it but we've

492
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:45,450
got a transition mechanism so that this

493
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:47,580
new traffic can be isolated in another

494
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:50,009
queue either a dual queue system has

495
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,658
drawn there or a per flowing queue which

496
00:27:50,009 --> 00:27:57,929
I didn't draw cuz I ain't got that much

497
00:27:51,659 --> 00:28:02,129
pencil and the other transition

498
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:04,049
mechanism is a packet identifier to be

499
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:08,849
able to isolate these flows in this dual

500
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:11,908
queue system because you can't do it

501
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:14,099
with the flow IDs when you're trying to

502
00:28:11,909 --> 00:28:15,419
just do it for two we don't want to do

503
00:28:14,099 --> 00:28:19,189
it for flow IDs because you might want

504
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:22,169
to do in encrypted VPNs and things and

505
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:24,450
finally the picture shows they're

506
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:29,519
they're transitions for the UCAN code

507
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:34,529
point we're proposing to use for this

508
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,979
solution all right and I've now got

509
00:28:34,529 --> 00:28:41,159
three slides on four slides on

510
00:28:36,979 --> 00:28:45,359
implementation status low-latency DOCSIS

511
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:49,039
first or there was a working group

512
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,039
formed on this you knocked over 17

513
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:57,299
Greg's done this useful slide for me I

514
00:28:52,590 --> 00:29:00,090
no longer consult for cable labs 89

515
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:03,418
individuals representing those companies

516
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:08,759
there I won't read them all out you can

517
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:10,919
see them on the screen so that's I don't

518
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:17,070
know something like 20 companies is it

519
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:22,409
very I mean including the 12 yeah more

520
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:28,649
than 20 yeah integrated the offer SQL

521
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:30,840
queue into the DOCSIS 3.1 Mac and also

522
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:32,908
develop two concepts in fact if you if

523
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,109
you go to these slides online there are

524
00:29:32,909 --> 00:29:38,730
links for things like the non queue

525
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,740
building traffic and the queue

526
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:44,429
protection algorithm

527
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,890
and all the features are managed to be

528
00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,630
implemented by a firmware update so no

529
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:53,700
hardware updates to cable modems so it

530
00:29:48,630 --> 00:30:00,330
can all be installed on existing modems

531
00:29:53,700 --> 00:30:02,909
and the news this time around there's

532
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,610
been this respects we published in

533
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:13,789
January we told you that and they've

534
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:17,850
been while you've been interrupted and

535
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:21,720
chickens select your chickens a good

536
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:24,570
luck doing that over ipv6 and the when

537
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,460
you when you say that this work has gone

538
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:28,289
on DOCSIS did they do it based on this

539
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:30,270
spec that we have here at the idea and

540
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:31,879
do they have any feedback on whether

541
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:34,440
that was implementable

542
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:36,419
in other words has it helped you or

543
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:39,510
feedback has been put on the list and

544
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,419
that's why you know the the people who

545
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:45,450
were doing it

546
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:48,000
don't pull in someone else they put

547
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,090
their list of changes they needed in it

548
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,309
and some of it was fed through me

549
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:55,860
directly and I posted it on the list so

550
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:58,230
in other words it has influenced the RFC

551
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,678
to be if there is one yeah and in the

552
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,409
dachsies spec it is there's the dual qi

553
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:12,960
TF spec is a normative requirement for

554
00:31:04,409 --> 00:31:16,559
that and so that so the news right now

555
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,350
is that in September that was the first

556
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,690
interrupts event and t2 cable modem

557
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:24,000
vendors had already produced the

558
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:27,980
implementation just to be clear there

559
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,500
are only two cable modem silicon vendors

560
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:34,789
were implementers and at that time there

561
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,500
was one cmts

562
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:41,610
implementer and then we just had another

563
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,529
interrupt with two of each to cable

564
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:48,270
modem to cmts

565
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:52,230
and in DOCSIS with for the low latency

566
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:53,620
DOCSIS the upstream service relies

567
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,120
partly

568
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:00,070
on the cmts so you need both to have it

569
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:03,520
employed for it to work was in the

570
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,939
downstream just the cmts is all that's

571
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:11,950
needed and three more events planned any

572
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:18,429
more to say on that great no good so the

573
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:22,900
next update is that the nokia nokia have

574
00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:29,320
implemented a Wi-Fi product with l4s in

575
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:34,360
the in the stack and that is due for

576
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,178
product in q1 2020 they've got other

577
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:39,100
devices planned later around that idea

578
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,470
it uses the dual pi/2 technology which

579
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:45,070
is in one of the appendices of the your

580
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:49,360
Q document and that was demonstrated at

581
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:55,210
broadband World Forum just a few weeks

582
00:32:49,360 --> 00:33:00,250
ago and Nokia one you to know that if

583
00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:03,120
you want to have some trials on this and

584
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:06,100
I hope it's okay to advertise this

585
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,809
contact there this unit Nokia home

586
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:13,678
differs for home business unit and

587
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:17,740
there's a URL and the third development

588
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,000
actually I was hoping I might get an

589
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:22,270
email on this because I think the

590
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,610
meeting has just finished and so I don't

591
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:28,899
know what the outcome is

592
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:31,330
but the 3gpp a meeting in Reno in Nevada

593
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:36,580
at the moment or they've just finished

594
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:42,279
and there was a proposal to include l4s

595
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:44,949
support in the 5g system architecture in

596
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:46,630
this essay to working group from and the

597
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:52,440
proposal was to Ericsson sprint Google

598
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:54,250
Nokia and AT&T and Vodafone for

599
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,169
enhancements for advanced interactive

600
00:33:54,250 --> 00:34:00,820
services AIS and that included again a

601
00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:01,960
requirement for both low latency and

602
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:06,520
high throughput for those sort of

603
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,280
applications so that there's been a

604
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:09,800
number of attend

605
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,900
to get ecn supported in the system

606
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,169
architecture and we're hoping that this

607
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,790
one will succeed there's no guarantee it

608
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:24,069
will there's a hell of a lot of things

609
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:24,070
trying to get into 3gpp but we shall see

610
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:35,750
two minutes right and these are all the

611
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:38,630
open source the one that additional this

612
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:40,340
time is the NS three implementation has

613
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:41,690
now been open sourced I've been

614
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:45,320
promising that for quite a time and it's

615
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:49,580
finally happened and test suite around

616
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:55,760
it most of the other ones was BB our v2

617
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:57,799
is coming along the alpha release and I

618
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,570
think all the other ones have been there

619
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,680
already but they're obviously being

620
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:05,780
updated all the time

621
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:08,210
and I showed this on Monday so I'll skip

622
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:10,460
very quickly through it this is stages

623
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:14,480
against the product requirements as it

624
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:16,640
was in July and this is as it is now and

625
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,550
you'll see it's nearly all greening

626
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,859
apart from the Rd T dependence one the

627
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:23,720
one I showed on Monday actually included

628
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,250
bbr but with we've done it just for one

629
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,750
implementation the the reference

630
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:29,360
implementation here so one of them is

631
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:34,540
still orange or no yellow I suppose

632
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:37,010
that's cool so we're nearly there

633
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:43,520
but there's still a lot more work to do

634
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:48,160
and but I think this shows that the

635
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:52,160
requirements are meetable that's a word

636
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,129
I've got one slide on sv SCE vs. l4s I

637
00:35:52,160 --> 00:36:03,109
know it's been plenty of discussion of

638
00:35:55,130 --> 00:36:06,710
this but I've got the mic yeah so that's

639
00:36:03,110 --> 00:36:08,890
the - Co point schemes along the top to

640
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,390
show the difference and I just wanted to

641
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:15,670
sort of put the main issues there that

642
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:18,650
the primary issue with l4s is that

643
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:21,110
scaleable flows with dominate classic

644
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:25,090
flows in a classic EC naq

645
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:29,000
if you didn't have FQ or some form of

646
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:32,020
flow queueing with the condition that

647
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,580
such things are deployed somewhere and

648
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:37,880
if the fallback scheme that we've

649
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:43,029
developed doesn't work and I'm going to

650
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:43,030
talk about that in the issues time

651
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:52,340
whereas the primary issue with a CTE I

652
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:56,420
think is similar in that you per micro

653
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:58,670
flow classification is really needed and

654
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:03,290
if you don't have it I don't think it's

655
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:05,870
been shown that that classic won't

656
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:10,940
dominate SCE and so I characterize these

657
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:13,580
two issues as one is that l4s sort of

658
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:15,080
dominates the past or that somewhere

659
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:18,560
there may be something it dominates

660
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:21,350
where as I see I can get by design gets

661
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:25,610
dominated for all time in the future and

662
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:28,430
that's why I would have chosen l4s if

663
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:30,340
I'd have seen these two together when we

664
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:36,160
had all the other issues that we were

665
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:36,160
considering about tunneling and and and

666
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,990
lower layers and all the rest of it to

667
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:48,290
determine which which code point to use

668
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:50,270
or which scheme to use that was wasn't

669
00:37:48,290 --> 00:38:00,370
it oh yeah the the drafts there was

670
00:37:50,270 --> 00:38:04,160
three updates okay questions on the

671
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:13,370
drafts of presentation but not on issues

672
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:16,160
that I'm going to get okay um I have no

673
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:18,770
idea what we're doing next David can you

674
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,560
come to the mic and tell me which

675
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,410
buttons to press it to bring whatever we

676
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:28,410
need to do to help

677
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:28,410
[Laughter]

678
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:40,160
and depends on where we are now I've

679
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:44,180
just got a bunch of PCs to look up or

680
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:47,480
doing other things here so my agenda

681
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,960
says yes you sit down and we have was in

682
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,840
charge which means I have David helping

683
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,400
me get was in charge so where's

684
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,070
hopefully wise is there I pressed the

685
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:01,900
red button was appears can I relay

686
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,900
something from Jabra quickly because yes

687
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:08,360
okay so Ingham up with some Java and he

688
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:10,250
said reporting back from the 3gpp the

689
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:12,080
sa-2 contribution was just discussed and

690
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:15,490
we know the reception was overall

691
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:18,710
positive and some additional proponents

692
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:20,870
with some pushback it's currently

693
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:22,940
unclear which timeframe Ellis for

694
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:24,950
support will be added in standards we

695
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:27,320
will have to wait for debriefing after

696
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:30,770
next week after the meeting was mo

697
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:32,710
deters what was very useful thank you

698
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:35,690
for bringing that so quickly to us and

699
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:38,740
Bob I think you probably can sit down or

700
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:41,360
stand at the mic and help yeah laughter

701
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:44,270
yeah this is this is David I've got to

702
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:46,880
sit down the audience because apparently

703
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:48,620
I'm her Majesty's loyal opposition on

704
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,030
this one or like this I'm hoping we get

705
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,620
the point where loyal is more important

706
00:39:50,030 --> 00:40:03,680
than our position in that bit in that

707
00:39:51,620 --> 00:40:05,660
term fine okay and I have no idea how I

708
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:08,060
think I hand over to Wes and see if we

709
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:10,660
can actually have a remote chair where's

710
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:17,440
that you there yeah can you hear me

711
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:17,440
excellent we can hear you great okay

712
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:27,200
okay you can see the slides with yes I

713
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:31,190
can yeah so sorry I can't beat her but I

714
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:35,180
am the document shepherd for the 300

715
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:40,910
forest drafts that bob was discussing

716
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:43,490
and according to the Charter we're going

717
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:46,430
to be trying to finish these in

718
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:50,509
of this year so we're a few months

719
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:53,629
behind and we knew that this was going

720
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:55,670
to happen but we would like to

721
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:59,840
eventually get to a working group last

722
00:40:55,670 --> 00:41:04,070
call and so we wanted to take some time

723
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:07,310
in the meeting to talk about criteria

724
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:10,190
for sort of what it takes to publish

725
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:15,230
experimental RFC's on congestion control

726
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:17,690
in the IETF and what we're doing to work

727
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:18,980
all the issues to closure in the

728
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:22,550
documents so that we can get to a

729
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:28,220
working group last call and hopefully do

730
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:31,250
it successfully and and wrap these up so

731
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:34,040
starting off you know it's important

732
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:37,940
we're not doing l4s for proposed

733
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,009
standard or standards track were we're

734
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:47,530
specifically targeting informational and

735
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:51,290
experimental RFC's is plenty of RFC's

736
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:54,020
exists similar this already so this is

737
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:55,900
not like we're blazing a new trail or

738
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:59,360
anything there are

739
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:01,430
rfcs we can look at for sort of level

740
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:07,340
setting guidance on what the

741
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:09,770
expectations should be RFC 5:03 3 was

742
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:15,110
brought up on the mailing list recently

743
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:19,780
it was a really good thing it sort of

744
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:27,580
lays out things that congestion control

745
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:33,440
specs should be assessed against and in

746
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:37,549
fact the DC tcp RFC has a good example

747
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:41,300
of going point by point through the

748
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:44,510
items in five zero three three and sort

749
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:49,400
of stating why or what's been done in

750
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:51,590
terms of DC tcp with regard to them and

751
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:55,550
I wanted to mention Quick Start as

752
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:56,800
another example we have experimental RFC

753
00:42:55,550 --> 00:43:00,670
on congestion control

754
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:04,120
it's particularly applicable because it

755
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:06,850
involves both in network components so

756
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:09,250
in quick start the routers are signaling

757
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:13,170
some information about how fast the flow

758
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:17,470
can go and it also has an host behaviors

759
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:21,400
too and so l4s is a little bit of an odd

760
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:24,299
thing because it's the drafts that we're

761
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:28,510
working on in TS bwg right now are

762
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:31,540
primarily the in network behaviors and

763
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:34,290
then there are some requirements the the

764
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:36,730
prague tcp prague requirements that

765
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:39,040
flows there using the elf forest idea

766
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:43,120
are supposed to meet but we're not

767
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:46,230
actually working out and the drafts that

768
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:49,839
describe a protocol doing all this stuff

769
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:55,780
at the moment so separating TCP Prague

770
00:43:49,840 --> 00:44:00,370
from l4s a little bit is different but

771
00:43:55,780 --> 00:44:03,490
between this working QuickStart in

772
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:05,319
essence though the goal of doing

773
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:10,509
experimental RFC's on congestion control

774
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:13,930
is always to not break the internet so

775
00:44:10,510 --> 00:44:15,490
you know we're we worked the RFC s and

776
00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,759
there are some open issues and questions

777
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:21,609
usually in in these things and that's

778
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:24,460
why we're going for experimental rather

779
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:27,490
than proposed standard but so it's

780
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:31,270
important that we have consensus and

781
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:32,620
there are things that are in place in

782
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,140
the RFC's

783
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:40,240
that make us feel like we're not going

784
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:42,220
to break the internet um so if the

785
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:44,890
experiment goes badly you know there's

786
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,589
there's a mechanisms that are available

787
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:51,940
to operators and system ends to see this

788
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:54,010
going badly and put the brakes on it we

789
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:56,040
need to maybe do a little bit more work

790
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,830
on that in the current drafts I think

791
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,930
but this is the point of doing the work

792
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:05,410
out in the open in the IETF the way

793
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:07,450
we're doing it there have been many

794
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:10,420
things not going in the ITF that went

795
00:45:07,450 --> 00:45:13,660
badly so like do you old

796
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,540
bittorrent old RealPlayer are a couple

797
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:18,160
of examples people might remember word

798
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:19,990
that's not going to happen here because

799
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:24,819
we're doing things in the ITF and we're

800
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:28,120
going to make sure that this is avoidant

801
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:30,850
so I go to the next chart and question

802
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:36,460
from Jake yeah Jake :

803
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:39,790
so do we have any kind of what normative

804
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:41,800
or you know prior consensus on what the

805
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:44,140
word break here it means because I think

806
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,720
yeah I think it will probably find easy

807
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,970
consensus that this will not cause

808
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:50,589
congestion collapse if that's the

809
00:45:48,970 --> 00:45:52,720
definition of break but I'm not sure

810
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:56,680
you'll find consensus that like for

811
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,180
example that is some of the tests have

812
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,379
brought up right the you know the the

813
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,819
existing deployment of like gaming

814
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:06,040
routers that promise to provide low

815
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:09,130
latency already and do so through these

816
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,350
fake um some of these there's a pretty

817
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:14,470
strong reason to believe in some cases

818
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:19,480
that that some of the observed l4s

819
00:46:14,470 --> 00:46:22,810
behaviors may introduce like persistent

820
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:24,790
and frequent queuing delay to these

821
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:26,799
systems that were specifically designed

822
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:28,930
to try to avoid such things right so

823
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:31,000
this is the kind of like does that count

824
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:35,190
as breaking or not so that's where the

825
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:37,630
like did you you know did you have the

826
00:46:35,190 --> 00:46:40,870
ability to observe what was going on

827
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,430
that with the l4s experiment and that

828
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:44,650
that was the cause of the breakage and

829
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:48,009
then easily turn it off then you could

830
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:52,090
say yeah there was a temporary problem

831
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:53,950
and didn't break or not because someone

832
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:55,960
could manage the problem yeah yeah I

833
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:58,569
have no objection to like trying that

834
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,340
once and then you know checking with the

835
00:46:58,570 --> 00:47:04,450
gaming or hiding owners if that's the

836
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:08,620
plan but yeah I guess I'd like to see

837
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:11,020
kind of what break means here before you

838
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:12,190
know there's no or about breaking when

839
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:18,090
you learn that trick

840
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:21,670
thank you me remark me a cool event so

841
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:23,980
my understanding was

842
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,690
in this group we rather specify

843
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,250
requirements for congestion control and

844
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:29,049
then the extra congestion control work

845
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:31,869
would potentially go to the group that

846
00:47:29,049 --> 00:47:34,420
also cares about the protocol so okay

847
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:36,220
you're nodding that's great but that

848
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:38,650
also means like breaking the internet is

849
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,390
not like the big issue here because like

850
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:52,589
the requirements itself would not break

851
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:52,589
the internet I hope next slide then yeah

852
00:47:56,490 --> 00:48:01,839
trying to make progress towards working

853
00:47:58,569 --> 00:48:04,150
group last fall so toward that end at

854
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,299
the last IDF meeting we discussed a

855
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:13,290
number of individual issues we're trying

856
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:18,759
to tease out from email threads and I

857
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:21,849
put all the into the IETF track tool and

858
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:26,650
the URL here you can through on your

859
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:29,799
computers and go visit but one thing to

860
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:32,349
keep in mind is we want to the main

861
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:34,869
discussion on the mailing list not go

862
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:38,770
back and forth in the trek tool with

863
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:41,049
comments so it's the intention is to use

864
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:42,670
the tool to record like the main status

865
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:45,280
and then when there are a bunch of

866
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:48,150
webpages and papers and things that we

867
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:51,309
want to refer to are quite - towards

868
00:48:48,150 --> 00:48:55,150
closure or progress on the issues we'll

869
00:48:51,309 --> 00:49:00,400
do that in the tracker but don't go back

870
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:04,240
and forth there use the mailing list and

871
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,040
then don't know the next page I have

872
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,709
sort of a stoplight chart that I wanted

873
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:12,099
to get out to the loop which is my

874
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:14,049
interpretation of the status that each

875
00:49:12,099 --> 00:49:17,740
of the issues is that at the moment

876
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:21,579
and whether or not we look like we're

877
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:26,589
about a document revision away from

878
00:49:21,579 --> 00:49:33,010
being ready for workgroup platform and

879
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:35,230
so like and for this meeting start

880
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:37,290
closing because you in track

881
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:42,880
there are some that were obtaining

882
00:49:37,290 --> 00:49:45,430
enough agreement on that sufficient work

883
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,750
and other sufficient I got it if it's

884
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:55,569
made that we don't fix you in public 18

885
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:58,450
anymore it's not indicating that every

886
00:49:55,570 --> 00:50:00,490
problem is solved and that this is a

887
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:04,390
perfect protocol for all pieces on the

888
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:07,709
internet it's indicating that it looks

889
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:12,450
like we've met the criteria for

890
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:15,970
experimental arms these basically and

891
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:21,040
it's just because I think through in

892
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:23,890
closing issue that we never again it's

893
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,990
still perfectly valid to bring a you

894
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:29,890
know your request call at any time on

895
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:32,979
the mailing list or in any other venue

896
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:35,710
it's just I make something because it

897
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:39,329
looks like we're trending toward being

898
00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:42,550
good and then I wanted to say is

899
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:44,050
co-chair and Shepherd this is a little

900
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:46,240
bit confusing at the moment because

901
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:48,130
we're talking about the elf forest

902
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:51,419
experiment and it's cues of the east of

903
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:54,730
t1 code point and we may have another

904
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:57,819
set of specs using either t1 code point

905
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:59,920
and we discussed both area directors

906
00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:06,839
we're not planning on like holding up

907
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:06,839
for us publication well that other specs

908
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:14,980
if it comes to will have to figure out

909
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:22,589
how to make coexist we're not going to

910
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:25,540
block L for us question from Jake or not

911
00:51:22,589 --> 00:51:28,920
you know just a sorry Jake Island again

912
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:33,730
just a quick clarification about the

913
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:37,150
back and forth on the on the on the

914
00:51:33,730 --> 00:51:38,890
issues lesson so I thought part of the

915
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:40,300
point of the issues list was that things

916
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:44,770
were getting dropped in these sort of

917
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:48,220
luminous email threads and that the the

918
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:53,109
goal was to capture the main

919
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:58,149
to be to be tracked with the issue

920
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:59,680
itself so I just although I am totally

921
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:02,079
in agreement that we do not want

922
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:07,180
circular arguments on these threads and

923
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,800
to make them also equally useless the I

924
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:12,190
just want to make sure that it is

925
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:17,200
correct that the main key points should

926
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:19,000
be captured in the in the very helpful

927
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,950
people have been adding things I

928
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,960
actually intended to add some things

929
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:25,348
myself and then I'd visit an issue and I

930
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,240
saw Oh some people have already added

931
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:30,730
extra stuff to that it's been very

932
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,310
helpful what people have done there I

933
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:34,869
just wanted to make sure that if

934
00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:37,119
everyone in the room starts clicking

935
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:44,290
through that we don't all feel the need

936
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:47,380
to add our two cents to the I think the

937
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:50,170
intention is that the chairs or

938
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:53,140
particularly wires tries to make sure

939
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:55,869
the correct things don't go missing so

940
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:58,598
we put them in the tracker and isn't

941
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:00,700
like a discussion github but this is a

942
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:04,300
step towards that so we just don't lose

943
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:06,040
stuff yeah the idea is that like as we

944
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:08,829
go towards a working group last fall if

945
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:10,390
you wanted to look up how it looks like

946
00:53:08,829 --> 00:53:13,960
an issue was dealt with there would be a

947
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:16,470
lot of links and information there to

948
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,470
help with that

949
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:22,660
so you have these this is my stoplight

950
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,770
chart on the issues and it's again my

951
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:27,879
own thoughts about whether we're about

952
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:33,089
green means were about a document

953
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:36,310
revision away and from what I could tell

954
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:40,240
yellow means sort of like I really don't

955
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:43,060
know if we're making progress and red I

956
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:49,118
was sort of it didn't look to me like we

957
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:50,828
had made progress so I don't know if

958
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:55,960
it's readable in the room it's barely

959
00:53:50,829 --> 00:53:57,339
legible through me deco but I want to

960
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:59,950
get this out there to the working group

961
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:02,140
because at least summarizes but I'm

962
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,819
seeing

963
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,500
and I didn't really want to talk about

964
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,910
it a whole lot in detail because I

965
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:13,690
wanted to give Bob time to talk about

966
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:15,670
issues 16 17 18 and 19 in the room but

967
00:54:13,690 --> 00:54:24,580
you're certainly free to talk about it

968
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:26,230
with me or with the working group the

969
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:27,850
one thing I think is worth noting is

970
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,060
that a lot of the issues seem like

971
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:35,440
they're pointing to number 16 now like

972
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:38,850
the classic I can interaction that seems

973
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:42,670
to be sort of a crucial issue that

974
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:44,380
several others hinge upon so I think

975
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:47,470
when Bob's talking about that today we

976
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:52,360
want to see if that's going in a good

977
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:53,859
direction okay so notice the point when

978
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,660
we're going to discuss issues just

979
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:57,010
before we do to everybody signed the

980
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,129
blue sheets if y'all signed the blue

981
00:54:57,010 --> 00:55:03,010
sheet we put your hand in there

982
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:05,920
okay can we find the blue shapes thank

983
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:08,590
you let's carry on look so we're going

984
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:13,620
to discuss you sixteen was if anybody

985
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:13,620
would yeah or give it to Bob to discuss

986
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:35,230
well I need I need David Bucky we're

987
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:39,900
doing slide changes yeah right start

988
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,900
going will get sites when we get David

989
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:55,479
we reach as doing three jobs in the 5k

990
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:56,980
we just presented but you should say

991
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,800
something anyway because you've only got

992
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,390
a small number of minutes yeah the first

993
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:04,360
slide you're gonna see it will be a

994
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:06,190
slide that we or a picture that was in

995
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:10,660
the report and I think we've shown it

996
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:13,530
before which is the maximum or the the

997
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:15,379
characterizing the difference in rates

998
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:25,039
between a cubic

999
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:28,819
DZ TCP flow indifferent in in this case

1000
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:31,670
a PI squared iqm both of them with ACN

1001
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,779
capable if one of them wasn't easy in

1002
00:56:31,670 --> 00:56:37,369
cable that wouldn't be a problem at all

1003
00:56:32,779 --> 00:56:42,890
because there will be loss and these TCP

1004
00:56:37,369 --> 00:56:46,900
responds to loss as if it's reno so this

1005
00:56:42,890 --> 00:56:53,390
shows something like between 4 and 16

1006
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:56,529
times fairness and it's difficult to

1007
00:56:53,390 --> 00:57:00,410
know whether that's acceptable or not

1008
00:56:56,529 --> 00:57:02,569
and it sort of depends whether this is

1009
00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:05,319
happening like all over the internet or

1010
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:07,940
in one or two corners the internet maybe

1011
00:57:05,319 --> 00:57:10,519
yes it's still a pain for that person

1012
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,019
it's happening too but it's also only

1013
00:57:10,519 --> 00:57:14,058
happening when two long-running flows

1014
00:57:12,019 --> 00:57:17,328
are going together and they're also two

1015
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:19,910
different flows so you know it's it's

1016
00:57:17,329 --> 00:57:23,779
it's not good but it's it's it's not

1017
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:29,740
starvation they're both stable they both

1018
00:57:23,779 --> 00:57:33,230
proceed and also the other interesting

1019
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:35,839
fact about this is that as the capacity

1020
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:40,250
for each flow gets smaller or as there's

1021
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:46,640
more flows the capacity per flow gets

1022
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:51,859
smaller they get more equal so yeah it's

1023
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:53,660
it's not good but it's um whether we

1024
00:57:51,859 --> 00:57:58,759
live it to the floor to decide whether

1025
00:57:53,660 --> 00:58:05,149
it's acceptable yep is there any

1026
00:57:58,759 --> 00:58:10,039
comments come to the mic and remote

1027
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:14,630
Gregor parsley that's not great but it's

1028
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:16,519
not catastrophic either yeah it's given

1029
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:18,650
the fraction of flows out there that are

1030
00:58:16,519 --> 00:58:20,899
actually that long-running it's almost

1031
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:23,480
like hey classic has just turned into

1032
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:26,079
our list and based if it transport oh

1033
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,079
well

1034
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:33,200
jquan the ones on the left there is that

1035
00:58:31,370 --> 00:58:34,700
not indicating starvation for some

1036
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,669
portion of the flows it goes all the way

1037
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:42,080
to the bottom of the log scale the the

1038
00:58:37,670 --> 00:58:44,780
line is the mean that little tick tick

1039
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:49,220
is the mean and that's the first and 99%

1040
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:54,770
are right so the bottom end of the 99th

1041
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:56,270
percentile goes down below 1% of the of

1042
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:57,590
the normalized flow rate for the

1043
00:58:56,270 --> 00:59:00,460
competing flow is that correct and that

1044
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:05,420
that's that's samples taken every second

1045
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:07,780
not not whole flow length is its so okay

1046
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:10,160
so the mean represents the entire flow

1047
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:12,620
now the mean represents the mean of all

1048
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,629
the seconds of all the samples okay so

1049
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:18,740
we don't really know whether the it's

1050
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:20,660
only where where space is left that okay

1051
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:22,669
this might be her further examination um

1052
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:25,899
the other one I wanted to mention was

1053
00:59:22,670 --> 00:59:31,070
that I thought the guidelines from 2914

1054
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:33,110
suggested that fairness a goal for you

1055
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:35,390
know different ideas was within an order

1056
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:37,520
of magnitude some of these data points

1057
00:59:35,390 --> 00:59:45,620
across the line but you know stuff them

1058
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:47,900
don't yeah anyone else please come to

1059
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:49,850
the mic if you do have a pinyons we just

1060
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:51,260
like to use some of this time just to at

1061
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:57,230
least talk about it if it is an issue

1062
00:59:51,260 --> 01:00:01,790
still Marku coil so this is when digi

1063
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:04,730
TCP and cubic is competing on okay so do

1064
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:07,660
you have the resource there same number

1065
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:13,580
of Cuba for you big flows are just alone

1066
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:16,549
without DC TCP so that is what you

1067
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:19,040
should compare to the results in these

1068
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:22,820
slides for cubic to see better

1069
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:25,850
there is ha for cubic yeah I didn't

1070
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:27,410
understand how many files how many cubic

1071
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:30,549
relatives I just took whatever number

1072
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:34,009
whatever number let's say you have a

1073
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:36,080
cubical flows and then you replace four

1074
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:39,650
of them to be dctp

1075
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:41,690
and now with this set up you compare the

1076
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:45,049
cubic results

1077
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:47,710
did a big only case right to see whether

1078
01:00:45,049 --> 01:00:52,220
there's any harm

1079
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:54,289
one assumes that in under under equal

1080
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:56,180
conditions because all these ones are

1081
01:00:54,289 --> 01:00:58,549
equal round trip times they're only

1082
01:00:56,180 --> 01:01:00,379
comparing the same round-trip times it's

1083
01:00:58,549 --> 01:01:04,910
like the same setup staring the same

1084
01:01:00,380 --> 01:01:08,809
link this base our teeth eat same link

1085
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:12,020
yeah yeah so and it's the same make um

1086
01:01:08,809 --> 01:01:15,260
same queue so if there were two and

1087
01:01:12,020 --> 01:01:17,119
these are just one one against one so if

1088
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:19,069
there were two cubics they're gonna be

1089
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,559
pretty much on on the one line the the

1090
01:01:19,069 --> 01:01:23,690
the number one by the way is when says

1091
01:01:21,559 --> 01:01:27,440
normalized rate per flow that's what you

1092
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:29,180
should get if they were equal so it's

1093
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:34,490
taking the capacity if it's two flows

1094
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:38,299
dividing it by two right but do we have

1095
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:41,270
the results for these the compare to

1096
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:44,240
compare just cubic it versus cubic yes

1097
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:47,690
against the results for cubic here on

1098
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:52,009
this slide that is you see that there's

1099
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:54,799
harm or not yeah okay I mean I the only

1100
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:58,549
the mean would be one I don't know how

1101
01:01:54,799 --> 01:02:01,640
big the variance would be but no I am

1102
01:01:58,549 --> 01:02:03,140
I've got in this slide say I haven't got

1103
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:06,170
those results I mean they're easy to do

1104
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:08,390
that would be useful does it do that but

1105
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:11,869
they're sort of going to be one only I

1106
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:13,640
mean I would anyone ask a different

1107
01:02:11,869 --> 01:02:15,619
question Bob do you think they're really

1108
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:18,020
easy to do could you could you do them

1109
01:02:15,619 --> 01:02:21,200
and just post the one slide to the list

1110
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:23,119
yeah yeah okay and we could then then

1111
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:26,629
then then the conversation can happen

1112
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:29,750
yeah Jay calling again

1113
01:02:26,630 --> 01:02:32,180
I was gonna ask for the same for Reno

1114
01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:34,549
this is just for cubic right we're sort

1115
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:37,549
of expecting Reno to be perhaps less

1116
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:43,700
aggressive and perhaps this to even have

1117
01:02:37,549 --> 01:02:46,130
a larger swing I I'm not sure if I

1118
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:49,250
should say but we do sometimes use Reno

1119
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:53,740
from our data centers and it's not just

1120
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:53,740
cubic everywhere yeah

1121
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:59,569
yeah I mean we have done experience with

1122
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:03,200
drilling we can certainly post ones with

1123
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:05,750
Reno yeah okay so you know repulsed

1124
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:09,620
maybe not dead side after this yeah okay

1125
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:14,510
Jana Jana anger just a clarification on

1126
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:16,549
this whole line of inquiry we know this

1127
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:19,690
is going to be the case you know that DC

1128
01:03:16,550 --> 01:03:23,720
DC B is gonna sort of do this with the

1129
01:03:19,690 --> 01:03:28,270
regular ACN what are we trying to

1130
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:30,709
accomplish by doing all of this work you

1131
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:32,780
asking me well I'm I guess I'm asking

1132
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:35,930
folks who are asking for more

1133
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:38,930
evaluations and also for the from the

1134
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:41,779
chair cause that is an issue now is this

1135
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:44,480
something that the question here in the

1136
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:47,810
room is not so much I you put these two

1137
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,840
flows in a single cue DC DC P is going

1138
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:53,720
to kill the other one

1139
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:55,400
fine how how slowly does it die or how

1140
01:03:53,720 --> 01:04:00,319
badly is it hurt is that an interesting

1141
01:03:55,400 --> 01:04:02,180
question for us to be asking I do want

1142
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:04,730
to just point out as I've said before

1143
01:04:02,180 --> 01:04:06,319
that starvation usually means something

1144
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,740
ratchets down and down and down and gets

1145
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:10,130
nothing

1146
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:12,350
yeah this is they're actually reaching a

1147
01:04:10,130 --> 01:04:14,270
stable state these two and there is

1148
01:04:12,350 --> 01:04:18,230
progress in both of them so it's not

1149
01:04:14,270 --> 01:04:22,009
killing it I know I know as I said it's

1150
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:25,910
for four to four at the ends and about

1151
01:04:22,010 --> 01:04:30,560
16 in the middle but you know we're

1152
01:04:25,910 --> 01:04:34,339
talking here like the forty Meg in the

1153
01:04:30,560 --> 01:04:37,759
middle so okay no one sixteenth or forty

1154
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:39,410
so on insignificant amount so rather

1155
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,510
than discuss whether we've got that is

1156
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:44,029
there another piece of data that we

1157
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:45,620
really want to look up if there's easy

1158
01:04:44,030 --> 01:04:47,300
things to do we can add it to the spider

1159
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:48,740
we can finish this discussion if there's

1160
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,320
something very specific that people

1161
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:53,209
asking for please ask but Andrews

1162
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,930
question is relevant yeah I can do with

1163
01:04:53,210 --> 01:04:57,410
this information

1164
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:58,790
you know do you taught me it was easy

1165
01:04:57,410 --> 01:05:00,529
and if this is the only issue that

1166
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:02,560
people are raising then I take this as

1167
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:05,530
we add this and see if people say oh

1168
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:07,610
that was easy that's done I mean this is

1169
01:05:05,530 --> 01:05:13,670
this is the really

1170
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:16,640
the only intractable issue with l4s that

1171
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:18,860
SCE was invented to solve you know and

1172
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:22,310
if that's not an important problem then

1173
01:05:18,860 --> 01:05:23,870
but how do we know what's the consensus

1174
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:26,779
on whether this is important or not you

1175
01:05:23,870 --> 01:05:28,850
know where's the line whatever where's

1176
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:30,620
our target what are we trying to do I'm

1177
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:33,680
sure Wes will say something when we've

1178
01:05:30,620 --> 01:05:35,210
got this conversation through and does

1179
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:37,730
anyone have any more things that they

1180
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,940
want to kind of say needs to be done in

1181
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:42,710
this evaluation no but I do have

1182
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,970
something I want and romário firstly I

1183
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:46,070
do have something I want to point out

1184
01:05:43,970 --> 01:05:48,919
was that if we do this exercise for

1185
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:50,210
cubic vs cubic or Reno versus Reno we're

1186
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:51,710
going to get numbers that are somewhat

1187
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:54,710
less than 1 because they will fail that

1188
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:58,580
will link so we'll get numbers somewhere

1189
01:05:54,710 --> 01:06:00,980
between about 1/2 and about 0.7 so

1190
01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:02,540
that's really the bar right that's the

1191
01:06:00,980 --> 01:06:05,150
really the bar for it's actually working

1192
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:09,440
ok here we're filling the link so we get

1193
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:13,430
more total close to feeling like you can

1194
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:15,710
ever fill it completely so yeah ok it's

1195
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:18,560
me to close the mic soon but please

1196
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:20,990
comment on this specific thing all right

1197
01:06:18,560 --> 01:06:22,279
so Peter heist from the SAE team I

1198
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:23,839
wanted to answer the question why we're

1199
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:26,600
doing this experiment and that is

1200
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:28,700
because there are many RFC 3168

1201
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:31,490
ATMs and deployment today so we want to

1202
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:34,100
demonstrate what is actually going on so

1203
01:06:31,490 --> 01:06:35,509
that we we show and not just talk about

1204
01:06:34,100 --> 01:06:38,540
what what could possibly happen because

1205
01:06:35,510 --> 01:06:40,580
it is a it is a serious issue but I did

1206
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:43,670
want to ask I didn't know if it came up

1207
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:45,830
in this issue or 17 but you have

1208
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:48,890
resolved some of the initial latency

1209
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:51,799
spikes that were due to the Alpha in TCP

1210
01:06:48,890 --> 01:06:53,960
prod the initial alphabet but that's

1211
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:55,370
issue 17 we've got that coming but if we

1212
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:57,530
take this for me along on everything

1213
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:59,720
when there's another three or four

1214
01:06:57,530 --> 01:07:02,060
slides about this this is just the the

1215
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:05,270
problem slide now we then we got the

1216
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,620
solution coming up but but I do want to

1217
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:07,730
pick up on you saying there are a lot of

1218
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:09,560
3168

1219
01:07:07,730 --> 01:07:11,510
rotors about we're talking here about

1220
01:07:09,560 --> 01:07:14,090
single these are all in a single queue

1221
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:17,310
if it's an f2 you don't get this problem

1222
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:20,010
at all J : just as

1223
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:23,160
to the point Jonah asked about why do we

1224
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:26,610
want to know this I would like to say

1225
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:29,279
that I am far more interested in how

1226
01:07:26,610 --> 01:07:31,320
well does the does the classic you

1227
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,720
detection work if you would do that

1228
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:36,720
instead and show that this goes away

1229
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:39,480
when when it's functional then it would

1230
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,459
make this moot I think what the serves

1231
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:43,590
as the baseline in case it doesn't and

1232
01:07:41,460 --> 01:07:45,780
to be able to show the difference and we

1233
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:47,430
don't actually need it if we don't if

1234
01:07:45,780 --> 01:07:50,670
the if the classic you detection works

1235
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:52,020
for you know both against Reno and

1236
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:54,120
against Keith er yeah I've got bad news

1237
01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:56,910
for you as I said in the previous

1238
01:07:54,120 --> 01:07:58,290
meeting assertive email this week so we

1239
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:59,970
haven't actually got results on that

1240
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,920
we've implemented it but we haven't been

1241
01:07:59,970 --> 01:08:04,259
over tested in the time we've had here

1242
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,810
right but I'm going to give John a

1243
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,400
chance to say something short and then

1244
01:08:06,810 --> 01:08:10,290
I'm going to try and get West to say

1245
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:13,860
what he wants to do with the remaining

1246
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:15,240
time this looks very eager that little

1247
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:20,850
blue ting is really moving

1248
01:08:15,240 --> 01:08:22,439
i I'm I'm going to say that it's it's

1249
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:23,790
it's always interesting for me to hear

1250
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:26,700
about EC and deployment because

1251
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:29,100
everybody thinks it's it seems to me

1252
01:08:26,700 --> 01:08:31,339
that it's it's super difficult to

1253
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:34,200
actually find out what is in deployment

1254
01:08:31,339 --> 01:08:36,450
looks like so if actually somebody has

1255
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,639
numbers or has experience I would love

1256
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:39,779
to see that and I am curious see if

1257
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,850
you've seen this in the past but I'd

1258
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:47,299
like to know that that's on the next

1259
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:50,819
slide that'd be useful yeah but okay

1260
01:08:47,299 --> 01:08:57,240
right okay but I'm still going to let

1261
01:08:50,819 --> 01:08:59,910
Wes be wise if he got the mic yeah okay

1262
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:02,370
so where's a chat chat and we're eating

1263
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:04,500
into the individual presentation so it

1264
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:06,630
will be cutting those if we continue for

1265
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,060
a lot longer and but there might be

1266
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:10,589
useful things that could be done how

1267
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:14,850
would you might use the next ten minutes

1268
01:09:10,589 --> 01:09:17,700
I think a key is to see if people agree

1269
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:22,109
that most of the work here is actually

1270
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:24,630
in tcp proc on and hosts and that as a

1271
01:09:22,109 --> 01:09:29,580
florets is concerned we need just sort

1272
01:09:24,630 --> 01:09:30,989
of the existence proof that is possible

1273
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:33,390
to do the classic

1274
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:37,049
bottleneck detection and and fallback

1275
01:09:33,390 --> 01:09:38,520
and whatever that this is enough to make

1276
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:41,219
us feel comfortable going forward with

1277
01:09:38,520 --> 01:09:45,980
the elf forest in network behavior RF

1278
01:09:41,219 --> 01:09:50,069
these so that's a question to the room

1279
01:09:45,979 --> 01:09:53,009
Bob his charts on the detection and fall

1280
01:09:50,069 --> 01:09:54,540
back yet I know but is it still quick

1281
01:09:53,009 --> 01:09:57,810
sort of how comfortable are people with

1282
01:09:54,540 --> 01:10:00,140
that position J holin if we had such a

1283
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:03,000
proof that would be adequate for me I

1284
01:10:00,140 --> 01:10:05,730
would that's that's that is the open

1285
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:09,510
question to me it's like can we in fact

1286
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:12,629
meet the the TCP proud or sorry the fr-s

1287
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:14,489
requirements with anything one example

1288
01:10:12,630 --> 01:10:14,940
of which could be TCP product we haven't

1289
01:10:14,489 --> 01:10:16,950
seen that yet

1290
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:19,349
that's my objection under the particular

1291
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:22,530
first requirement that you thought was

1292
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:25,350
important to gate on was fallback in

1293
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:28,259
some way to with three one six eight

1294
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:34,170
compatibility is that right yeah not if

1295
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:36,930
yes okay this slide is holding off one

1296
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:39,900
more slide until we get to the design of

1297
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:41,250
that fallback just to talk about because

1298
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:46,290
this issue is both about the prevalence

1299
01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:51,420
of the problem and and whether there's a

1300
01:10:46,290 --> 01:10:54,989
solution and where we asked Padma who

1301
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:57,930
presented this stuff in a map RG some

1302
01:10:54,989 --> 01:11:00,150
years ago now to dig into the data and

1303
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:03,150
she did remember that she had looked

1304
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:06,269
into the highest point there the thirty

1305
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,910
percent in Argentina and and traced it

1306
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:13,950
to a particular ISP so we found someone

1307
01:11:08,910 --> 01:11:17,790
in their ISP or corrected and they had a

1308
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:19,200
look and they said oh oh there's it

1309
01:11:17,790 --> 01:11:24,420
looks like we're overwriting the tossed

1310
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:26,309
byte with hex one seven and so they seem

1311
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:29,420
to be doing that on all of them so that

1312
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:32,310
could well explain that thirty percent

1313
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:34,920
yeah I like that data but I'm not sure

1314
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:37,290
it's the right place to dig at this

1315
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:39,719
moment that isn't it and that's why we

1316
01:11:37,290 --> 01:11:42,450
started doing the the work on TCP Prague

1317
01:11:39,719 --> 01:11:44,630
because I thought what no matter how

1318
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:47,780
much we find that there

1319
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:48,980
any single cue ECM we're always going to

1320
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,259
get the complaint there might be you

1321
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:53,509
know we can't prove the existence of the

1322
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:57,140
non-existence its in many of the rooters

1323
01:11:53,510 --> 01:12:01,370
I have as a configuration option so so

1324
01:11:57,140 --> 01:12:03,190
what no but it's there yeah

1325
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:06,760
where's what what you want to do next I

1326
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:12,379
think we probably should move to issue

1327
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:15,350
17 Bob well I mean there's the design

1328
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:16,820
works for issue 16 and then issue 17 I

1329
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:25,130
was going to skip over because it's sort

1330
01:12:16,820 --> 01:12:31,849
of pretty much done yeah no no no I was

1331
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:34,490
gonna skip 17 and not 16 this is about

1332
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:36,020
how we have designed the solution you

1333
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:46,550
haven't have you got data showing oh

1334
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:48,410
yeah but I can skip it all right briefly

1335
01:12:46,550 --> 01:13:01,220
issue 17 do you want to go to that just

1336
01:12:48,410 --> 01:13:04,400
just why I reckon we can skip it usually

1337
01:13:01,220 --> 01:13:06,980
just point and grunt yeah

1338
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:10,549
so that was a copy of the problem

1339
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:12,139
statement from feet I think I'm not

1340
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:18,290
gonna read all that out it was

1341
01:13:12,140 --> 01:13:23,870
essentially saying that there is this

1342
01:13:18,290 --> 01:13:27,620
case where quite often a cake reader is

1343
01:13:23,870 --> 01:13:32,120
set up so that the in the downstream the

1344
01:13:27,620 --> 01:13:34,220
the home rater at the end at the

1345
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,840
downstream end of the link is made to be

1346
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:38,960
the bottleneck slightly less than the

1347
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:45,170
capacity than the FIFO at the top of the

1348
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:47,380
link and they were concerned that there

1349
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:51,710
was there were measurements showing that

1350
01:13:47,380 --> 01:13:54,600
TCP prog was giving this huge

1351
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:56,940
period of congestion that was big enough

1352
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:59,880
to push back up into the FIFO so next

1353
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:02,129
well okay I mean so so do they still

1354
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:04,290
hold that belief I do not believe they

1355
01:14:02,130 --> 01:14:11,120
do because if you just show the next one

1356
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:11,120
oh yeah well I realized this was come

1357
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,260
just tell us okay

1358
01:14:14,699 --> 01:14:21,178
that was that that was the problem

1359
01:14:16,260 --> 01:14:26,040
observed but it was a bug when Olivier

1360
01:14:21,179 --> 01:14:29,159
herds copied over from VCT CP into T to

1361
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:33,600
be Prague and then started you know

1362
01:14:29,159 --> 01:14:36,960
turning into TCP Prague he'd want one of

1363
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,719
the initial parameters for where the aw

1364
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:44,000
ma starts was meant to be at one or Max

1365
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:46,830
and it was set to zero by the way he

1366
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,210
copied over the parameters so that was

1367
01:14:46,830 --> 01:15:06,120
what that initial bit wasn't if you look

1368
01:14:48,210 --> 01:15:09,830
at the next slide we could yeah so and

1369
01:15:06,120 --> 01:15:12,690
in fact in Pete's original measurements

1370
01:15:09,830 --> 01:15:16,650
BC TCP didn't have the problem and TCP

1371
01:15:12,690 --> 01:15:18,509
Prague did and it was because when

1372
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:22,469
introduced to bargains he's be proud

1373
01:15:18,510 --> 01:15:24,750
which once once we realized those two

1374
01:15:22,469 --> 01:15:26,840
differences immediately found it and

1375
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:33,360
then if you look at the next book flop

1376
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:36,780
it's you can just see yeah that's it a

1377
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:39,690
little bit further down anyway you see

1378
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:42,000
the the delay is on the right hand side

1379
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:44,099
if you can read that it's about that

1380
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,440
spike is about hundred fifty but the

1381
01:15:44,100 --> 01:15:50,790
rest of it is about I don't know five

1382
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:54,870
maybe on the TCP flow and probably

1383
01:15:50,790 --> 01:16:01,380
anything on the ICMP and when the ICMP

1384
01:15:54,870 --> 01:16:04,750
is of the T will be okay going back into

1385
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:06,730
FIFO and in the next so essentially the

1386
01:16:04,750 --> 01:16:11,730
gone away and if you look at it the next

1387
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:13,660
plot it shows essentially other

1388
01:16:11,730 --> 01:16:17,290
congesting the trials have that have the

1389
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:20,200
same size white rice but is really clear

1390
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:24,310
Bob worth to say when we should just go

1391
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:30,309
straight to the one on the lost in time

1392
01:16:24,310 --> 01:16:32,800
units where you have weight forward okay

1393
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,720
so we want to take comments from people

1394
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:38,620
in Bob's book but comments from the

1395
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:40,420
floor on these two issues and yeah all

1396
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:43,300
right with respects as the

1397
01:16:40,420 --> 01:16:47,020
initialization of alpha I believed that

1398
01:16:43,300 --> 01:16:55,780
is basically this is Johnson Morton just

1399
01:16:47,020 --> 01:17:00,750
- we came okay initializing alpha to 1

1400
01:16:55,780 --> 01:17:03,550
essentially means and that we have a

1401
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:04,080
multiplicative decrease on exit of slow

1402
01:17:03,550 --> 01:17:09,490
start

1403
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:12,400
isn't that right so what happens when

1404
01:17:09,490 --> 01:17:16,269
you have a sudden decrease in effective

1405
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:21,730
path capacity after alpha has stabilized

1406
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:25,900
to the steady state value right what

1407
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:28,389
happens is that as as with a lot of

1408
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:30,490
these things we're experimenting with a

1409
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:33,100
tcp prog that isn't finished and with

1410
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:36,849
we've got the well we've got the pace

1411
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:38,710
chirping stuff that we have his Jerry

1412
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:44,350
paced chipping is still about slow start

1413
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:49,660
isn't it no that's not as go on no we've

1414
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:52,560
got pace chirping and excuse me place

1415
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:55,480
chirping is also when the congestion

1416
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:58,800
level disappears mid congestion

1417
01:17:55,480 --> 01:18:02,740
avoidance and also we're working on a

1418
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:04,840
caster controller instead of the WMA

1419
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:08,559
well it's in addition to the WMA it's a

1420
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:10,840
bi controller in within they've sent TCP

1421
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:14,260
which I'm not just working on it it's

1422
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:16,390
implemented and the guy who wrote plays

1423
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:17,510
chirping is implementing that because he

1424
01:18:16,390 --> 01:18:20,330
wants

1425
01:18:17,510 --> 01:18:22,820
in order to come in a fast the other

1426
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:24,380
flows have to go out faster and DCT

1427
01:18:22,820 --> 01:18:26,450
speeds very slow at doing that

1428
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:33,920
okay so there's some working focus that

1429
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:38,120
we haven't seen yet yes I presented this

1430
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:45,440
work in the ICC RG and at net dev but

1431
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:48,410
it's not being shown in TS v WG Jake J :

1432
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:51,290
there was a another different latency

1433
01:18:48,410 --> 01:18:54,320
spike that happened with the staggered

1434
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:56,360
start Greg made a statement on list

1435
01:18:54,320 --> 01:19:00,610
about this is a different thing I was

1436
01:18:56,360 --> 01:19:04,610
less clear or I didn't see that analysed

1437
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:07,309
it looked to me like a similar issue but

1438
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:09,469
I agree that it can be fixed by fixing

1439
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:12,680
16 probably or I'd like to see a

1440
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:14,900
temperature so Craig white cable is I

1441
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:17,990
think issue referring to it's the same

1442
01:19:14,900 --> 01:19:20,870
one that Johnson Morton is bringing out

1443
01:19:17,990 --> 01:19:23,990
that if T CV Prague is in the steady

1444
01:19:20,870 --> 01:19:26,599
state with a small value of alpha and in

1445
01:19:23,990 --> 01:19:29,150
an F Q system and another flow starts up

1446
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:32,330
that the FQ coddle doesn't give enough

1447
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:35,120
of a congestion signal to meet the

1448
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:37,250
expectations of TCP Prague and calls it

1449
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:39,970
to reduce congestion window so quickly

1450
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:42,710
it's physically but it still does make a

1451
01:19:39,970 --> 01:19:45,320
multi second latency spike in this in

1452
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:47,920
much the same way as I recall and this

1453
01:19:45,320 --> 01:19:49,880
is so I'm surprised to see this

1454
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:54,140
represented as the conclusion to the

1455
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:58,670
issue but that it's only affecting the

1456
01:19:54,140 --> 01:20:00,980
tcp prague flow it was not causing minor

1457
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:02,810
damage to other flows I thought it was

1458
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:05,150
the same issue in the Sebastian thing

1459
01:20:02,810 --> 01:20:08,120
where you have an upstream flow and that

1460
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:10,790
one can back up and cut okay maybe I'm a

1461
01:20:08,120 --> 01:20:13,010
second thank you I'm not the conclusion

1462
01:20:10,790 --> 01:20:15,260
thing is Bob's take to reach a

1463
01:20:13,010 --> 01:20:17,840
conclusion not the chairs determination

1464
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:19,730
that that has happened and the other

1465
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:21,470
question I've got a small question here

1466
01:20:19,730 --> 01:20:24,139
you mentioned the use of paste

1467
01:20:21,470 --> 01:20:27,110
trapping is it possible to find a method

1468
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:29,240
that doesn't use paste chirping for

1469
01:20:27,110 --> 01:20:32,080
those people who have them off loads and

1470
01:20:29,240 --> 01:20:35,210
other things where that might be hard

1471
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:38,570
what what what your PO is doing at the

1472
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:41,420
moment is he well he's currently up

1473
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:47,019
streaming Accra ACN that the next job is

1474
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:49,489
to look at whether pays chirping is is

1475
01:20:47,020 --> 01:20:52,850
practical or whether we go for something

1476
01:20:49,489 --> 01:20:56,059
less ambitious as a sort of first step

1477
01:20:52,850 --> 01:20:58,489
that gives you a better start up and and

1478
01:20:56,060 --> 01:21:00,770
and faster but not you know not as

1479
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:02,570
necessarily as good as pace chirping or

1480
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:04,070
maybe we use poast chirping when it

1481
01:21:02,570 --> 01:21:06,110
works and something else otherwise all

1482
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:09,410
but I mean it will always it will always

1483
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:11,570
falter slow start if that's better than

1484
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:15,559
paced chirping anyway I would encourage

1485
01:21:11,570 --> 01:21:17,599
you to look outside of the pace trapping

1486
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:20,090
thing for something that the ietf can

1487
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,400
standardize and then explore pace

1488
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,890
tripping where you can deploy it and but

1489
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:28,429
I don't think there are any rfcs on

1490
01:21:24,890 --> 01:21:31,489
paced chirping and so so we you should

1491
01:21:28,430 --> 01:21:34,160
be careful to have a they weren't doing

1492
01:21:31,489 --> 01:21:35,750
it that works that within the RFC series

1493
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:40,099
and then improve on that with a separate

1494
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:42,110
RFC yeah but also we you know if we can

1495
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:48,980
get post chirping as an RFC that would

1496
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:50,690
be I want to get I agree with Wes I

1497
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:53,719
would look to see this these documents

1498
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:56,540
published so um I don't want to gate on

1499
01:21:53,720 --> 01:22:01,280
some future RFC to come along anything

1500
01:21:56,540 --> 01:22:03,140
so anyways and what the goal is here

1501
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:05,179
because you know we're all doing

1502
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:10,700
congestion control research in the ICC

1503
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:12,140
RG yes and are we meant to have solved

1504
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:17,750
all congestion control problems before

1505
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:20,390
we can get the outfit l4s drops chirping

1506
01:22:17,750 --> 01:22:23,840
is the answer we wouldn't necessarily

1507
01:22:20,390 --> 01:22:25,550
change anything in the 304 s documents

1508
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:30,080
you know that we're working on right now

1509
01:22:25,550 --> 01:22:33,980
if if the if the Mo's don't depend on

1510
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:36,739
the specific answer then let's just not

1511
01:22:33,980 --> 01:22:40,429
spend time talking about what specific

1512
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:41,809
answers are just okay so if I paraphrase

1513
01:22:40,430 --> 01:22:43,190
was

1514
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:46,070
give a simple answer to these questions

1515
01:22:43,190 --> 01:22:48,410
because of the development of the stuff

1516
01:22:46,070 --> 01:22:50,840
can be done somewhere else yeah yeah and

1517
01:22:48,410 --> 01:22:54,200
I guess the simple answer is we're doing

1518
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:57,110
this faster getting out of the way part

1519
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,700
of the work which isn't post chirping

1520
01:22:57,110 --> 01:23:00,080
but it's because we want post chirping

1521
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:01,490
to push in so if we did the faster

1522
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,930
getting out away bit that would probably

1523
01:23:01,490 --> 01:23:07,490
solve all these problems you know I

1524
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:13,280
think you've got 40 minutes left in the

1525
01:23:07,490 --> 01:23:15,139
session and in addition to SCE which is

1526
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,050
normally xx there's another three

1527
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:19,970
presentations behind it how much how

1528
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:23,180
much more time do we want to spend on

1529
01:23:19,970 --> 01:23:25,090
this and to do what it would be really

1530
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:28,430
good get quick feedback on Bob's

1531
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:30,260
proposed way forward on the loss

1532
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:34,730
protection and timing that she's got I

1533
01:23:30,260 --> 01:23:40,130
think if you skip to charts ahead three

1534
01:23:34,730 --> 01:23:47,209
charts ahead one more yeah that one this

1535
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:48,980
one with that can be done I think so

1536
01:23:47,210 --> 01:23:54,080
because people people are familiar with

1537
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:55,639
the problem in the controversy okay so

1538
01:23:54,080 --> 01:23:58,550
Bob you want talk about this show do you

1539
01:23:55,640 --> 01:24:01,540
want me to go go go web decided we're

1540
01:23:58,550 --> 01:24:02,950
gonna go for shoot if it helps get us

1541
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:05,890
moving

1542
01:24:02,950 --> 01:24:08,599
David Barack has an individual floor I

1543
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:11,570
strongly endorse this should hear and I

1544
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:13,760
will cheerlead I think said I can that

1545
01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:16,040
people really really really should do

1546
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:18,590
this make we can't must down to it

1547
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:20,240
should will will will take care of the

1548
01:24:18,590 --> 01:24:22,310
book will take care of this for me and I

1549
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:24,320
think we can go forward with that I'll

1550
01:24:22,310 --> 01:24:26,150
have to check on list but they should

1551
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:28,420
would just take this from right off the

1552
01:24:26,150 --> 01:24:30,980
table we can focus on the hard problems

1553
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:34,610
Richard so Richard Schaffner has met up

1554
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:37,429
so one question so many stacks have

1555
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:39,500
reordering detection which dynamically

1556
01:24:37,430 --> 01:24:42,710
adjusts the reordering interval in

1557
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:45,350
packets over time would that be an

1558
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:49,790
alternative method to do this or must it

1559
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:52,550
be time units that can be and I mean for

1560
01:24:49,790 --> 01:24:55,220
instance just to answer that question in

1561
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:57,530
a in a way that

1562
01:24:55,220 --> 01:25:00,680
the extremes that you can go to if you

1563
01:24:57,530 --> 01:25:02,750
did three do pack but you paste your

1564
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:05,330
initial window for instance if you did

1565
01:25:02,750 --> 01:25:10,310
3d back for your initial window and then

1566
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:12,500
move that to towards time using time

1567
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:14,660
later in the flow the three do pack

1568
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:17,120
would be in time because it's 3/10 of

1569
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:19,760
the round-trip time if you pace over the

1570
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:21,769
round-trip time only yeah and what this

1571
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,840
is dude one of the things are we enforce

1572
01:25:21,770 --> 01:25:25,310
Bob mentioned I think in session

1573
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,080
previous one that we had a lot of

1574
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:28,790
discussions one of the things I think

1575
01:25:27,080 --> 01:25:33,280
ain't clear most discussions is that

1576
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:35,930
pacing helps pacing helps a lot here yep

1577
01:25:33,280 --> 01:25:40,040
yes but some stacks do not have pacing

1578
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:42,680
yeah I mean pacing like pacing in

1579
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:45,050
general is something that can or cannot

1580
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:48,110
be present for various reasons in an end

1581
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:51,470
point my question is for stacks that do

1582
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:56,299
not feature pacing chirping power is it

1583
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:59,180
acceptable to have them declare

1584
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:02,420
themselves compliant with the tcp park

1585
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:07,600
specs if they do like reordering

1586
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:07,600
collection if we put it as assured yes

1587
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:18,440
I'm Jonah from away I think

1588
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:22,490
optional solution for the network test

1589
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:24,650
for example panel ice P is now rising

1590
01:26:22,490 --> 01:26:28,460
closest and C I think is the necessary

1591
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:34,070
solution I have a sudden meter one drop

1592
01:26:28,460 --> 01:26:35,530
turn and I can I think however the same

1593
01:26:34,070 --> 01:26:38,840
scenario yeah

1594
01:26:35,530 --> 01:26:43,429
please pay attention to my job thank you

1595
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:46,070
okay thank you thank you thank you

1596
01:26:43,430 --> 01:26:51,350
I'm Jonah I'm going to say something as

1597
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:52,490
well Jonah in January go so this is this

1598
01:26:51,350 --> 01:26:53,990
is the one requirement that's what

1599
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:56,750
sticks out in the list as a slightly

1600
01:26:53,990 --> 01:26:59,080
wonky one and I think we've gone over

1601
01:26:56,750 --> 01:27:00,980
this but I think the the goal here is to

1602
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:04,880
if I understand correctly is to

1603
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:07,219
basically make sure that the endpoint is

1604
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,959
resilient to the network doing things

1605
01:27:07,220 --> 01:27:10,849
that it is

1606
01:27:08,959 --> 01:27:13,909
constrained from doing right now because

1607
01:27:10,849 --> 01:27:15,519
TCP has a 3d back thing again as we know

1608
01:27:13,909 --> 01:27:18,650
the implementations are changing this

1609
01:27:15,519 --> 01:27:22,579
but there we mentioned something earlier

1610
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:26,388
to me that I realize this is probably

1611
01:27:22,579 --> 01:27:28,099
worth just bringing up briefly lost

1612
01:27:26,389 --> 01:27:29,630
addiction time units at the endpoints is

1613
01:27:28,099 --> 01:27:31,849
usually implemented as a fraction of the

1614
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:33,979
round-trip time in the network however

1615
01:27:31,849 --> 01:27:36,769
the switch doesn't necessarily know your

1616
01:27:33,979 --> 01:27:39,289
flows round-trip time which means that

1617
01:27:36,769 --> 01:27:41,840
whatever resilience we are telling them

1618
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:45,650
we're building is not really visible to

1619
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:48,019
them I did the degree of freedom that we

1620
01:27:45,650 --> 01:27:49,369
believe this might provide them might

1621
01:27:48,019 --> 01:27:51,530
not translate into the degree of freedom

1622
01:27:49,369 --> 01:27:55,728
you want discussion on the list it's

1623
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:57,259
it's okay the the even though the

1624
01:27:55,729 --> 01:28:00,079
network is another round-trip time it

1625
01:27:57,260 --> 01:28:03,610
generally knows this the rough minimum

1626
01:28:00,079 --> 01:28:03,610
round-trip time that any node is gone

1627
01:28:03,999 --> 01:28:07,760
because sure by the diameter of the

1628
01:28:06,499 --> 01:28:12,619
network the minimum diameter of the

1629
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:15,260
network how do then it has subtract that

1630
01:28:12,619 --> 01:28:19,459
yes it can't cut it that's what you're

1631
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:23,139
saying so I guess where we are going

1632
01:28:19,459 --> 01:28:25,340
here is what what I want to suggest was

1633
01:28:23,139 --> 01:28:26,979
definitely I should if you're gonna have

1634
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:30,039
this thing which should be I should

1635
01:28:26,979 --> 01:28:32,499
increasingly feeling strongly about that

1636
01:28:30,039 --> 01:28:37,309
separately I wonder if this should be

1637
01:28:32,499 --> 01:28:40,550
amended to actually talk about endpoints

1638
01:28:37,309 --> 01:28:43,989
being resilient to reordering in the

1639
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:45,330
network beyond the three packet limit

1640
01:28:43,989 --> 01:28:47,259
what

1641
01:28:45,330 --> 01:28:49,519
[Music]

1642
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:52,400
what's your name Richard thank you

1643
01:28:49,519 --> 01:28:54,260
Richard what Richard said sorry it's the

1644
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,579
moment what we just said is appropriate

1645
01:28:54,260 --> 01:28:59,659
that we there are n points that are

1646
01:28:55,579 --> 01:29:02,209
doing packet based you're doing adaptive

1647
01:28:59,659 --> 01:29:05,780
packet based thresholding then that's

1648
01:29:02,209 --> 01:29:06,829
also that's also good enough basically

1649
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:08,690
what you want is the endpoint to not

1650
01:29:06,829 --> 01:29:10,728
fall over if there's more reordering in

1651
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:12,079
the network and I wonder if there's a

1652
01:29:10,729 --> 01:29:15,519
better way of saying that rather than

1653
01:29:12,079 --> 01:29:15,518
saying loss addiction and time units

1654
01:29:15,969 --> 01:29:21,630
thank you we work out some words I like

1655
01:29:20,869 --> 01:29:24,750
I think

1656
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:26,880
useful contribution John praveen yeah I

1657
01:29:24,750 --> 01:29:29,880
would be supportive of a shirt here I

1658
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:31,740
think it's less clear if the goal is

1659
01:29:29,880 --> 01:29:33,240
actually to have the endpoint do loss

1660
01:29:31,740 --> 01:29:35,550
detection and time or just be more

1661
01:29:33,240 --> 01:29:37,800
reordering resilient so I think calling

1662
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:39,090
that out will be useful second thing I

1663
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:43,080
would like to say the current transport

1664
01:29:39,090 --> 01:29:46,830
specs are not enforcing the dynamic

1665
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:50,640
reorder requirement so it might be

1666
01:29:46,830 --> 01:29:53,190
static right so unless the transport

1667
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:54,750
specs in TCP and quick to say that the

1668
01:29:53,190 --> 01:30:00,660
reordering should be dynamic either

1669
01:29:54,750 --> 01:30:03,030
either in packets or in time so I want

1670
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:04,380
to place myself in the line so no way I

1671
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:05,880
don't know where to place myself maybe

1672
01:30:04,380 --> 01:30:09,090
I'll place myself on the chest oh so

1673
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:12,900
here I am and as a chair I find it

1674
01:30:09,090 --> 01:30:15,660
difficult for us to relax the reordering

1675
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:18,450
constraint in the internet layer unless

1676
01:30:15,660 --> 01:30:21,570
we write a specific draft that does that

1677
01:30:18,450 --> 01:30:23,340
and I tried to make comments earlier to

1678
01:30:21,570 --> 01:30:25,590
make sure that the text here talks about

1679
01:30:23,340 --> 01:30:26,520
being resilient to a network that might

1680
01:30:25,590 --> 01:30:28,980
do this

1681
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:31,020
I'm not motivating that particular

1682
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:34,200
change in this document if we get the

1683
01:30:31,020 --> 01:30:36,120
transports to all and be resilient to

1684
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:38,610
reordering a more and more resilient

1685
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:40,230
then that document could appear here and

1686
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:42,120
we could discuss it but we should have

1687
01:30:40,230 --> 01:30:43,500
put the cart before the horse because

1688
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:45,780
otherwise we would create a document

1689
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:47,970
that really will have to get ITF

1690
01:30:45,780 --> 01:30:50,370
consensus in a difficult way so if we're

1691
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:52,800
heading in that way I think I would have

1692
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:55,590
finished my comments so I will read the

1693
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:58,290
new text you already have read it

1694
01:30:55,590 --> 01:31:00,870
I know I know you've reviewed it for me

1695
01:30:58,290 --> 01:31:03,390
and unsaid there yeah exactly but

1696
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:05,910
usually is it right or not now okay so I

1697
01:31:03,390 --> 01:31:09,180
need I need to check again because at

1698
01:31:05,910 --> 01:31:11,400
this ITF and people talking about l4s

1699
01:31:09,180 --> 01:31:13,230
hub again mentioned that the long term

1700
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:15,299
intention is one thing which I didn't

1701
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:17,549
understand it to be so I need to make

1702
01:31:15,300 --> 01:31:19,950
sure the text is correct because I mean

1703
01:31:17,550 --> 01:31:22,440
I did work out a way of saying it

1704
01:31:19,950 --> 01:31:25,380
without implying at all that the network

1705
01:31:22,440 --> 01:31:28,740
was going to change it was more that if

1706
01:31:25,380 --> 01:31:32,490
the network stays as it is and that the

1707
01:31:28,740 --> 01:31:34,019
hosts will keep this you know I worked

1708
01:31:32,490 --> 01:31:35,329
out a way to do it that I thought

1709
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:40,249
satisfied you and

1710
01:31:35,329 --> 01:31:43,369
I think a bunch of us need need to bash

1711
01:31:40,249 --> 01:31:45,050
the text offline I'll probably have some

1712
01:31:43,369 --> 01:31:47,509
concerns about the specific text but but

1713
01:31:45,050 --> 01:31:49,249
but let's bash it offline yeah but we

1714
01:31:47,510 --> 01:31:51,379
seem to have a reasonable way forward on

1715
01:31:49,249 --> 01:31:53,179
this I think well would you like to

1716
01:31:51,379 --> 01:31:59,869
comment on this and have you got

1717
01:31:53,179 --> 01:32:01,579
anything exactly good and we should

1718
01:31:59,869 --> 01:32:05,499
spend some time on our remaining

1719
01:32:01,579 --> 01:32:09,320
documents we have one two three four

1720
01:32:05,499 --> 01:32:13,728
five individual presentations in 30

1721
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:17,599
minutes and we will seek to do what we

1722
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:19,669
can and but if the author's help us that

1723
01:32:17,599 --> 01:32:22,999
would help a lot I think we'll take

1724
01:32:19,669 --> 01:32:25,969
Jerome Jerome's qci thing very briefly

1725
01:32:22,999 --> 01:32:31,429
and as a point of information so we know

1726
01:32:25,969 --> 01:32:33,229
where we're up to so well okay but I was

1727
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:35,629
hoping to give the rest of okay fine

1728
01:32:33,229 --> 01:32:39,639
okay we'll put a cm cut a CA if you want

1729
01:32:35,629 --> 01:32:42,858
yeah that's fine well you come up can I

1730
01:32:39,639 --> 01:32:46,879
wasn't doing s you yes okay we'll take a

1731
01:32:42,859 --> 01:32:50,809
seat your time limited to ten including

1732
01:32:46,879 --> 01:32:52,070
questions so five presentations I just

1733
01:32:50,809 --> 01:32:55,570
wanted to point out two ways in the

1734
01:32:52,070 --> 01:32:57,709
previous session we tried to address the

1735
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:59,959
measurement issue which I can't remember

1736
01:32:57,709 --> 01:33:01,639
which number is 21 no not 21 22

1737
01:32:59,959 --> 01:33:05,169
something like that well I still pick up

1738
01:33:01,639 --> 01:33:05,169
because I don't think where's was there

1739
01:33:07,839 --> 01:33:13,899
which which one do you want to focus on

1740
01:33:10,429 --> 01:33:21,530
I just want to go through your top yeah

1741
01:33:13,899 --> 01:33:24,800
that's fine yeah I wanted to spend a bit

1742
01:33:21,530 --> 01:33:27,259
more time on these early slice since I

1743
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,599
think a lot of the information was also

1744
01:33:27,260 --> 01:33:33,589
presented at Montreal but seem to get

1745
01:33:29,599 --> 01:33:37,849
her lost when it filtered through to the

1746
01:33:33,589 --> 01:33:43,179
meaning list so I saw was the nights I

1747
01:33:37,849 --> 01:33:47,030
view some congestion experienced

1748
01:33:43,179 --> 01:33:49,130
honestly 368 left a spare code point in

1749
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:51,380
the ESPN field at the low

1750
01:33:49,130 --> 01:33:54,670
and of the tos bite and one of its

1751
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:58,220
suggested uses back in 2001 was an

1752
01:33:54,670 --> 01:34:00,610
indication of mild congestion was a see

1753
01:33:58,220 --> 01:34:04,820
II could point showing severe congestion

1754
01:34:00,610 --> 01:34:06,679
that's exactly what SCE is we're just

1755
01:34:04,820 --> 01:34:10,340
filled in a few details about how to

1756
01:34:06,680 --> 01:34:12,740
make it work in practice one such detail

1757
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:15,020
is in how to get the AC feedback to the

1758
01:34:12,740 --> 01:34:18,920
server where to the sender where it's

1759
01:34:15,020 --> 01:34:21,440
acted upon we propose using the a single

1760
01:34:18,920 --> 01:34:25,330
wizard bit on the TCP header as shown

1761
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,620
here originally assigning that bit

1762
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:31,130
obviously assigning that which is a TCM

1763
01:34:27,620 --> 01:34:35,000
TC p.m. working group matter and rod

1764
01:34:31,130 --> 01:34:37,970
will talk there about it tomorrow the

1765
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:40,250
crucial aspect of SCE is that we've

1766
01:34:37,970 --> 01:34:42,200
taken pains to preserve all the existing

1767
01:34:40,250 --> 01:34:44,240
functionality of our see three one six

1768
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:46,940
eight ecn within SCE

1769
01:34:44,240 --> 01:34:47,510
this music easy and sen points and

1770
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:49,490
middleboxes

1771
01:34:47,510 --> 01:34:51,250
are completely interoperable with each

1772
01:34:49,490 --> 01:34:53,450
other by design

1773
01:34:51,250 --> 01:34:56,780
this makes incremental deployment

1774
01:34:53,450 --> 01:34:59,120
considerably easier what this achieves

1775
01:34:56,780 --> 01:35:01,700
is an end to the perennial trade-off

1776
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:07,309
between link utilization and queuing

1777
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:09,410
delay the basic the basic course of that

1778
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:11,870
trade-off is the traditional congestion

1779
01:35:09,410 --> 01:35:14,330
control sawtooth if the peaks of the

1780
01:35:11,870 --> 01:35:16,519
sawtooth are kept at the low delay the

continuous a cruise control feedback

1784
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:29,900
loop here we have some famous quotes

1785
01:35:28,190 --> 01:35:32,509
which everyone this working group should

1786
01:35:29,900 --> 01:35:35,000
be familiar with I'd like to draw

1787
01:35:32,510 --> 01:35:38,690
attention to simplifying it then add

1788
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:43,480
lightness quoted by a success the

1789
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:46,900
founder of a very successful racing team

1790
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,900
next slide please

1791
01:35:47,350 --> 01:35:53,180
this is all about getting information

1792
01:35:49,790 --> 01:35:54,950
from the network about the network to

1793
01:35:53,180 --> 01:35:58,610
the endpoints trying to transport data

1794
01:35:54,950 --> 01:36:00,679
across the network these have been many

1795
01:35:58,610 --> 01:36:02,809
attempts at this over the years and the

1796
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:07,400
only protocol that has stood the test of

1797
01:36:02,810 --> 01:36:10,850
and implementation is ecn published in

1798
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,950
2001 almost 20 years ago and just seeing

1799
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:15,410
significant practical deployment in the

1800
01:36:12,950 --> 01:36:20,030
past few years those of you working with

1801
01:36:15,410 --> 01:36:21,800
ipv6 will know that June before is the

1802
01:36:20,030 --> 01:36:23,840
end the only robust indication of

1803
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:26,260
congestion was when packets got lost

1804
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:29,420
usually when the dumb FIFO overflowed

1805
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:32,360
ecn allows in Thank You M to tell the

1806
01:36:29,420 --> 01:36:35,660
receiver of its traffic to slow down

1807
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:39,349
without dropping packets enact which

1808
01:36:35,660 --> 01:36:41,030
wastes upstream capacity and causes

1809
01:36:39,350 --> 01:36:43,340
application delays due to head-of-line

1810
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:45,320
blocking the net effect is that

1811
01:36:43,340 --> 01:36:47,090
observing ecn signals is a good

1812
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:49,880
indication of a better quality of

1813
01:36:47,090 --> 01:36:53,570
network service reduced loss and lower

1814
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:54,950
latency RCC one six eight defines the C

1815
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:58,120
code point to carry this information

1816
01:36:54,950 --> 01:37:01,309
from the ATM to the receiver and the ECE

1817
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:03,860
TCP flag to carry that information back

1818
01:37:01,310 --> 01:37:06,560
to the sender ECE is a sticky bit

1819
01:37:03,860 --> 01:37:08,809
released by CW our response from the

1820
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,850
sender making it a reliable signal

1821
01:37:08,810 --> 01:37:15,500
however it is an imprecise signal of

1822
01:37:12,850 --> 01:37:17,330
course old endpoints and Datagram

1823
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:21,860
transports can't understand the C II

1824
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:24,890
signal so the sender informs the network

1825
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:29,080
that it understands the aqm signals by

1826
01:37:24,890 --> 01:37:34,610
using some code point other than not ECT

1827
01:37:29,080 --> 01:37:36,410
usually ECT 0s seeing adds an additional

1828
01:37:34,610 --> 01:37:40,190
channel of information from the network

1829
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:42,800
to the receiver where a drop or a seee

1830
01:37:40,190 --> 01:37:46,000
mark requests a large reduction in

1831
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:50,090
centrate SCE requests a small reduction

1832
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:52,460
does receiver reflects SCE precisely but

1833
01:37:50,090 --> 01:38:00,050
without an explicit reliability

1834
01:37:52,460 --> 01:38:00,680
guarantee using the ESEE bit okay next

1835
01:38:00,050 --> 01:38:05,390
slide please

1836
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:07,160
a crucial feature of this approach is

1837
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:09,590
that there is no ambiguity at the

1838
01:38:07,160 --> 01:38:11,240
receiver or the sender in whether the

1839
01:38:09,590 --> 01:38:14,630
network is requesting a large reduction

1840
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:16,519
or a small one existing a gate QMS

1841
01:38:14,630 --> 01:38:20,360
especially the most widely deployed

1842
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:23,480
seee marking nqm which is caudal x plex

1843
01:38:20,360 --> 01:38:26,660
CDC e to be interpreted as requesting a

1844
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:28,969
large reduction SC preserves this

1845
01:38:26,660 --> 01:38:30,950
meaning by providing another code point

1846
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:32,710
to carry the request for a small

1847
01:38:30,950 --> 01:38:35,480
reduction

1848
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:38,480
therefore SC e transports one correctly

1849
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:40,459
over all existing networks and existing

1850
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:43,219
transports run correctly over an SCE

1851
01:38:40,460 --> 01:38:47,390
network including networks formed of

1852
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:53,920
arbitrary mixture of SCE ECN and a dumb

1853
01:38:47,390 --> 01:38:53,920
FIFO notes next slide please

1854
01:38:55,300 --> 01:39:00,770
SC marking can be added to existing aqm

1855
01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:04,190
algorithms and many techniques for SC

1856
01:39:00,770 --> 01:39:06,200
marking are feasible in general we

1857
01:39:04,190 --> 01:39:08,570
expect SC marks to be applied at low

1858
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:13,040
acute absent at higher rates than C e

1859
01:39:08,570 --> 01:39:15,769
marks such that flows which respond to

1860
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:19,160
SC e may be able to avoid receiving see

1861
01:39:15,770 --> 01:39:21,290
e marks the tiger on the right should be

1862
01:39:19,160 --> 01:39:24,019
familiar and not only because I showed

1863
01:39:21,290 --> 01:39:27,019
you previously at Montreal it's a vet

1864
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:29,210
wrap which we initially used to add SC

1865
01:39:27,020 --> 01:39:31,490
support to cuddle based aqm us more

1866
01:39:29,210 --> 01:39:33,980
recently we've started using caudal for

1867
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:36,290
SC marking as well which tends to

1868
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:38,959
improve SC's performance on bursty paths

1869
01:39:36,290 --> 01:39:43,580
in the same way as kado works well on

1870
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:45,350
converse d-class mrs. Joe Stewart Josh

1871
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:48,680
from Apple just a clarification about

1872
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:51,290
that graph where you say sojourn time do

1873
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:53,480
you mean the instantaneous sojourn time

1874
01:39:51,290 --> 01:39:56,019
for a particular packet or the minimum

1875
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:57,769
over the last 100 millisecond window

1876
01:39:56,020 --> 01:40:00,290
it's instantaneous

1877
01:39:57,770 --> 01:40:02,090
okay I think it would be good to clarify

1878
01:40:00,290 --> 01:40:04,580
that because everything else Cottle does

1879
01:40:02,090 --> 01:40:06,320
is the minimum over the window so if you

1880
01:40:04,580 --> 01:40:09,170
mean instantaneous I think you need to

1881
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:10,519
call that out as an exception okay well

1882
01:40:09,170 --> 01:40:14,000
for the veg vampire using the

1883
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:16,880
instantaneous time for cuddle marking we

1884
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:21,350
are using the normal cuddle algorithm

1885
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:23,900
but with different parameters so there's

1886
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:26,630
a switch after mega just a quick

1887
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:29,599
clarification question in the range

1888
01:40:26,630 --> 01:40:30,409
where you say see e marking I presume

1889
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:34,400
that this will

1890
01:40:30,409 --> 01:40:37,989
also have 100% se marking continuously

1891
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:37,989
it's the creche that's correct

1892
01:40:38,650 --> 01:40:46,759
my question is where's drop drop is not

1893
01:40:43,730 --> 01:40:49,400
showing under on the graph we would do

1894
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:55,850
you would you would do dropping if the

1895
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:58,420
queue overflows obviously in cobalt aqm

1896
01:40:55,850 --> 01:41:03,130
we also have a blue algorithm which can

1897
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:04,670
do random dropping in case of

1898
01:41:03,130 --> 01:41:10,070
unresponsive floods

1899
01:41:04,670 --> 01:41:12,500
so if drop is kind of drop is just to

1900
01:41:10,070 --> 01:41:15,980
define limit M do you guarantee low

1901
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:21,380
latency or is low how do you heart how

1902
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:24,968
do you mix the delay properties if

1903
01:41:21,380 --> 01:41:24,969
there's no limit on them on the drop

1904
01:41:26,679 --> 01:41:31,780
well obviously if you have a not ECT

1905
01:41:29,210 --> 01:41:36,070
transport then that will get dropped

1906
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:39,889
whenever a see e mark would happen

1907
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:43,809
SCE does not influence the drops

1908
01:41:39,889 --> 01:41:46,580
okay thank you that PI deposit box Joe

1909
01:41:43,810 --> 01:41:50,659
Richard asked a question but I think the

1910
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:53,300
answer was wrong in that area above the

1911
01:41:50,659 --> 01:41:56,210
target where it says CE Marking you

1912
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,500
can't have a hundred-percent SCE because

1913
01:41:56,210 --> 01:42:00,560
you can't have both

1914
01:41:57,500 --> 01:42:02,449
you can either mark a packet s CA or you

1915
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:04,250
can mark it CA but you got to pick one

1916
01:42:02,449 --> 01:42:06,519
or the other so if it's CE Marking that

1917
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:13,340
means it's not SC you can't have both

1918
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:18,040
right so as a clarification we say that

1919
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:21,620
every packet is marked SCE if it is not

1920
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:28,969
otherwise marks EE and that that may

1921
01:42:21,620 --> 01:42:33,170
include incoming CEO marks you could I

1922
01:42:28,969 --> 01:42:35,239
mean can you iterate a little bit what

1923
01:42:33,170 --> 01:42:37,699
you mean on backward competitive because

1924
01:42:35,239 --> 01:42:41,750
like my understanding is that if you

1925
01:42:37,699 --> 01:42:43,969
have a non seee aware and non a non SC

1926
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:44,330
where an SEO airflow competing in the

1927
01:42:43,969 --> 01:42:47,150
same

1928
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:50,570
ICQ that you would see a very different

1929
01:42:47,150 --> 01:42:52,370
behavior than you know what else you see

1930
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:53,799
you I see you right so like I'm not sure

1931
01:42:52,370 --> 01:42:57,260
if that's like fully backward-compatible

1932
01:42:53,800 --> 01:42:59,510
or like what do you actually mean okay I

1933
01:42:57,260 --> 01:43:04,190
do actually have some prepared answer

1934
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:08,080
for that so we're talking about SC

1935
01:43:04,190 --> 01:43:10,730
fairness to non SE flows in a single Q

1936
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:13,790
and vice versa

1937
01:43:10,730 --> 01:43:16,790
the easiest solution is to leave single

1938
01:43:13,790 --> 01:43:19,250
Q nodes without s CD marking capability

1939
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:21,830
this takes advantage of SCS backwards

1940
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:25,310
compatibility in terms of dropped and I

1941
01:43:21,830 --> 01:43:27,890
of Sisu on 6/8 marks the C II response

1942
01:43:25,310 --> 01:43:30,280
is not materially affected by SCE and

1943
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:33,140
this provides a robust solution

1944
01:43:30,280 --> 01:43:35,450
alternatively the upgrade of a note of

1945
01:43:33,140 --> 01:43:38,420
support SCE Marking should be taken as a

1946
01:43:35,450 --> 01:43:41,030
golden opportunity to install some FQ

1947
01:43:38,420 --> 01:43:43,330
capability at the most basic level this

1948
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:47,120
could be CN Q which I'll describe later

1949
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:50,450
but of course a true F Q algorithm would

1950
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:53,180
prefer fairness better some networks may

1951
01:43:50,450 --> 01:44:01,490
choose to employ diffserv to isolate an

1952
01:43:53,180 --> 01:44:03,800
SE enhanced application I have a is

1953
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:06,290
there for question okay so I have a

1954
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:08,530
question to you and you have three

1955
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:11,000
minutes remaining to give the other

1956
01:44:08,530 --> 01:44:14,389
presenters at least a few minutes each

1957
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:15,740
and I would also like to use the sense

1958
01:44:14,390 --> 01:44:18,050
of the room to see how many people have

1959
01:44:15,740 --> 01:44:20,900
read this and have some thoughts on it

1960
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:24,380
so is there any way you would like to

1961
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:29,330
end your talk would you like to choose

1962
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:37,619
which slides you have yes I think if we

1963
01:44:29,330 --> 01:44:42,399
move next slide

1964
01:44:37,619 --> 01:44:49,119
just keep going yeah and I think we'll

1965
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:51,999
leave this 140 CPM okay and okay we have

1966
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:56,499
done a brief evaluation of SCE against

1967
01:44:51,999 --> 01:45:02,110
the five requirements and I think we

1968
01:44:56,499 --> 01:45:05,820
meet one and at least arguably we meet

1969
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:09,579
tuned to the ESC flag next slide

1970
01:45:05,820 --> 01:45:12,090
we definitely meet three we meet four by

1971
01:45:09,579 --> 01:45:15,849
design next slide

1972
01:45:12,090 --> 01:45:19,419
number five is the one where we don't

1973
01:45:15,849 --> 01:45:24,610
meet because we've actually worse than

1974
01:45:19,419 --> 01:45:26,530
cubic in a single new competition but

1975
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,509
that's something we can work on next

1976
01:45:26,530 --> 01:45:29,860
slide

1977
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:33,489
sailing nectar factional congestion

1978
01:45:29,860 --> 01:45:37,780
window we can use pacing scaling to

1979
01:45:33,489 --> 01:45:41,530
demonstrate that and in fact we had

1980
01:45:37,780 --> 01:45:43,509
already done that at Montreal and as far

1981
01:45:41,530 --> 01:45:45,728
as we ordering tolerance on time basis

1982
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:50,189
well we're using Linux and Linux

1983
01:45:45,729 --> 01:45:52,360
supports back okay next slide please and

1984
01:45:50,189 --> 01:45:54,760
there's a brief summary of our progress

1985
01:45:52,360 --> 01:45:57,188
since Montreal which I think I'll skip

1986
01:45:54,760 --> 01:45:59,169
over today except to say that we've

1987
01:45:57,189 --> 01:46:03,459
begun an evaluation if I see you're

1988
01:45:59,169 --> 01:46:07,959
going to IOC 503 3 which will continue

1989
01:46:03,459 --> 01:46:14,139
next slide please can we cut that can we

1990
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:15,669
cut that if we should could we should

1991
01:46:14,139 --> 01:46:19,090
have like some types of questions I've

1992
01:46:15,669 --> 01:46:25,989
got a question I'll go back go through

1993
01:46:19,090 --> 01:46:29,999
to the penultimate slide I think which

1994
01:46:25,989 --> 01:46:34,478
is where this next steps that one yeah

1995
01:46:29,999 --> 01:46:38,919
okay so we are requesting working group

1996
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:40,869
adoption of the SCE draft we believe SCE

1997
01:46:38,919 --> 01:46:42,939
as a useful exponent that is already

1998
01:46:40,869 --> 01:46:44,889
safe to deploy in the general Internet

1999
01:46:42,939 --> 01:46:47,709
we're happy to back that of assertion

2000
01:46:44,889 --> 01:46:49,840
with data some comments have been

2001
01:46:47,709 --> 01:46:51,249
received and noted we will continue our

2002
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:54,400
RFC fibers fees

2003
01:46:51,249 --> 01:46:56,619
evaluation there are some bugs - you

2004
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:59,879
know annotations to track down we want

2005
01:46:56,619 --> 01:47:03,179
to be search methods bah-bah-bah

2006
01:46:59,880 --> 01:47:08,170
we have a lot of flexibility here okay

2007
01:47:03,179 --> 01:47:10,809
let's take questions Bob yeah first of

2008
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:13,800
all I just wanted to reinterpret what

2009
01:47:10,809 --> 01:47:18,909
what you said about SC in a single queue

2010
01:47:13,800 --> 01:47:24,999
essentially you said SCE is starved in a

2011
01:47:18,909 --> 01:47:26,710
single queue against Kubik and so the

2012
01:47:24,999 --> 01:47:30,460
fact that it doesn't work isn't build an

2013
01:47:26,710 --> 01:47:33,159
opportunity for the operator to 0fq that

2014
01:47:30,460 --> 01:47:36,190
that's a precis of what you just said

2015
01:47:33,159 --> 01:47:38,549
just for the room that may not have

2016
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:41,739
followed their very long sentence and

2017
01:47:38,550 --> 01:47:47,860
they don't want to do fq it's not a

2018
01:47:41,739 --> 01:47:51,329
golden opportunity well they can of

2019
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:53,860
course just leave it as it is and

2020
01:47:51,329 --> 01:47:55,030
continue just as well as it's always if

2021
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,768
something doesn't work you can just

2022
01:47:55,030 --> 01:47:59,978
leave it as it is and then you can't

2023
01:47:56,769 --> 01:48:01,420
have the-- but suppose it's advantage

2024
01:47:59,979 --> 01:48:05,409
but that doesn't that's not the solution

2025
01:48:01,420 --> 01:48:07,119
I mean the point is see you don't need

2026
01:48:05,409 --> 01:48:11,170
to replace the network in order to

2027
01:48:07,119 --> 01:48:13,389
deploy scen points no but you don't get

2028
01:48:11,170 --> 01:48:16,090
the if you believe there's an advantage

2029
01:48:13,389 --> 01:48:20,320
of deploying SCE you can't have the

2030
01:48:16,090 --> 01:48:21,940
advantage if you don't deploy it you

2031
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:24,400
can't say that your solution is to do

2032
01:48:21,940 --> 01:48:26,259
nothing you still get the advantage of

2033
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:26,888
if the bottleneck happens to be

2034
01:48:26,260 --> 01:48:29,499
elsewhere

2035
01:48:26,889 --> 01:48:32,050
but at the same time it's still safe of

2036
01:48:29,499 --> 01:48:34,210
the bottleneck move a single edge I

2037
01:48:32,050 --> 01:48:36,039
think we're going to look where we're

2038
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:38,380
going to cut the queue or us we can't do

2039
01:48:36,039 --> 01:48:41,018
much more I mean and we need to actually

2040
01:48:38,380 --> 01:48:43,210
keep the questions within what there's a

2041
01:48:41,019 --> 01:48:47,199
second okay but the second part of my

2042
01:48:43,210 --> 01:48:51,070
question was that cnq is nothing to do

2043
01:48:47,199 --> 01:48:53,079
with SCE because you've still got all

2044
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:57,940
the long-running flows all together in

2045
01:48:53,079 --> 01:49:03,070
one queue so it doesn't it only takes

2046
01:48:57,940 --> 01:49:04,780
the sparse flows out it limits the

2047
01:49:03,070 --> 01:49:11,289
degree of unfairness

2048
01:49:04,780 --> 01:49:12,670
by preventing starvation we shall print

2049
01:49:11,289 --> 01:49:18,070
have that draft presented when it's

2050
01:49:12,670 --> 01:49:19,780
stable and Jana Jana lying or well Asus

2051
01:49:18,070 --> 01:49:21,549
very quickly my understanding is that

2052
01:49:19,780 --> 01:49:24,219
the goal of this is ultimately to get

2053
01:49:21,550 --> 01:49:26,170
low latency transport and if that's the

2054
01:49:24,219 --> 01:49:29,469
case I want to put that as the first

2055
01:49:26,170 --> 01:49:33,030
requirement and backward compatibility

2056
01:49:29,469 --> 01:49:36,190
as as a secondary requirement perhaps

2057
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:37,360
that's my personal opinion my question

2058
01:49:36,190 --> 01:49:38,739
in terms of understanding this is

2059
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:41,469
something that came out of the

2060
01:49:38,739 --> 01:49:43,209
discussion you were just having in a

2061
01:49:41,469 --> 01:49:44,440
backward compatible environment in the

2062
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:50,170
in the world that we are in right now

2063
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:52,210
what benefits does SCE get me and if I

2064
01:49:50,170 --> 01:49:56,920
need to get a low latency transport do I

2065
01:49:52,210 --> 01:49:59,800
need to change the network yes you do

2066
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:03,219
need to get the information from the

2067
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:07,000
network to the endpoints in order to

2068
01:50:03,219 --> 01:50:10,750
gain SC's advantages that's the whole

2069
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:12,309
point it is a signaling mechanism the

2070
01:50:10,750 --> 01:50:16,599
signaling mechanism doesn't give me low

2071
01:50:12,309 --> 01:50:18,579
latency it gives me a signal it gives

2072
01:50:16,599 --> 01:50:24,369
you a signal that the sender can then

2073
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:27,880
respond to but if it's a single cue if

2074
01:50:24,369 --> 01:50:32,710
it's a single cube and you are unable to

2075
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:34,570
deploy FCE with fq there then you just

2076
01:50:32,710 --> 01:50:37,210
have to leave it as a single cue with

2077
01:50:34,570 --> 01:50:40,210
our CC on 6:8 capability and that's it's

2078
01:50:37,210 --> 01:50:42,579
already a big advantage okay okay and

2079
01:50:40,210 --> 01:50:43,869
it's under snow I think I'm kind of

2080
01:50:42,579 --> 01:50:46,480
clarify this in my head and maybe this

2081
01:50:43,869 --> 01:50:49,719
is helping that to actually get low

2082
01:50:46,480 --> 01:50:51,519
latency I will need to get FQ if

2083
01:50:49,719 --> 01:50:53,559
otherwise there's backward compatibility

2084
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,059
but I don't necessarily get low latency

2085
01:50:53,559 --> 01:50:58,119
that's what I'm taking away from this I

2086
01:50:55,059 --> 01:51:00,940
would note that deploying a qm of any

2087
01:50:58,119 --> 01:51:02,558
sort gets you low latency the question

2088
01:51:00,940 --> 01:51:06,669
is whether that's a general circuit is

2089
01:51:02,559 --> 01:51:10,380
also good okay that's I think it's

2090
01:51:06,670 --> 01:51:15,280
gratifying help my question right

2091
01:51:10,380 --> 01:51:18,500
briefly quickly high branch Remmel

2092
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:23,030
quickly I should probably sit down then

2093
01:51:18,500 --> 01:51:25,130
um let me ask sort of a clarifying

2094
01:51:23,030 --> 01:51:26,960
framing question in terms of your first

2095
01:51:25,130 --> 01:51:29,840
point on this slide so requesting

2096
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:31,250
working group adoption I think if we end

2097
01:51:29,840 --> 01:51:33,290
up with a working group adoption call

2098
01:51:31,250 --> 01:51:39,110
and this work adopted by the working

2099
01:51:33,290 --> 01:51:40,550
group we will have two proposals for

2100
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,710
work in the working group that have

2101
01:51:40,550 --> 01:51:43,790
similar goals toward a similar set of

2102
01:51:42,710 --> 01:51:46,880
requirements that the working group is

2103
01:51:43,790 --> 01:51:49,910
adopted but with different to wildly

2104
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:51,950
different deployment stories um is that

2105
01:51:49,910 --> 01:51:53,240
is that an accurate statement like in

2106
01:51:51,950 --> 01:51:54,530
terms of not even wildly different

2107
01:51:53,240 --> 01:51:56,210
deployments or is like wildly different

2108
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:58,190
deployment targets like you know what

2109
01:51:56,210 --> 01:52:00,110
you get what you get in partial

2110
01:51:58,190 --> 01:52:04,280
deployment is different with these two

2111
01:52:00,110 --> 01:52:06,380
proposals um I would suggest to the

2112
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:10,670
working group that a way for there is to

2113
01:52:06,380 --> 01:52:12,290
make the deployment part of that story

2114
01:52:10,670 --> 01:52:13,970
an explicit part of any working group

2115
01:52:12,290 --> 01:52:15,230
deliverable that we would take on this I

2116
01:52:13,970 --> 01:52:16,340
don't know if we're actually going to do

2117
01:52:15,230 --> 01:52:17,809
the call for adoption it's just that

2118
01:52:16,340 --> 01:52:20,450
when I saw that out of here oh we are

2119
01:52:17,810 --> 01:52:22,100
not doing the color animating okay then

2120
01:52:20,450 --> 01:52:23,450
I will sit down and when we do the call

2121
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:25,670
for adoption I will come up and say the

2122
01:52:23,450 --> 01:52:28,610
same thing and I appreciate that and

2123
01:52:25,670 --> 01:52:32,180
that is a concern of the chairs and our

2124
01:52:28,610 --> 01:52:34,099
ad that we do think about how these

2125
01:52:32,180 --> 01:52:36,530
experiments will run and if we would

2126
01:52:34,100 --> 01:52:37,880
sanction two experiments at the same

2127
01:52:36,530 --> 01:52:41,900
time we would need to consider that

2128
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:43,640
seriously not likely I would say beyond

2129
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:45,440
that which is you know is absolutely

2130
01:52:43,640 --> 01:52:47,210
serious concern is you also want to talk

2131
01:52:45,440 --> 01:52:48,500
about the incremental deployment story

2132
01:52:47,210 --> 01:52:50,240
and a transition story for the

2133
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:52,250
deployment of these beyond the

2134
01:52:50,240 --> 01:52:55,519
experiment because that's where I think

2135
01:52:52,250 --> 01:52:57,830
that conflict comes in and yep is even

2136
01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,540
hairier and also the non deployment as

2137
01:52:57,830 --> 01:53:01,190
in what happens when we want to retract

2138
01:52:59,540 --> 01:53:02,690
the experiment these are things that

2139
01:53:01,190 --> 01:53:05,299
we'd have to consider seriously for

2140
01:53:02,690 --> 01:53:08,330
doing any experiment using the same set

2141
01:53:05,300 --> 01:53:10,280
of code points okay thank you yeah I do

2142
01:53:08,330 --> 01:53:12,080
I also have an answer for the teardown

2143
01:53:10,280 --> 01:53:13,280
capability but no leave it for now I

2144
01:53:12,080 --> 01:53:13,580
don't think we can take out at the

2145
01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:15,950
moment

2146
01:53:13,580 --> 01:53:19,150
Neera are you in line with a comment are

2147
01:53:15,950 --> 01:53:22,400
you in mine as an ad or are you thinking

2148
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:25,429
thinking okay that's cool I used to have

2149
01:53:22,400 --> 01:53:27,950
a comment okay and I I think we should

2150
01:53:25,430 --> 01:53:30,980
move on the first line of this by a

2151
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:31,969
simple question to start with who in the

2152
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:41,468
room has

2153
01:53:31,969 --> 01:53:41,469
the draft Morten TSV WGS CA ok 1 2 3 4

2154
01:53:43,870 --> 01:53:54,469
20 people maybe 25 okay and who is

2155
01:53:50,170 --> 01:53:57,199
planning to use the specs in here or

2156
01:53:54,469 --> 01:53:58,940
implement them or do experiments with

2157
01:53:57,199 --> 01:54:01,129
them beyond the team that's developing

2158
01:53:58,940 --> 01:54:03,259
them obviously because I'm the the

2159
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:04,730
authors of are presumably going to

2160
01:54:03,260 --> 01:54:07,660
progress the wrong way but who else is

2161
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:11,419
interested or actually targeting

2162
01:54:07,660 --> 01:54:19,250
experimenting with this of the moment

2163
01:54:11,420 --> 01:54:22,040
other people somebody will be one two

2164
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:23,170
three four five in the room okay thank

2165
01:54:22,040 --> 01:54:26,750
you

2166
01:54:23,170 --> 01:54:29,780
mmm is there anything else you want to

2167
01:54:26,750 --> 01:54:31,370
ask the chairs I think we have some

2168
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:36,889
information there we won't be running

2169
01:54:31,370 --> 01:54:38,300
the adoption call this meeting and we

2170
01:54:36,890 --> 01:54:40,550
can talk more with you offline about

2171
01:54:38,300 --> 01:54:43,060
what might be required by the working

2172
01:54:40,550 --> 01:54:47,060
group to have that adoption call

2173
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:48,410
certainly and I think we should cut to

2174
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:53,620
allow the other speakers at least some

2175
01:54:48,410 --> 01:54:53,620
time okay thank you thank you very much

2176
01:54:57,310 --> 01:55:04,880
okay comments on can we take the qci

2177
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:12,949
draft if anybody in the room wants to

2178
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:16,510
talk to that do we have anyone in the

2179
01:55:12,949 --> 01:55:30,860
room which is to say something yeah

2180
01:55:16,510 --> 01:55:33,440
write this with us from perspective labs

2181
01:55:30,860 --> 01:55:36,349
I have a quick question and the process

2182
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,870
for the QC I jobs yes I think we had

2183
01:55:36,350 --> 01:55:41,150
some resolutions in the last meeting yes

2184
01:55:38,870 --> 01:55:42,739
and now I see it's informational okay

2185
01:55:41,150 --> 01:55:44,599
that's good but what would be the

2186
01:55:42,739 --> 01:55:45,490
process from the chairs perspective that

2187
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:48,130
will be

2188
01:55:45,490 --> 01:55:50,740
is it an ed upon cert or is it a working

2189
01:55:48,130 --> 01:55:54,070
group will be item it is not a working

2190
01:55:50,740 --> 01:55:57,250
group item okay moment and we will have

2191
01:55:54,070 --> 01:55:59,200
to discuss and we don't have been put to

2192
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:01,390
discuss that and we will also check with

2193
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:03,910
other people about their interest in

2194
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:06,100
this including 3gpp here is impacted so

2195
01:56:03,910 --> 01:56:08,139
we will not make that adoption call

2196
01:56:06,100 --> 01:56:09,820
until we have consulted with people but

2197
01:56:08,140 --> 01:56:11,500
we're encouraging people to read and

2198
01:56:09,820 --> 01:56:18,160
work on the on the document to make it

2199
01:56:11,500 --> 01:56:21,580
better okay thank you give you a lot of

2200
01:56:18,160 --> 01:56:24,519
time I'll try to be really quick Fabio

2201
01:56:21,580 --> 01:56:27,000
karela from Telecom Italia and we

2202
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:31,030
developed some solutions to improve the

2203
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:33,250
measurements that is done using the spin

2204
01:56:31,030 --> 01:56:35,259
bit I'll be really quick in this part

2205
01:56:33,250 --> 01:56:37,660
all of you know I think there's been bit

2206
01:56:35,260 --> 01:56:42,250
working mechanisms we added the

2207
01:56:37,660 --> 01:56:45,790
additional bit that is used to try to

2208
01:56:42,250 --> 01:56:47,650
solve these three main problems that can

2209
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:49,120
be found on the spin bit mechanisms the

2210
01:56:47,650 --> 01:56:51,339
first one is the packet loss that tends

2211
01:56:49,120 --> 01:56:53,050
to it cause the wrong estimate around

2212
01:56:51,340 --> 01:56:56,590
trip time and the second one is the

2213
01:56:53,050 --> 01:57:00,190
reordering of spin edges that caused the

2214
01:56:56,590 --> 01:57:04,810
creation of multiple spurious edges and

2215
01:57:00,190 --> 01:57:09,610
so the multiple observation of round

2216
01:57:04,810 --> 01:57:11,830
trip time per spin bit period and the

2217
01:57:09,610 --> 01:57:15,250
third problem is the introduction of

2218
01:57:11,830 --> 01:57:17,650
alts in the traffic flow done by

2219
01:57:15,250 --> 01:57:20,860
application limited sender that in this

2220
01:57:17,650 --> 01:57:23,320
case can cause some delay in the edge

2221
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:25,570
reflection and so the wrong estimation

2222
01:57:23,320 --> 01:57:28,030
of the round-trip time with the

2223
01:57:25,570 --> 01:57:30,190
additional delay bit we solve this

2224
01:57:28,030 --> 01:57:31,630
problem is a single pocket that bounced

2225
01:57:30,190 --> 01:57:36,339
between transit service so the

2226
01:57:31,630 --> 01:57:41,040
measurement is done using the time of

2227
01:57:36,340 --> 01:57:43,360
the of two consecutive delay sample okay

2228
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:45,580
okay I'll go directly to the second

2229
01:57:43,360 --> 01:57:50,710
mechanism that is the one where we went

2230
01:57:45,580 --> 01:57:54,070
where we want to focus okay okay we

2231
01:57:50,710 --> 01:57:57,239
define also a second measurement that

2232
01:57:54,070 --> 01:57:59,369
it's possible to achieve

2233
01:57:57,239 --> 01:58:00,928
using the spin beat in one

2234
01:57:59,369 --> 01:58:02,999
implementation or it's possible to

2235
01:58:00,929 --> 01:58:05,550
implement using two bits so without

2236
01:58:02,999 --> 01:58:07,380
relying on the on the spin beat we

2237
01:58:05,550 --> 01:58:09,929
define a new performance metric the

2238
01:58:07,380 --> 01:58:12,179
round three packet loss and this means

2239
01:58:09,929 --> 01:58:15,749
that we measure the end to end between

2240
01:58:12,179 --> 01:58:18,900
client and server a packet loss in round

2241
01:58:15,749 --> 01:58:21,840
three obviously how it works the

2242
01:58:18,900 --> 01:58:24,388
mechanisms is really simple we mark a

2243
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:26,940
train of pocket real parts of production

2244
01:58:24,389 --> 01:58:30,030
packets these packets bounce between

2245
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:32,159
clients and servers and complete two

2246
01:58:30,030 --> 01:58:34,349
rounds so on observer plays on whatever

2247
01:58:32,159 --> 01:58:37,049
direction can count and compare the

2248
01:58:34,349 --> 01:58:39,380
packet seen in the first round and in

2249
01:58:37,050 --> 01:58:41,579
the second round and compute

2250
01:58:39,380 --> 01:58:44,070
statistically measurement of the loss

2251
01:58:41,579 --> 01:58:46,590
rate of the connection diminution in

2252
01:58:44,070 --> 01:58:48,150
this case is that usually uplink and

2253
01:58:46,590 --> 01:58:53,940
downlink have different parking rates

2254
01:58:48,150 --> 01:58:55,829
but this can be solved by by generating

2255
01:58:53,940 --> 01:58:59,308
pocket that are the slowest traffic

2256
01:58:55,829 --> 01:59:02,429
direction so using a token system we can

2257
01:58:59,309 --> 01:59:07,110
achieve these results can I suggest you

2258
01:59:02,429 --> 01:59:09,630
park there and just go to the end go to

2259
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:14,308
the your very last slide and in theory

2260
01:59:09,630 --> 01:59:15,840
because yeah and while you're doing

2261
01:59:14,309 --> 01:59:18,030
while you're thinking about what you'd

2262
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:19,590
like to say is your end I'll just do a

2263
01:59:18,030 --> 01:59:20,460
brief update from the chairs on this

2264
01:59:19,590 --> 01:59:22,949
particular topic

2265
01:59:20,460 --> 01:59:25,320
we believe that mechanisms to do this

2266
01:59:22,949 --> 01:59:27,539
could be talked about in this working

2267
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:30,179
group so the this one is a mechanism

2268
01:59:27,539 --> 01:59:32,150
that's being worked on by people who are

2269
01:59:30,179 --> 01:59:35,070
coming on to this meeting that's great

2270
01:59:32,150 --> 01:59:37,589
we also believe that the mechanisms when

2271
01:59:35,070 --> 01:59:39,268
they're instantiation protocols will be

2272
01:59:37,590 --> 01:59:43,349
developed within the working groups that

2273
01:59:39,269 --> 01:59:45,389
they target so in future this work will

2274
01:59:43,349 --> 01:59:47,190
probably be adopted in a different

2275
01:59:45,389 --> 01:59:49,230
working group unless it just becomes a

2276
01:59:47,190 --> 01:59:51,089
generic mechanism so if you're thinking

2277
01:59:49,230 --> 01:59:53,638
about why is this here what its future

2278
01:59:51,090 --> 01:59:55,110
is that's the scope you can have your

2279
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:57,329
finals over the last couple of minutes

2280
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:58,739
of a meeting oh yes I mean firstly I

2281
01:59:57,329 --> 02:00:00,929
want to say that this mechanism can be

2282
01:59:58,739 --> 02:00:05,329
applied on connection-oriented protocol

2283
02:00:00,929 --> 02:00:08,130
so we try to propose it for the weak

2284
02:00:05,329 --> 02:00:10,200
protocol but it can be used in any

2285
02:00:08,130 --> 02:00:12,060
connection oriented protocol

2286
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:14,340
and this is because we have two

2287
02:00:12,060 --> 02:00:15,720
implementations the first one that rely

2288
02:00:14,340 --> 02:00:19,770
on this pivot and the second one that

2289
02:00:15,720 --> 02:00:25,140
can be used using two bits so without

2290
02:00:19,770 --> 02:00:27,930
any spin bit implication and other

2291
02:00:25,140 --> 02:00:30,480
things never say is that in this working

2292
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:35,220
loop there's another draft that is

2293
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:38,400
talking about that talks about loss and

2294
02:00:35,220 --> 02:00:41,340
this is the one that is mentioned in the

2295
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:45,420
in the other of these lights and we did

2296
02:00:41,340 --> 02:00:49,440
also a slides where we compared the two

2297
02:00:45,420 --> 02:00:51,840
mechanisms so it could be interesting to

2298
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:54,599
have a discussion about these two

2299
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:58,200
mechanisms and try to find a direct

2300
02:00:54,600 --> 02:01:02,160
place where we can discuss these this

2301
02:00:58,200 --> 02:01:04,110
sort of mechanisms also because I think

2302
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:06,870
they are really useful to understand

2303
02:01:04,110 --> 02:01:09,990
where the laws are located because with

2304
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:11,670
for example with our mechanisms we can

2305
02:01:09,990 --> 02:01:13,860
understand if the loss is before the

2306
02:01:11,670 --> 02:01:18,270
observer after the observer and if we

2307
02:01:13,860 --> 02:01:20,280
use two observers we can also compute

2308
02:01:18,270 --> 02:01:23,460
them the loss that is between the two

2309
02:01:20,280 --> 02:01:26,280
observers so this could be a good way to

2310
02:01:23,460 --> 02:01:28,590
measure the loss inside the domain of

2311
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:30,599
the network operators so I think it's

2312
02:01:28,590 --> 02:01:33,720
thank you ever so much

2313
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:36,720
and thank you for being so brief in your

2314
02:01:33,720 --> 02:01:37,440
explanation you want to take both short

2315
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:41,820
comments

2316
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:43,080
go Eric Kinnear so I will skip past a

2317
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:45,420
lot of the other discussion that we've

2318
02:01:43,080 --> 02:01:49,290
been having elsewhere anyway but the two

2319
02:01:45,420 --> 02:01:50,760
things I wanted to say are first I thank

2320
02:01:49,290 --> 02:01:52,740
you for doing this I think these are

2321
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:56,340
interesting measurements to be able to

2322
02:01:52,740 --> 02:01:58,710
gain and secondly I would be much more

2323
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:00,780
interested in a generic way to do this

2324
02:01:58,710 --> 02:02:02,340
rather than trying to push this into

2325
02:02:00,780 --> 02:02:05,130
each and every protocol that it needs to

2326
02:02:02,340 --> 02:02:07,500
do so this this kind of feels like the

2327
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:11,130
right place to discuss it Uncas an

2328
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:14,850
interesting comment Brian Brian Trammell

2329
02:02:11,130 --> 02:02:17,910
co-chair IPP M up here to agree within

2330
02:02:14,850 --> 02:02:21,140
contradict Eric at the same time I think

2331
02:02:17,910 --> 02:02:24,540
that there's a there's a question as to

2332
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:26,130
like so we have a history of looking at

2333
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:29,070
generic mechanisms for these sorts of

2334
02:02:26,130 --> 02:02:31,230
things in AI ppm like so the IOM work is

2335
02:02:29,070 --> 02:02:35,400
exactly the same sort of thing I think

2336
02:02:31,230 --> 02:02:36,629
that in any case the I mean it's a lot

2337
02:02:35,400 --> 02:02:40,290
of the same people in the same rooms

2338
02:02:36,630 --> 02:02:41,460
rate so I TS pwg needs to be apprised of

2339
02:02:40,290 --> 02:02:42,600
this work as it goes forward because

2340
02:02:41,460 --> 02:02:43,920
that's where the details of these

2341
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,180
encapsulations are going to work out

2342
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,340
when you actually find into a transport

2343
02:02:45,180 --> 02:02:51,630
protocol but we'd also be happy to see

2344
02:02:47,340 --> 02:02:54,210
this work in AI ppm and I think bike

2345
02:02:51,630 --> 02:02:57,270
just just the illustrate how hard this

2346
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:59,190
is i ppm is the right place to decide

2347
02:02:57,270 --> 02:03:01,740
what the metrics are because the

2348
02:02:59,190 --> 02:03:04,620
expertise lies there so you probably

2349
02:03:01,740 --> 02:03:06,809
have multiple pieces to put together we

2350
02:03:04,620 --> 02:03:08,849
can do mechanisms but we would then D

2351
02:03:06,810 --> 02:03:09,900
die ppm to talk about measurements and

2352
02:03:08,850 --> 02:03:10,830
there you would need to influence

2353
02:03:09,900 --> 02:03:12,660
protocols

2354
02:03:10,830 --> 02:03:14,760
none of which should deter you from

2355
02:03:12,660 --> 02:03:16,830
doing this work please talk to other

2356
02:03:14,760 --> 02:03:18,870
people and find good ways to do this

2357
02:03:16,830 --> 02:03:22,230
alternately we could have a discussion

2358
02:03:18,870 --> 02:03:24,120
ni ppm and TSP WG about where the

2359
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:27,929
precise boundary between our charters as

2360
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:29,309
on this point but yeah who cares please

2361
02:03:27,930 --> 02:03:33,200
just work with people to make this

2362
02:03:29,310 --> 02:03:33,200
happen in multiple places for the moment

2363
02:03:33,230 --> 02:03:40,019
I'm amused if I'm from Orange actually

2364
02:03:37,830 --> 02:03:44,040
we don't care where the work will be

2365
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:47,120
done but do it now okay thanks

2366
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:49,670
yeah I just wanted to point to some

2367
02:03:47,120 --> 02:03:52,980
quite old work now done by the ITF

2368
02:03:49,670 --> 02:03:55,710
called congestion exposure which had

2369
02:03:52,980 --> 02:03:57,570
that lost bit in a congestion bit that

2370
02:03:55,710 --> 02:03:59,370
the sender put back into the network

2371
02:03:57,570 --> 02:04:01,019
from its feedback so that anywhere in

2372
02:03:59,370 --> 02:04:03,210
the network you could tell how much loss

2373
02:04:01,020 --> 02:04:07,560
was upstream of that point and

2374
02:04:03,210 --> 02:04:09,540
downstream of that point from any in any

2375
02:04:07,560 --> 02:04:11,190
measurement point in the network thing

2376
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:15,450
that and that was at the IP layer for

2377
02:04:11,190 --> 02:04:18,660
generic protocols thank you for every

2378
02:04:15,450 --> 02:04:22,200
ideas wouldn't support it Oh going up

2379
02:04:18,660 --> 02:04:24,210
okay thank you everybody for coming here

2380
02:04:22,200 --> 02:04:26,519
and a chairs note that there was one

2381
02:04:24,210 --> 02:04:28,980
person on Java and said they we're

2382
02:04:26,520 --> 02:04:30,330
willing to work upon SC apart from the

2383
02:04:28,980 --> 02:04:33,330
people in the room we will record that

2384
02:04:30,330 --> 02:04:37,050
and we will be meeting again at the next

2385
02:04:33,330 --> 02:04:38,449
IETF we plan to do a lot of work on the

2386
02:04:37,050 --> 02:04:41,510
mailing list please use them

2387
02:04:38,449 --> 02:04:43,690
please be constructive on the mailing

2388
02:04:41,510 --> 02:04:46,280
list to address technical comments

2389
02:04:43,690 --> 02:04:47,599
please don't make judgment calls on the

2390
02:04:46,280 --> 02:04:49,130
mailing list about the value of

2391
02:04:47,600 --> 02:04:51,610
something but please make technical

2392
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:53,900
comments to try and progress items or to

2393
02:04:51,610 --> 02:04:57,699
indicate where additional work is

2394
02:04:53,900 --> 02:04:57,699
required thank you ever so much
