[Music]

2
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:24,250
ABCB or something like that engineering

3
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:27,990
signaling a suit and are those cuff suit

4
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,990
suit was also at the scene

5
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:41,419
that's a pretty session they're blending

6
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,330
up it soon Pavillion can I confess I

7
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:48,820
actually looked a guy up you did mr.

8
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,820
Dearborne well

9
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,180
[Music]

10
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:54,069
why don't me

11
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:27,099
yeah I have a second thing don't you

12
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:30,540
think things would be necessary 160 I'm

13
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:39,160
sure so welcome

14
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:54,519
did you happen to see rink okay well we

15
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:56,980
should get started I think so

16
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:06,900
welcome to the money working group

17
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:10,510
meeting at ITF 106 this is the note well

18
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:12,819
even if this is your very first ITF

19
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:15,209
meeting you probably should have seen

20
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:21,779
this a couple of times before this week

21
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:21,780
but do take note of what is listed there

22
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:30,690
this is not going to be a regular

23
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:35,820
run-of-the-mill

24
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:43,840
working group session and the reason is

25
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:45,789
known to most of us the chair of this

26
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,650
working group Stan Ratliff passed away

27
00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:53,950
on October 22nd therefore we will have a

28
00:04:50,650 --> 00:05:00,299
short session and afterwards we will

29
00:04:53,950 --> 00:05:05,940
have an informal get-together in the bar

30
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,940
in the Stanford hotel ground floor

31
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,680
everybody is obviously invited to go

32
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:20,130
there so the idea is to keep this

33
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:23,440
session as short as possible just do a

34
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:25,510
document status update there will be no

35
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:31,890
presentations and as soon as we're done

36
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:36,719
we're out of here this is the agenda I

37
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:53,400
would appreciate at least a note-taker

38
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:58,720
Thank You Adam Jairus cried maybe so

39
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:03,840
document status we have one document in

40
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:13,180
the RFC Arabic you this is the link ID

41
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:16,919
extension of dilip of which Stan Redleaf

42
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:21,730
was an author Rick Taylor's and author

43
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:25,120
then we have one document the deal app

44
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,240
latency extension that has been approved

45
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,000
but I think some technicalities need to

46
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:34,710
be fixed in the document and it has been

47
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:44,440
in that state for a very long time over

48
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:46,030
100 days so authors are invited to do

49
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,920
something there I think if the action is

50
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:59,710
with the others but I correct me if I'm

51
00:06:47,920 --> 00:07:02,020
wrong ok and then we have three

52
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:06,849
documents that are in working group last

53
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,620
call status and have been for a while

54
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:11,270
[Music]

55
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,380
they have expired at the beginning of

56
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:19,640
September one of the authors in the

57
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:22,730
audience Lou has refreshed them revived

58
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:27,020
them this very morning so they're now

59
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:31,750
active again my idea on these documents

60
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:35,690
is that I don't think there have been a

61
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:39,430
lot of comments during this extended

62
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:42,830
working group last call period I

63
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,990
actually did you may notice that there's

64
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,479
some changes in each of the documents at

65
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,750
the time the comments came in I mrs. Lee

66
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,030
Berger

67
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,720
I made the changes to the document but

68
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,729
didn't push them so I believe that all

69
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,700
any comment that has been received has

70
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,470
been addressed but it's been a while so

71
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,130
you know we should go through the list

72
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:08,030
and go through them okay so they might

73
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,070
actually ignore content then the ones

74
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:13,280
that aligned they all have very small

75
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:14,900
that's good changes I'll have to go

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,869
through it and figure out what all those

77
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:20,929
changes works it was a while ago so what

78
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:25,630
I propose to do then is to do a quick

79
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,090
new working group rosco ending let's say

80
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:31,010
three weeks from now two weeks from now

81
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:36,829
I've been waiting so long it yeah

82
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:40,700
whatever we do is fine and then I guess

83
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:44,000
I get to be the shepherd of these

84
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:51,920
documents so that will be a new

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,690
experience as well this is not my last

86
00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:03,020
line it's my last life on document

87
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:06,190
status anyway so what else is left after

88
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:08,510
we get these documents out the door well

89
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:13,880
Lou made blue burger and made a

90
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:18,259
presentation at the previous ITF on deal

91
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:22,939
with multicast issues and the link

92
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:26,259
is given in the slides the idea is that

93
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:32,899
it's will result in an internet draft

94
00:09:26,259 --> 00:09:39,399
and who has volunteered to kick this off

95
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:43,959
to take this over from stem actually and

96
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:50,809
we're aiming for African internet draft

97
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:54,919
somewhere in January and I'm willing to

98
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:57,589
help in any way I can to progress this

99
00:09:54,919 --> 00:10:04,519
work because I also think personally

100
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:07,100
that it's interesting yeah sorry I

101
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:10,100
talked to mrs. Liu Berger again I talked

102
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,449
to David about it that the slide

103
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,739
presentation was actually joint work

104
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:18,128
with David Wiggins I talked to him about

105
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:20,209
jumping on trying to get a draft out

106
00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:22,160
briefly we talked about trying to push

107
00:10:20,209 --> 00:10:24,559
it for this meeting when we heard about

108
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,480
Stan I thought that was a little tight

109
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,129
so we should be able to do that and

110
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,049
we're happy to send you a first draft

111
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:34,730
that were what we put together and

112
00:10:30,049 --> 00:10:37,249
collaborate on it if you're willing yes

113
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:39,829
there will be excellent thank you there

114
00:10:37,249 --> 00:10:42,410
is also one or two other implementation

115
00:10:39,829 --> 00:10:44,149
details that David has run across that

116
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:45,769
we were thinking of putting into one

117
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:49,429
draft rather than running it as a second

118
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:51,529
draft we don't have to talk to technical

119
00:10:49,429 --> 00:10:59,499
details now but if you want we can do it

120
00:10:51,529 --> 00:11:03,799
offline but we don't have any other

121
00:10:59,499 --> 00:11:08,299
pending work and yet any other pending

122
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:13,970
internet droves I should say if you look

123
00:11:08,299 --> 00:11:16,970
at our charter so this was what I was

124
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,720
gonna ask on the prior slide we had had

125
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:20,659
an agreement

126
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:24,489
about two or three meetings ago ago to

127
00:11:20,659 --> 00:11:29,600
do an adoption call on a 1/4 document

128
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:31,399
and so just one apologies yes so in

129
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,620
terms of the prior slide we were talking

130
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,720
about

131
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,040
documents I think we had one more that

132
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,690
had been discussed in the working group

133
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,390
and the intent was to do an adoption

134
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:45,240
call on it so I had hoped that we could

135
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:46,830
do that adoption call and it's the one

136
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,960
once that the both the Ethernet flow

137
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,180
control Ethan the flow control Wow oh

138
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,710
good yeah yeah I mean I think it may

139
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,800
have even been like a year ago that we

140
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:59,270
had agreed to do an adoption college

141
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,270
this wasn't happening right

142
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,920
yeah they had been in a it had been in

143
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:07,050
appendix as an example and we decided

144
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,569
just in in a session we said let's make

145
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:14,000
it a real document so we did that work

146
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:16,440
and said we were gonna adopt it and then

147
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,630
anyway things happens things happen so

148
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,640
I'd hope to add that back to the list

149
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,710
and maybe get that adoption calls

150
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:26,370
started right after this meeting you

151
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,810
know I I get I don't think we should

152
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,580
wait another cycle just to have it

153
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:32,150
presented again but you know if that's

154
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:38,790
what needs to be done we can do that

155
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:41,339
no I will sent an email to the link with

156
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:48,839
to the list with a link to the document

157
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:51,180
and then ask people to to check on it

158
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:58,950
and say if they're okay with adopting it

159
00:12:51,180 --> 00:13:02,670
as a working group document I had a look

160
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:06,839
at our Charter and we're doing fine in

161
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:08,120
the deal at extensions Department you've

162
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:12,990
got that covered

163
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:20,600
however the Charter also men's mentions

164
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:24,330
multicast work and documenting

165
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:29,160
televisions and best practices practices

166
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:32,010
on deploying and managing minase I don't

167
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,740
think very much has happened there over

168
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:37,040
the past few years so question would be

169
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,860
[Music]

170
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,319
what do we do with that are we obliged

171
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,680
to address that

172
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,500
[Music]

173
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,199
Rick Taylor um so ironically Stan and I

174
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:53,070
were just putting pen to paper for a

175
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:57,520
dewlap extension for a sparse mode pin

176
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,920
but obviously events have overtaken that

177
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:02,230
slightly so and it's still early days so

178
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,280
it wasn't quite ready to come here right

179
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,450
we haven't worked out whether there was

180
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:14,860
any good begin that's Twp extensions not

181
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:18,070
multicast many routing I wonder that

182
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:25,620
about anything so you asked we have to

183
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:25,620
do what's the Charter ideally yes but

184
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:30,430
yeah the pendants of course and what

185
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:34,060
they'll work if the workgroup thinks has

186
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:37,030
every deliver that that specific item in

187
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:39,400
the Charter was actually the results of

188
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:42,760
compromise that we got into many years

189
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:44,980
ago with the off Sadie's because we had

190
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,110
had a similar item at the Charter there

191
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:54,280
was a document that was produced that

192
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:56,250
ended up being also specific and we in

193
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,990
the aegis I did not publish that draft

194
00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:01,900
but when we came back to reach our

195
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:04,270
terminate at that time we wanted to add

196
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,319
that item in here so that we wouldn't

197
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:10,990
forget so you know at the time there was

198
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:23,630
apparently interest and by someone to do

199
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:27,650
it but okay maybe another court

200
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:35,050
to the mailing list if there's anybody

201
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:38,300
out there who could so Rick Taylor again

202
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:42,319
confession time I'm actively working on

203
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:45,050
multicast back at home at work and I've

204
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,300
looked at SMF and I'm actually looking

205
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,280
at the stuff that's coming out of in and

206
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,199
looking at doing variations there and

207
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:58,699
I'm actually unconvinced whether what

208
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:01,760
we're doing is particularly many unique

209
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:05,210
I mean it may be some ways to make what

210
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,370
pin saw specific sparse mode is doing in

211
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,560
terms of picking out the tree and things

212
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:12,710
like that whether you can tweak that to

213
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,510
work better in many's or in networks

214
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:18,650
that look a lot like some types of MANET

215
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:20,770
I if it was to be something I wrote up I

216
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,540
would probably take it back to pin

217
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:26,600
because they're the guys who really know

218
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:31,610
about this stuff and I I remember it was

219
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:34,760
Brian Adamson and Justin's team who were

220
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:38,240
looking heavily at SMF etc and they're

221
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:40,400
not here anymore so I don't know what

222
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:47,300
I'm trying to say about that but it's a

223
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:49,579
comment that goes back to the same point

224
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:54,050
about the last thing which is actually

225
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:56,390
your last bullet right we need to if at

226
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:59,569
some point or at some point we need to

227
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,610
discuss know where do we go right yeah

228
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,200
here were the new items that would pick

229
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,270
up any of the old stuff I do remember

230
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,430
Justin saying at one point that yes he

231
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:10,579
had been working on multicast but that

232
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,839
because of work constraints he couldn't

233
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:13,129
bring it here

234
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,800
not that he didn't want to but he

235
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:17,800
couldn't bring it here

236
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:26,958
to card so just looking at the precise

237
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:29,300
words in the Charter it says we will do

238
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,300
liaison with the PIM working group

239
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:35,419
it also says we will do multicast based

240
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:41,960
upon SMF so there's a little bit of a

241
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:43,309
conflict not right in I sorry Rick

242
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,880
Ritter get us a follow up comment about

243
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:48,680
SM FA I know moving around industry

244
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,380
industry thinks SMF is a protocol ready

245
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:53,960
to go and I've had the conversations

246
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,690
rhythm to say well no it's it's I

247
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,790
believe an experimental draft that

248
00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:02,000
discusses some best practices in

249
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:04,190
experimental experimental RFC sorry that

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,730
talks about best practices when doing

251
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:12,590
tense about flooding it's not a solution

252
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:15,080
so there's a danger that if MANET stops

253
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:16,730
and says well SMF is good enough people

254
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,159
might think it is good enough and I'm

255
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:21,230
not convinced it is there's a second

256
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:23,630
point to this which is a lot of the very

257
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:25,220
many specific multicast topics are kind

258
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:27,650
of being picked up the link layer now a

259
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,330
lot of the meshing radios are doing

260
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,780
multicast that's tuned to their link

261
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:34,909
their technologies so I would be pushing

262
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:36,889
if we were to go down the meltdown the

263
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:39,350
multicast route it would be talking

264
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:41,600
about maintaining multicast in

265
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:45,199
heterogeneous link their technology

266
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,790
Manet's right and and that starting to

267
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,559
drift heavily into pin again and I know

268
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:56,928
we're supposed to be pin lazing I don't

269
00:18:48,559 --> 00:19:01,600
have an answer it's just okay I don't

270
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:04,070
want to go into the technical

271
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,340
discussions right now because the

272
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,220
reasons I just pointed out as much as

273
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:14,059
this I'm personally interested in this

274
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:23,660
in this topic but take it to the list I

275
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:25,340
think so yes we we need to get more

276
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:31,920
energy in the group I've been talking

277
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:35,760
with our ad earlier this week I have

278
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:39,480
couple of ideas also to bring back some

279
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,450
some all's our work may be because

280
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:47,580
otherwise we could rename ourselves to

281
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:52,350
the developed working group almost I do

282
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:56,909
have an idea myself on another deal a

283
00:19:52,350 --> 00:20:02,010
data item I need to check whether that

284
00:19:56,910 --> 00:20:06,870
actually holds water but I'm hoping to

285
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:09,930
write it up and have it ready here also

286
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:13,050
somewhere in January so that would be

287
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:16,160
something and then there's the

288
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:21,210
presentation that I gave last time on

289
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:24,360
internet routing that's outside the

290
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,920
scope of our current charter at that

291
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,139
meeting in Montreal some people

292
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:30,870
expressed interest in working on that

293
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,870
since I have also had email from

294
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:36,510
somebody from outside this community who

295
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,729
was interested in that I have incurred

296
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:46,610
anchors this person to take that to our

297
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:46,610
mailing list that hasn't happened yet so

298
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:54,150
that would be another thing to pick up

299
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:57,899
some topics that are not covered by our

300
00:20:54,150 --> 00:21:02,790
current a charter but then we would need

301
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:05,400
to reach out and I can see that there

302
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:07,500
has to be some evidence that there are

303
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:12,390
people there actually doing the work for

304
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:20,670
that to go down well it already and the

305
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:30,660
ISD in general I think so that sort of

306
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:34,530
brings me to last the agenda item we

307
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:40,350
have some things to go over with respect

308
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:42,720
to where this group is going I think we

309
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,469
can do that in the in the few weeks to

310
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,040
come

311
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:51,530
at the same time blue and Dave and

312
00:21:49,040 --> 00:22:00,260
myself will be working on these new

313
00:21:51,530 --> 00:22:04,930
drafts and then the idea is to have an

314
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:10,280
interim meeting well before Vancouver

315
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:14,180
but also allowing for for some time to

316
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:16,940
do some active work so I might hear

317
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:20,270
about this and I'm putting this to you

318
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:24,650
it's to do this end of January or

319
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:28,960
beginning on February 20 20 I don't know

320
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,960
whether anyone has any opinions on that

321
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:40,010
Rick Taylor I think that makes a lot of

322
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:51,580
sense the timing is good yeah virtual or

323
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:57,680
physical virtual web access so with that

324
00:22:51,580 --> 00:23:03,340
I'm at the end of of the agenda so

325
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,340
unless anybody has any other business

326
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,340
already

327
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,410
yeah just wanna say one thing real quick

328
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,220
I know we need to be at the power in

329
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:16,750
