1
00:00:35,530 --> 00:01:36,340
it works yes on your it's also started

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,640
okay welcome everyone let's get started

3
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:53,570
with the finding research group session

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,310
so as usual

5
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,440
since we are in an ITF meeting the note

6
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:00,590
will applies this is the short version

7
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,450
of the note well there's also now an

8
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,780
updated longer version essentially says

9
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:09,560
same thing IPR rules of IETF they apply

10
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:12,940
also in the IRT of sight you are being

11
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:16,190
recorded and be nice to each other and

12
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,709
the goals of the IRT F it's good good to

13
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,829
remind that now we are on the research

14
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:24,290
branch of the of the of the organization

15
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:26,180
so here our idea is to conduct research

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,579
instead of two standards but of course

17
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:31,190
we do a lot of collaboration with the

18
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,049
IETF so we are discussing a lot of

19
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,570
things that are related to standards but

20
00:02:33,049 --> 00:02:36,680
here are really our goal is about

21
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:39,410
advancing knowledge and sharing the

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,660
knowledge about topics relevant on IOT

23
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,890
at the IETF so the pink sheets or

24
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:49,230
nowadays bullets are going around

25
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:52,200
thanks for volunteering note-takers

26
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:54,179
Nicholas and evil Oh anyone is also free

27
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,190
to chime in on the note takers on the

28
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,460
etherpad online let's hope it works

29
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:03,480
better than earlier this week is anyone

30
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:05,190
using jabber okay you can also just in

31
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,010
case hang out at the jabber room see if

32
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:11,700
we have if you have anyone chiming in on

33
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:15,000
the chat room as usual you will find our

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,089
daily activities and more information at

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,760
our mailing list and we do share all the

36
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,090
materials as usual at our github

37
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,670
repository we have had one reposted per

38
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,410
meeting you can find me information

39
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:35,310
about this meeting particular at the

40
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:37,350
github repo tools in 1990 f-106 agenda

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:39,480
for today we are now in the introduction

42
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,920
part I will give a quick update on the

43
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,829
research group status what is upcoming

44
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,989
meetings and activities then we'll have

45
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,300
reports from our other activists

46
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:51,570
including we shape a meeting we had on

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,580
Friday before the IETF week hackathon

48
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:57,600
and quick one on the core application

49
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:59,400
site meeting after that Michael coaster

50
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,950
will give us an update on the activities

51
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,500
on IOT data model convergence in

52
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:06,630
particular one day tomorrow Michael

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,290
McCool will give us an update on a

54
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:12,930
double receiver of things and finally we

55
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,410
have reserved a quite substantial slot

56
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,750
towards the end of the meeting for

57
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,430
discussing about this general IOT

58
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,180
operations security management of on

59
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:27,630
boring life cycle etc a potential for a

60
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:30,450
new group or activity at the IETF or

61
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,520
looking at the IOT aspects at large this

62
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,039
is a discussion that has been going on

63
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,870
for for a while now our channel T

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,080
Directorate and also this meeting during

65
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,820
the site meetings and well not in this

66
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,300
slot would like to share some of that

67
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,669
discussion and engage the wider IOT IETF

68
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,440
community so Michael Richardson and

69
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:53,640
Elliot Lear will be driving the

70
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,570
discussion over there any agenda bashing

71
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,570
questions or comments

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,490
okay then we'll get started

73
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,259
that's a reminder of the tingling artsy

74
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,050
scope ankles so asthma in the beginning

75
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:11,330
this is the research arm so we are

76
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,570
working on the research issues turning

77
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,280
the IOT into reality and in particle

78
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:18,530
what we be focusing on is these low

79
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,179
resource nodes things or constraint

80
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:22,039
nodes as they're commonly called how

81
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,460
they can be part of the wider Internet

82
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,590
and wider IOT we are focusing here on

83
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:29,210
things that are have relevance on the

84
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:32,330
IETF standard size and so if you think

85
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:34,099
about stack wise we start roughly at the

86
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:35,900
IP adaptational a or sometimes don't we

87
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,610
have to connectivity aspects but go all

88
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,310
the way up to the application layer

89
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:46,970
including architectures api's management

90
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:49,130
and of course security how we really

91
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:51,770
relate to the groups on the IETF site I

92
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,800
mean there is a lot of overlap when it

93
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,750
comes to tips so where we are look at

94
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,550
this research issues for example taking

95
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,500
two groups that we have a close

96
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:02,960
collaboration IETF site core and a

97
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,199
looook in core we're doing a lot of the

98
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,000
restful protocol data model design that

99
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:10,580
sometimes originated on from the archie

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,050
side sometimes comes from elsewhere but

101
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,490
then sometimes get core working group

102
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,930
for example we come across some issue

103
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,060
that we realized okay we are actually

104
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,070
not ready to do to the standardization

105
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,320
on this we should do a bit more thinking

106
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:23,659
architectural considerations etc and

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,490
sometimes then move the work moves from

108
00:06:23,659 --> 00:06:28,639
the core cover or other working groups

109
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:30,500
to the thing looking Archie side in a

110
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,880
similar fashion with albick which is

111
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,300
focusing on giving guidance on

112
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:37,070
implementation on the iot aspects then

113
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,139
we have of course other groups like IIT

114
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:41,719
Directorate looking at coordination

115
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:43,010
across IETF Cruise and beyond and also

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,000
including Archie we have been

117
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,949
traditionally doing a lot of

118
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,180
coordination work with other stos

119
00:06:45,949 --> 00:06:53,169
including OMA spec works oh-o-oh CF and

120
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:53,169
double 3c for example

121
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,320
so in addition to this meeting which we

122
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:02,750
commonly call a summary meeting we have

123
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:06,740
had other related activities IETF 1:06

124
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:08,930
we had on on Friday a pre meeting with

125
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,700
ability to see well things at the at the

126
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,680
National University up or it's one more

127
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,170
slide coming on that in a moment and

128
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,240
also there was a core application site

129
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,310
meeting on Tuesday where we're

130
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,070
discussing the problem leaders for coop

131
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:24,440
API Sandero responses there will be

132
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,120
draft coming on both topics are likely

133
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,700
on the core side but was very much

134
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:35,180
related discussions also happening at

135
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:36,950
the RG side so a few words on the

136
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:39,260
workshop we had on Fridays this was a

137
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:43,640
joint work with Doubletree see what are

138
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:46,670
things what we were focusing from the

139
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,560
archie interest we have had generally

140
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:51,890
six interest areas where we're looking

141
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,780
at energy and a lot of those basically

142
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:56,390
three were mostly in the scope of this

143
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:58,460
workshop which we also commonly have in

144
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:00,280
the scope of the wishi activity so

145
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,349
modeling data interaction for IOT

146
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:06,710
rest-based hypermedia for IOT and also

147
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:10,760
connectivity for IOT so there was a

148
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:12,380
discussion how w3c what were things we

149
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,050
say to stare where they're going and

150
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:18,260
also how things relate to what we do at

151
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,250
ATF site quite a lot of discussions on

152
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,990
one day tomorrow

153
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,400
what it says is there how things relate

154
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,530
together however things thing

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,450
descriptions relate to one DM and how

156
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:28,969
the code all comes together in a bigger

157
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:31,430
architecture and then also on on

158
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:33,620
connectivity how things like much for

159
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,690
example can be used to give more

160
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,640
semantics on the connective you're

161
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,460
trying to establish or how you get for

162
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:42,439
example use protocols like ice in a

163
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:44,390
constrained environment and what are the

164
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,700
semantics on when you in when you

165
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:49,430
exchange candidate information data in

166
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,070
that kind of environment but there's a

167
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:53,930
whole host of nodes coming on that which

168
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:56,150
still need to refine them at will once

169
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:58,040
they are published will will let you

170
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:00,199
know on the mailing list but all the

171
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,620
materials are already available on the

172
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:10,279
github repo of that meeting going

173
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,769
forward we have had usually these

174
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:15,410
we she calls some couple of time between

175
00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:18,259
the ETF's we are planning to go roughly

176
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,589
monthly based on those December looks

177
00:09:18,259 --> 00:09:22,639
rather booked already so probable

178
00:09:20,589 --> 00:09:24,290
kick-start that in January but it's

179
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,490
gonna be notifications on their mailing

180
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:30,829
list we have had traditionally virtual

181
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:32,240
meetings OCA Ole Miss pack works double

182
00:09:30,829 --> 00:09:34,069
to see whether things occasionally on

183
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
the topics that we have common interests

184
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:39,199
we all like likely to continue those and

185
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,540
then we have had almost every IETF a a

186
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:44,209
joint these summary meetings happening

187
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,189
so likely will have one in Vancouver and

188
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,609
in particular the hackathons we have

189
00:09:46,189 --> 00:09:52,129
been very active or a seven of them or

190
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:56,110
so far so will most likely have a we she

191
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:58,279
hackathon activity go located with ETF

192
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,199
also we have been very interested in on

193
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:01,490
having colocation with academic

194
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,998
conference you haven't had too many

195
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:07,309
recently so if you are aware of or even

196
00:10:04,999 --> 00:10:09,110
potentially organizing a relevant

197
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:10,969
academic academic conference or other

198
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,889
activity we'd be very interested on

199
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,569
co-locating with you so please do

200
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:22,040
approach us chairs and let's talk about

201
00:10:14,569 --> 00:10:25,939
it then moving on to the stages of our

202
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:28,279
work while while our research group

203
00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,110
don't necessarily produce RFC's we have

204
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,809
a we have been having separation of

205
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:34,819
trying to document the major outcomes of

206
00:10:32,809 --> 00:10:36,680
this group in you know in drafts so we

207
00:10:34,819 --> 00:10:38,599
already published one RFC about a

208
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,878
security right now we do have one

209
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,709
research group document on restfully so

210
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,720
in priority I'll give a bit more details

211
00:10:42,709 --> 00:10:46,489
in a moment and we have a set of

212
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,439
documents that are or upcoming or not

213
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:50,120
currently a research group documents but

214
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:52,370
are something that we are considering

215
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,649
for adoption in Portugal that's one

216
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:57,139
active per connection IOT will have a

217
00:10:54,649 --> 00:11:01,129
short update in a moment also insecure

218
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:02,449
bootstrapping for IOT u P and then on

219
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,620
core applications there have been

220
00:11:02,449 --> 00:11:06,319
discussed and probably gonna be

221
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:08,529
documents either on the course I on the

222
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:11,599
research group side or the insulate both

223
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,679
on some considerations layer three there

224
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,870
has been discussed and we should

225
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:18,319
document more aspects that are relevant

226
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:21,079
there and then also on Vichy what will

227
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:24,050
be calling um we she notes we might be

228
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:24,589
coming something up on a part of all day

229
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:32,689
tomorrow

230
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:34,070
and semantics area at large so few words

231
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:35,960
on the rest of all designs what is one

232
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,170
of our long-running research group

233
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:41,540
documents we did an update for this idea

234
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,640
I did informational choral and

235
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,290
constraint you arise those two

236
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,360
technologies that are now being

237
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:49,400
developed on the core working group side

238
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,890
how do they fit into the larger

239
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,620
architecture and on the rest of the IOT

240
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,930
and also we add a dimension of how you

241
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:59,210
server push mechanism configure pick or

242
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,310
dialing so core dialing again is a

243
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:04,700
memorizing be developed at the core

244
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:06,170
working group side we are now

245
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,420
considering should we add as some more

246
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:10,339
information but affordances and also on

247
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:12,290
discovery side but overall we're

248
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:14,060
thinking that it has been becoming

249
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,650
rather stable document not much updates

250
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,900
coming so we should probably do a

251
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:23,120
request for publication soon and get it

252
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:25,189
get it get it done with a quick update

253
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,560
on secure bootstrapping for royalty I

254
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:29,240
asked from the authors what's current

255
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:32,209
state seems to be it's rather saying

256
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,440
that was on the last IETF so documented

257
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,630
device bootstrapping terminals and

258
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,060
relationships identifying some common

259
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,920
design assumptions and investing in

260
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,219
benefits and challenges of EAP there was

261
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:50,240
no update for this ITF but we should be

262
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:52,880
one coming for the next IETF meeting and

263
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,890
then on the quick update on the wiki

264
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,950
activity so this is I'm you could think

265
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:59,870
of a sub activity on thinking research

266
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,520
group focusing kinda on the top of the

267
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,720
stack so as the name implies on

268
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,500
semantics and hypermedia

269
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:09,170
interoperability we had two meetings

270
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:12,020
between the idea tips there was one

271
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,020
face-to-face work meeting because one DM

272
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,240
had a three-day face-to-face meeting in

273
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,060
cheese town in Sweden about a month ago

274
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,060
so we had a face-to-face we she works up

275
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,339
right after that meeting on that meeting

276
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,750
what we did we focused on the 1 billion

277
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:28,550
topics because they were still fresh in

278
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:30,320
mind and there was some interesting

279
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:33,530
architectural and research

280
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,850
considerations to be think about so we

281
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,709
did think about the architecture and

282
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,980
terminology discussed like how we get

283
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:40,500
some more alignment

284
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:42,510
on a bigger picture and in particular

285
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,820
the chasin pointer and somatic

286
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:47,130
breadcrumbs was a topic that was I

287
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:48,750
discussed in quite in detail and then

288
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:51,300
further on the processing model how do

289
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,250
you handle one VM and descriptions and

290
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,969
how you turn them into something are

291
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:59,220
useful in other contexts we did also

292
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,010
have one wish the online meeting a few

293
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,380
weeks before the idea there our key

294
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:06,689
focus was on data molar versioning so

295
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,580
this is a topic a lot of IOT

296
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:10,800
organizations seem to be heating right

297
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,660
now you make your first version of data

298
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,829
models then you realized maybe there are

299
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,140
some things that should have been done

300
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,740
slightly different way what is a good

301
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,480
way to support this evolution and

302
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:24,240
versioning is one mechanism what we have

303
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:27,660
been using in the past that has some

304
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,130
some challenges in particle in this

305
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,600
discuss so we're talking what are those

306
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,900
challenges and how war but perhaps

307
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,780
better ways to achieve the evolution

308
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:39,420
aspects so we are planning on only

309
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,579
wishing note on that aspect right now

310
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,890
solves a lot of material in the in the

311
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,430
meeting notes from that discussion and

312
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:49,050
also of course one data model and and

313
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:55,469
hackathon activities that were focused

314
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:58,469
on this online meeting then to give you

315
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,760
a quick update on the vichy hackathon so

316
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,940
as I mentioned we'll be having these

317
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:06,510
hackathon activities over seven times at

318
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,550
the ITF hackathons in this hackathon our

319
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:10,980
plan was to focus again on the data

320
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,560
model convergence of quite similar to

321
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,320
last IETF and in particular translation

322
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,400
using the one day tomorrow tools and

323
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,440
models also since we had this joint

324
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,870
activity we double three C of starting

325
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,250
on Friday and going on axis for years we

326
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,440
were working together with web of things

327
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:30,210
and they had their breakfast and they

328
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,340
were planning to work on integration of

329
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,080
core resource directories to further

330
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,840
their own support discover capabilities

331
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:38,340
in the book wave or things context and

332
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:40,380
then already aspects the past few ideas

333
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,730
will be working on this you P young face

334
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,860
conversion for binary to see poor

335
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:49,230
enhancements but Eve Allah will give an

336
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:51,690
closer update on this so what did we

337
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,870
achieve over those past two days

338
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:56,430
so as I mentioned big activity was

339
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,800
around one day demo tools and concepts

340
00:15:56,430 --> 00:16:00,780
so we've been working on conversion

341
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,550
tools to move between live with em time

342
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,439
if summer rolls and one day the model

343
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:06,780
models automatically so you wouldn't

344
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:09,330
have to do that kind of conversions ever

345
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,370
manually we already at the previous ayah

346
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:12,780
80 °f and hackathon we did have a first

347
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:15,810
version of coming from apes at 1:00 a.m.

348
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:17,910
we did enhance that conversion to will

349
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:20,550
mainly focusing going from one DM to if

350
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,439
so and it seems that we can do mainly

351
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:26,280
loss translation between these two

352
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,740
models already right now also what we

353
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,810
did is enhance this data more all winter

354
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,310
so it's very convenient to have a tool

355
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,369
to actually check out your conversions

356
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:37,500
make sense and have automated tools in

357
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:41,670
general it may it's very helpful helpful

358
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:43,470
in this context so what we did use these

359
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:45,930
tool tool sets also to set up a

360
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,920
automated continuous integration in the

361
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:49,770
github of

362
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,089
one VM test repo that whenever there are

363
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:53,400
new submissions they're automatically

364
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:56,510
tested they actually do confirm to the

365
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:59,310
guidelines and and style set up for that

366
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:01,290
so all those three tools they are

367
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,510
available as open source contributions

368
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:04,680
and you have the github you are right

369
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:07,319
there if you're interested to have a

370
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:08,610
look at the details in addition to

371
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,349
hacking we also had very good

372
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:12,479
discussions on architecture how we use

373
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:15,179
semantics how we how can we deal with

374
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,189
dynamic descriptions of things and data

375
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:19,530
models and overall how do we get

376
00:17:17,189 --> 00:17:21,689
convergence are occurs sto switch off

377
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:24,180
course lot of stos are working on very

378
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:25,770
similar topics how do we get more more

379
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,569
and more convergence across those so we

380
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:31,950
have better interoperability

381
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:33,990
going long-term on the double 3c web of

382
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,610
things topic there was now a first

383
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:37,920
version of thing description discovery

384
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:40,949
using qua party up up and running that

385
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:42,840
was also a good success and also we

386
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:47,910
asked good progress made on yupi that

387
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:49,379
Ivalo will tell you more in a bit one

388
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:50,970
thing that we are discussing going

389
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,780
forward how do we bring these things

390
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:58,350
together was that how can we take from

391
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:00,090
one DM SDF descriptions to create thing

392
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:01,830
descriptions perhaps we're using some

393
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:04,169
are already of tooling in between and

394
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,490
then be able to expose this you know

395
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:08,330
what we are now calling

396
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,429
semantics proxy that would enable to use

397
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,379
one applications and and devices from

398
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:17,100
different ecosystems and then working

399
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:18,630
together using a proxy or a gateway but

400
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,399
Michael coaster will be going in more

401
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:27,390
details on on his own on his

402
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:30,000
presentation slot so that was a quick

403
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:38,070
update on the research group activities

404
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:43,490
any questions comments on those okay

405
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:43,490
in that case that's Ivalo and you pee

406
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,760
hello everyone my name is Eva Petrov and

407
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:58,230
I will present you the advancement of

408
00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,510
you pee so a little bit of context in

409
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:02,580
some networks like everyone another

410
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:09,110
constraint networks quite often we use

411
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:11,850
binary formats in order to send data and

412
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:15,600
it could be Modbus it could be some

413
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:19,169
other proprietary formats but those

414
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:22,439
pellets are rather difficult to use in

415
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:25,200
other systems and in order to improve

416
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:28,590
interoperability it would be good to

417
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:32,700
have a common way to express how the

418
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:35,490
binary data could be parsed into JSON

419
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:40,290
sibour or something else that different

420
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:43,559
systems could use directly so this is

421
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:48,510
the goal of U P and what happened during

422
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:53,460
the hackathon was I implemented part of

423
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:55,500
the encoding it worked well and there

424
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,809
are still some parts from the encoding

425
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:02,340
that are not implemented but so far

426
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:07,678
there were no difficulties I looked how

427
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:11,100
we can express parsing coop and

428
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:14,540
different other different formats in U P

429
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:19,020
and Delta encoding server rather

430
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,490
unattractive so to speak but I think I'm

431
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:26,139
and

432
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:33,290
to get that done using experts which are

433
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:36,530
part of yonk so no magic there and I

434
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:40,159
looked at Modbus which seemed to be

435
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:44,059
rather easy so I think I'll be looking a

436
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:46,220
little bit at some concrete examples to

437
00:20:44,059 --> 00:20:48,860
see that everything works out well and

438
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:53,570
that I can implement some applications

439
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:59,120
with TP the differences in the draft are

440
00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:02,030
I introduced one statement and expert

441
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:08,169
expressions in case we need to express

442
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:12,350
more difficult or more complex parsing

443
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:17,380
they are the details about list then

444
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:20,750
definition before that was to be defined

445
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:24,950
now I mean the building types are

446
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:28,460
explicitly listed and there are details

447
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:33,880
about how string values could be mapped

448
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:37,100
to numbers namely using enumerations and

449
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:42,230
try to improve the readability by moving

450
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:47,620
some things around so my idea for steps

451
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:52,309
forward is to implement some real

452
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:55,520
example using models maybe have some I

453
00:21:52,309 --> 00:22:00,309
don't know lights or some other actual

454
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:06,290
devices that use models and implement

455
00:22:00,309 --> 00:22:09,710
use each of that with you P and C what

456
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:13,399
are other examples that we want to do

457
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:15,559
use get any feedback hopefully some

458
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:21,410
feedback hopefully and take it from

459
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:24,129
there so that it's any questions

460
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,130
comments

461
00:22:30,609 --> 00:22:35,678
okay thankthank see Bella do we have a

462
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:51,109
next puppy yes we're well on time i

463
00:22:48,439 --> 00:22:54,709
heard i'm mateus Kovich i'm presenting

464
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:59,119
and the IOT h computing draft also on

465
00:22:54,709 --> 00:23:00,979
behalf on my of my co offers so to look

466
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,458
a bit back so this draft originally

467
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:06,589
started as basically we are providing

468
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:12,139
use cases and examples how much

469
00:23:06,589 --> 00:23:14,629
computing can help IOT we saw a growing

470
00:23:12,139 --> 00:23:17,529
interest with this so in Prague actually

471
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:20,718
we had a discussion at one of DT to TRG

472
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:25,399
pre meetings and number of new offers

473
00:23:20,719 --> 00:23:26,899
joined and in the last meeting this was

474
00:23:25,399 --> 00:23:31,069
done actually also merged with the

475
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:34,428
already existing work so dick and Eve

476
00:23:31,069 --> 00:23:38,119
did some work on a survey of H computing

477
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:40,249
and again analysis this was merged in

478
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,109
the document so basically what you can

479
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:44,479
see is that the draft has evolved quite

480
00:23:42,109 --> 00:23:47,149
a bit so starting from just listing ok

481
00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:49,039
they are interesting use cases and we

482
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:50,688
actually moved forward to some gap

483
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,059
analysis which should be the ultimate

484
00:23:50,689 --> 00:23:55,189
goal of this draft basically do to

485
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,599
identify white spots is there something

486
00:23:55,189 --> 00:24:00,159
that needs to be done so that H

487
00:23:56,599 --> 00:24:03,948
computing becomes really useful for IOT

488
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:06,049
so what are the major updates for the

489
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:10,879
version that we submitted shortly before

490
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:13,039
this ITF one part of the work actually

491
00:24:10,879 --> 00:24:15,198
went into operations so we converted

492
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,759
everything to mark down and move to get

493
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:19,219
up because we now have actually quite a

494
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:22,159
number of offers around the globe so

495
00:24:19,219 --> 00:24:24,649
this smooths hopefully a bit the way

496
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,839
forward to work on this the major

497
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:30,168
changes that we did is one is that we

498
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:33,109
moved from the edge architecture that

499
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:36,409
was originally described in the document

500
00:24:33,109 --> 00:24:38,679
to models and the reason is we do not

501
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:41,830
want to promote or

502
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,840
our preclude certain architectures but

503
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,520
it's really about okay this is what you

504
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,949
find in the wild and this is how edge

505
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,340
computing is useful to solve your IOT

506
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:55,870
problems and the other major change was

507
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:57,639
dead yeah we moved from showing just

508
00:24:55,870 --> 00:25:01,959
okay those are use cases this is what

509
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,760
you find out there more to a function

510
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,650
analysis so we really want to see okay

511
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:08,800
what are those functions that you need

512
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:10,540
from the edge so Carson had a very nice

513
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,629
example that for instance the the

514
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:16,780
smartphone became a very good device to

515
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:18,880
configure new IOT devices but what is

516
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,710
the equivalent what is the box that we

517
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,200
use for instance if you need and I would

518
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:26,170
he device needs to store data maybe

519
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,010
needs to offload some computation how do

520
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,270
you do that other management functions

521
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:33,340
and your hot topic in general is

522
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:34,660
onboarding maybe there's also some

523
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:37,629
benefit if you have this for instance

524
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:40,300
on-premise and this is what we want to

525
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,890
do ultimately to basically look at what

526
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:45,129
are the different functions that you

527
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:46,930
need and then do this gap analysis or

528
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:51,430
whites show the white spots where

529
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:53,950
there's potential work for ATL so we met

530
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,720
at this ITF so the offers met and we

531
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:58,540
discussed basically several to do so we

532
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:01,900
have quite some homework for now so some

533
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,810
of the things ya need to be written

534
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,510
better out in the document to actually

535
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:10,060
arrive at these goals and we set

536
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,950
ourselves a timeline so we want to

537
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:15,250
update the draft with what we discussed

538
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,750
by around Christmas so that we can

539
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:20,350
actually gain feedback and get some

540
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:22,120
reviews in early next year so that we

541
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:26,860
can get out a new version that then

542
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,989
includes this feedback by next ITF may

543
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:31,300
ask the room who has interest in

544
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:33,940
reviewing this document and then maybe

545
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:37,770
someone who can note this down see one

546
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,770
two three

547
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,280
okay cool thanks Michael in

548
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:45,280
participating more actively I'll

549
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,879
probably IETF in Vancouver as well okay

550
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,830
very good

551
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:52,260
can you put up your hands again because

552
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:52,260
I would like to record names

553
00:26:52,299 --> 00:27:00,209
Michael's recognition no facial

554
00:26:54,339 --> 00:27:04,178
recognition yeah and and Michael McCaul

555
00:27:00,209 --> 00:27:05,669
thank you and I think the special was

556
00:27:04,179 --> 00:27:08,919
out there with the adoption foreign

557
00:27:05,669 --> 00:27:11,019
research group document since we had

558
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,059
quite some change and I also want to

559
00:27:11,019 --> 00:27:15,820
implement this change here more clearly

560
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,259
now have we decided let's get a few more

561
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,029
versions out there there to be a as

562
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:24,219
office I actually really happy with it

563
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:27,219
and then post this questions again so

564
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:28,599
there's an open source or a set of open

565
00:27:27,219 --> 00:27:31,059
source projects happening under the

566
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:33,879
Linux Foundation as part of something

567
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:35,799
called LF edge so I'll since I'm working

568
00:27:33,879 --> 00:27:37,718
in that space I'll take a look at you

569
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:41,079
know terminology and other things that

570
00:27:37,719 --> 00:27:42,339
might be able to harmonize a bit but I

571
00:27:41,079 --> 00:27:44,440
had a question about the draft to the

572
00:27:42,339 --> 00:27:47,049
draft that sheet has a few use cases in

573
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,759
there are you planning on keeping those

574
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:50,679
expanding them because as far as I know

575
00:27:48,759 --> 00:27:53,709
there's like gazillion use cases right

576
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:55,509
exactly so yet that was that that we you

577
00:27:53,709 --> 00:27:57,399
definitely want to look at real world

578
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:59,200
use cases but then more focus more on

579
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:01,029
the models that you find in there so

580
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,669
basically Universal patterns that can be

581
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:06,119
applied but not give you the complete

582
00:28:03,669 --> 00:28:12,669
list of use cases or solutions out there

583
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:14,918
okay maybe one comment we quite have

584
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:18,009
quite an extensive appendix at the

585
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,139
moment that lists projects that are out

586
00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:22,629
there and gives a quick introduction I

587
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:24,008
think we have to see how we give of this

588
00:28:22,629 --> 00:28:27,129
if you really want to have a look at

589
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:31,809
this huge appendix as you said it's a

590
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:34,599
gazillion zoom opt with the coin

591
00:28:31,809 --> 00:28:37,329
co-chair hat on I think this would be

592
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,579
interesting work to do like maybe in

593
00:28:37,329 --> 00:28:41,849
collaboration with us because it seems

594
00:28:39,579 --> 00:28:43,989
to be a lot of commonality in terms of

595
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:46,509
the edge and the discovery of

596
00:28:43,989 --> 00:28:49,119
computation and data and storage so I

597
00:28:46,509 --> 00:28:52,570
think we should talk about maybe you

598
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:54,428
presenting to us at a future IETF maybe

599
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:56,649
in Vancouver and maybe do some things

600
00:28:54,429 --> 00:28:59,950
together yeah so in fact I mean I

601
00:28:56,649 --> 00:29:01,988
presented this in proc I think also to

602
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:04,659
address and make people in Cohen aware

603
00:29:01,989 --> 00:29:05,720
of this and we also actually discussed

604
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:07,190
yesterday that

605
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,750
we should talk more about the network as

606
00:29:07,190 --> 00:29:12,410
something that could be discovered so

607
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:14,000
the what modalities are there so once we

608
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,100
have this in there it's definitely good

609
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,370
to also maybe ask for reviewers in coin

610
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:21,080
and yeah to keep the the two groups

611
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,419
together because it's yeah related to

612
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,590
both yeah I think it is so I think yeah

613
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,640
we should we should move forward with

614
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,679
this thank you so kay

615
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,540
thank you yeah and likewise that's my

616
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,190
interest is I'm doing work on discovery

617
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,020
and watt and I think there's some heavy

618
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:39,940
overlap we get reading and other things

619
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:46,220
very good the interest grows further

620
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:48,680
okay I'm done excellent Thank You

621
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,900
Matthias and so this ends our our first

622
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:56,660
thought on the overview of activities

623
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:59,420
and documents so next we have a Michael

624
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:03,380
Custer remotely presenting the IOT data

625
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:05,470
model convergence Michael a please go

626
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,470
ahead

627
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:31,590
and Michael if you're talking we cannot

628
00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:33,990
hear you right now it's better thanks

629
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:36,059
okay goodnight I had to click a button

630
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:39,780
here to do that so how did the slides

631
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:41,428
work if you are in the presenter mode

632
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:42,660
you could also present there or or you

633
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:45,840
just asked me to put the next slide

634
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:48,030
whatever works for you so I'm in

635
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:51,980
presenter mode and I can advance the

636
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:58,080
slides then put the button somewhere

637
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:59,460
mm-hm I see the slide probably it's

638
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:05,129
easier if you ask me to put the next

639
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:07,080
slide on okay so please next slide go I

640
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:09,480
want to would talk about two activities

641
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,120
that are going on in the past we've

642
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,410
talked about IOT schema.org and that's

643
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:17,189
what really what we're calling them ie

644
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:18,450
extensions for schema.org to to to make

645
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,390
it clear what we're doing and then now

646
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:23,370
the one data model that I think I've

647
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:25,460
talked about maybe one time before so

648
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:28,409
slide please

649
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,299
so one data model to refresh people's

650
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:33,929
memory where we're not an organization

651
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:36,679
but but we're a sort of a Federation of

652
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:39,750
organizations that are working under a

653
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:42,350
liaison agreement and initially what

654
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,720
we're working on is a common language

655
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:49,949
for how we express semantic models for

656
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,230
IOT that's that's simple enough to be

657
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,000
usable by application domain experts so

658
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:57,690
you don't have to become a you know a

659
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,730
modeling expert so and also eventually

660
00:31:57,690 --> 00:32:02,250
we want to use it for converging the

661
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:03,900
definitions of common IOT device types

662
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,210
so that someone wanting to create a

663
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,090
device type using some common patterns

664
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:12,600
has a model that already exists right

665
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:16,350
megabyte please so the history is it

666
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,449
came from the fall of 2018 so we've been

667
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:20,760
working about a year and there was a

668
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:22,710
good cross industry consensus that

669
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:25,650
common data models were what we really

670
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:28,870
needed to go after is the next key

671
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:32,950
inhibitor for IOT growth so

672
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:34,600
we we work in the open mostly we work at

673
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,509
least the tools are in the open and it

674
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,189
get up repository and then when the me

675
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:42,179
when the models are contributed they'll

676
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:46,269
be in the open as well next slide please

677
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:48,279
so right so what we're doing is first

678
00:32:46,269 --> 00:32:49,990
creating the language as I mentioned and

679
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:52,440
then we're creating a representative set

680
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:54,759
of models representative set of models

681
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:58,570
sort of a set of models from each

682
00:32:54,759 --> 00:33:00,789
contributing organization or or a vendor

683
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,480
to sort of pressure test this language

684
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:06,309
and but once we get that done

685
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,309
organizations are going to contribute

686
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:11,799
models for sort of down selections what

687
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:14,408
we call that and then and then there's

688
00:33:11,799 --> 00:33:17,440
going to be a process for public public

689
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:18,029
publishing these models next slide

690
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:23,320
please

691
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:24,850
the status okay we we've been having

692
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,769
weekly technical meetings and we've had

693
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:29,590
four face-to-face meetings over the year

694
00:33:26,769 --> 00:33:31,570
I believe four if I can count right and

695
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:34,029
there's a pretty good set of models

696
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,918
that's being used to pressure test and

697
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:39,820
and that the last face-to-face meeting

698
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,039
is uttering mentioned we that was in

699
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:44,439
Kista we approved a version of the

700
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,999
language to proceed with contribution so

701
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,850
we've said another language is stable

702
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:51,429
and we're going to go forward with with

703
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:53,678
the next phase of the process and we've

704
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:56,379
set up an area for contributions to be

705
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,840
uploaded called the playground and we're

706
00:33:56,379 --> 00:34:02,289
also setting up as I mentioned of some

707
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:04,418
CI and some more formal contribution

708
00:34:02,289 --> 00:34:07,809
areas next slide please

709
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:09,490
the outcomes of this really one good

710
00:34:07,809 --> 00:34:12,159
outcome is we've all agreed to publish

711
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:14,828
our license models under the open-source

712
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,069
license the BSD three clouds license

713
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:20,139
which is a very permissive license as

714
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,909
already mentioned there's some a lot of

715
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:25,240
work that they've done in tools and

716
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:27,429
translations already we have some SDF

717
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:30,310
models for dot dot which is like the

718
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:32,619
Alliance lighting and energy we're

719
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:37,929
working on we have some st of models for

720
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:39,879
ocf appliances in progress and ocf since

721
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:41,679
they're sort of using swagger as an

722
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:42,399
underlying language thank you this is an

723
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,069
alternative

724
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:47,828
- having developers use swagger this is

725
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:49,839
an easier entry point for developers

726
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,240
pardon me - come in and create and

727
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,788
maintain models and they're working on

728
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:58,089
the similar thing as as was lightweight

729
00:34:54,789 --> 00:35:03,210
m2m some automatic mapping between ocf

730
00:34:58,089 --> 00:35:06,430
and and one diem next slide please

731
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:08,829
so what we're you know we're working on

732
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:10,419
practical IOT semantics what we mean is

733
00:35:08,829 --> 00:35:12,579
how do we what are the things we need to

734
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:14,859
look at first to get things hooked up in

735
00:35:12,579 --> 00:35:17,140
a way that they're interoperable and so

736
00:35:14,859 --> 00:35:19,598
we're addressing we know we need to look

737
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,460
at the affordances of devices we also

738
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,710
need to look at their behaviors and the

739
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,549
context of but we're really starting

740
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,750
with the scope focusing on affordances

741
00:35:26,549 --> 00:35:30,819
first because we have device vendors

742
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,500
involved and then also that that's

743
00:35:30,819 --> 00:35:34,210
really where we need to try to normalize

744
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,309
first because that's where a lot of

745
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,700
divergences today where people are doing

746
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:43,029
things in a in the similar way but but

747
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:45,750
different enough to to not be quite

748
00:35:43,029 --> 00:35:48,160
interoperable next slide please

749
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:49,750
so we're talking that a model I don't

750
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,288
want to spend too much time on it but to

751
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:55,180
point out that what we're using is a

752
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:57,640
fundamental concept of affordances in

753
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:59,529
three categories events actions and

754
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,020
properties and then we're also defining

755
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:04,119
data types as a semantic category that's

756
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,690
reusable semantically across the

757
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:10,270
different affordance categories we have

758
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,660
a thing call and object that we use to

759
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:16,650
group categories into cooperative

760
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:19,660
functional units like to do things like

761
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:21,400
control and like them in control and

762
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,930
door locking and unlocking and things

763
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,839
like that and then we have some

764
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,910
higher-level compositional concepts like

765
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,069
a like a thing that can be just billed

766
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:31,750
as almost any any bag of any of the

767
00:36:30,069 --> 00:36:33,759
other things together including other

768
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:36,549
things and then we have a view that we

769
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,339
use for virtualization of hortons so you

770
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:42,099
can have used that a lot so we use that

771
00:36:39,339 --> 00:36:43,328
have the same affordance but presented

772
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:48,150
somewhat differently or in different

773
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:51,490
with different constraints X line please

774
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,829
so a quick design of review of that by

775
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:55,450
there's a much deeper set of slides this

776
00:36:53,829 --> 00:36:56,110
is just a sort of skipping through this

777
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,750
present

778
00:36:56,110 --> 00:37:00,850
but I want to point out that this is a

779
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:03,250
JSON based language we sort of wanted to

780
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:05,110
create a domain language but it's sort

781
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:07,990
of based on JSON and use JSON schema

782
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:09,940
validation and things like that one the

783
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:12,370
very front end but we also wanted to be

784
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:13,990
convertible to back-end so here's an

785
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:19,060
example of a definition with three

786
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:20,439
affordances next slide please and if you

787
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,330
can see that it's a bit of an eye chart

788
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,830
but basically there's an information

789
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:25,870
part that says here's where it came from

790
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:28,240
in its version and you know the stuff

791
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:30,609
that people like to keep track of then

792
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,430
some namespaces so that we can sort of

793
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:38,260
partition the different submissions and

794
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:40,480
contributions and sort of combine them

795
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:41,800
in some more controlled ways and then

796
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,470
there's some definitions of these

797
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:47,440
different classes object property and

798
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:49,419
actions here and there's some keywords

799
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,280
that that say what you're defining and

800
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,260
then there's some some terms that you're

801
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,850
defining and redefining switch and value

802
00:37:53,260 --> 00:38:01,690
and on and off next slide please

803
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:03,730
next steps for one to M we were updating

804
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:07,450
the language we're adding more features

805
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:09,430
to the language we're working on some of

806
00:38:07,450 --> 00:38:11,080
this model convergence across vendors

807
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,779
and stos we think it's going to be

808
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,880
fairly easy to to build some simple

809
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:19,930
limited models that we can all share and

810
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:22,320
then work toward you know getting there

811
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:25,240
come from thermostat a common lightbulb

812
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,220
we we basically want to start with

813
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,379
demonstrating though some some immediate

814
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,439
value based on doing this translation

815
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:35,170
and building some gateways in some ways

816
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,210
of creating a layer of interoperability

817
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,690
before we build the interoperability

818
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:43,270
right into all of the end points a

819
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:45,700
little bit more about that coming up and

820
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:49,720
study eluted we're calling it the

821
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:52,540
semantic proxy next slide we've got a

822
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,839
couple slides about that so the idea is

823
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:58,420
that we we use w3c thing description as

824
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:01,470
a way to associate the metadata the meta

825
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:03,760
have affordances these high levels

826
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:05,770
abstract descriptions with concrete

827
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,470
protocol bindings and that's really what

828
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,790
the w3c thing description was designed

829
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:13,270
to do was create

830
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:16,330
and descriptions of instances of things

831
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:18,880
that have high-level abstract

832
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,590
affordances and concrete protocol

833
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,840
bindings and different flavors so we

834
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:25,600
want to use basically two of these one

835
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,190
for each flavor of protocol one from the

836
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,500
thing we're consuming and translating

837
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:31,810
from if you will and the other we're

838
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,120
exposing and translating to and

839
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:36,279
obviously you could have a duplex

840
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:39,190
version of this but this is the basic

841
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,990
pattern there's already a couple of

842
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:42,820
pieces of software they can do the

843
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:46,479
semantic proxy part and know how to

844
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:48,550
interpret w3c thing descriptions so we

845
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,800
think this is going to be a fairly easy

846
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:52,990
thing to start prototyping in our

847
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,120
hackathons and and some of the other

848
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,189
code programming and demo activities

849
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:03,250
next slide please

850
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:06,490
the way we feed it is by taking some SDF

851
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:08,500
definition and converting it into well I

852
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:12,580
say RDF here they're really all we need

853
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:15,040
our URI for annotation but but if we

854
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,930
have RDF that we can have a graph backs

855
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,850
the annotation we don't have to build

856
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:22,149
the graph right into the endpoints you

857
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:24,940
have a graph that's just described in a

858
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:27,610
model through these relationships

859
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,770
between these affordances and things and

860
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:32,110
views and what have you and then you

861
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:33,670
have applications that that consume

862
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:35,860
things and they interoperate at the

863
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:38,410
level of the affordances so once I know

864
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:42,510
I'm talking to a lightbulb I'd know how

865
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:46,779
to gem it next slide please

866
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:49,630
yeah so the other thing we're working on

867
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,130
I've been working on for really a number

868
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,690
of years now and we really kind of

869
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:54,520
kicked it off at the first wishi

870
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:58,540
workshop so that's how long we've been

871
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:01,030
working on this as well and we made a

872
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,890
lot of progress getting some some trial

873
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:06,310
formats but together in the beginning

874
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:08,259
and well I'm going to go through sort of

875
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:09,970
where we started and where we are and

876
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:11,560
where we're going to go from here

877
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,120
because there's a lot of overlap with

878
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,590
what we're doing in one data model as

879
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,589
well so next slide please

880
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:24,000
yeah so we started off to create an

881
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:27,090
extension to schema.org that would add I

882
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,030
semantics to schema.org and without

883
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:35,460
going into too much detail schema.org is

884
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:38,310
a way of using basically rdf statements

885
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:41,220
to annotate webpages and the idea of

886
00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,770
statements are from a model that's

887
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,509
pretty low constrained so it really take

888
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:48,630
a lot of reasoning to interpret what's

889
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:50,970
in the webpages in terms of semantic

890
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:53,670
annotation but it was originally created

891
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:55,859
for search engine optimization

892
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:58,200
it has kind of grown into a thing that's

893
00:41:55,859 --> 00:42:01,160
starting to drive api's and drive

894
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,720
interactions with webpages more and more

895
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,720
so what we wanted to work with the

896
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:08,098
relevant vendors and SDOs

897
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:10,109
familiar to architects a common

898
00:42:08,099 --> 00:42:11,760
information model for IOT so it's gonna

899
00:42:10,109 --> 00:42:16,410
have the same problem from a little bit

900
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,450
different perspective we we were

901
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:20,879
focusing on the process to enable free

902
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:23,189
contribution from diverse organizations

903
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,330
to really have a low bar and and very

904
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:29,640
printer's of open source royalty-free

905
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:33,660
licensing and drive or non normalization

906
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:36,810
to a common model so really again a lot

907
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,759
in common we wanted the domain and

908
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:41,520
subject experts to be able to work with

909
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:43,680
the tooling and not have to become

910
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,080
experts in the Semantic Web to in order

911
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:47,970
to create models and we wanted to work

912
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,029
on practical integration with schema.org

913
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:54,089
so that existing tooling and and that

914
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:57,710
can be easily adapted and expended to to

915
00:42:54,089 --> 00:43:01,009
work with IOT stuff so next slide please

916
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:04,170
hello our status where we've come to is

917
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:06,060
we have a common meta model which really

918
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:07,680
we feel it's already adopted in the

919
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:11,160
industry in other words we didn't have

920
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,410
to go evangelize a new way of modeling

921
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,118
things because we we looked at what

922
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:17,040
people were doing these categories are

923
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,140
really pretty common across all the

924
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:21,119
different organizations and again it

925
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:26,430
comes down to events actions and

926
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:28,560
properties and you know again we have a

927
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:30,720
lot of discussions about you know how

928
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,580
these are similar to other ways of

929
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,279
describing similar things and how

930
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:36,190
they're different but but essentially

931
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,069
there

932
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:40,869
we found a lot of commonality and even

933
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:43,029
in how these were interpreted between

934
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:44,890
the different organizations and vendors

935
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:47,289
and people who were already doing some

936
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:49,960
modeling so the other thing we wanted to

937
00:43:47,289 --> 00:43:54,280
do in schema.org though is connect them

938
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:55,710
to these other the other ontologies if

939
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,510
you will

940
00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,369
vocabularies such as the Geneva VSS

941
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:03,520
schema work and BRIC schema that are

942
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:06,940
being done in the w3c and also their

943
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,140
soso and SSN so since we have an RDF

944
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:12,640
base we can build graphs that include

945
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:17,828
you know other concepts and other types

946
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:19,808
of descriptor scripted linkages so we

947
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:21,910
published a strawman definitions a set

948
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:26,530
of Strama and definitions on a on a

949
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:30,038
prototype website that's at that I mean

950
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:31,900
IOT schema.org all one bird and we

951
00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,210
published some definitions from some

952
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,750
common IOT capabilities and we've been

953
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:40,539
using them in the w3c web of things and

954
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:44,079
in the wishi work in the hands-on plug

955
00:44:40,539 --> 00:44:50,460
fests and in some of the examples and

956
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:54,940
evaluations right so next slide please

957
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:58,299
the meta model for the IOT schema

958
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:59,470
extensions is very similar to what

959
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:01,900
you're going to see in the web of things

960
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:04,058
meta model as well as what we built in

961
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,799
one DM there's basically some

962
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:08,470
interaction patterns that are events

963
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:10,900
actions and properties what we've done

964
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:13,660
in IOT schema has rep them up in a in a

965
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,450
very similar functional element to what

966
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,538
we were calling an object in one DM this

967
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:21,490
is a what we call the capability and the

968
00:45:19,539 --> 00:45:23,589
capability is basically something like I

969
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,259
can turn a light on and off so here's an

970
00:45:23,589 --> 00:45:27,880
on/off state property that represents

971
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,890
the state whether it's on or off here's

972
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,500
an action for turning the light on and

973
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:36,368
the action for turning it off and maybe

974
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:38,410
some events having to do with you know

975
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:40,119
the state changing or something of that

976
00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:43,720
nature and then their data schemas that

977
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:45,369
describe you know how the data items

978
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:48,879
looked and what the constraints are not

979
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:49,970
so much the on the air package schema

980
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,549
like

981
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:54,529
schema on the air but more like this

982
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:55,880
action has two parameters one is the

983
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:58,190
target brightness and one it's the

984
00:45:55,880 --> 00:46:01,400
transition time and they are they're

985
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,500
both numbers and then we allow levels of

986
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,690
constraint on top of that a range of the

987
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,450
number the depth value of the number

988
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:11,109
whether it's an integer or a fractional

989
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,520
number of floating point a fixed point

990
00:46:11,109 --> 00:46:16,069
etc so we want we want to be flexible

991
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:17,839
with data schemas to say be either able

992
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:19,930
to constrain a thing to having to be an

993
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:24,009
integer in the definition itself or to

994
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:27,680
to allow that to be defined in you know

995
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:29,329
an adaptation layer and it is the

996
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,089
protocol binding is what we call them

997
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:36,440
and so we'll see more about protocol

998
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:38,390
bindings with the web of things work

999
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,630
that and mccool will be presenting right

1000
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:43,129
after this so the the new concept we're

1001
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,780
adding here though is a linkage to a

1002
00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:47,000
thing called feature of interest which

1003
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:50,510
is a really already a common concept

1004
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:52,849
from the onm ontology on which SSN and

1005
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:55,339
sosa and a lot of these other more

1006
00:46:52,849 --> 00:46:59,599
recent works are derived from and

1007
00:46:55,339 --> 00:47:01,609
feature of interest basically in my

1008
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,500
reading comes down to mostly things that

1009
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:06,380
are either a location or some kind of

1010
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:08,630
equipment some kind of physical sort of

1011
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:09,710
piece of things that you want to

1012
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,390
describe and of course there are

1013
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,039
features of interest can be properties

1014
00:47:11,390 --> 00:47:15,828
of those things and they can be much

1015
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:18,049
broader than that but for our or our

1016
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:24,049
sort of for describing what what they do

1017
00:47:18,049 --> 00:47:27,288
they they kind of describe you know the

1018
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,509
the the connected world nouns if you

1019
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:32,930
will

1020
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:35,059
places and things but but things like

1021
00:47:32,930 --> 00:47:37,848
doors not things like door locks right

1022
00:47:35,059 --> 00:47:39,890
and and so the door lock once you

1023
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:41,720
combine the door lock which is a thing

1024
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,779
we provide interaction patterns for like

1025
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,689
lock unlock and determine lock date and

1026
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,430
events about things being unlocked those

1027
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:51,020
patterns once we combine the idea of a

1028
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:52,819
door lock with the feature of interest

1029
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,650
being a door then we have a way of

1030
00:47:52,819 --> 00:47:56,779
saying lock the door unlock the door and

1031
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:59,569
we start getting closer to a real world

1032
00:47:56,779 --> 00:48:01,400
interaction pattern as opposed to having

1033
00:47:59,569 --> 00:48:03,810
to think about a device that's

1034
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,820
responding to an app on your

1035
00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:07,440
and that's really what we want to get to

1036
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,020
with the semantics or something that's

1037
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:13,080
both more interoperable but also more

1038
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:15,089
connected to the real world right now

1039
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:17,580
next slide please that's that's enough

1040
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:20,580
on that so our test cases we've

1041
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:22,470
integrated these definitions with wot

1042
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:24,690
thing descriptions weather thing thing

1043
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,520
descriptions and there's some semantic

1044
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,740
annotations if there may or may not be

1045
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:31,500
an example here and it's like I'm not

1046
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:34,740
sure I wish I put numbers on them you

1047
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:36,750
know these I think we've we've been

1048
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:38,879
using these definitions of things like

1049
00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:41,310
switches and light dimming and motion

1050
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:42,839
sensing and it's turned out to work out

1051
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,390
pretty well but it's been mostly a

1052
00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:47,009
manual exercise we haven't really we've

1053
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,240
done a little bit of discovery but we

1054
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:54,710
haven't really done a whole lot of

1055
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:57,959
automation yet some other organizations

1056
00:48:54,710 --> 00:49:00,210
are using this in the weather thing

1057
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,030
stuff as well to talk about their

1058
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:06,060
devices and protocols I think we might

1059
00:49:03,030 --> 00:49:09,990
have about 50% of the participants you

1060
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:11,940
know like using IOT schema or more and

1061
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:14,609
there's some interesting read

1062
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,650
applications that we developed that have

1063
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:20,580
been developed I'd say we but mostly

1064
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:23,670
been by demons by Darko and Aparna that

1065
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:26,670
have developed these thing description

1066
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:28,530
based note read applications that that

1067
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,410
are really easy to use and kind of plug

1068
00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:33,869
and play and we really want to work on

1069
00:49:31,410 --> 00:49:35,640
discovery next as sort of a thing that

1070
00:49:33,869 --> 00:49:37,560
we're we're looking at in terms of

1071
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:40,379
interfacing interacting with the

1072
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:44,029
intersecting with the w3c one of the

1073
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:48,869
things work right next slide please

1074
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:50,849
so again IOT schema for node-red there's

1075
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:53,520
a github project that you can go look at

1076
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:56,670
and play with but basically we we put

1077
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,820
IOT schema into node-red such that you

1078
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:01,490
can do semantic connections between

1079
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:03,660
between things and we there are

1080
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,279
essentially from a practical sense you

1081
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:07,170
can connect events actions and

1082
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,730
properties with things that trigger them

1083
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,450
and things that observes that up your

1084
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:14,940
own code and you can bring in some nodes

1085
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:16,450
that do automatic adaptation of units

1086
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,300
and ranges and

1087
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,810
and measures and things like that

1088
00:50:19,300 --> 00:50:24,000
quantities and units right next slide

1089
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:26,890
please

1090
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,980
so the schema.org integration but what

1091
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:32,819
we what we found is that there there's a

1092
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:36,520
little bit of an impedance mismatch and

1093
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:38,020
what first in the class names that we're

1094
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,700
doing were naming things that are

1095
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,650
similar to things that are already named

1096
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:46,540
so we probably need to invent a bunch of

1097
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:48,820
new names and also we have a lot of

1098
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:50,680
different property types we you know if

1099
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,570
you think about it if you think about

1100
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,180
properties as being advanced actions

1101
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:58,390
property types and the term rdf

1102
00:50:55,180 --> 00:51:01,629
relations as being events actions

1103
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:03,549
properties capabilities datatypes things

1104
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:05,260
you don't have that many but if you

1105
00:51:03,550 --> 00:51:07,240
think about them as being temperature

1106
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:09,070
and humidity and acceleration and

1107
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,220
voltage and and all these other things

1108
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:16,180
that you can do in controls it quickly

1109
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:17,680
becomes hundreds or thousands so what

1110
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:21,190
we're looking for is a way that we can

1111
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,890
do some layered connection to schema.org

1112
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:26,290
so that a schema.org application can

1113
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:28,180
discover that it has some basic things

1114
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:31,599
that it can do but then I might need to

1115
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:34,540
have some extra you know awareness in

1116
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,819
order to know how to actually do some of

1117
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:38,800
these things and manipulate these it'll

1118
00:51:36,819 --> 00:51:41,770
it'll need to need to be able to go to

1119
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,660
another level just really just like if

1120
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:47,319
you wanted web software using schema.org

1121
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:51,009
today to understand which venue you're

1122
00:51:47,319 --> 00:51:52,630
talking about and you know the basic

1123
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,550
pattern is there but then you still need

1124
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:56,290
software that's able to show different

1125
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:58,869
arrangements of seats in your baby and

1126
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:00,460
etc the same thing with IOT you'll need

1127
00:51:58,869 --> 00:52:03,310
software that'll deal with different

1128
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,900
types of cameras for execrable and

1129
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,630
doesn't have to assume all cameras are

1130
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,530
the same because you have some

1131
00:52:06,630 --> 00:52:10,480
annotation like the in description to

1132
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,660
tell you what affordances are there and

1133
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:18,099
what what you can do and what you can

1134
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:20,200
write so next slide please ok so we

1135
00:52:18,099 --> 00:52:22,660
started the community group for the IOT

1136
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:24,339
schema we we have a few members but we

1137
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:28,740
haven't really ramped it up yet the

1138
00:52:24,339 --> 00:52:28,740
purpose of the group is to have an IPR

1139
00:52:28,950 --> 00:52:35,049
then you if you will for accepting

1140
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:38,650
contributions so what we're hoping to do

1141
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:41,530
is sort of combine this with the with

1142
00:52:38,650 --> 00:52:44,380
the one data model works so that we can

1143
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:46,600
use one day tomorrow as a front-end for

1144
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,900
entering schemas and we're hoping that

1145
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:53,259
we can all use DSD 3 clause and when the

1146
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:55,180
community group as a as a way to accept

1147
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:57,940
contributions and publish things on the

1148
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:59,890
IOT schema side so one data model will

1149
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,910
have each process have down selecting

1150
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:03,609
things and then we'll have another

1151
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:06,339
process of accepting those or other

1152
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:09,340
types of definitions into IOT scheme up

1153
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,650
for publication there all right next

1154
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:16,240
slide please

1155
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:17,560
we're getting close here so right this

1156
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:21,279
is really just more of the same we're

1157
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:23,290
aligned with the the metamodel expect to

1158
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,930
be able to use the wantin data model

1159
00:53:23,290 --> 00:53:27,940
language and tools to make this

1160
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:30,430
developer friendly front-end so we don't

1161
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,230
have to duplicate that work but we need

1162
00:53:30,430 --> 00:53:34,720
to work on converting from one data

1163
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:36,940
model to RDF and and one example that

1164
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,129
was really interesting in my exercise of

1165
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:42,940
doing some strawman conversions was that

1166
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:45,790
in RDF enum values are you are eyes they

1167
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:48,100
don't have to be integer or string or

1168
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:51,130
boolean or anything like that they can

1169
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:52,750
be bound to different you know different

1170
00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:54,850
you can have for example the light

1171
00:53:52,750 --> 00:53:57,490
control that uses a true/false boolean

1172
00:53:54,850 --> 00:54:01,980
that community the text phrases on and

1173
00:53:57,490 --> 00:54:04,870
off and in English or it can use say 0 1

1174
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,600
integers that represent true and false

1175
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:09,940
and those can all be described by the

1176
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,160
same URI enum but they can't be

1177
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,340
described by the same JSON schema heat

1178
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,859
source for thinking about what how to

1179
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:19,090
deal with conversions there and there

1180
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:22,330
are a couple of issues like that that

1181
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:25,510
can interest me right next slide is

1182
00:54:22,330 --> 00:54:27,330
getting yeah so going forward we're

1183
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:33,190
going to create an experimental error

1184
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:35,670
area for for people to sort of host

1185
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:38,230
these definitions and test the the

1186
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:41,470
hosting of them on schema.org we already

1187
00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:44,440
have them on our own experimental site

1188
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:48,160
create namespaces I don't have some kind

1189
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:49,870
of CI process and then have a way so

1190
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:51,819
that when someone upload definitions

1191
00:54:49,870 --> 00:54:53,589
they can immediately dereference them in

1192
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:57,580
their own namespace and not have to wait

1193
00:54:53,590 --> 00:55:00,060
until you know things have been argued

1194
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,279
about and accepted so that we have some

1195
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:05,410
some ways that get some traction

1196
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:09,610
immediately on that seems to be the

1197
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:11,920
biggest barrier to people using

1198
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:14,290
semantics is you really need them to be

1199
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,940
sort of globally referenceable or at

1200
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:18,460
least referenceable within the scope of

1201
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:21,250
all of your experiments which key is

1202
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:23,020
pretty broad so to have a place to

1203
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:25,330
upload them and then reference them

1204
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:27,430
online is is pretty useful and valuable

1205
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:30,540
so we want to try to provide that I'm

1206
00:55:27,430 --> 00:55:34,419
early on right next slide please

1207
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:36,940
so here are some your eyes for the one

1208
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:40,600
data model work and some semantic proxy

1209
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:43,690
proposal and on the next slide there are

1210
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:46,830
some there's some resources for some of

1211
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:51,280
the other stuff that that I talked about

1212
00:55:46,830 --> 00:56:00,730
so with that I think we're four we have

1213
00:55:51,280 --> 00:56:02,530
a few minutes we for questions well one

1214
00:56:00,730 --> 00:56:06,760
question that came up in the jabber room

1215
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:09,660
was how do you actually use these model

1216
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:13,300
files so is this something like a mud

1217
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:17,259
safe description you would attach to a

1218
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:20,320
device so when a device is integrated

1219
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:23,350
into a system the system starts to read

1220
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:28,180
that model or how are these one data

1221
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:30,009
models being used so they're there they

1222
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,890
will there they're being used and will

1223
00:56:30,010 --> 00:56:35,020
be used as semantic annotation for a

1224
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:38,049
thing description so in that sense yes

1225
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:40,570
it is they're there they're attached to

1226
00:56:38,050 --> 00:56:43,600
a description of a concrete thing an

1227
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:46,030
instance of a thing that has Network

1228
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:48,880
addresses and security protocols and

1229
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:52,480
things like that and they're basically

1230
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:56,030
used to orchestrate the connection of an

1231
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,430
application to a connected thing and

1232
00:56:56,030 --> 00:57:02,150
it's understanding how to use it's a

1233
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:03,980
connected thing so in that sense it's a

1234
00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:06,980
sort of complementary to something like

1235
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:08,690
a mud file that kind of describes for a

1236
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,450
different actor in the system what to

1237
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:13,670
expect from a thing a mud file described

1238
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:16,609
to a network after what kind of behavior

1239
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:18,530
to expect this describes to an

1240
00:57:16,610 --> 00:57:22,670
application that wants to use the thing

1241
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:24,020
what kind of affordances and and and you

1242
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:26,150
know and again it's through common

1243
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:29,540
terminology that it does that so it

1244
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:31,640
means to have an understanding of the

1245
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:34,370
meaning based on terminology and so in

1246
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:37,129
that sense it's also similar to the mud

1247
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:39,049
files there's a schema for and the set

1248
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,930
of terms and a set of concepts that are

1249
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:45,320
used to talk about what this device has

1250
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:47,419
is and does yeah so if I can comment on

1251
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,920
this we discuss this at the workshop

1252
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:51,650
last time and I think one way to think

1253
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:54,890
about it is an SDF file it's kind of a

1254
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:58,640
class definition for a set of products

1255
00:57:54,890 --> 00:58:01,100
they are our product line a TV file is a

1256
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:03,830
description of an instance of advice so

1257
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:05,930
it has all that the modeling stuff plus

1258
00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:07,940
things like IDs and and protocol

1259
00:58:05,930 --> 00:58:08,899
bindings of URLs and whatever for a

1260
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:12,230
particular device

1261
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,390
I think mud describes kind of a system

1262
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,460
network configuration so I think how the

1263
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:19,220
routers are configured for both security

1264
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:21,410
and quality of service and so forth I do

1265
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:23,899
think one missing piece here is how do

1266
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:25,850
you configure orchestration how do you

1267
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:27,890
configure the system how do you set up

1268
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:30,560
set in the networks of devices to do a

1269
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:32,960
certain task and that's something that

1270
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:35,600
we probably to think about it more but

1271
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,160
one thing we looking at in TV for

1272
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,630
example of using links for that but me

1273
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:39,379
that's kind of indirectly do a new we

1274
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:44,870
need more direct

1275
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:47,990
wait a minute data for systems hi this

1276
00:58:44,870 --> 00:58:50,270
is Eve Schuler from Intel thanks for the

1277
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:53,660
presentation it's great to see how far

1278
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:55,630
you guys have come in the last year or

1279
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:58,120
since the last time you spoke about this

1280
00:58:55,630 --> 00:59:02,420
similar to some of the other questions

1281
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:05,960
it would be really great to see an

1282
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:09,250
example of how things come online and

1283
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,260
how it maps to the various

1284
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:13,850
parts of the architecture and you know

1285
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:16,190
when things get called so really having

1286
00:59:13,850 --> 00:59:17,750
grounding it in an example where these

1287
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:19,220
different pieces get pulled in that

1288
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:22,730
would be really great to see in an

1289
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:26,660
upcoming talk the other thought I had

1290
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:28,790
was is it are you thinking about that in

1291
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:33,830
these name spaces where people define

1292
00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:36,650
their affordances that there's room for

1293
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:38,930
the evolution of them is there that kind

1294
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:43,460
of flexibility because things just

1295
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:46,700
continue to change over time oh that's

1296
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:48,590
that's a great topic the the because

1297
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:52,460
really what we're discovering is that

1298
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:55,400
the the normal mode of things is going

1299
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,980
to be you know evolving and not so much

1300
00:59:55,400 --> 01:00:01,760
static especially just for the next sort

1301
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:04,580
of whatever time periods so there's been

1302
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,060
a lot of discussion about how to enable

1303
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:10,340
innovation and things to evolve and not

1304
01:00:08,060 --> 01:00:11,890
sort of keep them fixed well well having

1305
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,420
interoperability and not breaking

1306
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:16,160
interoperability and so some of the some

1307
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:18,590
of the versioning discussion covers that

1308
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:20,899
and just some of the basics how do we

1309
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:23,000
build and partition models we make the

1310
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:25,070
pieces small enough so that if a

1311
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,730
monkey's needs to change a lot it can be

1312
01:00:25,070 --> 01:00:30,590
substituted with a different piece and

1313
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:32,420
you know we're really just learning

1314
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:34,790
about that so that's that's really one

1315
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:37,700
of the ongoing topics I think oh so I

1316
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:39,350
think I'll amend what I just suggested

1317
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,970
earlier which is I'd love to see an

1318
01:00:39,350 --> 01:00:43,940
example sort of from beginning to end

1319
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:46,910
how somebody using these components

1320
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:49,250
would actually tie in with them you know

1321
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:52,549
just grounding it in a use case I would

1322
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:54,620
even go further to say you know and then

1323
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:56,900
what happens when things get changed

1324
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:59,240
let's let's include that part of the

1325
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,740
example as well but anyway enough for

1326
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:07,189
now but thanks thanks very much that was

1327
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:11,930
great thank you this is Eliot Eve

1328
01:01:07,190 --> 01:01:13,310
stay tuned this is a pretty big topic

1329
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:17,410
actually that you just hit on it's

1330
01:01:13,310 --> 01:01:20,420
actually a really good one we have a lot

1331
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,730
and this the IETF right we like building

1332
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:25,119
building blocks

1333
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:26,680
and actually soda soda other SES

1334
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,290
building blocks are nice and easy to

1335
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:31,899
build right so the question is how do

1336
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:34,450
you put them together right this is a

1337
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:36,850
topic that I'm about to delve into in

1338
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:39,270
just a few minutes so I just want to say

1339
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,270
stay tuned

1340
01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:44,260
[Music]

1341
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,790
great thank you Michael thank you

1342
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:47,140
everyone yeah I think absolutely this is

1343
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:49,840
a topic we should have a closer look

1344
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,920
we're gonna start on the last slot for

1345
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,910
for today and we should definitely

1346
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,410
continue on their upcoming activities in

1347
01:01:54,910 --> 01:01:58,029
particle the upcoming we she calls is

1348
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:00,310
something where we could take deep dives

1349
01:01:58,030 --> 01:02:03,580
on this so anyone interested in topic of

1350
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:06,009
this and at ilt data model and

1351
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:09,490
interoperability at large very welcome

1352
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:13,090
to join the way she goes okay but now we

1353
01:02:09,490 --> 01:02:15,310
need to move on we have one more one

1354
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:17,109
more update from from a double 3c whack

1355
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:19,420
of things coming and then we'll have the

1356
01:02:17,109 --> 01:02:27,520
final discussion that Elliot was already

1357
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:28,840
referring to thanks a lot Michael okay

1358
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:30,910
so Michael McCord

1359
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:35,470
please go ahead okay you guys can hear

1360
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:36,879
me okay yes okay so these slides will

1361
01:02:35,470 --> 01:02:39,819
look familiar to some people who are the

1362
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:42,280
last idea so I'm actually updating a

1363
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:44,280
slide back that was done before and I've

1364
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,320
highlighted the changes so basically

1365
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:49,660
what other things is progressing and I'm

1366
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:51,730
given that the EMA status the next step

1367
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:53,290
is parts relate to our new Charter and

1368
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:55,660
items that we're going to be working on

1369
01:02:53,290 --> 01:02:57,490
over the next two years and in

1370
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:59,799
particular there's some items of high

1371
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:05,740
relevance to this discussion and clean

1372
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:07,930
discovery and building so anyways are

1373
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,990
you know any standardization we're

1374
01:03:07,930 --> 01:03:12,520
looking at enhancing interoperability

1375
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:15,160
and we actually have two two working

1376
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,810
groups in w3c the interest group

1377
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,940
basically those research and you know

1378
01:03:16,810 --> 01:03:22,720
priestly others work drafts and so forth

1379
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:25,030
and also you know validation and that

1380
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:28,299
was renewed for another couple years in

1381
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:30,160
October and the the working group just

1382
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:31,810
finished their last charter we just

1383
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:33,940
delivered our candidate recommendations

1384
01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:35,360
that should go to PR by the end of the

1385
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:37,040
year

1386
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:39,020
we have a draft that's been submitted

1387
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:43,130
and is in process right now being voted

1388
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:45,500
on for a new set of work items and blue

1389
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:47,270
rules over the next two years and I'll

1390
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,190
discuss that at the end of this talk

1391
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:49,700
after giving an update of you know where

1392
01:03:49,190 --> 01:03:51,470
we are

1393
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:53,810
so I'm going to go pretty quickly

1394
01:03:51,470 --> 01:03:56,689
through the background and the current

1395
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:59,090
status so you've seen some as before so

1396
01:03:56,690 --> 01:04:04,420
we have more time to spend on the new

1397
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:07,730
items next slide

1398
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:10,430
right so the basic glue bowls of the

1399
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:12,530
last charter were the things you see

1400
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:15,460
listed here thing descriptions pretty

1401
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:18,350
guidelines 50 API and buying templates

1402
01:04:15,460 --> 01:04:19,760
so that the main verbal here is the

1403
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:22,250
thing description which is already been

1404
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:25,070
mentioned and basically is the metadata

1405
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:28,810
format that describes the interaction

1406
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:31,460
model our affordances of the devices

1407
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,950
this interaction model is just a closely

1408
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:37,100
aligned with IOT system in a word and

1409
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:38,930
actually fvf so we have a similar set of

1410
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:41,630
interactions and is our intention to

1411
01:04:38,930 --> 01:04:43,190
remain line and in fact to improve our

1412
01:04:41,630 --> 01:04:46,760
alignment to make sure the cavalieri is

1413
01:04:43,190 --> 01:04:48,830
consistent TVs generally are also a

1414
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:51,200
place to use annotations they're

1415
01:04:48,830 --> 01:04:53,480
generated by high-level models so as I

1416
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,069
mentioned before the way I think of SDF

1417
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:58,490
is a class definition that defines

1418
01:04:55,070 --> 01:05:00,500
vocabulary and the high-level models and

1419
01:04:58,490 --> 01:05:02,810
the TD of the description of the actual

1420
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:04,970
instance of the device which includes

1421
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:06,770
all that it also includes things like

1422
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,930
here's the URL you have to talk to to

1423
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:12,620
talk to get this property here's the

1424
01:05:08,930 --> 01:05:14,180
security bindings here's the location of

1425
01:05:12,620 --> 01:05:18,170
the device here the idea that a license

1426
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:19,819
or so a particular device now

1427
01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:22,550
there's also I mentioned protocol

1428
01:05:19,820 --> 01:05:24,800
bindings the purpose of that is to say

1429
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:26,780
okay this high level interaction model

1430
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:29,090
you know I think again read and write a

1431
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:32,350
property for example how does that map

1432
01:05:29,090 --> 01:05:35,210
down to a specific protocol like Co app

1433
01:05:32,350 --> 01:05:36,900
what are the URLs or any header options

1434
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:40,630
and so forth

1435
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:42,819
so we are also a document we published

1436
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:46,449
the buying templates which basically

1437
01:05:42,819 --> 01:05:48,910
describe informatively how you would map

1438
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:52,449
for particular protocol a particular

1439
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:54,029
attraction the scripting API we actually

1440
01:05:52,449 --> 01:05:56,709
decided not to publish as an enormity of

1441
01:05:54,029 --> 01:05:58,839
document that are still discussing the

1442
01:05:56,709 --> 01:06:00,848
discipline model for it is a scripting

1443
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:03,219
API enables essentially you know

1444
01:06:00,849 --> 01:06:06,759
computing and rules engines and this

1445
01:06:03,219 --> 01:06:08,259
sort of thing and so it's it it depends

1446
01:06:06,759 --> 01:06:10,150
a lot on the point of all of what it

1447
01:06:08,259 --> 01:06:11,979
actually looks like we do have a strong

1448
01:06:10,150 --> 01:06:13,779
draft and we do have an implantation is

1449
01:06:11,979 --> 01:06:15,399
open source and we have used it for many

1450
01:06:13,779 --> 01:06:18,219
projects and it is quite convenient

1451
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:21,179
we're just uh to work on the landing

1452
01:06:18,219 --> 01:06:23,650
zone for it a bit more so next slide

1453
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:25,539
just a summary of the status of these so

1454
01:06:23,650 --> 01:06:27,459
we have informative documents and notes

1455
01:06:25,539 --> 01:06:29,229
and we have rec tracks or normative

1456
01:06:27,459 --> 01:06:30,640
documents I didn't mention the

1457
01:06:29,229 --> 01:06:32,109
architecture but the architecture is

1458
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:33,299
kind of like just describes the whole

1459
01:06:32,109 --> 01:06:35,469
system and all the pieces put together

1460
01:06:33,299 --> 01:06:38,439
so we are taking kind of butwe blocks

1461
01:06:35,469 --> 01:06:39,939
approach the architecture describes you

1462
01:06:38,439 --> 01:06:42,399
know how ability blocks fit together and

1463
01:06:39,939 --> 01:06:44,519
we have more building blocks in the pipe

1464
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:48,849
like discovery as I'll mention in that

1465
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:50,709
ok next slide so yeah this a bit more

1466
01:06:48,849 --> 01:06:53,049
detail on this so you know the what

1467
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:55,239
architecture document describes

1468
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:58,059
constraints about you know what kinds of

1469
01:06:55,239 --> 01:07:01,329
devices and protocols make sense in the

1470
01:06:58,059 --> 01:07:03,390
context of a a lo of things so

1471
01:07:01,329 --> 01:07:06,749
particular

1472
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:11,379
weather things definitely goes beyond

1473
01:07:06,749 --> 01:07:13,238
ATP and it arguably goes beyond restful

1474
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:15,910
interfaces so we've been looking at

1475
01:07:13,239 --> 01:07:18,579
targeting pub/sub type things in GDP and

1476
01:07:15,910 --> 01:07:21,819
we're currently looking at OPC UA and

1477
01:07:18,579 --> 01:07:23,679
things like this but the idea those it

1478
01:07:21,819 --> 01:07:26,229
Maps these protocols down to an

1479
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:28,029
abstracts of affordances and the way to

1480
01:07:26,229 --> 01:07:29,410
think about these affordances is an

1481
01:07:28,029 --> 01:07:32,380
affordance is like what do you want to

1482
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:35,019
do open the door and a protocol binding

1483
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:37,839
is how do you do that and what URLs do I

1484
01:07:35,019 --> 01:07:40,988
send what messages to etc what verbs do

1485
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:45,219
I use so you think description example

1486
01:07:40,989 --> 01:07:47,559
over here and it's a JSON file that you

1487
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:49,329
know describe various things now

1488
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:50,460
actually want to say it's actually more

1489
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:53,640
specifically

1490
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:57,210
it can be interpreted as of json-ld 1.1

1491
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:59,308
file and Jase melty one point one has

1492
01:07:57,210 --> 01:08:02,069
the advantage you can import it into an

1493
01:07:59,309 --> 01:08:05,400
RDF database and liberate it with you

1494
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:07,319
know Rd of things however you're careful

1495
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,869
to avoid dependency on RDF

1496
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:11,790
so not everyone wants to deal with RDF

1497
01:08:09,869 --> 01:08:13,829
and we don't want to create the

1498
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:15,750
expectation you have to understand argh

1499
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:17,279
you have to use thing descriptions so

1500
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,929
you can treat it like a regular JSON

1501
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,929
file and that's totally fine

1502
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:24,299
there's many use cases that just do that

1503
01:08:20,929 --> 01:08:26,130
however the Act context there describes

1504
01:08:24,299 --> 01:08:28,890
the version and the vocabulary that's

1505
01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:31,739
used in this and it also allows us to

1506
01:08:28,890 --> 01:08:33,630
have pull in extensions so for example

1507
01:08:31,738 --> 01:08:35,910
if you want to use vocabulary defined by

1508
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:37,799
LG steam at org you could define that

1509
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:40,559
IOT vocabulary and start using terms

1510
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:43,738
from there like IOT light if you wanted

1511
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:46,440
to use a vocabulary defined by the SDF

1512
01:08:43,738 --> 01:08:48,718
file one approach we're looking at is

1513
01:08:46,439 --> 01:08:51,000
you know compiling sto down to RDF and

1514
01:08:48,719 --> 01:08:53,730
importing the vocabulary just like you

1515
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,339
do here for IOT schema.org so that's how

1516
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:59,459
you connect these two together and then

1517
01:08:56,339 --> 01:09:00,719
if you then import the description into

1518
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,670
a database you'd be able to interpret

1519
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:07,790
all the information from both SDF and

1520
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:10,529
the instance definition ah next slide

1521
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:12,238
right so then the notes we have actually

1522
01:09:10,529 --> 01:09:15,660
a pretty big document on security and

1523
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,968
privacy its guidelines only there's also

1524
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:19,920
a best practices document which is more

1525
01:09:17,969 --> 01:09:22,529
you know aimed at you know what you

1526
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,779
actually need to do to build something

1527
01:09:22,529 --> 01:09:26,250
that's a reasonable one thing worth

1528
01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:28,410
saying is things ascriptions are

1529
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:31,020
descriptive so they describe what's out

1530
01:09:28,410 --> 01:09:33,238
there including brownfield devices but

1531
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:35,370
there are brownfield devices that in do

1532
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:36,959
a very good job of security so to

1533
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,580
describe those things we have to have

1534
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:41,040
the descriptive power to describe things

1535
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,299
that don't have good security we also

1536
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,899
want encourage people to do good

1537
01:09:42,299 --> 01:09:47,488
security so we we have a best practices

1538
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:50,429
document as well that describe that you

1539
01:09:47,488 --> 01:09:52,108
should be doing and one thing we're

1540
01:09:50,429 --> 01:09:54,630
actually looking at in our next round is

1541
01:09:52,109 --> 01:09:58,560
profiles that are a bit more normative

1542
01:09:54,630 --> 01:10:00,750
about what you should be doing anyways

1543
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,630
this could be API I mentioned is you

1544
01:10:00,750 --> 01:10:04,870
know it's we're talking about various

1545
01:10:03,630 --> 01:10:10,660
landings on for

1546
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:15,349
next life right so mention just in ld1

1547
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:17,059
we we also have a stream looking at

1548
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:19,580
various security protocols and we're

1549
01:10:17,060 --> 01:10:21,350
looking at you know explaining that you

1550
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:24,050
can add mystery protocols with the

1551
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:26,390
Semitic extension mechanism and yes and

1552
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:29,930
we currently mostly look at HCP and Co

1553
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:31,670
app and we're now and M cuties and I

1554
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:33,230
think is partly supported we're working

1555
01:10:31,670 --> 01:10:36,650
on more of that and we're looking at

1556
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:40,089
further things like obviously you in the

1557
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:42,889
future ok next slide

1558
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:44,420
ok so here's a lot of candidates been

1559
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:47,870
least you know five minutes my talk

1560
01:10:44,420 --> 01:10:49,460
discussing so this is our next two years

1561
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:53,150
and we got a bunch of things you want to

1562
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:54,860
work on now the important most important

1563
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:57,170
things here are probably the

1564
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:01,309
interoperability profiles which has its

1565
01:10:57,170 --> 01:11:04,940
own normative global discovery which has

1566
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:06,590
a normative deliverable and and then

1567
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:09,799
things like the protocol vocabulary

1568
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:13,040
bindings so we're doing a lot of work

1569
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:17,540
just extending things to new protocols

1570
01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:20,870
like OPC UA and and obviously and fixing

1571
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:24,040
up MPT and so forth we're also about

1572
01:11:20,870 --> 01:11:26,960
under profiles one of the issues is that

1573
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:29,840
thing descriptions are open they can

1574
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,760
describe lots of things including things

1575
01:11:29,840 --> 01:11:34,010
in the future that might appear right

1576
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:36,500
the trouble is if you want to implement

1577
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:39,110
a system and say it's compatible with

1578
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,730
the things device a little store and buy

1579
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:42,920
whether things device and bring it home

1580
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:45,500
and have it work right you need to have

1581
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:47,150
a more you know finite set of

1582
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:49,730
requirements for what does it mean to

1583
01:11:47,150 --> 01:11:52,160
implement something that can read any

1584
01:11:49,730 --> 01:11:54,980
web of Things device or talk to it and

1585
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:58,099
so the idea of profiles is we would have

1586
01:11:54,980 --> 01:12:01,280
a finitely implementable subset you know

1587
01:11:58,100 --> 01:12:02,720
so like so have a profile that says you

1588
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:06,530
only have to support these three

1589
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:09,860
protocols or whatever and so we are

1590
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:11,990
working on this core profile that sort

1591
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:15,230
of is you know the minimum requirements

1592
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:17,130
for something that that if you satisfy

1593
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:20,638
this court file it will not

1594
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:27,000
operate out of the box so under

1595
01:12:20,639 --> 01:12:28,710
discovery we are basically I have a we

1596
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,270
had a document worked on the hackathon

1597
01:12:28,710 --> 01:12:33,270
that you can look at it's still very

1598
01:12:30,270 --> 01:12:34,710
early but at a high level I want to say

1599
01:12:33,270 --> 01:12:36,870
we don't we would like to really avoid

1600
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:39,270
reinventing the wheel here so it's very

1601
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:42,059
very important that and we have a full

1602
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:44,520
intention to working closely with IETF

1603
01:12:42,060 --> 01:12:46,080
with looking at existing standards by

1604
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:47,909
doing to say at a high level the arkyn

1605
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:51,389
are looking at is to divide this into

1606
01:12:47,909 --> 01:12:52,830
two phases actually pretty to that one

1607
01:12:51,389 --> 01:12:55,260
see we're actually looking both local

1608
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:57,030
and global so by discovery I don't mean

1609
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:58,650
no broadcast something a local network

1610
01:12:57,030 --> 01:13:01,349
can get pings back that kind of thing

1611
01:12:58,650 --> 01:13:04,500
don't assume that a discover I mean how

1612
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:07,139
do you get get access to the TV metadata

1613
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:08,880
how do you find it and that could be a

1614
01:13:07,139 --> 01:13:11,130
global problem like you know on the

1615
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,900
internet you're looking at like a smart

1616
01:13:11,130 --> 01:13:15,120
city and you want to like find services

1617
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,769
to handle traffic maybe local in your

1618
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,260
home network you know finding the light

1619
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:20,639
lights and light switches so we want to

1620
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:24,000
handle both those contexts in a

1621
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:26,190
consistent way and we also want to

1622
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:28,230
highly emphasized privacy and security

1623
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:30,719
so we want to have a privacy preserving

1624
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:32,638
architecture so the general strategy

1625
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:36,590
looking at is to divide the problem into

1626
01:13:32,639 --> 01:13:39,449
two parts introductions and exploration

1627
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:42,060
introductions we first contact protocols

1628
01:13:39,449 --> 01:13:43,888
which basically is what the very first

1629
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:48,719
thing you do when you're in unknown

1630
01:13:43,889 --> 01:13:50,940
network and then exploration is finding

1631
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:53,280
and getting access to detailed metadata

1632
01:13:50,940 --> 01:13:54,900
about the available services and between

1633
01:13:53,280 --> 01:13:58,469
those two you have to have an

1634
01:13:54,900 --> 01:13:59,969
authentication process so that you're

1635
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:01,980
only giving out that detailed metadata

1636
01:13:59,969 --> 01:14:04,500
to people who have authorization to it

1637
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:06,239
and their right to use it and so the

1638
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:08,429
idea is the introduction protocol should

1639
01:14:06,239 --> 01:14:10,259
be privacy conservative should be open

1640
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:13,469
but giving you a as little as possible

1641
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:15,300
and in fact we want to do is just have

1642
01:14:13,469 --> 01:14:17,880
introductions point at a directory

1643
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:19,679
service the directory service then

1644
01:14:17,880 --> 01:14:22,590
requires authentication and

1645
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:24,540
authorization with the appropriate

1646
01:14:22,590 --> 01:14:26,760
access controls and then you can do the

1647
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:28,409
search this also prevents things like

1648
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:29,820
the Milo service attacks because you

1649
01:14:28,409 --> 01:14:30,808
know maybe metadata searches can be

1650
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:32,670
expensive

1651
01:14:30,809 --> 01:14:34,320
so that's the general protocol but we

1652
01:14:32,670 --> 01:14:36,869
have many candidates for both

1653
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:38,130
introductions and for directories we

1654
01:14:36,869 --> 01:14:40,199
also have many different ways in which

1655
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:41,670
you could do queries you know from

1656
01:14:40,199 --> 01:14:43,769
simple keyword search or location-based

1657
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:46,590
search to full semantics no Sparkle

1658
01:14:43,770 --> 01:14:47,969
endpoint Mantic queries and you want to

1659
01:14:46,590 --> 01:14:51,360
conditionally implement all those in all

1660
01:14:47,969 --> 01:14:54,179
possible devices so we however have two

1661
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:55,320
two years to discuss this and you know

1662
01:14:54,179 --> 01:14:56,909
we are currently in the process of

1663
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,980
gathering requirements and understand

1664
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:01,049
the use cases and surveying the

1665
01:14:58,980 --> 01:15:04,650
landscape and figured out what makes

1666
01:15:01,050 --> 01:15:05,880
sense we did do you know a deep dive on

1667
01:15:04,650 --> 01:15:07,110
the core we just directory it's

1668
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,579
certainly one of the one of the

1669
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:10,889
candidates where things are looking at

1670
01:15:08,579 --> 01:15:12,449
for like directory services likewise for

1671
01:15:10,889 --> 01:15:17,099
introductions you know things like DNS

1672
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:19,138
DNS DHCP to like that are also quite

1673
01:15:17,099 --> 01:15:21,510
reasonable introductory mechanisms I

1674
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:24,210
also feel be more than one way to do

1675
01:15:21,510 --> 01:15:25,559
this especially for introductions many

1676
01:15:24,210 --> 01:15:27,030
different styles introductions could

1677
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:28,590
point the same directory service and

1678
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:30,539
that's totally fine

1679
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:34,020
different context we require different

1680
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:35,610
mechanisms for first contract for

1681
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:37,860
identifier management there's a group in

1682
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:41,880
w3c that is looking at the whole process

1683
01:15:37,860 --> 01:15:44,130
of decentralized enta fires and this is

1684
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:46,590
also an issue that it's close to a to

1685
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:48,059
privacy you know how do you deal with

1686
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:51,059
mutable identifiers temporary

1687
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:53,190
identifiers x' non-global identifiers

1688
01:15:51,059 --> 01:15:55,559
you know locally scoped in a fire just a

1689
01:15:53,190 --> 01:15:57,629
thing and so and actually what if you

1690
01:15:55,559 --> 01:15:59,489
only changed in a fire land device to

1691
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:02,929
like break tracking how does that happen

1692
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:04,919
how do you how to mythical updates and

1693
01:16:02,929 --> 01:16:07,770
not mentioned here actually is

1694
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:09,539
onboarding which we're looking at but I

1695
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:11,760
would say the primary focus in the past

1696
01:16:09,539 --> 01:16:14,460
has been during operational phase I

1697
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:16,170
think when we look at discovery

1698
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:18,179
obviously we're looking at discovery

1699
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:19,800
phase one of the first things you want

1700
01:16:18,179 --> 01:16:21,510
to do with the onboard device is you

1701
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:23,820
discover the places you can onboard to

1702
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:26,010
so I think they're close related and

1703
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:27,750
obviously to do ax controls you need to

1704
01:16:26,010 --> 01:16:30,210
have keys and so forth being provision

1705
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:32,280
so we're going to be looking again at

1706
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:34,199
the life cycle and probably touching at

1707
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,090
least on the onboarding process and

1708
01:16:34,199 --> 01:16:40,860
again there's a whole set of standards

1709
01:16:36,090 --> 01:16:42,840
we figure out be consistent with rate

1710
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:44,219
and I guess one last final thing is link

1711
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:47,490
relation types

1712
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:49,410
so I the thing description has a section

1713
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:51,719
it's not an example that can link the

1714
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:54,150
very resources it could have various

1715
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:56,760
resources like maybe the TV points at an

1716
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:59,160
SDF file to say that the TV is an

1717
01:16:56,760 --> 01:17:01,260
instance of that class of devices or it

1718
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:04,110
has these capabilities it could also be

1719
01:17:01,260 --> 01:17:05,520
as part of orchestration you know a

1720
01:17:04,110 --> 01:17:08,309
light switch might be associated with

1721
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,720
light you might have a link for that but

1722
01:17:08,310 --> 01:17:12,180
we don't have any standard link relation

1723
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:14,280
types and of course is a set of

1724
01:17:12,180 --> 01:17:16,080
regulations types in IMA but there is a

1725
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:18,420
huge number and it's not clear what's

1726
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:20,640
used for which purpose so we want to be

1727
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:24,900
able to clarify that and and define what

1728
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:26,520
what relations to used what purpose and

1729
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:28,440
complex interactions finally that's one

1730
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:30,270
more thing we're looking at currently

1731
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,990
you can use thing descriptions for like

1732
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:35,130
media like controls but it's not obvious

1733
01:17:32,990 --> 01:17:37,620
not how obvious what happens when you

1734
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:39,120
post a new resource on a device does it

1735
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,830
change the thing description or does it

1736
01:17:39,120 --> 01:17:43,980
just appear as a new thing description

1737
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:45,780
that is dynamically generated so we want

1738
01:17:43,980 --> 01:17:48,059
to clarify that out by dividing

1739
01:17:45,780 --> 01:17:51,769
basically guidance and examples for for

1740
01:17:48,060 --> 01:17:54,480
complex a hyper media driven controls

1741
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:56,760
okay well I think over time but maybe we

1742
01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:02,820
can have a Tears one I can have some

1743
01:17:56,760 --> 01:18:05,610
question okay thank you Michael any

1744
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:07,790
quick questions comments reactions on

1745
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,790
this

1746
01:18:11,719 --> 01:18:15,839
so here on the thinking archie side of

1747
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:17,789
course we've been doing a long time

1748
01:18:15,839 --> 01:18:19,109
basically all the time was called racing

1749
01:18:17,789 --> 01:18:21,179
with with the wave of things and we'll

1750
01:18:19,109 --> 01:18:22,969
be continuing doing that we have a lot

1751
01:18:21,179 --> 01:18:25,829
of common interest when it comes to the

1752
01:18:22,969 --> 01:18:29,849
interoperability on the data on the

1753
01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:31,858
hypermedia or security etc and we are

1754
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:34,469
kind of looking at more research aspects

1755
01:18:31,859 --> 01:18:35,429
here on the archie side and then seeing

1756
01:18:34,469 --> 01:18:37,260
where it makes sense to do

1757
01:18:35,429 --> 01:18:40,829
standardization on Doubletree see

1758
01:18:37,260 --> 01:18:44,189
IETF side etc that's how it has been our

1759
01:18:40,829 --> 01:18:47,039
pre-much mode of operation and I plan to

1760
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:48,479
continue continued working that way also

1761
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,938
when the web of things is being

1762
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:53,069
recharter and you can see having a

1763
01:18:50,939 --> 01:18:58,229
common activities on dande hackathons

1764
01:18:53,069 --> 01:19:00,269
and when we see calls etc yeah another

1765
01:18:58,229 --> 01:19:02,549
thing in general we are highly motivated

1766
01:19:00,269 --> 01:19:03,839
to keep things converged here and to

1767
01:19:02,549 --> 01:19:06,209
collaborate with people and making sure

1768
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:08,369
we avoid and you know silly history

1769
01:19:06,209 --> 01:19:11,030
differences between things and I don't

1770
01:19:08,369 --> 01:19:15,659
have been very nicely

1771
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:18,059
hi Michael this is Eve um comment on I

1772
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:22,739
know you're there's a lot of discussion

1773
01:19:18,059 --> 01:19:24,689
about kind of IOT centric convergence of

1774
01:19:22,739 --> 01:19:28,018
things all the different stos that are

1775
01:19:24,689 --> 01:19:30,780
focusing specifically and i io t but

1776
01:19:28,019 --> 01:19:33,479
there's a lot of work inside of the ITF

1777
01:19:30,780 --> 01:19:35,518
that could benefit from discussions

1778
01:19:33,479 --> 01:19:38,089
around directory services and so can you

1779
01:19:35,519 --> 01:19:43,260
share some of what you're thinking about

1780
01:19:38,089 --> 01:19:47,039
dns and the resource directory how that

1781
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:49,889
sort of a lines or not right so I think

1782
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:53,369
a lot of the existing directory services

1783
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:55,649
elisany vitae index of links and the

1784
01:19:53,369 --> 01:19:58,438
thing descriptions provide more complex

1785
01:19:55,649 --> 01:20:00,539
you know graphs of metadata and so I

1786
01:19:58,439 --> 01:20:03,479
think that a lot of the distance

1787
01:20:00,539 --> 01:20:06,358
services you know are have like

1788
01:20:03,479 --> 01:20:08,039
basically tag links and so I think we

1789
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:09,809
need to expand upon that there's

1790
01:20:08,039 --> 01:20:12,179
actually a thing called a data hub in

1791
01:20:09,809 --> 01:20:14,010
the core that gives you access to more

1792
01:20:12,179 --> 01:20:17,609
more data and something we're looking at

1793
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:20,400
is combining resource directors links to

1794
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:21,840
to that warming

1795
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,549
boy doing generally those just

1796
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,620
broadcasting metadata like this is a

1797
01:20:23,550 --> 01:20:26,790
this is an insulin pump because I

1798
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:29,070
wouldn't want necessarily everyone to

1799
01:20:26,790 --> 01:20:31,949
know that I have an insulin pump so I

1800
01:20:29,070 --> 01:20:33,090
think that we need to think about you

1801
01:20:31,949 --> 01:20:34,980
know what kind of agent types you want

1802
01:20:33,090 --> 01:20:36,860
to support in public directories versus

1803
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:40,199
private directory behind authentication

1804
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:44,040
we are looking at you know DNS SDA DNS

1805
01:20:40,199 --> 01:20:48,299
SRV are looking at DHCP we're looking at

1806
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:51,300
core Rd but a lot of those really are

1807
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:53,670
best at linking to places where more

1808
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:55,140
detailed metadata can be provided as far

1809
01:20:53,670 --> 01:20:57,150
as directories we have prototyped

1810
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:59,550
directory services that can do things

1811
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:01,469
like semantic query a relevant standard

1812
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:04,620
there is sparkle which allows you to do

1813
01:21:01,469 --> 01:21:06,420
you know federated graph searches that's

1814
01:21:04,620 --> 01:21:07,830
quite expensive though and we think

1815
01:21:06,420 --> 01:21:10,260
that's only for most advanced use cases

1816
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:12,840
I think there's lots of other way to do

1817
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:15,840
queries that directly support keyword

1818
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:18,530
search template based search and so

1819
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,909
forth one thing we are looking at for

1820
01:21:18,530 --> 01:21:23,130
introductions are location-based search

1821
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:24,839
I really want to know the set of

1822
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:26,520
services available in a certain area and

1823
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:29,010
that's one thing that we're discussing

1824
01:21:26,520 --> 01:21:32,850
around DNS right now okay obviously a

1825
01:21:29,010 --> 01:21:35,640
question before yeah hi this is Elliott

1826
01:21:32,850 --> 01:21:38,390
again Mike we're acting a little bit to

1827
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:44,580
what you said and also to what Eve said

1828
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:46,710
there's a ripeness issue here for some

1829
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:51,269
changes into the the overall internet

1830
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:53,489
architecture as I see it and we've

1831
01:21:51,270 --> 01:21:57,420
started it sort of slowly in different

1832
01:21:53,489 --> 01:21:59,370
places one of the places that work is

1833
01:21:57,420 --> 01:22:02,190
being done I think is interesting work

1834
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:07,010
and you'll laugh perhaps it's in the

1835
01:22:02,190 --> 01:22:10,710
DHCP working group what they've done is

1836
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:14,460
they have taken tht parameters and

1837
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:16,860
created a yang model for them now yang

1838
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:22,320
isn't usually the sort of stuff that

1839
01:22:16,860 --> 01:22:24,360
that w3c deals with but the nice thing

1840
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,870
about Yang is that you can serialize it

1841
01:22:24,360 --> 01:22:29,940
lets you realize it in various ways once

1842
01:22:27,870 --> 01:22:31,830
you can serialize it in a way like JSON

1843
01:22:29,940 --> 01:22:34,400
or XML however you want to serialize it

1844
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:38,360
do other things with it too

1845
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:42,530
like sign it encrypt it these are things

1846
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:46,369
that are useful if for privacy for vert

1847
01:22:42,530 --> 01:22:47,750
preserving technologies for instance now

1848
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:49,940
obviously you can't do that with every

1849
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:52,099
last DHCP object that we that we have

1850
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:54,409
defined if you're still in the ipv4

1851
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:55,670
world perhaps your IP address is not

1852
01:22:54,409 --> 01:22:58,250
something that you're going to serialize

1853
01:22:55,670 --> 01:23:00,260
in this way maybe I don't know it's

1854
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,159
worth we're thinking about I know

1855
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:03,590
they've done a lot of work at

1856
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:09,469
categorizing some of these things last

1857
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:11,389
couple weeks now that ties to the trust

1858
01:23:09,469 --> 01:23:15,949
anchor discussion that I think we've

1859
01:23:11,389 --> 01:23:19,300
been having quite a bit of and we have

1860
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:22,269
other building blocks along those lines

1861
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:25,280
to leverage one of which is est or

1862
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:30,139
element over secure transport another

1863
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:31,790
which is EEP believe it or not you could

1864
01:23:30,139 --> 01:23:34,940
you can look at this in other context

1865
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:37,550
the key point there is that if you want

1866
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:39,650
to gain parameters if you want to

1867
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,869
exchange information about devices right

1868
01:23:39,650 --> 01:23:43,580
now we have very we have a lot of

1869
01:23:41,869 --> 01:23:46,280
challenges in establishing trust anchors

1870
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:49,400
and so this is an area where the network

1871
01:23:46,280 --> 01:23:51,380
infrastructure can play a role it's up

1872
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:52,848
to the day and it also plays into

1873
01:23:51,380 --> 01:23:55,040
another aspect that we're hearing a lot

1874
01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:57,619
of in the industry which is your trust

1875
01:23:55,040 --> 01:24:00,080
networking the basis of which is you

1876
01:23:57,619 --> 01:24:04,730
should declare yourself and allow for

1877
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:06,320
establishment of trust as a as a first

1878
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:12,199
class component rather than trust being

1879
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:13,790
assumed and so I'm sorry my co that I'm

1880
01:24:12,199 --> 01:24:15,379
kind of a list of things to do for fun -

1881
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,580
maybe you can unpack and answer a few

1882
01:24:15,380 --> 01:24:19,369
the questions and we can continue the

1883
01:24:16,580 --> 01:24:21,710
discussion with the topic ok so just

1884
01:24:19,369 --> 01:24:23,269
about the yang versus whatever so one

1885
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:26,300
other work item I want to get off the

1886
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:28,159
table is there's yang there's seaboard

1887
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:29,869
there's Jason there's XML there's

1888
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:32,509
various ways to transmit data on the

1889
01:24:29,869 --> 01:24:33,980
wire and our encode metadata I would

1890
01:24:32,510 --> 01:24:36,230
like to see it all in her vault

1891
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:38,330
interoperable and have a common data

1892
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:40,218
schema and a lot of people use an

1893
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:41,750
extension of JSON schema or various

1894
01:24:40,219 --> 01:24:43,760
different extension to JSON schema I

1895
01:24:41,750 --> 01:24:45,560
love to see that cleaned up so we have

1896
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:48,139
one wave declare data models for any

1897
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:49,519
serialization and things like yang

1898
01:24:48,139 --> 01:24:51,260
to choice of civilization of our

1899
01:24:49,519 --> 01:24:53,090
information model and we still have the

1900
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:55,880
information we want to export things in

1901
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:58,130
JSON that's totally fine I think you

1902
01:24:55,880 --> 01:25:00,559
know a lot of mud stuff is done around

1903
01:24:58,130 --> 01:25:02,780
yang I would like to see that not weigh

1904
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:05,439
matter so much as it's just a structured

1905
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:07,518
information informations available

1906
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:10,219
regarding trust anchors I completely

1907
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:12,590
agree I think that you know we need to

1908
01:25:10,219 --> 01:25:14,360
think less about on board to a system

1909
01:25:12,590 --> 01:25:16,639
and onboarding and thinking about you

1910
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,169
know establishing trust what is the what

1911
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:20,780
is the way we establish trust from

1912
01:25:18,169 --> 01:25:22,939
devices and so privacy is a lot about

1913
01:25:20,780 --> 01:25:24,499
who do you trust and we need to figure

1914
01:25:22,939 --> 01:25:29,630
out ways to make that happen

1915
01:25:24,499 --> 01:25:32,539
right okay maybe I'll stop there because

1916
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:35,860
we this is a pretty broad topic and it

1917
01:25:32,539 --> 01:25:35,860
actually leads into the next topic

1918
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:42,289
go ahead yeah so exactly I had the same

1919
01:25:40,789 --> 01:25:44,599
thing in mind so I think these links

1920
01:25:42,289 --> 01:25:48,079
very nicely to our our next topic that

1921
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:49,280
we see in um so Mike Michael did you

1922
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,099
have any final conclusions you will not

1923
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:54,110
share before we move on to the next no I

1924
01:25:52,099 --> 01:25:56,719
don't say that we discussion with minds

1925
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:59,058
and I I think I get that alignment at

1926
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:03,469
some point to be on the same page with

1927
01:25:59,059 --> 01:26:04,550
margin teams as well absolutely we

1928
01:26:03,469 --> 01:26:06,649
should take that you know for example

1929
01:26:04,550 --> 01:26:08,059
one of the upcoming we she calls they

1930
01:26:06,649 --> 01:26:09,800
could take a stab at that topic and see

1931
01:26:08,059 --> 01:26:12,590
how we can find some more convergence

1932
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:13,939
common tools common ways to get get more

1933
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:15,439
interoperability I think that we very

1934
01:26:13,939 --> 01:26:20,419
interesting topic let's take a note of

1935
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:24,439
that okay okay thank thank you McCool

1936
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:27,079
and then off to our final topic you saw

1937
01:26:24,439 --> 01:26:29,689
something along these lines on the

1938
01:26:27,079 --> 01:26:32,719
agenda it's related to these discussions

1939
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:36,760
we have had over the past few months or

1940
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:39,260
so and now we're basically talking about

1941
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:41,479
what they're all of these different

1942
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:44,599
activities we have around going on on

1943
01:26:41,479 --> 01:26:46,070
IOT how should we perhaps have where's

1944
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:48,139
the right for ahadees what is the price

1945
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:49,999
structure and groups should we have more

1946
01:26:48,139 --> 01:26:53,300
site meetings inter-school new working

1947
01:26:49,999 --> 01:26:54,709
group how we go forward on the systems

1948
01:26:53,300 --> 01:26:57,649
and have a lot of discussions over the

1949
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:59,898
weekend our IT director etc but now this

1950
01:26:57,649 --> 01:27:01,520
out discussing at large with IETF and

1951
01:26:59,899 --> 01:27:03,710
hierarchy of community

1952
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:06,500
Anne Elliot kindly volunteered to take a

1953
01:27:03,710 --> 01:27:12,500
lead on this disgusting okay thanks

1954
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:15,410
sorry okay so I'm Elliot

1955
01:27:12,500 --> 01:27:17,120
I represent only myself in this

1956
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:19,670
discussion I'm not trying to represent

1957
01:27:17,120 --> 01:27:21,680
any iesg view or any other view I'm not

1958
01:27:19,670 --> 01:27:23,090
a member of the isg I'm not a charity

1959
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:25,940
bla bla bla

1960
01:27:23,090 --> 01:27:28,010
however I have him convening some side

1961
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:30,650
meetings and in one of those side

1962
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:32,500
meetings we had an area director show up

1963
01:27:30,650 --> 01:27:35,240
and we've had some discussion on lists

1964
01:27:32,500 --> 01:27:39,310
about a perennial topic at the IETF

1965
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:47,710
which is how do we organize around IOT

1966
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:50,270
so this discussion is about that so as

1967
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:53,720
as nobody in this room will be surprised

1968
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:56,960
we have a huge amount of work going on

1969
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:59,930
in IOT not only in this organization but

1970
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:03,080
elsewhere so of course we have this

1971
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:04,430
group I'm sure that these two gentlemen

1972
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,680
would would say that I mischaracterized

1973
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:09,050
the work in some way and in terms of TT

1974
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:10,700
TRG it's a very broad activity which is

1975
01:28:09,050 --> 01:28:13,370
great by the way

1976
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:15,170
that's it's fun to participate here and

1977
01:28:13,370 --> 01:28:19,130
and I particularly enjoyed participating

1978
01:28:15,170 --> 01:28:24,890
in the workshop on last Friday we have

1979
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:28,460
the IOT Directorate which the iesg

1980
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:31,550
members have in particular Ignace

1981
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:34,700
described as a reactive component of our

1982
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:39,020
system to provide review of work that

1983
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:42,920
goes on at the I at the IETF we have a

1984
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:46,370
great many working groups that tackle

1985
01:28:42,920 --> 01:28:51,650
issues that that affect IOT sometimes

1986
01:28:46,370 --> 01:28:55,070
it's a direct intention to go into IOT

1987
01:28:51,650 --> 01:28:57,679
sometimes it gets backed into an example

1988
01:28:55,070 --> 01:28:59,480
of an area where I think really IOT got

1989
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:01,340
backed into particularly onboarding was

1990
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:02,629
anima I'm sure they didn't start out

1991
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:04,010
thinking that they were gonna be an IOT

1992
01:29:02,630 --> 01:29:08,450
onboarding discussion but that's where

1993
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:12,140
they ended up and then of course there

1994
01:29:08,450 --> 01:29:15,070
are the plethora of SD O's that are

1995
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:15,070
involved in the space

1996
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:22,790
and as eve mentioned there are a great

1997
01:29:19,220 --> 01:29:25,330
many building blocks all around which we

1998
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:28,370
have I think perhaps a lack of guidance

1999
01:29:25,330 --> 01:29:31,940
at this point that is something that

2000
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:38,780
Ignace pointed out in his discussions on

2001
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:41,150
Monday so he proposed something and I'm

2002
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:45,250
going to do his proposal some injustice

2003
01:29:41,150 --> 01:29:51,500
I'm sure and for that I apologize to him

2004
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:53,440
but it the iesg did have a meeting in

2005
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:56,720
which they discussed alternate methods

2006
01:29:53,440 --> 01:29:59,000
to organize around work the classic

2007
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:02,239
method that we have in the ITF is to

2008
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,830
have a working group but working groups

2009
01:30:02,239 --> 01:30:06,980
usually have deliverables and they're

2010
01:30:03,830 --> 01:30:10,610
usually tightly constrained to to

2011
01:30:06,980 --> 01:30:12,950
certain to two very specific charters

2012
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:15,650
for it to accomplish those those

2013
01:30:12,950 --> 01:30:17,720
objectives this would be a little

2014
01:30:15,650 --> 01:30:20,960
different this would be more of a

2015
01:30:17,720 --> 01:30:23,270
standing group that would focus on on a

2016
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:25,610
broader topic for purpose for slightly

2017
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:27,800
different purposes one of which is to

2018
01:30:25,610 --> 01:30:30,440
know and perhaps the most important of

2019
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:32,530
which is to focus on how we put all

2020
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:38,320
these different building blocks together

2021
01:30:32,530 --> 01:30:41,480
how do we make them a useful system and

2022
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:44,090
so the idea would be okay great we have

2023
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:47,150
core over here the co-op over here we

2024
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:50,810
have cozy over here there's the web of

2025
01:30:47,150 --> 01:30:57,379
things there's I Triple E 802 2.1 AR

2026
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:59,390
there's six tsch there's other I Triple

2027
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:03,530
E groups there so DVA

2028
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:04,640
and and sip and the next generation of

2029
01:31:03,530 --> 01:31:07,519
sip that is coming along in the

2030
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:08,870
industrial space I can mention a zillion

2031
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:13,190
of these things and spend the entire

2032
01:31:08,870 --> 01:31:16,280
time doing so but putting together

2033
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:18,950
putting them together as a system is

2034
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:21,910
something that we could spend some time

2035
01:31:18,950 --> 01:31:26,050
doing and the key here I think is that

2036
01:31:21,910 --> 01:31:28,190
it can't be proprietary to IETF work

2037
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:29,160
other people are doing work and other

2038
01:31:28,190 --> 01:31:32,849
people doing really good

2039
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:34,440
work but we could also do a couple of

2040
01:31:32,850 --> 01:31:36,180
other things so so what does that lead

2041
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:37,740
to means maybe we're delivering some

2042
01:31:36,180 --> 01:31:39,870
informational documents in the form of

2043
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:42,840
architectures I have to say the iesg in

2044
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:45,150
past has not been in favor of doing

2045
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:47,310
architectural documents but here I think

2046
01:31:45,150 --> 01:31:49,349
they feel differently but that could be

2047
01:31:47,310 --> 01:31:51,090
me projecting a little bit and Ignace

2048
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:52,980
could say more if you were here but I

2049
01:31:51,090 --> 01:31:54,600
think this is people who are in the room

2050
01:31:52,980 --> 01:31:56,639
on Monday please correct me if you think

2051
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:59,030
I'm wrong

2052
01:31:56,640 --> 01:32:02,910
we could certainly spot some gaps in a

2053
01:31:59,030 --> 01:32:05,190
and it overlaps I think at least my feel

2054
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:08,580
at the moment is that there are both an

2055
01:32:05,190 --> 01:32:10,679
example of an overlap is the plethora of

2056
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:13,769
onboarding mechanisms that are

2057
01:32:10,680 --> 01:32:18,090
developing at different levels an

2058
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:22,110
example of a gap would be some amount of

2059
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:24,360
authorization models that tie to the tie

2060
01:32:22,110 --> 01:32:26,309
the network level onboarding into the

2061
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:29,820
application space a good example of that

2062
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:32,910
is the discussion that we just had Mike

2063
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:34,469
just mentioned about how we do

2064
01:32:32,910 --> 01:32:37,650
authorization of resource directories

2065
01:32:34,470 --> 01:32:38,820
for instance and how and how you bind

2066
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:40,530
all the way through from an onboarding

2067
01:32:38,820 --> 01:32:43,259
perspective which was Eve's point in

2068
01:32:40,530 --> 01:32:50,550
terms of showing the whole flow okay so

2069
01:32:43,260 --> 01:32:54,030
these are this is one approach but the

2070
01:32:50,550 --> 01:32:57,480
people at least on Monday did not really

2071
01:32:54,030 --> 01:33:01,259
take warm to it I think there are a

2072
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:03,120
couple of issues that were raised one of

2073
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:07,980
which was that this was an excessively

2074
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:10,950
broad area and the IETF has a let's just

2075
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:13,860
say a sketchy track record for handling

2076
01:33:10,950 --> 01:33:18,240
such a broad area and it was a little

2077
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:20,339
vague and the work that we could clearly

2078
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:23,760
see before us related to network level

2079
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,830
onboarding well more of that was a

2080
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:30,810
little the rest of it was a little fuzzy

2081
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:32,640
but so so one approach so one approach

2082
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:34,320
that we could do is we could go into

2083
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:35,520
onboarding so let me talk a little bit

2084
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:37,920
about what we did in onboarding this

2085
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,930
week and and that can give you a feel

2086
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:43,200
for alternatives even to having a

2087
01:33:39,930 --> 01:33:45,210
working group so the IETF

2088
01:33:43,200 --> 01:33:49,679
you have a working group if you're lucky

2089
01:33:45,210 --> 01:33:52,320
you meet for an hour or two during a

2090
01:33:49,680 --> 01:33:54,150
week where you've flown a great distance

2091
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:57,030
to be here

2092
01:33:54,150 --> 01:33:59,580
we met the onboarding group that we had

2093
01:33:57,030 --> 01:34:01,519
had sightings that met three times this

2094
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:04,620
week

2095
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:07,470
people essentially sacrificing sleep

2096
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:10,830
time especially after the social to come

2097
01:34:07,470 --> 01:34:12,660
join us and we actually have a very

2098
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:14,100
particular problem that we were focused

2099
01:34:12,660 --> 01:34:16,940
on which is the the plethora of

2100
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:19,970
approaches and the way I put it is that

2101
01:34:16,940 --> 01:34:21,870
if we can get some consolidation of

2102
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:27,300
approaches maybe we can get some

2103
01:34:21,870 --> 01:34:28,980
acceleration of implementation so we

2104
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:31,500
were we were talking a lot about the COS

2105
01:34:28,980 --> 01:34:32,669
inches in COS outers of this process for

2106
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,990
those people who are not familiar with

2107
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:36,720
that phrase and there were some in the

2108
01:34:33,990 --> 01:34:39,290
previous session that I have because

2109
01:34:36,720 --> 01:34:41,880
inches meaning inputs into the into the

2110
01:34:39,290 --> 01:34:43,950
process of the network process of

2111
01:34:41,880 --> 01:34:45,510
onboarding and the goes out is meaning

2112
01:34:43,950 --> 01:34:48,870
the weight weight you get out of that

2113
01:34:45,510 --> 01:34:52,680
process an example of which being DPP

2114
01:34:48,870 --> 01:34:54,360
which I'll discuss in a second and then

2115
01:34:52,680 --> 01:34:55,920
we wanted to go through great many use

2116
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:59,339
cases to see if we could validate

2117
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:02,910
against a very small against one

2118
01:34:59,340 --> 01:35:04,740
particular architecture so fewest

2119
01:35:02,910 --> 01:35:09,120
possible inputs views possible outputs

2120
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:13,469
common components where possible common

2121
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:16,200
components also means that probably we

2122
01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:19,110
need four and consolidation means that

2123
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:23,280
people need to be able to take ideas off

2124
01:35:19,110 --> 01:35:25,019
the table and that's hard especially

2125
01:35:23,280 --> 01:35:28,200
when there are a lot of vendors involved

2126
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:30,210
the typical way that happens is somebody

2127
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:32,490
says we have too many ideas we need to

2128
01:35:30,210 --> 01:35:35,400
take we need to take some off the table

2129
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:39,480
you take yours off the table

2130
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:42,530
so we Cisco and I and a couple of others

2131
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:44,759
have been looking at anima and

2132
01:35:42,530 --> 01:35:45,690
bootstrapping remote key infrastructure

2133
01:35:44,760 --> 01:35:47,220
one of the things we've been looking at

2134
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:50,639
is whether we can take that one off the

2135
01:35:47,220 --> 01:35:52,350
table in favour of other mechanisms but

2136
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,760
that that requires careful use case

2137
01:35:52,350 --> 01:35:56,250
analysis and we spent a fair amount of

2138
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:57,190
time this week talking about that we

2139
01:35:56,250 --> 01:35:59,530
spent a lot of times

2140
01:35:57,190 --> 01:36:01,179
walking about DPP this is device

2141
01:35:59,530 --> 01:36:04,900
provisioning protocol from the Wi-Fi

2142
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:07,170
Alliance the common input here is a

2143
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:11,049
public/private key pair this is a nice

2144
01:36:07,170 --> 01:36:13,830
architectural component because it's

2145
01:36:11,050 --> 01:36:16,660
quite common already if we look at

2146
01:36:13,830 --> 01:36:19,420
Intel's SDO the secure device on boards

2147
01:36:16,660 --> 01:36:21,030
mechanisms one of the outputs of that

2148
01:36:19,420 --> 01:36:23,650
mechanism is a public/private key pair

2149
01:36:21,030 --> 01:36:26,410
annie annie dcs a public/private keep

2150
01:36:23,650 --> 01:36:28,179
here well that can feed right into a

2151
01:36:26,410 --> 01:36:30,660
network level onboarding process here

2152
01:36:28,180 --> 01:36:37,120
that's nice that's something we observed

2153
01:36:30,660 --> 01:36:38,949
the same might be true with with with

2154
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:41,590
some of the ocf processes but I'm not a

2155
01:36:38,949 --> 01:36:44,379
I'm not 100% clear on that so that's an

2156
01:36:41,590 --> 01:36:46,660
input the input could come in the form

2157
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:49,719
of say that SDO output or it could come

2158
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:54,780
in form of a QR code or it could come in

2159
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:54,780
the form of some other import mechanism

2160
01:36:55,949 --> 01:37:02,589
the output is something that is also is

2161
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:04,360
interesting and it has a couple of

2162
01:37:02,590 --> 01:37:07,719
architectural implications the first of

2163
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:09,699
which is a question which is who gets to

2164
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:11,830
decide what sort of authentication is

2165
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:14,739
used for network and what sort of a

2166
01:37:11,830 --> 01:37:15,820
thing altercation is needed I think

2167
01:37:14,739 --> 01:37:19,150
there are a fair number of networks out

2168
01:37:15,820 --> 01:37:24,370
there that use private shared keys as a

2169
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:27,250
means to use Wireless either that is in

2170
01:37:24,370 --> 01:37:29,140
the form of sae or as an inform of it

2171
01:37:27,250 --> 01:37:30,850
couldn't be in the form of just a PS k

2172
01:37:29,140 --> 01:37:32,949
that is an input to another process or

2173
01:37:30,850 --> 01:37:35,890
in DPP's case they have this other

2174
01:37:32,949 --> 01:37:38,379
concept of a connector DPP what it

2175
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:40,510
really delivers as the output is what

2176
01:37:38,380 --> 01:37:42,580
what Dan harkens would call a profile

2177
01:37:40,510 --> 01:37:44,560
and the profile can contain these

2178
01:37:42,580 --> 01:37:47,680
various options including the potential

2179
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,989
potentially for a certificate another

2180
01:37:47,680 --> 01:37:53,469
nice feature about DPP is that has a

2181
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:56,169
label standard associated with it that's

2182
01:37:53,469 --> 01:37:59,050
something that we don't want to have too

2183
01:37:56,170 --> 01:38:01,030
many of otherwise the manufacturers will

2184
01:37:59,050 --> 01:38:02,560
just throw up their hands and we'll be

2185
01:38:01,030 --> 01:38:05,500
right back where we started from a

2186
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:06,969
fragmentation standpoint and so that's

2187
01:38:05,500 --> 01:38:09,130
one reason to take other mechanisms off

2188
01:38:06,969 --> 01:38:10,960
the table is that this here we have a

2189
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:13,060
labeling standard so

2190
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,880
we looked a little bit then a teep here

2191
01:38:13,060 --> 01:38:19,060
at the ietf a nice linkage between DPP

2192
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:22,240
and teep is so for those people don't

2193
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:26,310
know teep is an EP it has some nice

2194
01:38:22,240 --> 01:38:30,160
features in that it has tlvs to handle a

2195
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:32,410
pkcs7 pkcs 10a transaction so you can

2196
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:35,380
get certificates you can reprovision

2197
01:38:32,410 --> 01:38:37,450
certificates using tea if you do this at

2198
01:38:35,380 --> 01:38:39,670
the l2 layer you don't have to worry

2199
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:40,870
about your interface having been up if

2200
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,370
you look at a lot of the onboarding

2201
01:38:40,870 --> 01:38:44,050
mechanisms that have been defined in

2202
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:45,790
other fora usually there are a bit

2203
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:47,550
higher layer and so they assume for

2204
01:38:45,790 --> 01:38:50,710
instance that you're able to communicate

2205
01:38:47,550 --> 01:38:52,330
using HTTP or KO app when in fact you

2206
01:38:50,710 --> 01:38:53,710
might not even have been assigned an IP

2207
01:38:52,330 --> 01:38:57,900
address because the network will not

2208
01:38:53,710 --> 01:39:02,080
have authorized you yet for that purpose

2209
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:04,830
so teep allows for lockstep often

2210
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:07,720
occations server driven authentication

2211
01:39:04,830 --> 01:39:09,610
meaning if you need a certificate if

2212
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:11,230
they're off if the local deployment

2213
01:39:09,610 --> 01:39:13,150
needs for you to have a certificate you

2214
01:39:11,230 --> 01:39:16,629
can say I need you to have a certificate

2215
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:18,460
please request one so that's a nice

2216
01:39:16,630 --> 01:39:19,680
feature and it can say things like I

2217
01:39:18,460 --> 01:39:22,060
need you to reprovision

2218
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:24,190
your new certificate and why would you

2219
01:39:22,060 --> 01:39:26,290
do that it's because perhaps for

2220
01:39:24,190 --> 01:39:27,700
instance the trust anchor has changed

2221
01:39:26,290 --> 01:39:30,190
and you want to roll the certificates

2222
01:39:27,700 --> 01:39:31,570
onto a new trust anchor right so there's

2223
01:39:30,190 --> 01:39:33,339
some nice features critique now the

2224
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:36,429
question is how do you link TPP to teep

2225
01:39:33,340 --> 01:39:38,830
and we spent three days worth of time

2226
01:39:36,430 --> 01:39:42,430
talking a lot about that if the output

2227
01:39:38,830 --> 01:39:46,600
of the DPP process is for instance a PSK

2228
01:39:42,430 --> 01:39:51,520
could you then link for instance that

2229
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:53,770
PSK using TLS PSK the other side of this

2230
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:57,280
also is that we wanted to cover why

2231
01:39:53,770 --> 01:39:59,590
wired onboarding we have been going back

2232
01:39:57,280 --> 01:40:01,929
and forth quite a bit on that and we

2233
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:05,260
haven't yet really landed on how how

2234
01:40:01,930 --> 01:40:07,150
that should work but what that shows is

2235
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:10,660
that we have quite a number of calls

2236
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:12,070
still to have I see that Ignis is walked

2237
01:40:10,660 --> 01:40:13,620
in through room so I'm gonna give Ignace

2238
01:40:12,070 --> 01:40:16,570
an opportunity to talk in a little while

2239
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:20,470
to say because and I'll just back up and

2240
01:40:16,570 --> 01:40:21,670
review in a few moments on that so we we

2241
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:23,260
have a list of questions that I think

2242
01:40:21,670 --> 01:40:24,760
we've we focused around on this which

2243
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:26,860
was how do we read provision

2244
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:29,680
what to do for Wired what sort of

2245
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:32,110
credentials be supported and this

2246
01:40:29,680 --> 01:40:33,910
basically review so the next steps that

2247
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:35,290
we came out of today is that we know we

2248
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:38,170
need to write an architecture document

2249
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:39,970
we know we need to sort wired we have to

2250
01:40:38,170 --> 01:40:41,230
handle manufacturer certs in this

2251
01:40:39,970 --> 01:40:42,940
process because one of the things we

2252
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:44,709
want to be able to do is detect

2253
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:47,200
counterfeit gear this something that

2254
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:49,150
brewski handles quite well it's it's

2255
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:52,510
right in the in the wheelhouse of

2256
01:40:49,150 --> 01:40:54,849
brewski in fact how to link PSK output

2257
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:59,470
of DPP to the next step if that's t p--

2258
01:40:54,850 --> 01:41:01,810
or something else that's actually it's

2259
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:04,090
not a hundred percent nailed down but

2260
01:41:01,810 --> 01:41:06,370
it's close and we think that the profile

2261
01:41:04,090 --> 01:41:07,390
mechanism that DPP has well that would

2262
01:41:06,370 --> 01:41:09,610
lead to that there's also another

2263
01:41:07,390 --> 01:41:12,280
mechanism that was defined in a draft

2264
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:15,639
called eat MEK which looks like it can

2265
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:17,530
it can actually be further merged into

2266
01:41:15,640 --> 01:41:20,500
tea and so there's some nice things

2267
01:41:17,530 --> 01:41:23,170
there so what does this mean about an IT

2268
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:25,060
working group so in a Monday meeting I

2269
01:41:23,170 --> 01:41:28,180
think people were very interested in

2270
01:41:25,060 --> 01:41:31,500
focusing on IOT onboarding so is that a

2271
01:41:28,180 --> 01:41:33,820
starting point or is that something that

2272
01:41:31,500 --> 01:41:35,880
we should just create a working group on

2273
01:41:33,820 --> 01:41:40,000
that just sort of zooms in on that topic

2274
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:42,130
I think I heard from people in this room

2275
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,930
earlier that really we have other things

2276
01:41:42,130 --> 01:41:48,489
to talk about beyond just the network

2277
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:51,550
level onboarding they're great many this

2278
01:41:48,489 --> 01:41:54,009
is a very large elephant and they're

2279
01:41:51,550 --> 01:41:55,750
great many places to touch it and so

2280
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:58,270
there are probably other aspects that we

2281
01:41:55,750 --> 01:42:01,150
can that we can develop so maybe it is

2282
01:41:58,270 --> 01:42:04,750
really a starting point an authorization

2283
01:42:01,150 --> 01:42:06,489
in the resource directory is another

2284
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:08,500
area think that's that's worthwhile and

2285
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:12,219
what I just mentioned previously at the

2286
01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:14,710
microphone about how we authorize how we

2287
01:42:12,220 --> 01:42:16,840
provide secured information about the

2288
01:42:14,710 --> 01:42:18,840
network and without the device in a way

2289
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:21,820
that each side knows who the other is

2290
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:23,830
for for sharing information in a way

2291
01:42:21,820 --> 01:42:24,130
that's more confidential than it is

2292
01:42:23,830 --> 01:42:26,050
today

2293
01:42:24,130 --> 01:42:28,450
it's also something that we could

2294
01:42:26,050 --> 01:42:30,610
explore in that aspect but it also leads

2295
01:42:28,450 --> 01:42:36,300
to overlap with this group for instance

2296
01:42:30,610 --> 01:42:39,580
as to what's research what is what is

2297
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:42,940
explanation of the existing

2298
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:43,989
capabilities and how do we drive and I

2299
01:42:42,940 --> 01:42:45,489
think one of the things that Ignis it

2300
01:42:43,989 --> 01:42:47,309
was it'd be useful to have a place where

2301
01:42:45,489 --> 01:42:50,139
we could drive work into other groups

2302
01:42:47,310 --> 01:42:53,860
such as how do we take the output of

2303
01:42:50,140 --> 01:42:55,930
DHCP working group and use that say in a

2304
01:42:53,860 --> 01:42:58,150
serialization and so that would be a

2305
01:42:55,930 --> 01:43:00,610
good topic for such a group I think and

2306
01:42:58,150 --> 01:43:01,900
of course this needs to track across SD

2307
01:43:00,610 --> 01:43:03,219
O's and the reason it needs to track

2308
01:43:01,900 --> 01:43:04,449
across the studios is because not all

2309
01:43:03,219 --> 01:43:06,010
the good work is going on here it's

2310
01:43:04,449 --> 01:43:07,870
going on elsewhere and we want to

2311
01:43:06,010 --> 01:43:09,520
leverage that work in as much as we can

2312
01:43:07,870 --> 01:43:13,930
there are certain limitations in doing

2313
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:15,100
so with that before we we have an open

2314
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:16,719
microphone discussion

2315
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:21,790
I thought Ignace you might want to say a

2316
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:23,770
few additional words Donna's right so

2317
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:25,360
apologists that I was not here at the

2318
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:27,370
very beginning of the session I was not

2319
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:31,239
aware what you promised to the group

2320
01:43:27,370 --> 01:43:32,559
that I will do I said you go ahead and

2321
01:43:31,239 --> 01:43:33,910
create this thing and there'd be no

2322
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:38,320
further discussion you just pop up in

2323
01:43:33,910 --> 01:43:40,389
the each other next year right if maybe

2324
01:43:38,320 --> 01:43:42,460
you want to put that that slide that we

2325
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:44,680
discussed Monday morning at the side

2326
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:48,340
meeting just as a context or did you did

2327
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:50,730
you go through that I didn't go through

2328
01:43:48,340 --> 01:43:54,850
that exact slide but I talked through it

2329
01:43:50,730 --> 01:43:57,879
all right so a very brief summary none

2330
01:43:54,850 --> 01:44:00,430
of the thinking there's a lot of

2331
01:43:57,880 --> 01:44:04,210
activity of the individual work

2332
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:06,340
happening on a components that are

2333
01:44:04,210 --> 01:44:09,820
relevant to the IOT in way one or the

2334
01:44:06,340 --> 01:44:12,550
other way doesn't appear to be the place

2335
01:44:09,820 --> 01:44:15,670
that works on combining those components

2336
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:18,280
together that's one gathering the

2337
01:44:15,670 --> 01:44:20,620
requirements and explaining to the

2338
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:23,530
external entities be it as do so the

2339
01:44:20,620 --> 01:44:27,760
user groups or or in general users of

2340
01:44:23,530 --> 01:44:30,790
these technologies setting is if we look

2341
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:33,250
from outside of the IETF is it really

2342
01:44:30,790 --> 01:44:35,019
evident that the idea works on IOT idea

2343
01:44:33,250 --> 01:44:36,640
of work it's evident that the idea works

2344
01:44:35,020 --> 01:44:42,370
on multiple components but does that

2345
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:45,850
work or does it work on IOT systems or

2346
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:47,530
or solutions as such whether it needs to

2347
01:44:45,850 --> 01:44:50,770
work on that or not it's still an open

2348
01:44:47,530 --> 01:44:52,300
question and to what level so the

2349
01:44:50,770 --> 01:44:54,910
working thinking about that

2350
01:44:52,300 --> 01:45:00,000
is probably we need a structure which

2351
01:44:54,910 --> 01:45:00,000
would work on coordination and then

2352
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:07,120
merging of the individual working groups

2353
01:45:03,370 --> 01:45:10,720
outputs into something broader and this

2354
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:12,910
would include mostly taking the

2355
01:45:10,720 --> 01:45:15,550
requirements for a broader scope work

2356
01:45:12,910 --> 01:45:17,620
slicing that into the pieces directing

2357
01:45:15,550 --> 01:45:20,790
that to the individual working groups

2358
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:24,130
and coordinating that work now one

2359
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:26,920
specific work item that I hear a lot is

2360
01:45:24,130 --> 01:45:28,330
about the IOT onboarding and and the

2361
01:45:26,920 --> 01:45:32,500
things related to that so probably

2362
01:45:28,330 --> 01:45:35,110
that's one of the specific focused

2363
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:37,750
working groups that needs to happen and

2364
01:45:35,110 --> 01:45:39,849
the feeling that I hear from a community

2365
01:45:37,750 --> 01:45:41,380
that there is interest there appear to

2366
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:43,720
be people who are willing to do that

2367
01:45:41,380 --> 01:45:48,610
work so probably it's simpler to answer

2368
01:45:43,720 --> 01:45:53,110
now the IOT coordination group it's not

2369
01:45:48,610 --> 01:46:02,500
so evident and I think that's that those

2370
01:45:53,110 --> 01:46:06,040
are the comments that I have take Taylor

2371
01:46:02,500 --> 01:46:07,780
so I have four comments on topics that

2372
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:09,640
been trying to save up and not interrupt

2373
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:10,240
and so let's see if I can keep them in

2374
01:46:09,640 --> 01:46:13,170
my head

2375
01:46:10,240 --> 01:46:17,050
which you have to do with this group

2376
01:46:13,170 --> 01:46:20,020
onboarding working group website and I

2377
01:46:17,050 --> 01:46:21,550
in IOT Directorate those are the four

2378
01:46:20,020 --> 01:46:24,670
topics I'm fronted so if I forget one

2379
01:46:21,550 --> 01:46:26,800
hopefully somebody can write so on the

2380
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,750
onboarding topic I am all in favor of

2381
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:31,180
having a working group the only concern

2382
01:46:28,750 --> 01:46:32,650
that I would have that the working group

2383
01:46:31,180 --> 01:46:33,730
charter or whatever would have to

2384
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:35,290
address and this may have come up in

2385
01:46:33,730 --> 01:46:36,490
your side being I was obviously there in

2386
01:46:35,290 --> 01:46:39,700
the Monday meeting but not in the other

2387
01:46:36,490 --> 01:46:41,800
ones is that on your one slide that said

2388
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:44,440
like too many solutions market

2389
01:46:41,800 --> 01:46:46,420
fragmented can we consolidate and of

2390
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:48,759
course there's the classic xkcd nine to

2391
01:46:46,420 --> 01:46:50,140
seven which comes up in that and as long

2392
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:52,420
as you can convince the community that

2393
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,710
xkcd 927 will apply that I think the

2394
01:46:52,420 --> 01:46:55,660
working group is a great idea to have

2395
01:46:53,710 --> 01:46:57,010
something that scoped to IOT onboarding

2396
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:58,750
and for those of you who don't know

2397
01:46:57,010 --> 01:47:00,070
that's the one that says there's 14

2398
01:46:58,750 --> 01:47:01,570
competing standards what do we do let's

2399
01:47:00,070 --> 01:47:04,299
create a new one and surveys 15

2400
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:05,380
competing standards right so I'm all in

2401
01:47:04,300 --> 01:47:06,080
favor of that thank you

2402
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:07,820
please

2403
01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:10,340
can you hopefully you can do something

2404
01:47:07,820 --> 01:47:12,710
and find a justification that's topic

2405
01:47:10,340 --> 01:47:16,130
104 okay

2406
01:47:12,710 --> 01:47:17,720
uh external people do they actually know

2407
01:47:16,130 --> 01:47:20,720
that the IETF does IOT this is the

2408
01:47:17,720 --> 01:47:22,880
website topic if you go to the WWI ETF

2409
01:47:20,720 --> 01:47:24,320
org right now you'll see topics of

2410
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,730
interest in the header at the top one of

2411
01:47:24,320 --> 01:47:26,690
those topics of interest is IOT you

2412
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:27,709
scroll down to the bottom of the page

2413
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:29,750
you see a great big thing they're saying

2414
01:47:27,710 --> 01:47:31,670
Internet of Things and so hopefully

2415
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:32,810
anybody who actually goes to the website

2416
01:47:31,670 --> 01:47:34,340
would never come away with an impression

2417
01:47:32,810 --> 01:47:36,830
that we don't do IOT because that's how

2418
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:37,910
the whole point of their and Greg has

2419
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:39,260
been running this thing about how do we

2420
01:47:37,910 --> 01:47:41,300
improve the website and so you have

2421
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,440
ideas of that there's an initiative

2422
01:47:41,300 --> 01:47:44,930
there that doesn't require a working

2423
01:47:42,440 --> 01:47:46,339
group to improve that visibility thanks

2424
01:47:44,930 --> 01:47:49,040
to Greg and anybody else involved in

2425
01:47:46,340 --> 01:47:53,110
that and please continue that that's for

2426
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:55,730
the external visibility point let's see

2427
01:47:53,110 --> 01:47:57,950
this group so some of the topics that

2428
01:47:55,730 --> 01:47:59,480
you mentioned are some of the discussion

2429
01:47:57,950 --> 01:48:02,599
from Monday that you were summarizing

2430
01:47:59,480 --> 01:48:04,879
giving an accurate summary of was do we

2431
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:07,190
need a group that has perhaps no

2432
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:09,200
constrained Charter and does more broad

2433
01:48:07,190 --> 01:48:11,990
things including gap analysis and

2434
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:13,220
coordination between stos I think the

2435
01:48:11,990 --> 01:48:14,780
thing to think the research group is

2436
01:48:13,220 --> 01:48:15,980
doing a great job of that because

2437
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,780
especially because there's so many

2438
01:48:15,980 --> 01:48:19,549
people in this room that are working

2439
01:48:17,780 --> 01:48:21,500
group chairs and editors and documents I

2440
01:48:19,550 --> 01:48:22,700
think we have a great group for that I

2441
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,830
don't know if we need to compete with

2442
01:48:22,700 --> 01:48:26,660
this group because if I didn't broke

2443
01:48:24,830 --> 01:48:29,300
don't fix it I like what you're doing in

2444
01:48:26,660 --> 01:48:32,510
this room please continue and then my

2445
01:48:29,300 --> 01:48:34,250
last topic what did I say Oh internet

2446
01:48:32,510 --> 01:48:36,740
area director it's some of the other

2447
01:48:34,250 --> 01:48:38,780
coordination which is different

2448
01:48:36,740 --> 01:48:40,429
categories other ones is the Directorate

2449
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:42,950
does have some of that role too of doing

2450
01:48:40,430 --> 01:48:44,900
stuff across working groups that's the

2451
01:48:42,950 --> 01:48:46,160
four things that I came up to say I

2452
01:48:44,900 --> 01:48:49,570
don't know if I'll have more given the

2453
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:49,570
rest of the mic line so I'll go away now

2454
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:57,799
we have both I was referring to the IOT

2455
01:48:55,240 --> 01:48:59,139
Directorate but yes we have both they

2456
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:01,430
have different roles but for the

2457
01:48:59,140 --> 01:49:03,830
Coordination across a working group

2458
01:49:01,430 --> 01:49:07,310
chairs because the internet the IOT

2459
01:49:03,830 --> 01:49:09,920
Directorate not only coordinates across

2460
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:11,450
s Geo's like this group does but the

2461
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:12,920
chairs come together and are put out all

2462
01:49:11,450 --> 01:49:14,480
that they know about what other working

2463
01:49:12,920 --> 01:49:17,090
groups are doing on a more regular basis

2464
01:49:14,480 --> 01:49:19,039
and so those calls are what monthly you

2465
01:49:17,090 --> 01:49:20,570
get bi-weekly something like that

2466
01:49:19,039 --> 01:49:22,130
that we have calls will report out ah

2467
01:49:20,570 --> 01:49:23,869
this is what LCF is doing this is what

2468
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:24,980
LMA is doing and so on so some of that

2469
01:49:23,869 --> 01:49:26,000
is going on right now within the

2470
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:28,190
Directorate of sharing information

2471
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,139
across stos but that's primarily between

2472
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:31,820
the working group chairs this group

2473
01:49:30,139 --> 01:49:32,960
think the think research group is the

2474
01:49:31,820 --> 01:49:35,989
one that does it across the global

2475
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:38,179
community just a quick comment

2476
01:49:35,989 --> 01:49:40,968
let me put for a while my IOT

2477
01:49:38,179 --> 01:49:42,409
directorate-general hat on so yeah what

2478
01:49:40,969 --> 01:49:44,659
Dave said we have this coordination

2479
01:49:42,409 --> 01:49:46,759
across the groups and maybe was we have

2480
01:49:44,659 --> 01:49:49,039
had so far in the directory is that

2481
01:49:46,760 --> 01:49:51,650
those calls have been closed it's only

2482
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:54,280
for director members maybe one thing was

2483
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:57,170
we could do here is have that alignment

2484
01:49:54,280 --> 01:49:59,900
reporting calls open for for everyone

2485
01:49:57,170 --> 01:50:01,820
that could be one way to go forwards you

2486
01:49:59,900 --> 01:50:04,460
already have this activity of reporting

2487
01:50:01,820 --> 01:50:06,980
on the frequency of those calls it's

2488
01:50:04,460 --> 01:50:09,619
basically once before the IETF usually

2489
01:50:06,980 --> 01:50:11,150
after the deadline before diet if we

2490
01:50:09,619 --> 01:50:13,639
have had this one call where we go

2491
01:50:11,150 --> 01:50:15,888
through all the groups and basically

2492
01:50:13,639 --> 01:50:17,150
that chairs report what's the main

2493
01:50:15,889 --> 01:50:19,340
things going on what are things that

2494
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:21,259
require coordination that could be one

2495
01:50:19,340 --> 01:50:26,300
potential way to get more of that

2496
01:50:21,260 --> 01:50:28,940
activity or widely available yeah let me

2497
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:33,949
just add one comment about coordination

2498
01:50:28,940 --> 01:50:35,150
within the IETF and in particular where

2499
01:50:33,949 --> 01:50:37,009
where I think this group probably

2500
01:50:35,150 --> 01:50:38,329
separates out a little bit and it could

2501
01:50:37,010 --> 01:50:40,340
be that we just want to evolve this

2502
01:50:38,329 --> 01:50:42,920
group into into something slightly a

2503
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:46,809
little bit more bound to the IETF

2504
01:50:42,920 --> 01:50:50,090
actually which is that we have had

2505
01:50:46,809 --> 01:50:51,409
numerous instances I think particularly

2506
01:50:50,090 --> 01:50:56,119
with onboarding but I'm sure it's

2507
01:50:51,409 --> 01:50:58,308
happened elsewhere to where different

2508
01:50:56,119 --> 01:51:01,250
mechanisms respond in different working

2509
01:50:58,309 --> 01:51:03,800
groups very early on director it never

2510
01:51:01,250 --> 01:51:07,699
saw didn't see it until much very late

2511
01:51:03,800 --> 01:51:11,090
in the game for instance and having a

2512
01:51:07,699 --> 01:51:13,339
way to spot those things earlier to

2513
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:15,679
provide for common architecture earlier

2514
01:51:13,340 --> 01:51:18,590
it probably would have helped

2515
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,300
I think prevent some fragmentation so I

2516
01:51:18,590 --> 01:51:26,780
just add that as comment I think Mohit

2517
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:29,150
your next might so I have been around

2518
01:51:26,780 --> 01:51:31,489
IETF now for four and a half years I've

2519
01:51:29,150 --> 01:51:33,049
been attending all the meetings and this

2520
01:51:31,489 --> 01:51:36,169
is my view of thing

2521
01:51:33,050 --> 01:51:37,010
so if I go to a boss people are all

2522
01:51:36,170 --> 01:51:38,809
excited

2523
01:51:37,010 --> 01:51:41,989
there is hundred people in the room and

2524
01:51:38,809 --> 01:51:43,520
yeah hum if you want to form this

2525
01:51:41,989 --> 01:51:46,129
working group the working group gets

2526
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:48,980
formed excellent but when it comes down

2527
01:51:46,130 --> 01:51:50,389
to doing the things I don't see anyone

2528
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:52,579
like there's only maybe two people

2529
01:51:50,389 --> 01:51:56,030
driving the things no people reviewing

2530
01:51:52,579 --> 01:51:58,009
and and and Elliott and I have been

2531
01:51:56,030 --> 01:52:00,590
involved in writing the blog post that

2532
01:51:58,010 --> 01:52:02,659
that Steve writes and we have trouble

2533
01:52:00,590 --> 01:52:06,520
getting even people to write texts for

2534
01:52:02,659 --> 01:52:09,650
the blog like am i living in in in some

2535
01:52:06,520 --> 01:52:11,270
fantasy land where we there's like a lot

2536
01:52:09,650 --> 01:52:13,730
of people excited but nobody sticks

2537
01:52:11,270 --> 01:52:16,909
around to do the things so so we have

2538
01:52:13,730 --> 01:52:18,530
experience of this on several occasions

2539
01:52:16,909 --> 01:52:20,480
wherever people don't show up to do

2540
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:23,210
things I mean look at t2 TRG there is

2541
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:25,009
plenty of time to present new things but

2542
01:52:23,210 --> 01:52:28,070
who are writing the drafts and bringing

2543
01:52:25,010 --> 01:52:29,809
it to rooty tooty RG coop right I think

2544
01:52:28,070 --> 01:52:33,230
this provides an excellent opportunity

2545
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:36,679
to get feedback from from a diverse set

2546
01:52:33,230 --> 01:52:38,110
of people but who is making the effort

2547
01:52:36,679 --> 01:52:40,309
to do that so before we go around

2548
01:52:38,110 --> 01:52:42,199
forming new working groups whether their

2549
01:52:40,309 --> 01:52:44,090
coordination groups or new working

2550
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:46,009
groups on onboarding why don't we bring

2551
01:52:44,090 --> 01:52:48,860
those things here and try to like get

2552
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:50,989
feedback here and see like if if this is

2553
01:52:48,860 --> 01:52:54,619
not sufficient maybe then forming a

2554
01:52:50,989 --> 01:52:58,369
working group might help I had a couple

2555
01:52:54,619 --> 01:52:59,869
of more things and then you please let

2556
01:52:58,369 --> 01:53:02,808
me finish and then then you can address

2557
01:52:59,869 --> 01:53:05,030
all my common comments together I don't

2558
01:53:02,809 --> 01:53:07,579
want to do that Mohit because I won't be

2559
01:53:05,030 --> 01:53:11,420
able to keep them in my head well I have

2560
01:53:07,579 --> 01:53:12,739
note so III you take notes as well so

2561
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:14,809
just stop for a second

2562
01:53:12,739 --> 01:53:17,598
and the only comment I wanted to say was

2563
01:53:14,809 --> 01:53:20,809
for IOT arm boarding we've had three

2564
01:53:17,599 --> 01:53:21,949
meetings this week with I'd say 20 25

2565
01:53:20,809 --> 01:53:24,469
people in the room for each of the

2566
01:53:21,949 --> 01:53:25,638
meetings so we have probably I think

2567
01:53:24,469 --> 01:53:27,619
we're seeing a pretty consistent

2568
01:53:25,639 --> 01:53:28,969
interest and it's not the goal there I

2569
01:53:27,619 --> 01:53:31,098
don't think is to come up with a new

2570
01:53:28,969 --> 01:53:32,659
standard right it's maybe a little bit

2571
01:53:31,099 --> 01:53:34,250
here and there but mostly to leverage

2572
01:53:32,659 --> 01:53:35,839
the existing standard so in that case I

2573
01:53:34,250 --> 01:53:37,309
think we have enough interest to move

2574
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:41,090
forward all right go on with your next

2575
01:53:37,309 --> 01:53:43,369
column disappointing anyways so we had

2576
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:46,400
the idea of building blocks right and we

2577
01:53:43,369 --> 01:53:47,150
let people to choose that maybe we want

2578
01:53:46,400 --> 01:53:49,070
to change

2579
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:50,659
I'm not saying we should always this is

2580
01:53:49,070 --> 01:53:54,679
something that's written in stone and we

2581
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:57,799
should never like try out new things but

2582
01:53:54,679 --> 01:53:59,480
like there is lake the working group on

2583
01:53:57,800 --> 01:54:02,690
lightweight key exchange there is

2584
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:04,879
compact TLS there is IPSec there is TLS

2585
01:54:02,690 --> 01:54:06,799
we have so many security protocols we

2586
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:09,770
don't go and tell VPN providers to use

2587
01:54:06,800 --> 01:54:11,989
IPSec and not use TLS or or one or the

2588
01:54:09,770 --> 01:54:13,460
other we let them make the decision for

2589
01:54:11,989 --> 01:54:15,709
them so what I'm afraid

2590
01:54:13,460 --> 01:54:17,980
also here is that if you start doing

2591
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:20,570
system architectural components

2592
01:54:17,980 --> 01:54:23,178
documents we are making the decisions

2593
01:54:20,570 --> 01:54:25,730
for people where as we should let them

2594
01:54:23,179 --> 01:54:29,150
make the decisions for themselves so

2595
01:54:25,730 --> 01:54:32,030
that that's another point I I think I

2596
01:54:29,150 --> 01:54:38,389
wanted to make I took notes as well so

2597
01:54:32,030 --> 01:54:42,139
let me okay if you can be brief we have

2598
01:54:38,390 --> 01:54:44,870
only five minutes session left sure yeah

2599
01:54:42,140 --> 01:54:47,630
maybe I will conclude by saying bring

2600
01:54:44,870 --> 01:54:49,219
the documents to t2 TRG whether we want

2601
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:50,810
to have a focus working group on

2602
01:54:49,219 --> 01:54:53,510
onboarding or whether we want to have

2603
01:54:50,810 --> 01:54:56,540
more general broader thing on IOT and on

2604
01:54:53,510 --> 01:54:58,550
systems I'm not saying no to it I just

2605
01:54:56,540 --> 01:55:01,699
think like there's plenty of time in t2

2606
01:54:58,550 --> 01:55:03,140
trt to do a slow start here I'll just

2607
01:55:01,699 --> 01:55:07,669
point out that there isn't cuz we're

2608
01:55:03,140 --> 01:55:10,130
just about out of time was it not mark I

2609
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:12,320
mean I think that on the EIU T Network

2610
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:14,480
onboarding and I said Network onboarding

2611
01:55:12,320 --> 01:55:16,610
because I think that's been the focus of

2612
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:19,549
the work today right that sounds like

2613
01:55:16,610 --> 01:55:21,080
engineering and something that you know

2614
01:55:19,550 --> 01:55:23,030
people can put together in a focus

2615
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:24,980
working group there is a question about

2616
01:55:23,030 --> 01:55:27,050
when you talk about onboarding in more

2617
01:55:24,980 --> 01:55:29,178
general right what resources do I get

2618
01:55:27,050 --> 01:55:31,070
access to who does this device actually

2619
01:55:29,179 --> 01:55:32,480
belong to does it belong to Eric does it

2620
01:55:31,070 --> 01:55:34,429
get access to the video camera at the

2621
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:37,040
door the thermostat whatever in the

2622
01:55:34,429 --> 01:55:39,679
house that might be a bit more research

2623
01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:43,040
here I don't actually know right we've

2624
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:44,780
done some of that with mud right yeah so

2625
01:55:43,040 --> 01:55:47,300
we've already have all ready produced a

2626
01:55:44,780 --> 01:55:49,400
standard there but but but it's not the

2627
01:55:47,300 --> 01:55:51,620
manufacturer that decides who can access

2628
01:55:49,400 --> 01:55:53,870
my my camera at my front door right

2629
01:55:51,620 --> 01:55:56,330
that's me but how does the device belong

2630
01:55:53,870 --> 01:55:57,830
to me well I can come up with schemes

2631
01:55:56,330 --> 01:55:59,300
but it's not obvious that there's one

2632
01:55:57,830 --> 01:56:00,920
answer and it could be different for

2633
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:04,010
different domains as well different use

2634
01:56:00,920 --> 01:56:06,050
cases right so maybe figuring out where

2635
01:56:04,010 --> 01:56:07,790
the boundary is is a useful thing but

2636
01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:09,710
starting with the network onboarding I

2637
01:56:07,790 --> 01:56:12,440
don't know about the sort of general

2638
01:56:09,710 --> 01:56:15,710
inbound let's have a place in the IDF to

2639
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:17,678
discuss IOT as a working group is that

2640
01:56:15,710 --> 01:56:20,270
you have you have to have some

2641
01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:22,400
motivational factor to have people show

2642
01:56:20,270 --> 01:56:24,739
up and actually try to do something even

2643
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:26,420
if that's writing some documents that

2644
01:56:24,739 --> 01:56:27,980
describe what they think is the shape of

2645
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:29,600
the dot part of the world right there

2646
01:56:27,980 --> 01:56:32,030
has to be some motivation that that

2647
01:56:29,600 --> 01:56:35,199
drives focus in there and I think is I I

2648
01:56:32,030 --> 01:56:41,660
t's way too broad for that but but also

2649
01:56:35,199 --> 01:56:43,879
thanks Michael Richardson here um so I

2650
01:56:41,660 --> 01:56:47,030
mostly agree with Mohit we should we

2651
01:56:43,880 --> 01:56:50,239
should probably make use more use of t2

2652
01:56:47,030 --> 01:56:52,880
TRG I would particularly like to know

2653
01:56:50,239 --> 01:56:54,860
the Friday schedule pre meeting schedule

2654
01:56:52,880 --> 01:56:58,670
at least four months in advance so that

2655
01:56:54,860 --> 01:57:01,820
I can adjust my other Friday pre meeting

2656
01:56:58,670 --> 01:57:03,290
scheduled people around would have been

2657
01:57:01,820 --> 01:57:05,840
there I would have tried harder to be

2658
01:57:03,290 --> 01:57:08,750
there last week and I known more than it

2659
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,400
three days in advance but so I think we

2660
01:57:08,750 --> 01:57:11,660
actually need that big long time as

2661
01:57:10,400 --> 01:57:13,309
Elliott said we're running at a time

2662
01:57:11,660 --> 01:57:15,410
right now I actually think is very

2663
01:57:13,310 --> 01:57:19,160
little value in having the t2 TRG

2664
01:57:15,410 --> 01:57:21,980
meeting this one here now I think that

2665
01:57:19,160 --> 01:57:24,469
that it needs the the whole date to

2666
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:28,160
discuss the second thing is that I think

2667
01:57:24,469 --> 01:57:30,110
that t2 TRG has has been focused on

2668
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:33,429
particularly like wish she typed things

2669
01:57:30,110 --> 01:57:35,750
like McCool's and and caustics

2670
01:57:33,429 --> 01:57:37,640
presentations earlier and while I find

2671
01:57:35,750 --> 01:57:38,900
them fascinating I not a participant in

2672
01:57:37,640 --> 01:57:40,670
that I think we need to branch into

2673
01:57:38,900 --> 01:57:43,759
other bigger things and I think it's the

2674
01:57:40,670 --> 01:57:46,480
way to do it but I wanted to respond

2675
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:51,170
specifically to the systems question

2676
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:53,150
the IETF does do systems architecture we

2677
01:57:51,170 --> 01:57:55,640
have routers on the internet they're

2678
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:58,190
stupid and we have we thought they were

2679
01:57:55,640 --> 01:57:59,900
and we have endpoints and that's a

2680
01:57:58,190 --> 01:58:01,699
systems things and the internet doesn't

2681
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:03,469
operate without the fact that there are

2682
01:58:01,699 --> 01:58:05,599
routers on the that move layer three

2683
01:58:03,469 --> 01:58:07,600
packets around and the problem we have

2684
01:58:05,600 --> 01:58:10,210
in all of the onboarding system

2685
01:58:07,600 --> 01:58:13,880
proposals and the pushback we get as

2686
01:58:10,210 --> 01:58:14,600
Eric just alluded to how do i onboard

2687
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:17,090
what

2688
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:19,880
on board two we have not described a

2689
01:58:17,090 --> 01:58:22,940
system architect that says that a

2690
01:58:19,880 --> 01:58:24,590
network owner including a homeowner will

2691
01:58:22,940 --> 01:58:26,450
have a thing that you ought that on

2692
01:58:24,590 --> 01:58:29,900
boards devices that's a system level

2693
01:58:26,450 --> 01:58:31,849
decision that and we're getting pushback

2694
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:34,070
on that even in the enterprise space

2695
01:58:31,850 --> 01:58:37,070
Elliott it's hard to convince them that

2696
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:39,500
they need to have a registrar or an AAA

2697
01:58:37,070 --> 01:58:41,150
server or whatever it's like how can I

2698
01:58:39,500 --> 01:58:42,350
get around without that please redesign

2699
01:58:41,150 --> 01:58:45,559
your protocol so you don't need one of

2700
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:47,840
those right and so we need to have us

2701
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:50,390
and other groups are looking to us to

2702
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:52,790
describe an architecture for how that

2703
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:56,720
works that's a system level description

2704
01:58:52,790 --> 01:58:59,030
and once we say that there will be a few

2705
01:58:56,720 --> 01:59:00,740
where you join things together we can

2706
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:02,630
argue both the engineering question of

2707
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:04,760
whether it's radius or diameter or our

2708
01:59:02,630 --> 01:59:07,100
brewski or this or that or maybe it's

2709
01:59:04,760 --> 01:59:10,280
all of the above right getting the

2710
01:59:07,100 --> 01:59:10,970
system to to host that installed is the

2711
01:59:10,280 --> 01:59:12,500
hard part

2712
01:59:10,970 --> 01:59:14,650
teaching it to prote learning new

2713
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:17,600
protocols is probably relatively easy

2714
01:59:14,650 --> 01:59:19,099
that I'm just gonna comment on one thing

2715
01:59:17,600 --> 01:59:24,320
that's that somewhat pedestrian I

2716
01:59:19,100 --> 01:59:26,480
suppose in response to Eric and Mohit as

2717
01:59:24,320 --> 01:59:28,040
part of this Michael which is anytime

2718
01:59:26,480 --> 01:59:30,589
you want to form a new working group

2719
01:59:28,040 --> 01:59:32,060
thank you any forum there should be a

2720
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:33,500
couple of drafts flow you know at least

2721
01:59:32,060 --> 01:59:35,300
one draft floating around probably a

2722
01:59:33,500 --> 01:59:36,980
couple of drafts floating around and so

2723
01:59:35,300 --> 01:59:39,590
what just to give you an idea one of the

2724
01:59:36,980 --> 01:59:42,049
actions we took out of the all the the

2725
01:59:39,590 --> 01:59:45,620
meetings that we had this week so we do

2726
01:59:42,050 --> 01:59:47,570
need an architecture draft for for how

2727
01:59:45,620 --> 01:59:50,300
these things can fit together well he

2728
01:59:47,570 --> 01:59:53,750
that doesn't mean that that is the only

2729
01:59:50,300 --> 01:59:56,270
way things can fit together but that it

2730
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:56,990
is at least one way that makes that that

2731
01:59:56,270 --> 02:00:03,050
is sane

2732
01:59:56,990 --> 02:00:07,550
so with that okay through comments the

2733
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:13,730
one on the say architecture idea and the

2734
02:00:07,550 --> 02:00:16,040
other one on the t2 t RG so I think

2735
02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:20,360
there is a say interesting balance

2736
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:23,210
between having in a systems view and say

2737
02:00:20,360 --> 02:00:24,769
doing all the say architectures with

2738
02:00:23,210 --> 02:00:26,060
vacation or a stem that's watch

2739
02:00:24,770 --> 02:00:28,250
activities that you mentioned in the

2740
02:00:26,060 --> 02:00:29,990
beginning so although

2741
02:00:28,250 --> 02:00:31,820
components that you mentioned I mean

2742
02:00:29,990 --> 02:00:34,130
these are not really compliment Henry a

2743
02:00:31,820 --> 02:00:36,860
complementary components this is a bag

2744
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:38,510
of things that you know you could pick

2745
02:00:36,860 --> 02:00:42,889
one of the other and combine them in in

2746
02:00:38,510 --> 02:00:44,960
different ways and so as I may be

2747
02:00:42,890 --> 02:00:47,600
example if I'm and like I'm say

2748
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:49,910
different technology field I mean there

2749
02:00:47,600 --> 02:00:52,490
is there is certainly there's there are

2750
02:00:49,910 --> 02:00:55,540
things going on outside the my ATF as

2751
02:00:52,490 --> 02:00:59,360
you mentioned and so what other said

2752
02:00:55,540 --> 02:01:02,090
groups do quite often is that they built

2753
02:00:59,360 --> 02:01:04,250
something like reference implementation

2754
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:06,410
reference architectures quite often in

2755
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:09,830
what used to be called forums or these

2756
02:01:06,410 --> 02:01:12,200
times open-source projects so that I

2757
02:01:09,830 --> 02:01:14,269
mean of course they are quite many

2758
02:01:12,200 --> 02:01:18,500
already but that could be another idea

2759
02:01:14,270 --> 02:01:20,030
so I'm not convinced that the IETF

2760
02:01:18,500 --> 02:01:22,490
should really survey all those things

2761
02:01:20,030 --> 02:01:24,590
and try to put em up as proposed

2762
02:01:22,490 --> 02:01:30,500
architectures I think the idea would be

2763
02:01:24,590 --> 02:01:33,740
really good in well enabling say group

2764
02:01:30,500 --> 02:01:37,010
of companies or institutions to work on

2765
02:01:33,740 --> 02:01:39,530
really specific things and they don't

2766
02:01:37,010 --> 02:01:40,640
even have to fit together as well

2767
02:01:39,530 --> 02:01:43,070
everything will be doing the idea of has

2768
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:47,420
to fit together into into one system so

2769
02:01:43,070 --> 02:01:52,250
that's I think not really necessary the

2770
02:01:47,420 --> 02:01:55,010
other thing is I think youth energy so

2771
02:01:52,250 --> 02:01:58,970
there seems to be some utility and so

2772
02:01:55,010 --> 02:02:01,340
this you know a little updating what's

2773
02:01:58,970 --> 02:02:03,530
going on in in the different groups on

2774
02:02:01,340 --> 02:02:05,120
the other hand I mean this is the IRT F

2775
02:02:03,530 --> 02:02:07,309
we shouldn't forget that I mean is also

2776
02:02:05,120 --> 02:02:11,960
place for for research so I'm not sure

2777
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:13,880
it's a good idea to so develop this

2778
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:19,100
group further to a coordination or

2779
02:02:13,880 --> 02:02:21,350
serving activity Mohit we are already

2780
02:02:19,100 --> 02:02:23,660
over time so I won't make any long

2781
02:02:21,350 --> 02:02:25,880
comments I was reading through my notes

2782
02:02:23,660 --> 02:02:27,559
and I got distracted because Jaime sent

2783
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:31,040
me a telegram I agree with you on the

2784
02:02:27,560 --> 02:02:33,080
lack of participation 100% I think one

2785
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,700
final comment we have bigger problems to

2786
02:02:33,080 --> 02:02:36,590
solve before we go around making

2787
02:02:34,700 --> 02:02:38,019
onboarding working group can somebody

2788
02:02:36,590 --> 02:02:41,360
tell me the difference between

2789
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:41,750
onboarding or brueski cause a Brutes

2790
02:02:41,360 --> 02:02:43,880
who

2791
02:02:41,750 --> 02:02:46,310
trapping remote key infrastructure or

2792
02:02:43,880 --> 02:02:48,290
you mentioned EPP which is device

2793
02:02:46,310 --> 02:02:49,550
provisioning protocol so what's the

2794
02:02:48,290 --> 02:02:51,700
difference between provisioning

2795
02:02:49,550 --> 02:02:54,260
onboarding bootstrapping configuration

2796
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:56,510
initialization I think once we have that

2797
02:02:54,260 --> 02:03:01,520
sorted out maybe we can actually move on

2798
02:02:56,510 --> 02:03:04,280
to onboarding okay I think you just

2799
02:03:01,520 --> 02:03:09,320
subscribe for things which are roughly

2800
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:11,030
speaking the synonymous and that we've

2801
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:14,570
had that discussion though we haven't

2802
02:03:11,030 --> 02:03:17,210
documented it so I don't think it's

2803
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:19,280
bigger I just think we we know we have a

2804
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:20,690
particular problem in network level

2805
02:03:19,280 --> 02:03:22,160
onboarding which is that we have

2806
02:03:20,690 --> 02:03:24,730
fragmentation which is leading to

2807
02:03:22,160 --> 02:03:27,260
confusion the market which is leading to

2808
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:30,349
slow roll deployments or no deployments

2809
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:32,030
at all and so that's something that we

2810
02:03:30,350 --> 02:03:35,060
have a real problem that that's the big

2811
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:36,290
for me at least that's the high order

2812
02:03:35,060 --> 02:03:39,410
bit which is that we're slowing

2813
02:03:36,290 --> 02:03:41,960
ourselves down and that systems level of

2814
02:03:39,410 --> 02:03:43,970
you might actually help that this having

2815
02:03:41,960 --> 02:03:45,920
been said I want to thank people for

2816
02:03:43,970 --> 02:03:49,100
their time Ignace I think you've heard

2817
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:51,440
the feedback here I think it's probably

2818
02:03:49,100 --> 02:03:52,940
worthwhile to talk about where we want

2819
02:03:51,440 --> 02:03:57,500
to talk about this next and what what

2820
02:03:52,940 --> 02:03:58,759
our next steps are so one thing it has

2821
02:03:57,500 --> 02:04:02,990
worked on us one thing that I will

2822
02:03:58,760 --> 02:04:04,790
notice is I i RTF group meeting here so

2823
02:04:02,990 --> 02:04:08,510
I think I'm here on on the rights of a

2824
02:04:04,790 --> 02:04:10,640
tourist but what I hear from the

2825
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:14,150
feedback on those two topics IOT

2826
02:04:10,640 --> 02:04:18,470
embodying working group I think it's

2827
02:04:14,150 --> 02:04:20,629
much more clear that clear of what to do

2828
02:04:18,470 --> 02:04:24,680
next with that now the IOT systems think

2829
02:04:20,630 --> 02:04:27,950
it's it's much higher of the contention

2830
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:31,850
and and not that obvious at least for me

2831
02:04:27,950 --> 02:04:35,960
at this point in time the comment about

2832
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:37,580
the documents and explaining the mapping

2833
02:04:35,960 --> 02:04:40,640
between those and basically how those

2834
02:04:37,580 --> 02:04:42,320
different things are the this different

2835
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:44,090
names for the same thing and how I think

2836
02:04:42,320 --> 02:04:46,429
that's a valid one and maybe the

2837
02:04:44,090 --> 02:04:50,180
proponents could try to address that

2838
02:04:46,430 --> 02:04:53,510
basically trying to describe their view

2839
02:04:50,180 --> 02:04:54,559
of how these things differ work together

2840
02:04:53,510 --> 02:04:57,709
and

2841
02:04:54,559 --> 02:04:59,599
what is the relevance between them okay

2842
02:04:57,709 --> 02:05:01,369
thank you guys unfortunately running

2843
02:04:59,599 --> 02:05:03,469
horribly over time so we have to cut it

2844
02:05:01,369 --> 02:05:05,719
this time but let's let's continue the

2845
02:05:03,469 --> 02:05:08,209
discussion here on the remaining days

2846
02:05:05,719 --> 02:05:09,379
and on the list and on I think clear

2847
02:05:08,209 --> 02:05:11,659
there's something interesting things to

2848
02:05:09,379 --> 02:05:13,999
be done we're very happy to host art of

2849
02:05:11,659 --> 02:05:16,398
these discussions in the RG one quick

2850
02:05:13,999 --> 02:05:18,438
comment on that we usually tend to have

2851
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:20,569
a lot of time on the agenda until like

2852
02:05:18,439 --> 02:05:23,089
week before the meeting so if you are a

2853
02:05:20,569 --> 02:05:24,469
bit ahead send us a request that okay

2854
02:05:23,089 --> 02:05:26,929
here set of topics we'd like to discuss

2855
02:05:24,469 --> 02:05:28,550
user we're able to accommodate that both

2856
02:05:26,929 --> 02:05:31,099
goes for the Friday meetings and also

2857
02:05:28,550 --> 02:05:32,539
for the summer in meetings so but then

2858
02:05:31,099 --> 02:05:34,129
of course if you want to go standards

2859
02:05:32,539 --> 02:05:37,639
documents etc then it's gonna need to be

2860
02:05:34,129 --> 02:05:38,869
a different kind of group but but with

2861
02:05:37,639 --> 02:05:40,789
that thank you everyone for joining

2862

2864
02:05:43,129 --> 02:05:47,119
our future face-to-face meetings and if

2865
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:49,010
