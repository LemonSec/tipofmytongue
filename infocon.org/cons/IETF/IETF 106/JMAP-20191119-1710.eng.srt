1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,139
in dings Phil all right all right we've

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:10,760
got stragglers coming in at the last

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:13,949
second

4
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:21,750
welcome welcome to the gem up working

5
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:24,990
session last one of the day Tuesday last

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,869
session for Gemma this yeah well yeah a

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,909
decade certainly not the last one ever

8
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:33,240
but you seem to keep keep accumulating

9
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:34,829
new workers we go along I'm sure you are

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,730
all well aware of the note well by now

11
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:40,440
but if not searched a chef not well and

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,620
you will find it very very easily and

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,790
you can read it at your leisure

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:48,900
this is the agenda that we have so far

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,519
one thing that's not mentioned on here's

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,260
WebSocket we'll just very briefly touch

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,040
from that as well is there anything else

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:02,339
that anyone wants to add or any changes

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:12,719
to make this list no excellent let's go

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:15,090
straight into calendars yeah just

21
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:18,210
quickly to say give us status update on

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,380
WebSockets sure I'll get that out of the

23
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:23,100
way

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,719
so I'm the document Shepherd for

25
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:31,609
WebSocket I had one set of last call

26
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:35,999
comments that can just submitted a

27
00:01:31,609 --> 00:01:41,869
revision to cover those I think on

28
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:45,749
Monday after the internet craft freeze

29
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:51,869
thawed and so I just need to go through

30
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:54,030
that and revise my my Shepherd comments

31
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,399
get those submitted and we'll be

32
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,600
submitting it to iesg hopefully within

33
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,600
just a couple of days

34
00:02:10,818 --> 00:02:19,219
who shot us yeah I don't know if no

35
00:02:15,139 --> 00:02:33,650
science more they believe bit

36
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:36,290
off-centered so since montreal has been

37
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:38,209
quite a big update to this spec that

38
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:40,730
really fleshed it out it was kind of

39
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:43,900
just the rough outlines on the zero zero

40
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:46,760
version zero one is fairly complete

41
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,409
missing a boatload of examples which I

42
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,769
think definitely gonna be needed because

43
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:56,090
it's very hard to describe really what

44
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:57,769
I'm describing everything in prose but I

45
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,299
think it's much easier to understand if

46
00:02:57,769 --> 00:03:00,500
you see examples and then you look at

47
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,699
the pros rather than just trying to read

48
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,840
codes but it's always the case but I

49
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:05,780
think particularly calendars because

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,919
turns out a lot of intertwining stuff so

51
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,510
I will add a lot of examples there

52
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:09,949
document there are at the moment and I'm

53
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:12,379
sure that will help to understand it but

54
00:03:09,949 --> 00:03:16,090
the actual content I think is mainly

55
00:03:12,379 --> 00:03:20,388
there we had a look at it at the interim

56
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:22,989
calyx meeting with Cal Connect in

57
00:03:20,389 --> 00:03:27,650
Philadelphia about a month ago as well I

58
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:29,120
think a big what we really need next is

59
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,280
to get some implementation experience

60
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,609
just it's always going to find edge

61
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,009
cases and things so we hope to at least

62
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:38,709
get some implementation experience first

63
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,759
of all over the next three to six months

64
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:42,579
anyone else wants to do that as well I

65
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:45,828
would love to hear it there are a few

66
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:48,049
open issues though or interesting edge

67
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:50,569
cases I thought we talked about today if

68
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:54,519
you can get onto the next slide just

69
00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,518
before that I thought I'd give a brief

70
00:03:54,639 --> 00:04:01,430
brief description of the data model and

71
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,349
the slight changes from last time

72
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:05,389
anymore the really good memory we'll

73
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:07,039
have seen a slide similar to this at the

74
00:04:05,389 --> 00:04:11,019
last ITF but there are some more things

75
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:13,129
in it now in particular notification

76
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:15,590
things so there's this calendar share

77
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:17,259
notification object based type and the

78
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:20,090
calendar event notification data type

79
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:21,260
essentially a calendar event

80
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,539
notification dose time to start with

81
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,510
that is just a log of every change

82
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:26,729
that's happened

83
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,950
events in this account so when you add

84
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:35,640
something update something or destroy

85
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:37,110
something and then you expose a subset

86
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,490
of that basically you expose everything

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,400
where the change was not made by the

88
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,650
user that is viewing the account so this

89
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,120
is because calendars systems involve a

90
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,370
lot of people editing the same stuff you

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,950
get invitations coming in so on Cal deaf

92
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,020
has a concept of an inbox which covers

93
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,789
one small part of this which is when you

94
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,280
receive invitations and updates fire I

95
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:58,980
tip this is kind of just extending that

96
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,690
concept to any time someone else makes

97
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:02,100
change to your calendar so you have a

98
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,510
hope in hell of knowing what's changed

99
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,250
because this we see is a big problem

100
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,599
so yeah essentially that's kind of a log

101
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,070
and if you store it in the account

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,090
doesn't matter how many people this is

103
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,380
shared with you and you have to store

104
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:16,349
one copy but all we just have to know

105
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:18,240
who has seen which notation dismissed it

106
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:21,000
so that's much easier to keep track of

107
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
which is why they're co-located with the

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,160
data rather than with the user who the

109
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,809
notification is for necessarily calendar

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,820
share notification on the other hand is

111
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:32,190
when a calendar is shared but with a

112
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,710
different principle that's stored with

113
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:38,670
the principle data principle is a user

114
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:42,239
or a room or any kind of resource that

115
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:45,480
schedulable in your calendar that needs

116
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,920
to be up there because the you may have

117
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,570
been removed from Ana calendar so you

118
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,530
can't store it in that account because

119
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:52,230
you no longer have access to that

120
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,450
account so again this is log of when

121
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:56,010
you're added or removed from a calendar

122
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:57,690
your permissions change to a calendar

123
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,490
basically so again you can be notified

124
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,530
and choose whether you actually want to

125
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,120
kind of accept the invitation to view

126
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:07,559
this calendar that Bob shared with you

127
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:11,540
or ignore it or whatever that's kind of

128
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:13,500
the the general data model which is

129
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:16,470
basically in line with what Cal adapt

130
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,660
does but enhanced in terms of getting

131
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,790
exposed more information in the sharing

132
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,050
world to make it possible to create a

133
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:28,310
better experience there any particular

134
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:28,310
questions or comments on that

135
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:40,340
so I move on to that next yeah so

136
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:41,930
there's a few things see if people have

137
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,159
seen the spec there's a lot of

138
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:45,740
permissions involving calendaring

139
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,240
there's the calendar object has gained a

140
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,600
lot of different permission options that

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,580
you can assign to people more than

142
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,080
mailbox and I do think we need them all

143
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,320
I'm just wondering whether need to add

144
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,700
one more which is whether can you share

145
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,099
a calendar with someone where they have

146
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,110
write access but they don't have

147
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,480
permission to add new invitees to events

148
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,240
at the moment I'm just tying those

149
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,500
together but I think some systems might

150
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,300
make that separate I think a common

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,640
where the calendar has separate that

152
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,540
they will know whether you can add

153
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:20,570
participants to an event so I have write

154
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:26,150
access to it but I can't add invite new

155
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:28,040
people to ok so probably rather not add

156
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:31,000
yet another Akal as I said there's a lot

157
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:36,490
of them already but I took any one

158
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,070
things we need need that next thing is

159
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,020
when a calendar is shared with someone

160
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:44,380
they need the ability to change the name

161
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,099
to make it more understandable to them

162
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,420
otherwise you might have a load of

163
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,680
calendars or called work because

164
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,970
everyone shares their work calendar with

165
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,850
you but you want to be named work to

166
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,560
Barry's work or to Lexi's work and

167
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,850
that's just your view of that calendars

168
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,700
renamed you don't want it renamed

169
00:07:55,850 --> 00:08:01,010
everywhere else so there's no two

170
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,800
options here one is that you make the

171
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:05,780
name property writable for these

172
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,940
Sherri's but once they've written it is

173
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:09,979
their local copy and they don't have

174
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,660
acts and that doesn't affect their else

175
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:13,490
which is fine but also they don't see

176
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,830
the original then or we could have a

177
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,270
separate property that they can write so

178
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:19,969
they still have access to the original

179
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,680
name does that make sense so that you

180
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,180
could you have you have two properties

181
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,470
on the object one which is the immutable

182
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,480
original name which only the owner can

183
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,730
change and one which is their local name

184
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,140
so I don't know if anyone has experience

185
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,700
with systems lights before with is it

186
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:36,439
better to have that explicitly a

187
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:38,539
separate property or as just you can

188
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,770
update the call property but then you

189
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,728
overwrite whatever was there before and

190
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,728
you don't really have access to that

191
00:08:52,430 --> 00:09:01,739
it's very I I have experience with that

192
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:04,109
sort of thing in other contexts where I

193
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,949
think it matters more yeah I can't

194
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:10,139
imagine why it makes a difference here I

195
00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:13,229
guess the thing is you change the name

196
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:14,879
of it then they and then you no longer

197
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,740
have access to the old name in the data

198
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,269
model anymore right and then someone

199
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,250
says hey there's this talent and you're

200
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:21,959
trying to find it and the you I can't

201
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:25,649
expose the old name I don't know is that

202
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:31,018
yeah and I suppose if you call the

203
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:35,610
calendar by some funny name that someone

204
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:38,250
else will refer to then maybe but I mean

205
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:41,430
99% of the usage of this is going to be

206
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:43,500
you share your calendar with me and I

207
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:47,910
guess you say you call it work and I

208
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:49,139
call it Neal's work mmm you know don't

209
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,689
we care what the original name I don't

210
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:53,970
care what his original name and I will

211
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:56,219
never care what the original which is

212
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,889
not the case with some other things in

213
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:01,050
other contexts but for here well so we

214
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:02,610
could the current speck just has it

215
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,079
doesn't have a separate property just

216
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,309
yet does override it and you never happy

217
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:06,689
personal name after that we could we

218
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:08,730
could leave that I just yeah was

219
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,540
wondering whether this is the kind of

220
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:11,670
thing I can imagine someone's had

221
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,469
experience with and either is fine or

222
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,969
they've got some other way oh this is it

223
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,129
gotcha because you need the original

224
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:19,949
name at this point because the the other

225
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:22,230
gotchas in contexts where the object can

226
00:10:19,949 --> 00:10:25,019
be updated by the owner or somebody else

227
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,490
and that would overwrite your changes

228
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,990
you'd have to change it again it

229
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,430
explicitly says in the spec yes that

230
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:30,509
does not change the Cherry's once

231
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:33,660
they've changed it is theirs and

232
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:34,829
lavishing so that doesn't bother me with

233
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,540
that but that's the sort of thing that

234
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,750
happens for instance in calendar

235
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,569
invitations and stuff like that yeah you

236
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,920
definitely don't want to happen I agree

237
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:45,479
so even weaker argument for the same

238
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,680
thing with color I think again once

239
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,389
you've set your color who cares what the

240
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:52,250
original close that's definitely not

241
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:52,250
important sep 10

242
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,640
just under demanding things like ITF

243
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,070
calendar you show that with me it's

244
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:02,020
still gonna be called that you know our

245
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:04,990
family work family holiday calendar

246
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,390
we'll keep that name I mean yeah well

247
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:11,530
sure but the the issue here is that if

248
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:14,380
it's IETF calendar and you share with me

249
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,780
and I decided to call it something else

250
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:19,270
why would I ever need to go and know

251
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:25,089
that you called it IETF calendar that's

252
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:27,520
the question okay question from Rob

253
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:29,260
Norris who's yes not even on the

254
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,790
official things but anyway and if you

255
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,620
delete your custom name does it revert

256
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:34,780
to the original there's no need to

257
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,850
delete a name you can update property

258
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,860
because they started it can't delete it

259
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,690
so now you you don't get the original

260
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,960
back if you don't have a separate

261
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:47,920
property in common hon Jabbar from ken

262
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:49,600
Murchison says I agree with Barry fine

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,510
okay I will know how to separate

264
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,860
property if you want to expose the

265
00:11:55,510 --> 00:12:02,680
original name as opposed to local man

266
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:05,589
yeah okay sounds my mind a bit of bike

267
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,209
sharing I guess there's a Sherri's

268
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:09,910
access property on a calendar which is

269
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,860
does this acting team mode where

270
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,990
everybody is acting as themselves and a

271
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,650
shared cameras so Barry adds an event

272
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,440
Barry's

273
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,329
you know Barry the organizer Alexi then

274
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,820
the Lacey's organizer who are you acting

275
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,370
as whoever owns that calendar like

276
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:28,300
Barry's acting as a Lexy secretary and

277
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:31,240
is that the at the moment I'm giving the

278
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,469
that there's a property that says who

279
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,290
you acting out on the calendar which is

280
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:37,270
either owner or self as in the owner of

281
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,849
the calendar but the word owner is used

282
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,720
in a variety of contexts in calendaring

283
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,370
and I'm wondering whether it's better

284
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,010
just to rename that even though it's in

285
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:49,390
a different place here just to avoid

286
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,950
confusion but so it's just it's the

287
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:55,240
question here is just what we call it

288
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:57,370
yeah basically which I think probably

289
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,270
I'll rename it to avoid confusion anyway

290
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:03,820
okay so tell events there's a couple of

291
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:05,470
extra properties I'm whether we add

292
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,670
which not in CalDAV or that kind of

293
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:10,220
thing but do seem to be quite common I

294
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:12,410
both exchange and Google Calendar have

295
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,490
very similar stuff which you can

296
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:18,199
probably guess from the names what they

297
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:20,540
do one where when you send out I tip

298
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:24,760
messages you don't send out all the

299
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,760
participants with them just yourself

300
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:29,240
should we actually try to standardize

301
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,810
this thing given that I said seems to be

302
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,880
common various proprietary systems and

303
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,670
in some way similar one is some

304
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,590
indication of whether the organizer is

305
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,540
prepared for other people to turn up

306
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,110
it's you can't stop people actually

307
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:46,640
forwarding obviously information but you

308
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,110
can give an indication of whether that's

309
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,699
likely to be approved or not and then

310
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:50,450
clients might actually do something do I

311
00:13:49,700 --> 00:14:01,280
at least err

312
00:13:50,450 --> 00:14:03,230
sure well yeah so this is a curious

313
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,850
thing like these would be extra

314
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:06,170
properties that we'd register against

315
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,370
J's calendar but that's fine there's a

316
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,530
whole registry with that they don't need

317
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:11,120
to be in the initial spec and the point

318
00:14:09,530 --> 00:14:14,089
of them is they they only really affect

319
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,770
stuff when you're using it viral

320
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,790
protocol when you're using it then fact

321
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,829
the only really effective we didn't miss

322
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,079
chairman calendars because it's about

323
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:24,250
when you I send out invitations should I

324
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,600
include this information or not it's not

325
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:29,630
it's not in heaven property or

326
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,250
necessarily of the event so I don't know

327
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,100
you could argue either way but I I

328
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:37,190
thought it was didn't need be in the

329
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:39,770
James Callender original sting given how

330
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:41,380
easy is a register new properties and it

331
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:43,430
makes more sense to register it with the

332
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:54,220
definition of how it's going to be used

333
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:54,219
in German calendars ossified yes yes

334
00:14:54,370 --> 00:15:04,430
okay so I will look at adding those okay

335
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:07,730
so this is so one of the capabilities is

336
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:09,620
how big an event object is the server

337
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:10,970
willing to store which sounds sensible

338
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:12,740
as probably something we want and

339
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:15,260
there's a very similar capability in

340
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,120
CalDAV the trouble is it's a bit harder

341
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,280
and gerrant to say what actually is the

342
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,650
size and you know how we made it useful

343
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,050
to the client because you've got this

344
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:27,439
kind of JSON object is it like the

345
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:29,630
stringify JSON encoding in bytes or the

346
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,930
then depends how the Jason's formatted

347
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:34,550
maybe slightly or what I yeah exactly

348
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:36,109
and it might depend on if the server

349
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,699
adds in extra properties or something

350
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,290
when it saves it which you don't have in

351
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:41,410
the client because there are a few cases

352
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:43,610
where the server like the server might

353
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:45,620
in the really extreme case the server

354
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:47,120
might bunt the sequence number from 999

355
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,570
to 1000 you've added an extra character

356
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:53,360
and something you've gone over there

357
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:55,220
over over the size limit I it seems like

358
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,900
a simple capability except I can't work

359
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,120
out how on earth to be exposed in a way

360
00:15:56,900 --> 00:16:00,260
to make it actually useful because

361
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,940
unless the client knows how to calculate

362
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:04,060
the size as the server's gonna see it

363
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,560
what's the point of telling it how big a

364
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,390
thing you can accept so I wondered if

365
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,489
anyone had ideas about that or do we

366
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:12,860
just get the capability almost chance

367
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:14,270
that no probably unless you're doing us

368
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,920
doing something stupid you're not gonna

369
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,800
have something too big and so you don't

370
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,449
really need the capability about it Alex

371
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,370
yeah I think you just made a good

372
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:28,160
argument for how unworkable this is so

373
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,540
maybe you did not drop it what was their

374
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,839
reason why it was there in the first

375
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:37,250
place the danger is if people start I

376
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,960
mean so calendar event it kind of can't

377
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,550
contain arbitrary key values and some of

378
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,470
those properties can be you know can be

379
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:44,689
as big as you like you can embed a data

380
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,190
URL in there with three Meg's of

381
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:47,300
attachment data now it's not the way you

382
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,580
meant to do it you meant to upload up

383
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,719
you should upload a blob like you

384
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,740
normally do enjoy math and reference

385
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,920
that but you could embed data URLs and

386
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,820
so you could have like an arbitrary big

387
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:00,439
object obviously at some point the

388
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,720
server's gonna say no this is this is

389
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:08,720
silly stop it is that more useful to

390
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,800
limit your old stays maybe I mean you

391
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,810
could still constructor with it because

392
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,760
they have a tree big object just without

393
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:14,800
that but it would be harder yeah you can

394
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,500
just have you know

395
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:20,180
property buying property but I mean you

396
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,230
could add a billion participants

397
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,459
although there's actually separate

398
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:25,060
capability on the maximum number of

399
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:27,080
participants you can have I think but

400
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,850
yeah so I don't know that they obviously

401
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:32,629
has to be some size limit in the server

402
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:34,340
it's just how if or even if it should be

403
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:35,430
exposed maybe we just don't need to is

404
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:38,399
its ex-con sanity

405
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,570
and if you hit it you'll get a error but

406
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,530
you should you don't need to know it

407
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,909
because you should never hit it if you

408
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:47,820
did not doing something silly I don't

409
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:52,800
maybe that's reasonable yeah I'm kind of

410
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:56,310
comparing in my head to the in extra hmm

411
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:57,990
where it says the the fact that you

412
00:17:56,310 --> 00:18:00,260
quote us says you've only got this many

413
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,250
bytes left isn't a reason to reject

414
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,680
uploading any particular message from

415
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,930
the client the client should not say you

416
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,240
kind of load Gordon I think it must not

417
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:11,640
stop uploading even though it can warn

418
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,440
because the server may store it and

419
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,720
compressed in such a way that it still

420
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:21,540
fits and likewise the server may reject

421
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,640
a message which is smaller than what the

422
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:25,080
quota quota said it would accept or what

423
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,300
max size it would settle it accepted

424
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:30,210
anymore so it's just an indication

425
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:32,310
clients can look at this and say your 10

426
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,260
Meg messages really not correct in this

427
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,870
unit says Maxima so that calendar event

428
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:38,280
is 50 kilobytes is it worth having at

429
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:40,229
all and yeah probably not

430
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,930
the server can always reject anyway as

431
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,280
long as there is a special error yes I

432
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:48,510
think then you can at least I'm yeah

433
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,200
sure it's a to large error or an

434
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:53,790
oversize yeah yeah yeah yep

435
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,020
which is separate over quota which is

436
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,700
nothing you know but they're both errors

437
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,780
it exists all right I think we just

438
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,430
ditch it in from the sound of it there's

439
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,710
no if it's not useful when I don't think

440
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:08,570
we can make it useful fine cool I want

441
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:11,400
to talk briefly about alert push which

442
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,870
so this is obviously calendar events can

443
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,020
have alerts or alarms whatever you want

444
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:20,520
to call them like 10 minutes before show

445
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:22,590
sure it'll alert what about in a way

446
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,560
that J map servers can push the clients

447
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:26,970
when the alerts triggered so that they

448
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,720
don't necessarily have to calculate all

449
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:32,160
about themselves what slightly weird is

450
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,290
the way you register for this is with a

451
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,780
pseudo type which is not entirely

452
00:19:34,290 --> 00:19:38,370
unprecedented you register so normally

453
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:39,629
you can register for types that you care

454
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:44,159
about when those types change you get

455
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:46,620
push the new state string we have some

456
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:50,160
pseudo a pseudo type thing in

457
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:53,100
male where you can register for a type

458
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,330
just to be pushed when changes to when

459
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,370
you must just arrive rather than any

460
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:59,129
change so this is kind of similar to

461
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:02,489
that except that the push type you get

462
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:04,080
back is not state change type is

463
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:06,750
completely different Bush type which has

464
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,399
information about the alert in I think

465
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,240
it's still okay but I don't people found

466
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,280
it particularly weird

467
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,310
I probably no one here has had a look

468
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:21,389
enough detail the event the push stuff

469
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:27,450
and jam up to really say but if you do

470
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:29,580
have any comments no okay yeah well I'll

471
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,870
leave it as it is if people play it

472
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,010
later in view we can look at options but

473
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:38,340
as I've mentioned it's a bit weird but

474
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,890
seem to be the right thing okay finally

475
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,800
then I just wanted to talk about the

476
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:48,330
other things I haven't put in yet but

477
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:53,490
some of them I will probably delegation

478
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:55,679
is in my calendar it's even it's also in

479
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,170
J's calendar it's not widely used but is

480
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,340
used in some places it's kind of a

481
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,380
formal method of saying I'm not coming

482
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,250
to this meeting but someone else is and

483
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,620
I've invited them it doesn't require

484
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,870
much on the on so for service port but

485
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,979
there's a little bit so I thought I'd

486
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:15,330
probably document that similarly

487
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,890
party-crashing it's just should the

488
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:19,710
server allow you to RSVP to an event

489
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:22,140
where you not been invited to and you

490
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:26,820
just add you as a participant again this

491
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:29,880
is kind of defined in the define deny

492
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,080
tip but whether the surface will accept

493
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,760
your RSP of courses you don't know

494
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,260
although with the new property of allows

495
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,750
forwarding that would actually tell you

496
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,080
because it's says do I allow other

497
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,150
people to come and also taking over an

498
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,629
event which is where the organizer needs

499
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,290
to change

500
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:50,760
normally this again is in I tab I tip it

501
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,780
says you can agree outer band that

502
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,610
someone else is organizing this event

503
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,680
now and then there you take over as the

504
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:57,959
organizer caroled I've never really

505
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,130
offered a way to do this but the stands

506
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,090
I'd be saying that yes you do need to do

507
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,400
from time to time so

508
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:04,309
I thought it'll be worth putting in just

509
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,690
how you should do this over the protocol

510
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:08,190
the last one I don't planter out because

511
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:13,250
as far as I can tell no one used it

512
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:15,299
anymore which is a countering via I tip

513
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:17,100
again this was never had it - Kaldur

514
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,379
that I don't think there's any clients

515
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,418
that offer way of doing it and it looks

516
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,159
like the once you're starting to

517
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:25,289
negotiate over what time the meeting

518
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,929
should be you want something much more

519
00:22:25,289 --> 00:22:30,179
like doodle which is coming with the

520
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:32,549
veep old stuff which is happening in

521
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:33,840
calyx at the moment and so I think

522
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:36,750
that's really much better solution to

523
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,459
this in the Stannis world so I unless

524
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:40,080
anyone really really wants it I wasn't

525
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,909
find edge

526
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,990
they can't proposal sport so that's just

527
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:48,480
a brief preview of I don't think any of

528
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:49,620
those are super important as I said I

529
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,190
think the big thing now is to implement

530
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,010
the core bits which all specified and

531
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,770
get some experience with that and then

532
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:00,029
we add some examples and I know things

533
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,090
in the details like that into the

534
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:04,860
document and hopefully yeah maybe middle

535
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:08,639
next year will be kind of finished

536
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:11,309
that's kind of a rough timeline there

537
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,929
are unfortunate so many calendaring

538
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:14,549
people in this group all the time but

539
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:18,809
yeah also looking at this with Cal

540
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:21,210
Connect and yes how they come to people

541
00:23:18,809 --> 00:23:25,408
Cal Connect is next meeting in April

542
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:28,980
20th to 24th in Nottingham in the UK so

543
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:32,669
we'll set up a intra meeting again for

544
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,740
the calyx group and potentially discuss

545
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,770
some of this there and while we discuss

546
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:39,659
this as well so they make sense yes

547
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:41,700
happy hopefully though yeah people from

548
00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:44,760
Google Calendar and Apple etc again we

549
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:46,169
can talk about that there okay I think

550
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,520
that's all I have fun calendaring if

551
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:50,720
anyone else wants tarts and questions

552
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:53,279
about it do so otherwise let's move on I

553
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:58,649
have a question but I'm too lazy to get

554
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:00,240
up so I - come here as a participant you

555
00:23:58,649 --> 00:24:02,879
mentioned at the very beginning you were

556
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,890
looking for implementations are you

557
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,700
looking for server implementations or

558
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:10,980
client implementations or both and in

559
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,190
either case are there what are the

560
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,320
things that that are available

561
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:18,820
to interoperate with so my my I was

562
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,830
thinking more so fermentation although

563
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:26,379
client implementation of C is useful too

564
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:28,750
and I think the the main thing is that

565
00:24:26,379 --> 00:24:30,279
this is somewhere where ideally anyone

566
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,049
that's implanting it would come to Cal

567
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,669
connect where where we do try to do

568
00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,908
interoperability testing as well as

569
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:39,850
discussion stuff but we can also arrange

570
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:42,100
other times to do interoperability

571
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:45,009
testing at ITF or whatever also

572
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,480
hackathon yeah or just feedback on

573
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:49,539
experience when implanting if there's

574
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,070
bits that are unclear convictions things

575
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:53,649
you can't implement for whatever reason

576
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,210
yeah it's calendaring stuff get

577
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:57,600
surprisingly complicated once you have

578
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,340
all the different things going on and so

579
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,139
yeah I think we need just a bit of

580
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:05,830
experience just to make sure that that

581
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:07,178
got the details right so said well we'll

582
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,470
be working on implementation hopefully

583
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,529
we can find some other people as well

584
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:12,850
and yeah next three months will can

585
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,500
experience for that just out of

586
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,969
curiosity other any implementations of

587
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,309
this stuff other than other than

588
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:20,080
involvement of the j-man calendars I

589
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:21,639
think not sure of the calendars yeah

590
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,860
there's a jarrett mail but not yeah I

591
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:25,600
did I'm not aware of j-mac calendar

592
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:30,158
implementations this is all much newer

593
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:32,649
and yeah we we will talk some people and

594
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,149
see if we can persuade them to be fair

595
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,799
far spells not employing most of the

596
00:25:34,149 --> 00:25:38,168
stuff yeah we haven't emotive this yet

597
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:39,789
yes zero zero implementations which is

598
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,799
exactly why I think we need some

599
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:45,299
implementation experience before we can

600
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:45,299
save sure yeah this is this is right

601
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:59,500
right next on our agenda was mdn

602
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:06,670
unfortunately Rafael has not joined us

603
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:10,000
this is what the last meeting said no I

604
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:11,290
don't have any slides from anyone I had

605
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,970
people who said they would attend the

606
00:26:11,290 --> 00:26:23,970
meeting but the only one who's here is

607
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:29,320
Ken so but I'm in London so we have zero

608
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:33,360
that section no wait we have various

609
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:35,379
Europeans and both in a lot of this but

610
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,790
will this will be a lot quicker meeting

611
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,840
than I expected if we don't have people

612
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:45,610
to talk about these ones

613
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:49,000
I think mdn is pretty much ready the

614
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:50,409
discussion last time was everyone was

615
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,660
happy with the changes were discussed

616
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:55,330
where the MDM was too short but everyone

617
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,000
knows what mdn means unluckily something

618
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:59,620
else will grab that name so we're happy

619
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,340
with that I think we're ready to go to

620
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:06,280
last call I will query that also as on

621
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,230
the mailing list and check but I think

622
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:13,750
everyone was happy with the the most

623
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:16,860
recent draft is version 2 now Neil do

624
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:21,429
you remember anything else on that

625
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:28,020
none it was this is published July 19th

626
00:27:21,429 --> 00:27:28,020
so co-located with the last IGF

627
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,250
yeah I'm the unset MDN paws

628
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:59,480
it all looks good all right I will I

629
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:01,220
will follow up and hopefully do a last

630
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:10,790
call on it in the next couple of weeks

631
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:14,840
so all right let's move on then next

632
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:21,260
thing is the quota draft there's been a

633
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:24,590
lot of discussion on us and not much

634
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:26,059
I think this dollar work to do there we

635
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:28,879
need to make sure the lines with the

636
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:32,149
imap quotas and discuss what should be

637
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,840
included in there so we need to restart

638
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,840
the discussion on that

639
00:28:54,070 --> 00:29:02,200
yeah I think this is new me as I'm

640
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:05,659
holding the less the question poses

641
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,850
separate you could specify the scope of

642
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,710
the usage separate to the scope of the

643
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,809
total which I didn't really understand

644
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:16,400
and I was hoping the authors could try

645
00:29:11,809 --> 00:29:18,710
and it did yes like I you know you have

646
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:21,110
a thousand gigabytes of quota and that

647
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:24,230
quota scopes to the server your usage is

648
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:27,740
10 gigabytes which is scoped to the user

649
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,059
well that's not very helpful because if

650
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:30,110
you're not in the same scope then he

651
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:32,480
doesn't tell you how close you are to a

652
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,070
limit or anything and I didn't quite

653
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,250
understand their explanation of why they

654
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,168
thought this was useful so they're not

655
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:41,660
here so I just don't have anyone else

656
00:29:39,169 --> 00:29:48,460
had any thoughts on why you might want

657
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:51,500
something like that it also only had

658
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:56,290
ability to get poor there's no quota

659
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,290
management so it was purely for display

660
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:08,399
oh I think people want to devote that of

661
00:30:04,419 --> 00:30:14,850
mind but I think just having one sadness

662
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:14,850
Kevin it's happening

663
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:46,850
cool and quite a slush changes yeah yeah

664
00:30:44,029 --> 00:30:56,919
okay so that's the next step will be to

665
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:59,389
keep discussing on the list yes without

666
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,859
the author's being available it's a

667
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:05,389
little tricky to follow up and check

668
00:31:02,859 --> 00:31:13,840
they did tell me they would be attending

669
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:18,320
remotely so you see what happened there

670
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,080
all right um and we'll try and get this

671
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,509
done early next year hopefully it

672
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,158
doesn't look like it's going to be

673
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:26,600
particularly difficult to get done but I

674
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:28,389
know this there's a few different people

675
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:30,549
interested in making sure that it covers

676
00:31:28,389 --> 00:31:33,289
everything they want to cover and

677
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:39,369
certainly having having the same types

678
00:31:33,289 --> 00:31:39,369
as the IMAP quota in terms of storage

679
00:31:52,720 --> 00:32:00,049
Nick next time I will make sure to check

680
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:01,789
in with people again rather than

681
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:03,908
trusting their I'll be here from a month

682
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:03,908
ago

683
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:17,239
cool s mine we have no work on electric

684
00:32:15,859 --> 00:32:19,489
did tell me in advance he wouldn't be

685
00:32:17,239 --> 00:32:22,220
able to work on it at the moment so the

686
00:32:19,489 --> 00:32:27,889
main question with s/mime is when do we

687
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:31,429
expect to get back to it now I should be

688
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:35,119
able to do something by Vancouver I

689
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:36,590
think there are also discussion last

690
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,668
time and I think there would be two

691
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:40,189
documents yeah

692
00:32:37,669 --> 00:32:43,849
one is extension of the current one

693
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:47,090
which is simpler I want to verify this

694
00:32:43,849 --> 00:32:49,970
as my signature of this message and they

695
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:56,119
are more complicated one if you want to

696
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:58,849
use service TNC to cut storage then you

697
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:07,509
can both do both signing and encryption

698
00:32:58,849 --> 00:33:10,549
and said we want to set a milestone for

699
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:12,789
just simple one so in and then set and

700
00:33:10,549 --> 00:33:14,779
is done for adopting a more complex one

701
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:17,419
like I like your thinking

702
00:33:14,779 --> 00:33:18,799
all right I will I'll put the master in

703
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:22,249
for the first one early next year and

704
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:23,658
for adopting the second one at the same

705
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:31,190
time and then we can work on the second

706
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:35,840
one afterwards yeah cool easy easy

707
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:37,940
next is jeaious contact unfortunately we

708
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:50,269
don't have robert or mario here so Neal

709
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:53,629
you're back up again okay so this has

710
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:58,669
been hunted into the game at working

711
00:33:53,629 --> 00:34:02,959
group which kind of makes sense the

712
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:06,460
concept is as jazz calendar is to

713
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:11,270
iCalendar j/s contact is to vCard it's

714
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:15,109
much easier to use more consistent JSON

715
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:20,389
based format for representing contacts

716
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:24,150
ie people and their locations

717
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:26,190
contacts in some ways are simple because

718
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,540
you don't have things like recurrences

719
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:31,110
and time zones all the stuff that make

720
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,330
calendars hard but they also involve

721
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:36,690
real people in the real world which

722
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:40,199
makes them hard in tech particularly

723
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:42,030
international internationalization we

724
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:45,000
talked a bit about this Cal connect a

725
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,730
few months ago as well so your big issue

726
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,690
is things like addresses and names which

727
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:53,370
can be complicated in ways I still can't

728
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:56,400
imagine fully even though I know about

729
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,750
some of the weird edge cases so that

730
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,600
makes them interesting if you want a

731
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:02,640
format that's suitable for worldwide use

732
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,330
I think we came up with quite a neat

733
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,580
solution for this though so the trouble

734
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:12,470
is you have this tension of not wanting

735
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:14,400
to make the kind of data format

736
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:15,990
ridiculously complicated when you want

737
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,030
to do just something simple that's

738
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:19,799
always been a key requirement at least

739
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:21,690
to me for the this format and for the

740
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,980
calendar one simple thing should be

741
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:26,310
simple but you also want to be able to

742
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:27,720
make the other things possible and you

743
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,680
just needs flexibility so I think what

744
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,250
we come with is kind of concept of

745
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:38,339
tagged words so if you had a name like

746
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:40,980
mr. Joe Bloggs rather than having

747
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:44,040
separate title field mr. first name

748
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:45,510
field Joe last name field blogs new

749
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,460
that's great for the Western world but

750
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:49,350
there's lots and lots of other ways you

751
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:50,400
could describe names and people have

752
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:54,000
alternate names and all sorts of things

753
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:57,360
so instead what I think we're heading

754
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,760
towards is a kind of a simple property

755
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,120
called name which would be an array of

756
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,470
objects and the object will be like the

757
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,870
first one would have a value of mr.

758
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:08,399
second one value named Joe last one

759
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:10,890
buddy blogs and then you can add other

760
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,840
attributes onto that object so you could

761
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:16,920
tag it as this is a first name this is a

762
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:18,330
title this is a prefix and we can make

763
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,240
that as rich as you'd like and you only

764
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:24,090
have to include the tax you want so that

765
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,470
both gives you the ability to describe

766
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,660
things pretty much in as much detail as

767
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:28,680
you need and also for simple clients you

768
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:30,149
don't have to understand any of those

769
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,379
tags you just join all the words

770
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:33,100
together and you have the name to

771
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,490
display to the user in

772
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:38,020
you know in a reasonable way this seemed

773
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,310
quite a neat solution to me we could do

774
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:41,650
something very similar the dresses which

775
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:47,500
suffer from exactly the same problem so

776
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:51,870
if people have any thoughts on that is

777
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:54,190
that I don't think it is I don't think

778
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:58,029
I'd have to receive the text and I'd

779
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,680
have to see some examples with different

780
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,900
kinds of names hmm

781
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:07,169
you know maybe Spanish names versus

782
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:09,700
Burmese names versus yeah I think we did

783
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:12,160
yeah like so such things with patronymic

784
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,509
since stuff like yeah but I I think the

785
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,910
nice thing is this can express all that

786
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:18,910
and it lets you ignore it when you don't

787
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:21,790
need it and still there when you do yeah

788
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:24,370
most much of the time you just want a

789
00:37:21,790 --> 00:37:26,350
string yes and so if you want to get

790
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,910
that it's just Matt don't value right

791
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,190
Jordan but then there's the thing of

792
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:32,200
what do you call the person and how do

793
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:34,450
you sort the person's name and all of

794
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,790
that which is very dependent on the name

795
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:40,870
format in the localization that you're

796
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:44,110
talking about yes so I'd have to see the

797
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:45,850
text and the examples yes we'll review

798
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:48,190
it when it's there I think we need a lot

799
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:52,089
more examples for sure how you represent

800
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:54,310
them but yeah Aleksey yeah my initial

801
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:56,230
reaction doesn't look too horrible I'm

802
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,529
just thinking what the hell Deb has I

803
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:03,370
think LDAP has first name last name and

804
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:05,800
the whole thing yeah well I know but

805
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:09,910
it's as an example of what's already

806
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:11,620
News News is has things like yes title

807
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,759
first name last name suffix and it's

808
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:20,020
like cool that goes everything you can

809
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:26,680
do in the world but again I think I

810
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:28,810
would like to see some exam to go seek

811
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:31,299
out people from different countries to

812
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:33,759
help you with the examples yes we don't

813
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:36,580
need that you know for instance those

814
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,860
Spanish names have various family names

815
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:40,960
in there and this side of the family and

816
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,580
that side of family and the name that

817
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,800
you

818
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:47,430
the surname for the person is somewhere

819
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:52,140
in the middle Aaron yes is represented

820
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:53,430
correctly as a challenge yes but I think

821
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:55,920
yeah that's not kind of nice thing about

822
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:57,600
that is you you could you just need to

823
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,280
get the tags right now you may I don't

824
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,370
know don't know yet what all those tags

825
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,840
should be but I think as a model concept

826
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,540
this seems the cleanest one that I've

827
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:09,000
seen that might work conceptually would

828
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:12,630
you have a registry of tags or just have

829
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,450
them be ad hoc well I need to be either

830
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:17,400
I think I think putting in need to be

831
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,839
registry you need an initial set of ones

832
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,690
you expect people to using this in

833
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,170
specification but maybe you could define

834
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:27,480
anything that you need a registry of

835
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:30,420
significant ones and then you can use

836
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,530
any others for whatever yes you could

837
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:33,530
certainly add ones that you just

838
00:39:36,410 --> 00:39:44,399
whatever you you probably wanna if I'm

839
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:48,240
sorting by last name as a concept this

840
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,640
is the names you use yes yes and for

841
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,979
others it may just be you know

842
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,509
patronymic might just be one that you

843
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,220
can use and you don't have to have it

844
00:39:54,510 --> 00:40:00,950
registered anywhere because it doesn't

845
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:03,899
have any meaning to automated process

846
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,149
well there would be nice if I don't knew

847
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,900
if any more everyone that was using that

848
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:11,370
use the same tag for it just helps so

849
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,490
having the registry probably doesn't

850
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:16,529
hurt I guess one one thing that I'm

851
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,270
seeing in this is potentially if you had

852
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:20,070
things that were just a sort key you

853
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:22,440
might not want them to also be part of

854
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:26,610
the dumb display so there might need to

855
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,260
be a silent or something yeah I mean the

856
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:30,270
other and the other one is is multiple

857
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,190
names of course like this is my name if

858
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:35,550
I'm in a Western world but this is my

859
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:37,620
name if I'm in China yes they probably

860
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:42,180
don't want to be in one long string

861
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:45,900
that's not how you yeah that's a harder

862
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,819
for mining actually like it's customary

863
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,550
to put the family name first

864
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,320
just like in China but that's okay

865
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,570
that's that's that's also part of your

866
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,420
name right right but

867
00:40:55,570 --> 00:41:00,160
I mean it may be just be one name

868
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:07,240
display name or something or I don't

869
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:09,910
know yeah display nanny aren't that

870
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:12,399
simple because the way you display a

871
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:14,770
name will depend on the social context

872
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,690
that you're playing it displaying it for

873
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,130
IETF will be different from displaying

874
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:20,830
it for the name of the White House

875
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:27,250
something like that even things like got

876
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:34,509
nickname and stage name and authors been

877
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:39,730
named so this P trecek in the Apple

878
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:42,100
address book they do running they have a

879
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:46,690
concept of nickname they have a concept

880
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:49,000
of phonetic name right so quite often

881
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:52,390
when I fill in these things I've got Han

882
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:56,110
characters in the actual name I've got

883
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:58,779
pinyin in the phonetic name and I've got

884
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:03,130
the English name that the person uses in

885
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:04,960
in the nick name now rarely do clients

886
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:07,630
that use that address book get it all

887
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,520
right most of them just display the real

888
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:12,850
name although they generally put the

889
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:20,770
order right that may do family name

890
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:23,920
first if it's a Han name but but well I

891
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:25,870
don't know if they do or not they apples

892
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,050
pretty cute about doing things in

893
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:32,400
interesting ways so I I don't think you

894
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:38,290
should get into the sub semantics of it

895
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:41,220
I think you should stay at name and you

896
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:44,770
know give phonetic name it possibly or

897
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:48,279
some other romanized name latinized name

898
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:51,160
whatever you want to call it try not to

899
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,660
get too deep into the weeds of what's

900
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,430
you know because there's too many

901
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:56,080
semantics to deal with yeah I don't want

902
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,089
to don't want to know with an array of

903
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:59,680
arrays like you've got an array of names

904
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:05,680
each of those is an array of parts like

905
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:06,990
that I think we get too far so and wait

906
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,850
until we have texting

907
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,399
examples to look at and we can review it

908
00:43:08,850 --> 00:43:14,069
yeah III think just some of them I mean

909
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,770
concept is good yes lean towards kind of

910
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,960
maybe as Pete said properties like name

911
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:22,290
phonetic name and nickname are probably

912
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,440
a couple most cases but at least for the

913
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,940
name one it's an array of tagged objects

914
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,710
whereas the other two may be just be

915
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,780
straightens phonetic name is just yeah

916
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:33,810
whatever a nickname is just a string I

917
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,790
think we'll enjoy nitpicking and finding

918
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,440
hole in it once you publish I am sure

919
00:43:35,790 --> 00:43:42,119
well I'm not even an author on this in

920
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:45,540
theory yes contacts are weird okay what

921
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,340
we do right yeah you know it should be

922
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,140
simple it's just like story about your

923
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:51,180
data there's no complex data model but

924
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:55,890
yeah the internationalisation stuff to

925
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:57,149
make it as Jim just pointed out pronouns

926
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:58,890
probably something well it's not even

927
00:43:57,150 --> 00:44:00,600
just is a binary is that it you know

928
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,700
you're trying to make something that

929
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:05,220
work for everyone when we only

930
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:09,089
experience very small subset of the

931
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:11,910
needs do you have a similar thing for

932
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:13,230
address yes absolutely I've been to

933
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:14,850
briefly I think exactly the same concept

934
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,470
bad addresses is the way to go for that

935
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:18,420
because again there's so many different

936
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:22,319
ways it's sort of the assumptions that

937
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:24,180
are wrong yes so yes and I said you want

938
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,460
at least four simple things I just want

939
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:28,618
the address to print great just map dot

940
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:31,170
value join they've told you how it

941
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:33,660
should be presented you get the value

942
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:37,740
and you write it down but if you do yeah

943
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:39,750
exactly so yeah that's the concept I

944
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,799
think this works at least better than

945
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,810
the other things we've seen so far

946
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,750
better than B card another garbage does

947
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:49,980
so it will have some kind of draft by

948
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:52,200
next time the good news is this is the

949
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,070
hard bit of j map contacts the data

950
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:58,080
format once once we have that defined i

951
00:44:56,070 --> 00:45:00,420
I think that's gonna be much easier spec

952
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:01,740
than my gem account so J map mail to put

953
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:04,890
together and then we have that the full

954
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:07,379
suite of contacts mail calendar which we

955
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,440
very nice over consistent protocol so

956
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:11,940
we'll see when this gets finished but

957
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,030
yeah maybe but in the next year if we're

958
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,030
lucky

959
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:26,500
read slide what's on the end that's what

960
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:27,730
was changed in the previous two I have

961
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,930
to have a look at the draft then maybe

962
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:29,830
localized string was what we're talking

963
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:34,290
about I haven't where that was before

964
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:34,290
after this discussion yeah

965
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:39,100
so this has been discussed in Cal

966
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:41,980
Connect as well for all the Cal Connect

967
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:44,500
is called Cal connect it does do contact

968
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:46,780
related stuff and particularly there's a

969
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,780
group who are involved in ISO as well

970
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:51,640
and I first doing a bunch of work in and

971
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,280
resting and naming at the moment and so

972
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,350
good is they are non Western young which

973
00:45:54,280 --> 00:46:08,980
means we have broader experiences names

974
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:10,630
and things like that so I guess this

975
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:12,190
needs to be officially adopted in the

976
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,020
Chairman I can move if we're doing Jesse

977
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:16,030
I tell you the point that it has not yet

978
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:18,310
been officially at hazard do we need to

979
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:39,220
change the charge again as well that is

980
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:42,160
on the way okay cool

981
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:47,970
I thought it's almost the next question

982
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:50,319
on our list is to at the Charter huh I

983
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:57,970
didn't I didn't stick on this slide but

984
00:46:50,320 --> 00:47:03,990
push apparently AJ who loves creating

985
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:03,990
work for this group in particular eight

986
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:13,810
we were talking about whether the

987
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:17,800
correct working group for a more general

988
00:47:13,810 --> 00:47:19,660
push for application protocols belongs

989
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:25,090
here or belongs somewhere else do you

990
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:28,960
have updated thinking on this Alexi well

991
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:34,780
looks better than extra show this work

992
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,400
but maybe do you know this was an hour

993
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:39,790
yeah and this is I think some dug

994
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:42,580
difficult people but the main thing I

995
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:44,110
think we can extract out kind of James

996
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:45,520
already following this kind of the best

997
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:48,840
practices for setting up your post

998
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,520
channel to ensure that you verify that

999
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:54,220
you're not spamming some random person

1000
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,440
and you know all the stuff that we're

1001
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:58,240
it's the security concerns etc all those

1002
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,290
and then if because what the actual day

1003
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:01,060
to you push is gonna be different

1004
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:02,470
depending on where it's I'm a poor day

1005
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:05,440
map or what you're doing and stuff so

1006
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:06,790
that but if we can kind of say this is

1007
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:08,800
how you set it up in a way that we

1008
00:48:06,790 --> 00:48:10,570
pretty much we use everywhere that will

1009
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,770
be easier for servant hunters and what

1010
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:14,020
keeps it easier for everyone I think

1011
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:16,090
that's the main goal as far as I well

1012
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:19,810
that person actually having maybe a one

1013
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,220
for y map that uses that so you maybe

1014
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,900
it's even just a best contractors

1015
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,129
document for the kind of abstract or

1016
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:28,420
this is how you set up a push channel

1017
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:31,330
thing I don't know there's not really

1018
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:34,690
our work but that's the way I look at it

1019
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:35,770
done till the Jama but let's let's have

1020
00:48:34,690 --> 00:48:38,410
a look at the draft

1021
00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:39,970
yeah there's two drafts that are both in

1022
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:42,759
a similar area which is why I thought

1023
00:48:39,970 --> 00:48:45,009
bring me the question of should all this

1024
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:47,500
happen in one place one of them came

1025
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:49,770
from Cal connect from Martin and that

1026
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,060
has already been published as an ITF

1027
00:48:49,770 --> 00:48:55,060
personal draft a couple of years ago and

1028
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:56,740
expired since he'd like to bring that

1029
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,560
back up again and the other ones quite

1030
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:01,509
recently from dovecot for IMAP as part

1031
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:05,799
of that she had over IMAP stuff they

1032
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:07,540
wanted to add push there yeah martin

1033
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,780
also has something on order discovery

1034
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:17,529
which is another great area which or

1035
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:19,360
discoveries if I don't the number of

1036
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:21,640
different order discovery mechanisms

1037
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:23,830
we've come up with over the years we

1038
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:27,310
haven't always all of them and almost

1039
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:29,200
nobody uses is so annoying I think we

1040
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:29,860
had what more than one buff on this

1041
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,689
mm-hm

1042
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:35,630
and there were like sort of people

1043
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:38,090
sympathetic at least at but just

1044
00:49:35,630 --> 00:49:45,430
I blame Cyrus double last time he just

1045
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:51,350
disappeared and nothing is done right

1046
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:53,120
okay all right well we do need a method

1047
00:49:51,350 --> 00:50:00,830
discovery protocol for discovery

1048
00:49:53,120 --> 00:50:03,170
protocols that's right I don't know why

1049
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:06,110
no one is listen because they're not

1050
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:08,210
perfect all right so next thing on the

1051
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:10,390
list is milestone review those are the

1052
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:13,130
three milestones that we currently have

1053
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,779
listed a submit document with guidance

1054
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,610
for implementation of time of servers

1055
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:19,490
and proxies which we promise that early

1056
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:22,580
on we have not done yes we did you

1057
00:50:19,490 --> 00:50:23,569
signed up from the initial charter we

1058
00:50:22,580 --> 00:50:25,660
said we're going to do it in the initial

1059
00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:35,240
charter we're going to make Rob Colorado

1060
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:37,220
yeah so I should get on that I'd like to

1061
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:46,430
kick that one another six months down

1062
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:50,750
the road leave it on things so I'll say

1063
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:53,330
July 2020 I once suggested to the core

1064
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:55,100
working group something that they did of

1065
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:59,000
changing a milestone to be something

1066
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:00,710
like 2099 just just to park it so

1067
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,960
because they they didn't want to get to

1068
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:07,630
it anytime soon and they didn't know

1069
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,630
when so if you have something like that

1070
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:23,690
well it's sort of like who might come

1071
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:26,960
back to it it's a question whether you

1072
00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:29,540
prefer having a milestone that is known

1073
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:31,910
to be totally unrealistic but near-term

1074
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:33,259
and you know that they're gonna keep

1075
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:35,480
changing it and changing it and changing

1076
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:37,340
it or whether you just want to admit

1077
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:38,930
that this is work you're gonna Park for

1078
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:39,620
a while but you will get back to it

1079
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:41,540
eventually

1080
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:43,520
and then you'll change the milestone is

1081
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:46,160
something reasonable my preference is

1082
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:49,450
the latter but you're the responsible ad

1083
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:51,350
for this so I said

1084
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:55,460
considering all the other work we've

1085
00:51:51,350 --> 00:51:57,700
done it's either build quickly or we

1086
00:51:55,460 --> 00:52:01,700
just say we're not going to do it I

1087
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:04,040
would like to keep on a writer I would

1088
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:08,359
slightly prefer to keep it on there

1089
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:11,150
rather a radar but I'm less unhappy

1090
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,640
about dropping it if it's what happens

1091
00:52:11,150 --> 00:52:16,070
I'll put it a nice December 2020 and

1092
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:20,200
review at the end of next year if we

1093
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:20,200
have not yet got there then it's it's I

1094
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:27,830
asked some of the people working for you

1095
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:32,960
to do it by von Corps but he keeps

1096
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:36,350
having other priorities all right

1097
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:39,110
no it's all right we will NEX next

1098
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,670
year's plan includes cleaning things up

1099
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:43,150
and this is part of that all right

1100
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:47,690
submit message disposition notification

1101
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:51,050
September 2019 that one I will bump to

1102
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:52,670
December because I think the only reason

1103
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:55,400
didn't get submitted was that I didn't

1104
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,570
follow up with the authors and say let's

1105
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,990
go

1106
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:08,510
Jemma hoho WebSockets likewise is going

1107
00:52:59,990 --> 00:53:12,620
November and I think we want a new one

1108
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:17,510
for quarter right yes so we have a few

1109
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:19,580
new ones to add I just looked at the

1110
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:22,330
quarter drafters routes and the small

1111
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:26,090
and I agree with Neil yep

1112
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:28,670
so it needs to be over made slightly

1113
00:53:26,090 --> 00:53:30,560
more generic and certain things are over

1114
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:33,440
complicated just three more it will be

1115
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:37,730
both slightly simpler it's slightly more

1116
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:41,780
complex at the same time but more

1117
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:48,200
general yes we should be able to get to

1118
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:49,060
that early next year it should be

1119
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:55,759
straightforward

1120
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:58,790
I'm gonna say 2020s mom I've already

1121
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:02,450
said I was gonna say Feb 20 24 the

1122
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,960
simple one and likewise for adopting an

1123
00:54:02,450 --> 00:54:05,140
addition

1124
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:06,410
document for the more complex s/mime

1125
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:10,670
fine

1126
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:13,940
cool ambience covers jamot calendars

1127
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:18,710
we've said we'll push that out to July

1128
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:21,470
next year and then decide what's do that

1129
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:23,839
and jeaious contact realistically well

1130
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:26,230
we'll go to adopt it first so we won't

1131
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:30,710
set a milestone for it at this meeting

1132
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:34,430
well well cuz we don't that charter

1133
00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:36,109
doesn't allow us to well conditioning on

1134
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:43,669
charter being approved I think you can

1135
00:54:36,109 --> 00:54:45,710
make it led December cheering I'll put a

1136
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:48,619
dot if again urine if you if you put the

1137
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,660
milestone in now then when the reach our

1138
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:55,369
Turing comes along the IAS G will see

1139
00:54:50,660 --> 00:55:01,720
the milestone for Jazz contact for

1140
00:54:55,369 --> 00:55:01,720
January next year and then have a

1141
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:07,970
testing by the end of the year probably

1142
00:55:04,970 --> 00:55:11,589
have a have something ready for ready

1143
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:14,589
for testing at least if not published

1144
00:55:11,589 --> 00:55:14,589
cool

1145
00:55:24,049 --> 00:55:29,269
all right what should we do about push

1146
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:37,410
because that will be a recharter if we

1147
00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:41,099
add it so do you say there is a document

1148
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:42,960
already there are two documents that are

1149
00:55:41,099 --> 00:55:45,900
both separate they're not that's not an

1150
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,670
overall document that describes the

1151
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:52,200
general problem space and and a

1152
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:53,430
consistent way to do us but that's what

1153
00:55:52,200 --> 00:56:00,118
I would like to see people moving

1154
00:55:53,430 --> 00:56:03,450
towards see if depending how general it

1155
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:07,609
is http-based working group might or

1156
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,609
might not want to have a look at it okay

1157
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:20,760
so it's it would be helpful to see the

1158
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:23,130
document before deciding there's also

1159
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:26,759
our CID 599 which I wasn't aware of

1160
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:29,039
until Monday so it describes some of

1161
00:56:26,759 --> 00:56:31,079
this stuff for sip and it may be lit

1162
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:35,640
between that and what's in J map we can

1163
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:38,700
create a more general document so can

1164
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:50,549
you send me a message with point a tad

1165
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:53,490
of core document and export yep cool and

1166
00:56:50,549 --> 00:57:01,170
with that we are other business is there

1167
00:56:53,490 --> 00:57:03,919
anything else no we have a plenty of

1168
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:03,920
work to get on with

1169
00:57:04,279 --> 00:57:09,599
but I'd love to certainly see some more

1170
00:57:07,859 --> 00:57:10,769
interrupts with the general calendars

1171
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,750
but I expect that will mostly be

1172
00:57:10,769 --> 00:57:18,419
happening through Cal Connect and other

1173
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:20,190
than that the quota works probably the

1174
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,109
immediate thing that we should be

1175
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:25,529
discussing on the list and giving that

1176
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:27,240
nailed down mdn almost would be contact

1177
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,549
meiosis and saying do you think you're

1178
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:33,538
ready to go maybe you should implement

1179
00:57:29,549 --> 00:57:37,229
as well tester

1180
00:57:33,539 --> 00:57:38,839
all right anything else no one said

1181
00:57:37,229 --> 00:57:45,328
missing in Java

1182
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:46,919
no all right cool thanks everybody we've

1183
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:52,649
finished half an hour early go get

1184
00:57:46,919 --> 00:58:10,699
yourself pretty for dinner thanks for my

1185
00:57:52,649 --> 00:58:10,699
people probably by mistake
