last-minute suggestions no good we have

26
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,790
two active documents which we are going

27
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,080
to discuss and we have one document

28
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:39,150
individual draft which were also going

29
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,960
to discuss today and we have two guests

30
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:44,460
talks and I think we're good to go but

31
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:47,160
when you go to the microphone please

32
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,840
state your name affiliation and other

33
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,490
information you think might be

34
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,720
interesting for a minute to take care

35
00:02:50,490 --> 00:03:14,760
and so the first presenter is Brian let

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:16,500
me uh and we have Eric now so we have

37
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,670
like three minutes takers

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:22,670
I fought valiantly but I got away okay

39
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,670
excellent

40
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:28,620
so hi I'm Brian Trammell I am for

41
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,019
purposes of this discussion not the

42
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,920
co-chair of energy just some guy off the

43
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,660
street with a research group draft this

44
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,309
is open questions in path aware

45
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,900
networking which the basically the

46
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,750
feedback we got at the last meeting was

47
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,190
to change the title um to current open

48
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,270
questions and panarin or this is you

49
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:48,000
Erin I don't know it looked confused

50
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:49,260
about this the idea was you know if

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,610
we're gonna snapshot this then we should

52
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,380
probably make it clear that this is

53
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,360
something that is you know as of the

54
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,430
point in time as in publication so we

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,019
changed some of the frontmatter we

56
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:02,730
changed the title we kept it from

57
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,019
expiring and those were the three things

58
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,290
that happened when we have submitted

59
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:08,850
that draft just for a review there are

60
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:10,230
some open questions I am NOT going to

61
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,940
sit up here and read this I think that

62
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,350
everybody who is interested in this

63
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,630
draft has already read these multiple

64
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,930
times it turns out when I wanted to make

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,000
my slides for this presentation all I

66
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:23,690
had to do was copy my slides from

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,780
Montreal and when I say Montreal I mean

68
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:30,540
102 not 105 so this document has now

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,320
been stable for about

70
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,880
18 17 months I did change sort of the

71
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,349
annotations over here so how our path

72
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,490
properties defined represented since the

73
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,760
last time we talked about this graph

74
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:43,830
there is now a individual draft that

75
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:46,289
that talks about that sort of okay so

76
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:47,940
more defined than represented but you

77
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:51,030
know there's a semantic layer and then a

78
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,560
presentation layer Aaron Falk so given

79
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,479
the fact that the questions haven't

80
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,980
changed in such a long time I suggest

81
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,260
that we remove current from the title

82
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:07,890
and make perpetual questions and at the

83
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:09,659
way stable questions next slide I am I

84
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,849
am like like draft revisions are free

85
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,800
like it's actually done by Circle C I so

86
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:17,280
it's like pushing to get back so I can I

87
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,500
can do it or is that is that a serious

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,280
question or you just Friday and you're

89
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,490
being snarky

90
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,099
I can't tell us sorry it was a it was a

91
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:27,090
snarky comment on the lack of

92
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:30,810
contributions to the answer to the

93
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,890
questions great oh okay that's a better

94
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,790
joke than the joke I thought you were

95
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:36,570
making okay ha

96
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,790
thank you Spencer Dawkins or it could

97
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,550
have been a non snorky comment on the

98
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,740
idea that research questions don't

99
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:49,440
change very often great so so it's just

100
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,800
that so I was just in a in another

101
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:57,030
working group where the word recent was

102
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,080
spin bitted and like it's like we

103
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,549
shouldn't talk about reason because

104
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,840
there's going to be perpetual it's like

105
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,700
so I think that we can leave current in

106
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,739
there and the current means perpetual so

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,240
that way I don't have to push another

108
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:09,210
get tagged

109
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,920
there was one minor change to this list

110
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:12,840
of questions from some discussion that

111
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,720
we had some time between two Montreal's

112
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,890
ago and now about the transition right

113
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,180
like so we're talking about in this

114
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:22,880
eighth question so this is the thing

115
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:25,950
that's in in italic your is the new text

116
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,640
this incentive alignment is not just

117
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:32,460
about um you know the greenfield

118
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,770
creation of these kind of networks it's

119
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,049
they transition right like so this is

120
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:38,430
the this is you know taking from a

121
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,210
careful reading of planning for a

122
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:43,200
protocol transition and adoption

123
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,080
preparing for adoption in subsequent

124
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,438
transition so

125
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,188
favourite graft the favorite FC guy Eric

126
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:53,349
on mark so we have this reliable and

127
00:06:51,189 --> 00:06:55,780
available Wireless boss earlier this

128
00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,300
week and it's part of this discussion

129
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,280
leading up to that we asked o is pen RG

130
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,710
doing something and I went I looked at

131
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:06,280
this staff to find out about whether you

132
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:08,138
have discussed this sort of time aspect

133
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,090
of the properties so particularly

134
00:07:08,139 --> 00:07:13,300
Wireless we have some path properties

135
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:15,250
that might very extremely quickly over

136
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,900
some particular wireless link as opposed

137
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,180
to the unturned properties of the whole

138
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,679
path right and I don't see any mention

139
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,060
about in the draft I was just curious

140
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,509
whether you guys have talked about that

141
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:30,819
stuff a little bit but not in the draft

142
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:32,680
so because part of it is I guess the s

143
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:35,949
of it if you turn and find out about a

144
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,719
whole path no I get the question yes

145
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:44,620
yeah that's actually important to

146
00:07:37,719 --> 00:07:46,599
capture your yeah actually can you Frank

147
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,180
no can you frame your comp like actually

148
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,460
can you you've you've you've read this

149
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,569
draft I presume it one of its revisions

150
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:57,370
all of which are basically the same

151
00:07:54,569 --> 00:07:59,289
let's sync up offline about getting

152
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,599
texts from that comment into question

153
00:07:59,289 --> 00:08:03,490
form because this is this is Pat this is

154
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,659
path or networking jeopardy so

155
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:10,000
everything has to be in the form of a

156
00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:11,680
question so I think the question the

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,960
previous question relates to path

158
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,270
properties which which is also related

159
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,128
to my tribe so wait so you actually do

160
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,750
we did actually start the discussion

161
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:23,469
about the temporal the temporal

162
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:27,009
characteristics these properties the I

163
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:28,389
think the question should capture that

164
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:29,589
because they don't write like so when

165
00:08:28,389 --> 00:08:31,419
you started trying to answer the

166
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,828
question this other question came up

167
00:08:31,419 --> 00:08:35,110
very quickly and you kept answering it

168
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:37,899
but the questions draft should point out

169
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:39,610
that this is a thing so I see Erik

170
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:40,990
typing furiously over there and I hope

171
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,890
that that's he's sending a PR on the

172
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,880
draft but yeah I think I think yes we're

173
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,640
gonna talk about a little bit more in

174
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:51,060
your in your thing but it doesn't need

175
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,270
to be in this draft which means these

176
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:57,699
meta questions on the question draft are

177
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:59,350
overtaken by events we discussed

178
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:03,969
a bit hasn't changed much we're gonna

179
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:05,850
change that April I would propose his

180
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,220
editor publish on the IR TF stream I

181
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,839
would actually say proposed as editor to

182
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,910
publish on the IR TF stream after some

183
00:09:10,839 --> 00:09:17,519
discussion on the mailing list after a

184
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:20,350
zero for Rev that has Eric's text in it

185
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,959
just to add to the thing that you said

186
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:25,540
I'm willing to help like add something

187
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:29,290
to the first question which my document

188
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:32,349
is I've read a number of like versions

189
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:37,959
of your draft and willing to go over it

190
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:39,369
one more time okay cool thanks just to

191
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:41,258
double check this I'm like I'm super

192
00:09:39,369 --> 00:09:43,720
happy to to give you an RC number for

193
00:09:41,259 --> 00:09:45,100
that but given the word crudeness in

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,989
there and it actually has some meaning

195
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,449
does it actually make sense to publish

196
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:51,339
it as an RC or is it just like something

197
00:09:49,449 --> 00:09:54,399
we need to know about in this group and

198
00:09:51,339 --> 00:09:55,899
then work on the questions so I thought

199
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,279
about this back like we've we've

200
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:58,749
discussed this in the last three

201
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:02,410
meetings and at each meeting we land on

202
00:09:58,749 --> 00:10:04,119
a different answer and I think that like

203
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:06,429
right now we're in the phase that it's

204
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:08,970
published so if we manage to drag this

205
00:10:06,429 --> 00:10:11,919
out to Vancouver it'll be don't publish

206
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:15,509
my thinking on this has changed over

207
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:19,649
time and where I am right now is

208
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:22,119
publishing this as an RFC has the

209
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:26,199
advantage of giving people who are

210
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:28,509
working on on technologies and

211
00:10:26,199 --> 00:10:30,368
techniques and and stuff in this space

212
00:10:28,509 --> 00:10:32,470
who are not in this room

213
00:10:30,369 --> 00:10:33,939
something that they can wave around and

214
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:37,149
say this is important and I think that's

215
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:38,529
a service to the community I want to

216
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:42,699
stake my name but because I forgot me a

217
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:45,100
cool event Erin + wonder what you

218
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:47,108
just said also referring to my last

219
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:49,559
comment given the fact that the answers

220
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:52,149
are coming rather slowly I suspect that

221
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:54,009
these questions will be around for a

222
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:56,739
while in fact this would be great input

223
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:59,529
for say an activity that's looking at a

224
00:10:56,739 --> 00:11:01,959
vision of the network for 2030 to have

225
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:04,600
some real research questions to chew on

226
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:06,279
that would okay so that's that's tuned

227
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,539
for we should probably probably publish

228
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:08,829
but let's not have that discussion right

229
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:10,600
now because there's going to be text

230
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:11,500
coming like texts and it's coming in to

231
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,430
talk about the temporal

232
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:19,400
aspects of things so like on the current

233
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:23,510
versus not I mean like we can we can we

234
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,709
can multicast the the title a bit if we

235
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,560
want to but I think we should probably

236
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,030
do that on the list yeah we already

237
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,000
already spin bit at the agenda so we

238
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:36,110
have to multicast the title other

239
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,730
questions thank you very much we will

240
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,930
follow up on the list and I hope to get

241
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,470
this done

242
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:45,050
with my editor had on before Vancouver

243
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,550
so that we can just say hey it's going

244
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,589
up to the IRS G before Vancouver and

245
00:11:46,550 --> 00:12:10,189
then we'll be there problem

246
00:11:47,590 --> 00:12:12,800
thanks hi I'm Theresa and I'm here for

247
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:16,130
an update of deep F properties draft

248
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:21,079
which I prepared together with Cyril

249
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:23,600
before this meeting so we got a bunch of

250
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,150
feedback in at last Montreal which was

251
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,370
105 and we got an extensive review on

252
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,850
the list by med for which we're really

253
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:33,440
grateful so I just the first thing I

254
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:37,700
just wanted to remind people of the

255
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:39,680
scope of this particular draft so there

256
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,530
was a question on like is there some

257
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,670
architectural reference of this of this

258
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:49,520
draft and we think it would be really

259
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:51,699
interesting to have something like more

260
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:54,020
fleshed out more concrete but the

261
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,870
architectural reference that we see and

262
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,569
that we now link to in the error that we

263
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,210
reference now in the abstract or in the

264
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:05,090
introduction is basically what the

265
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:07,220
questions questions draft says what a

266
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:09,290
path aware network is so the path of a

267
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,050
network exposes information about the

268
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,750
forwarding paths and services associated

269
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:18,349
with these paths to costs or to other

270
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:20,300
entities and in the path properties

271
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,120
draft we want to talk about this

272
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:25,310
information like what how can we define

273
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,170
this kind of information

274
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,899
either the host or the other entities

275
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:35,930
would want to know and how do we express

276
00:13:29,899 --> 00:13:37,999
them and four so yeah to answer this

277
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,029
question we need a common terminology

278
00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:42,980
because if people from different areas

279
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:45,470
say path they sometimes mean like very

280
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,600
different things so we had a look at a

281
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:49,089
bunch of different definitions and now

282
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,709
we're trying to find a common language

283
00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:54,860
for this research group to talk about

284
00:13:51,709 --> 00:13:58,279
paths so we still have nodes and nodes

285
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:59,899
process packets and those nodes could be

286
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:03,709
a physical machine they could be a

287
00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:06,740
virtual machine but now we expanded this

288
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:09,199
definition a little bit to include for

289
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:12,079
example a software component for example

290
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,699
a service functional implementation of a

291
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,748
service function but we are probably

292
00:14:13,699 --> 00:14:16,939
going to talk about it a little more

293
00:14:14,749 --> 00:14:19,579
abstract so you could have a path that

294
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:22,009
consists of multiple nodes that you sort

295
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,459
of chained to each other because each of

296
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:30,050
those nodes processes packets in some

297
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:32,888
way and otherwise a node could also be a

298
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:36,378
little more more abstract like a

299
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:38,870
collection of multiple physical devices

300
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:40,399
maybe even an entire autonomous system

301
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:43,610
for example if you want to talk about a

302
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,829
path and you do not care about like each

303
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,980
individual device that is on the path or

304
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,258
maybe you just don't know or maybe it it

305
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,019
changes and so a node can also be this

306
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:57,800
kind of more abstract thing or a more

307
00:14:54,019 --> 00:15:00,079
concrete thing and we still have one

308
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,689
special case of a node because we talk

309
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,939
about hosts so much we decided that we

310
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,459
would keep the definition of hosts but

311
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:09,829
it our other definitions do not depend

312
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:12,199
on it but we talk about hosts a lot in

313
00:15:09,829 --> 00:15:15,160
like other parts of the draft so that

314
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:18,670
definition is now aligned with our SLC

315
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,379
11:22 and then there's links which

316
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,019
basically allow one node to send a

317
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:27,259
packet to another node or even to

318
00:15:24,019 --> 00:15:29,809
multiple other nodes our links are

319
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:31,579
unidirectional so if you want to model

320
00:15:29,809 --> 00:15:33,860
bi-directional communication just use

321
00:15:31,579 --> 00:15:36,138
two links between for example the same

322
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,380
nodes which basically allowed to send

323
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:45,260
packets in opposite directions

324
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:47,660
and now if you can sort of align those

325
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,300
or if you have multiple of those nodes

326
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,579
one after the other each of nodes and

327
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,189
links one after the other they are path

328
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:59,300
elements if you can transmit a packet

329
00:15:55,190 --> 00:16:01,519
over these path elements then this is

330
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,889
enough for them to form a path so you

331
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,959
can have a path that includes note link

332
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:08,000
node link and then there can be three

333
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:09,680
nodes for example for the for the

334
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,440
service function chaining use case we

335
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,649
need this so it depends on kind of your

336
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:21,949
granularity and then the de path is

337
00:16:18,649 --> 00:16:24,560
defined as the sequence of path elements

338
00:16:21,949 --> 00:16:26,779
from one node to another node doesn't

339
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,119
have to be a host can of course be like

340
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,240
both hosts but they can also be overlay

341
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,680
nodes for example and we didn't want to

342
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,449
have like a clear distinction between

343
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,750
what is a host what is a router what as

344
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:41,630
an overlay node because then we might

345
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,760
unnecessarily constrain our definitions

346
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,790
so now we just have like one node

347
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:48,560
another node and that can be a packet

348
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:52,430
sent from one node to the other node

349
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:55,279
across those path elements and then sub

350
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:56,930
path is just a subsequence of this path

351
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,740
doesn't have to start and end with a

352
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,290
node anymore

353
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,829
so we can just talk about maybe three

354
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:08,899
nodes or three links or something like

355
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:14,839
that and then the packet so a data flow

356
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:17,120
is packets that can for example be sent

357
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:20,629
from one node to another over a given

358
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,989
path but we didn't want to constrain our

359
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:26,329
definition to imply that all the path

360
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,910
elements have to stay the same because

361
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:32,480
maybe you send you sent multiple packets

362
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:33,890
and somewhere on your path maybe it just

363
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,380
tastes like a load balancer and then

364
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:37,790
packets take one way the other way and

365
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,460
so on maybe you want to still

366
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:43,070
collectively refer to those packets

367
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,559
because they are between the same nodes

368
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:47,750
right and so we basically have a flow

369
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,389
that is just a collection of packets and

370
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:52,400
we want to talk about these packets sort

371
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,120
of as a collection and

372
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:58,160
like a path property to them and then

373
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:01,340
the property definition essentially

374
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,580
stayed the same but like components that

375
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:08,870
it refers to change so we think now a

376
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:14,149
path property should should work as a

377
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:16,550
definition and we give a number of

378
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:19,730
examples for path property so note that

379
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:22,490
we remove the classification into domain

380
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:24,620
properties backbone properties and what

381
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,920
was the other dynamic properties but now

382
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:29,919
we basically have a list of of examples

383
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,920
of path properties which might be

384
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:35,450
interesting to know for the host such as

385
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:38,300
what access technology do we have is

386
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:41,240
this a Wi-Fi link cellular link is like

387
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:43,850
Ethernet and does it cost money to

388
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:47,150
transmit packets across a network across

389
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,040
a link then did administrative domain is

390
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:51,830
a new property which we basically we

391
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,560
basically more of this this aspect that

392
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:57,889
maybe you care like who owns path

393
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:00,169
element on your path or sequence of path

394
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:03,950
elements and that is the administrative

395
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:05,540
domain property which can for example

396
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,850
just be it belongs to an autonomous

397
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:11,330
system it belongs to a certain service

398
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,580
providers network or it might also be

399
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,199
like more fine-grained for example if

400
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,060
you have multiple routing areas within

401
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,980
your AAS maybe you want to refer to one

402
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:21,590
of them so this is all possible with

403
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:24,950
this administrative domain property then

404
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:27,139
you might care about different paths in

405
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,150
terms of what what features or what

406
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:30,940
protocols or protocol features today

407
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,850
support and then there's these

408
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:37,000
transmission related so transmitted

409
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:39,679
transmitting a packet or a flow

410
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,500
properties for example expressing the

411
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:45,950
capacity or a usage of links or the

412
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,920
delays so those definitions we aligned

413
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:52,910
with basically with existing RFC's

414
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:56,240
such as wit entire di VPN working group

415
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:58,820
because we we do not intend to like

416
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,330
redefine properties that are already

417
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,580
well defined somewhere else right so we

418
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:05,870
have this list of examples of map

419
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:08,570
properties

420
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:10,669
and of course this is not an exhaustive

421
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,120
list but just a few examples so we

422
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:17,000
wanted to motivate our examples and that

423
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,100
is why we have the use cases section in

424
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,140
there actually this section is not new

425
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,959
it was part of the introduction before

426
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:27,170
but now we explicitly made it its own

427
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:30,980
section and those are three use cases

428
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:35,210
that we came up with also with the help

429
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:39,020
of our reviewer and yeah basically those

430
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:42,110
are examples why a host or another

431
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:47,050
entity might want to know about the past

432
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:50,059
properties that we have in our draft and

433
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,830
with this I'm going back to like the

434
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:55,820
bigger picture so after the scope of

435
00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:00,110
this draft and the context so and we

436
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:02,600
have asked for adoption on the list

437
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:04,490
already there was not a lot of feedback

438
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:08,840
at the time so now I just would like to

439
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,880
to ask again so do it does the research

440
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:13,928
group think that these terms and like

441
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,840
this draft serves or may serve as a

442
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:20,809
basis for us as a research group to come

443
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,780
up with a common terminology so we can

444
00:21:20,809 --> 00:21:25,550
talk about a path properties in the

445
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:31,000
context of the research group and maybe

446
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,000
later on for people reading a strap

447
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:40,399
hello Tommy Polly Apple so I think we

448
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:41,630
should adopt this it's a good starting

449
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,110
point and thank you for the work on the

450
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:47,870
most recent update I think that does

451
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,969
help clarify I appreciate all the work

452
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,649
to incorporate this it was not a trivial

453
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,590
change

454
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:56,540
I think the terms do work I think

455
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,870
they're more narrowly scoped than

456
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:01,100
something we saw before so that was good

457
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,360
one thing that just came to mind kind of

458
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:07,399
as an aside so we have the notion of

459
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:09,590
node in here which i think is nice in

460
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:14,590
general and it's I think general for a

461
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:17,480
purpose should we have some

462
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:18,679
specification of a certain type of node

463
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,880
with

464
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:24,950
guards to path awareness because we were

465
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,690
talking about path selection in here and

466
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,400
so there are certain nodes that I may

467
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:29,720
Traverse that I can't do anything about

468
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,370
but there are other nodes that

469
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:34,280
essentially allow me to make choices

470
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,959
right like things that are the I think

471
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,629
as you mentioned transport converters or

472
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:40,640
I have you know things I can help me do

473
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,820
MPT CP or like things that can act as

474
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,120
proxies or nodes that enable path

475
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:48,909
selection and in potentially even when

476
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,590
we talk about measurement nodes that

477
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:54,050
participate with the client in path

478
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,459
measurement so they are know so

479
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,260
essentially there are transparent nodes

480
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:59,590
and there are nodes that you can use for

481
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:02,960
measurement or selection that are

482
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:05,090
enabling some future techniques and so

483
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,320
maybe just having a definition Kosovo of

484
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:07,970
course we don't necessarily know all the

485
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,330
mechanisms that will want going forward

486
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:14,840
but defining these stances a node can

487
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,399
take would be useful yeah I was thinking

488
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,830
that maybe we could express something

489
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,950
like that as another property like oh

490
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,659
this node has the feature that I can I

491
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:30,680
can do stuff on it right that's this

492
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:34,700
kind of thing maybe that works hello

493
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:37,400
this is Sabine from so just to make sure

494
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:39,620
I didn't miss anything all those

495
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,300
information that you list on path

496
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:47,510
properties so you assume they will be

497
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:50,360
generated automatically at the side of

498
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:53,570
the endpoint of a starting endpoint then

499
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,149
I have a bunch of questions and so I do

500
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:58,220
not assume they will automatically be

501
00:23:56,150 --> 00:24:02,120
generated or available

502
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:05,000
I just I'm coming up with a with

503
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,239
definitions of how to talk about those

504
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:10,790
properties if there are like devices

505
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,070
that can come up with them right or if

506
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:17,270
there are devices that sort of can can

507
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:20,000
process them but how we would exactly

508
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:22,460
measure them how we would communicate

509
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,400
those properties from for example a puff

510
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,690
element to the end point that is another

511
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,660
answer to another research question that

512
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:31,130
might be another research group draft or

513
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,630
something else so this is just about the

514
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:34,870
terminology so I do not

515
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:39,020
this will automatically happen just by

516
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:43,159
providing a terminology okay so the next

517
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:48,260
question is that it seems that you may

518
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:52,610
want to design a representation format

519
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:57,830
and cap and for those paths and their

520
00:24:52,610 --> 00:25:01,389
properties I have actually these looks

521
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:07,520
very similar to what is done in auto

522
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:10,340
auto defines a feature a service that is

523
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:15,379
called path vector and that may be

524
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:21,649
useful to your work because between two

525
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:24,140
endpoints you you make a break you you

526
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:27,680
make a breakdown on what happens between

527
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:31,220
two end points and that can be this is

528
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,880
kind of this this would support what you

529
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:37,100
would like to have as information maybe

530
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,990
a couple of interesting features that

531
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:44,330
you mentioned like the list of available

532
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:49,640
transport protocol and to end that may

533
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:53,270
be useful so may I invite you to write

534
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:55,790
the draft on path vector and I think

535
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:59,080
that there would be room for some common

536
00:25:55,790 --> 00:26:02,899
work about it maybe you already read it

537
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,610
so I've read a number of different like

538
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,650
drafts that relate to different

539
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:09,740
definitions of a path your sounds more

540
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:12,410
like the transport perspective so we we

541
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,090
have on our github repo where this draft

542
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:17,120
is being developed we have a wiki where

543
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:19,669
we also list like some working groups

544
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,639
and some RFC's that are related we have

545
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:24,710
Alto in there I believe but I'm gonna go

546
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,840
back and check the specific like path

547
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:29,360
vector that you mentioned and then we

548
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:36,409
can talk about more okay thanks thank

549
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:41,600
you for your comments hi Brian Trammell

550
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:43,730
speaking as an individual actually I

551
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,040
wanted to I want to come up here and say

552
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,240
yes I think this is a good start

553
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,950
I think we should continue this

554
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,110
discussion in the research group this is

555
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,490
what we're here for

556
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:57,219
I have a couple of things that I would

557
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,120
change but I don't want to make those

558
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,650
discussion goes from here because I

559
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,330
don't want to I don't want to let's see

560
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:07,030
we've already you spend it and multicast

561
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:10,220
I don't want to put it in the DNS the

562
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:12,610
Tommies thing like I think he just like

563
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:15,200
did that and then ran out didn't he so

564
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:18,229
Tommy's idea is intriguing but

565
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:22,580
terrifying I would not want to see us

566
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:25,010
try to go down the the path of node

567
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,870
properties or node classification in the

568
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:31,310
path properties document I think there

569
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:33,590
is some room for talking about the types

570
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:35,450
or classes of functions that a node

571
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:37,760
might like so I like the idea of like

572
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,460
saying this is a transparent and this is

573
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:43,910
an in transparent and this is a you know

574
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,040
layer X and this is an endpoint right

575
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:48,320
like so that beyond that I don't think

576
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,060
we want to you know because the between

577
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,590
there like you do that and then there's

578
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:56,270
like a whole bunch of unclarity and at

579
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:57,350
the end of it you get to mud right which

580
00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,180
is trying to solve a completely

581
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:01,459
different problem but we do already have

582
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:03,350
service functions in there which can

583
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,200
also like annotate at Oh this is a

584
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:09,050
firewall or something like that so we

585
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,940
could you see I would be very careful

586
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,830
about trying to do a an ontology of

587
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,320
every service function on that exactly

588
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:18,560
that's not what I'm going to do right

589
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,970
yeah and like that the intention to

590
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,710
bring it into the research group and

591
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,420
then we can work on it more as a

592
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:25,130
research group great but as an

593
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:27,530
individual contributor I just say that I

594
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,860
will be I'll be sort of aggressively

595
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:32,120
pushing toward trying to generalize the

596
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,860
things in this document as opposed to

597
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,100
make them like specific to a particular

598
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:38,570
thing I also think that like so there's

599
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:42,110
a there's definite overlap here with

600
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:43,700
Aalto with respect to like the path

601
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:47,209
vector I think there's a very clear line

602
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:50,630
between the responsibilities of Alto in

603
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:53,630
terms of building representations of

604
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:55,640
these things and the energies should

605
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:56,810
work on abstract vocabulary if we get to

606
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,370
the point where we're actually saying

607
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:00,740
this is a wire encoding on one of these

608
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:03,629
that's IETF work

609
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,970
we already say that the path property is

610
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:08,490
like the sequence of path elements and

611
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:10,170
then some like topple flows or something

612
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:11,790
like we already have something along

613
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,420
those lines and I wouldn't want to be

614
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,889
more specific

615
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:15,450
that's an information model on a data

616
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:18,060
model information models are fine data

617
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:23,790
models are not well I don't want to get

618
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:26,100
into yang so that having been said yes I

619
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:29,360
support adoption of this let's let's

620
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:29,360
keep work on it let's work on the here

621
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:38,370
you're being it a statement on the same

622
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,649
topics on policy on Thomas comment I

623
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:44,219
find it very interesting to have this

624
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,710
property of a layer X transparency you

625
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,260
can formulate it mathematically you can

626
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,570
aggregate it on path on path

627
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,080
aggregations on aggregations of on

628
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:57,659
subpaths to formulate that you have a

629
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,370
transparency on a specific layer which

630
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,200
means that you have an kind of

631
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:04,500
end-to-end connectivity for this

632
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,330
specific just just to make sure I

633
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,130
understand what you're saying you mean

634
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,899
for example there's like a layer 3

635
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:13,470
device a layer 3 device and then all the

636
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:15,180
layer 2 devices between them are sort of

637
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:17,070
abstracted from and they sorta don't

638
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,470
know about the layer 3 or vice versa

639
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:21,929
this kind of thing sorry all these nodes

640
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:24,660
in between our characterises layer 2

641
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:27,810
transparent which means and layer 3

642
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:30,240
transparent which means that just the

643
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:32,639
end device is communicate directly at a

644
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,580
specific layer also mathematically it

645
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,700
could be interesting and so it could you

646
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,230
could you like provide a reference or

647
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,640
something to that to the list because I

648
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,290
would like to see like how do you

649
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,540
express that mathematically because we

650
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:47,940
did have something like that and I think

651
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,710
previous versions of our definitions and

652
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:52,410
then we were like yeah it's kind of hard

653
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,000
to express so I would just like to take

654
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:57,450
a look at like how you mathematically

655
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,030
Express those become ok I can think

656
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:06,780
about it is good about security is there

657
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:09,090
any metric on security any property on

658
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,190
security encryption has a specific layer

659
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,290
because this was also topics that has

660
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:14,250
been addressed so what I could imagine

661
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:17,580
is

662
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:20,220
you have to talk about trust in some way

663
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,780
but this is really complicated I'm not

664
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,490
sure like I don't think you can capture

665
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:28,050
how much you trust a certain half

666
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:30,780
element as a property yeah

667
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,730
but otherwise what do you want encrypted

668
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:35,600
your transfer like is it like Oh traffic

669
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,770
is encrypted between this and that other

670
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,570
but still you have to you have to

671
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:41,940
qualify it it's not like encryption is

672
00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,610
not the same as encryption right yes I

673
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,740
meant at a specific layer a protection

674
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:51,060
that is either through signatures or

675
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:55,020
through encryption done from endnotes

676
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:56,790
to EndNote in a sense to to say yeah

677
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:06,930
corresponding to the threat model that

678
00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:08,909
we're defining now yeah yeah I think it

679
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,430
might be interesting to characterize a

680
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:16,380
path with respect whether it is liable

681
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:18,000
to threat or not yeah yeah I think the

682
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,910
trust question is really interesting and

683
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,670
we should revisit it once we talk more

684
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:29,250
about like how how does how do we get a

685
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:32,970
trustworthy and sure thanks Philip T's

686
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:35,000
does begin as an individual first really

687
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:38,400
thank you for doing this work because

688
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,070
we've seen it maturing a lot and I think

689
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:43,020
it's read definitely in the state where

690
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:45,899
we should adopt it and work together on

691
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,590
it honorable as a working group or as a

692
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:51,330
research group sorry

693
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:54,510
tommy's comment also made me think made

694
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:57,780
me stand up for more deities I think

695
00:32:54,510 --> 00:33:01,530
it's very good starting with a generic

696
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:05,670
description of the past like just being

697
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:09,600
a set of node or a sequence of notes I

698
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:13,350
don't think that things like notes that

699
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,800
could do stuff or couldn't do stuff are

700
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:20,310
something useful because I would rather

701
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,060
prefer network functions that could be

702
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:28,280
on the past as two different paths so

703
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:28,280
one with the node one without the node

704
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:34,380
besides that the idea of whether the

705
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:36,330
note is transparent or isn't transparent

706
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,720
so whether it's actually breaking the

707
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:42,240
end-to-end principle or whether it isn't

708
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,390
breaking that end-to-end principle it's

709
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,860
an important property I'm not sure

710
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:48,900
whether we need this in the basic

711
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,510
definition or that's one of the first

712
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:55,140
properties of a note one wants to be

713
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:57,270
fine right so yeah as I was saying we

714
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,590
don't define an exhaustive list but yeah

715
00:33:57,270 --> 00:34:01,590
this is definitely an interesting one

716
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:07,439
and think about it another interesting

717
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:10,739
one I see is whether this can does not

718
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,869
break the interim principal but passes

719
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:15,719
information along so like a measurement

720
00:34:12,869 --> 00:34:17,850
note that's giving use some information

721
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:19,408
that's passed along with the packet then

722
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,179
we would about then we would have to

723
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:24,210
define what breaking the end-to-end

724
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,730
principle means and I don't think I want

725
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:29,418
to define it in this draft that's a good

726
00:34:26,730 --> 00:34:34,168
question whether we want this thank you

727
00:34:29,418 --> 00:34:36,600
I'd like to cut the line me a cool even

728
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:38,310
yeah thank you for the work I am

729
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,230
actually a plus one on at least

730
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,489
exploring the idea of adding

731
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:43,260
transparency your definition of

732
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:44,549
transparency here because that could be

733
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,080
very useful but we could also feel about

734
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,940
it but it was another thing we have to

735
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:49,710
decide before adoption can work on that

736
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,918
but the actual reason I came here was

737
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:54,000
that about the use cases you've added so

738
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,290
I think it's a very good approach to

739
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,909
look at the use cases and figure out

740
00:34:55,290 --> 00:34:58,529
like based on the use cases what we need

741
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,670
and what we want but right now I find

742
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:02,250
the use case is rather a little bit

743
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:04,080
confusing because so example you talk

744
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:05,550
about performance monitoring and like

745
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,799
performance monitoring for me is

746
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:09,990
something very like I want to know does

747
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,150
my does work that's my network work

748
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:13,439
right now right and I don't think that's

749
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,670
what you're looking at that's actually

750
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,109
kind of what you're explaining very

751
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:17,760
lengthy in the next section talking

752
00:35:16,109 --> 00:35:20,220
about examples that it's not about

753
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,200
dislike current state but more about

754
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:25,830
general properties right and that's also

755
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,240
everything that's related to

756
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:29,490
measurements always the question is

757
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,810
what's your measurement timeframe right

758
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,310
this is something you've been measuring

759
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,170
over the last second or do you take the

760
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:36,690
average over the last week right this is

761
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:39,150
very different and then and like my

762
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:40,710
understanding was that like this group

763
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:41,070
actually was more scoped on something

764
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,450
that is

765
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:44,040
not over the last second but something

766
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,140
like more long-term I don't know maybe

767
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,509
discussion to have but like right now

768
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,450
I'm a little bit confused here

769
00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,590
okay yeah so I definitely open to

770
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,180
contributions to this to this use case a

771
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:57,870
section because yes I agree it needs

772
00:35:54,180 --> 00:36:00,029
more work performance monitoring I think

773
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:01,680
as the definitions work right now we can

774
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:03,180
have both we can have like the very

775
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,009
short term because like the property

776
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,779
would be defined on may be a single

777
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,400
packet and one-way delay of a single

778
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:10,230
packet and then you can aggregate and

779
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,370
then you can aggregate over the last 10

780
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:16,230
seconds last hour week that's all

781
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:18,000
possible right types very much into like

782
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:20,820
the measurement method about how to

783
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,300
access this metrics rather than what the

784
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,760
metrics actually means right mmm-hmm

785
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:28,680
but I mean isn't that like two separate

786
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,050
things how do you define the metric and

787
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:32,190
how do you like communicate it access it

788
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:33,600
how do you measure it we're not

789
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:37,230
attempting to answer that question right

790
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:38,880
but you say basically it's I leave the

791
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:40,140
metric undefined and depends on the

792
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,820
measurement you use I would rather

793
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:45,509
define the metric and then look for the

794
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,690
right measurement for it okay I'm gonna

795
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:52,500
come back to the same discussion also

796
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,760
actually and traffic conservation is a

797
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:56,070
little bit the same because right now

798
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,300
what yet so product protocol selection

799
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,380
would be the right title for me because

800
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,850
that's the point you the thing you

801
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,500
really want but like traffic

802
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,660
configuration Sean it sounds like you're

803
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,480
diving into doing congestion control

804
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:07,710
here right so this can be protocol

805
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,090
features but it can also be like

806
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:14,190
application level modifications to what

807
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:15,300
you're sending as a horse so I wanted to

808
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,740
keep it much annual but traffic

809
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,990
configuration was trusted to her mine

810
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:21,299
came up with like at one point and of

811
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,899
course we can change it or maybe split

812
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:27,330
those news cases and make them more

813
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:28,800
talks very much about protocol selection

814
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:30,210
I think it's a very good use case let's

815
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,860
start with the simple ones first we know

816
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:37,470
about and then maybe extend later hello

817
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,360
max Wonka just really quick and easy

818
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:41,129
clarifying question I think it's very

819
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,320
fairly obvious but you stayed that links

820
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:47,300
are unidirectional explicitly and paths

821
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:47,300
are also unidirectional right okay

822
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,480
[Music]

823
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:54,020
Andrew McGregor firstly I could have a

824
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:57,220
lot to say about this but I'll just

825
00:37:54,020 --> 00:38:01,040
restrict myself a bit firstly

826
00:37:57,220 --> 00:38:03,560
representing representing different

827
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,609
modes of a path as separate paths is a

828
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,430
really bad idea

829
00:38:04,609 --> 00:38:11,598
because what you want to do is represent

830
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:14,720
where the shared resources are and if

831
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,040
you if you say ok at this point you

832
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,859
could route it through that tunnel or

833
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:21,020
not then what about the fording

834
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:24,589
resources on the on path nodes that are

835
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:25,790
in the unfolded version of the path how

836
00:38:24,589 --> 00:38:28,250
do you represent that you're sharing

837
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,869
buffers between the two versions right

838
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:34,849
so that's that's oh no no don't do that

839
00:38:31,869 --> 00:38:37,040
right so you're saying that those are

840
00:38:34,849 --> 00:38:39,140
like two different paths and on two

841
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,750
different paths there one path they can

842
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:50,868
operate in two different modes all right

843
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:51,950
right and it's the end of the waking the

844
00:38:50,869 --> 00:38:53,300
other things I was going to say falling

845
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:57,290
out of my head so I'll sit down thank

846
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:59,869
you we have a mailing list so like in

847
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:03,080
three weeks when your brains back yeah

848
00:38:59,869 --> 00:39:05,210
and least I've been quite very quiet

849
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:07,130
right we did call for adoption on the

850
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,680
mailing list but unfortunately we

851
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:13,060
haven't received many comments so I

852
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,680
think we shall just can be just harm for

853
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:22,310
adoption if you're single this should

854
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:23,930
better but please harm sorry I

855
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:25,070
interrupted the home I'd actually like

856
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,460
to see a show of hands if you've read

857
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,460
the draft

858
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:36,950
[Music]

859
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:38,869
okay so order a dozen that's reasonable

860
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:42,740
yeah so don't look at now now I'm gonna

861
00:39:38,869 --> 00:39:44,810
step back so okay just in case if you if

862
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:56,379
you seen a it's a draft shouldn't be

863
00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:56,380
adopted please hum let's rerun the home

864
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:08,259
okay sir let's do it again if you think

865
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,260
this draft should be adopted please harm

866
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,880
if you are against adoption please come

867
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:26,329
so from up here the acoustics are not

868
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,989
the most terrible in this venue but

869
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:30,489
they're not great

870
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:33,139
I heard sort of Lake yeah

871
00:40:30,489 --> 00:40:35,989
lukewarm to warm support for adoption

872
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:38,959
and crickets on non adoption which seems

873
00:40:35,989 --> 00:40:40,729
like adoption to me it wasn't quite

874
00:40:38,959 --> 00:40:43,339
crickets for adoption someone did hum

875
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:49,999
but it was it was very thin for over not

876
00:40:43,339 --> 00:40:58,599
adoption there is one cricket okay okay

877
00:40:49,999 --> 00:40:58,598
cool Thank You Spencer you are next

878
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:35,620
so who's read this draft thank you and

879
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:39,730
that and that the picked the picture was

880
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:41,140
mostly the question was mostly just give

881
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,850
me time to take the picture

882
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:49,859
so I'm Spencer Dawkins I'm talking about

883
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:53,740
the what not to do draft which was

884
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:55,270
something maybe I can give just this

885
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:59,799
much background for people who haven't

886
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:02,290
read it for from the beginning of the

887
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,060
research group work one of the things we

888
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,550
said was that we keep you know we've had

889
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:12,120
a lot of had to wear networking

890
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:15,490
mechanisms that didn't get deployed and

891
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,589
they keep not getting deployed for many

892
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:19,689
of the same reasons so we should write

893
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:22,660
those down so this is what the document

894
00:42:19,690 --> 00:42:25,200
was intended to be to put my first last

895
00:42:22,660 --> 00:42:30,040
flights first but you'll see it again

896
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,810
we've been talking about this draft as a

897
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,410
research group draft and as an

898
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:38,320
individual draft for you know what what

899
00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:40,359
will be in Vancouver two years they've

900
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:44,050
been presented at every parent recession

901
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:45,580
since ITF 400 and I want to say that

902
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:48,550
every revision has been an improvement

903
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:51,279
and that has been because people have

904
00:42:48,550 --> 00:42:54,970
worked on it and contributed to it thank

905
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,790
you for those people we can continue to

906
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:59,350
improve this draft in the future or it

907
00:42:57,790 --> 00:43:02,290
might be time for this bird to leave the

908
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:04,240
nest and the reason I think that is the

909
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:07,150
last two major revisions have been

910
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:09,250
mostly summarizing the draft the goals

911
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:12,580
for this informational draft are to

912
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:16,680
inform research in this research group

913
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:19,240
research outside this research group and

914
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:21,190
engineering outside this research group

915
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:23,200
and that's the third one is the one i

916
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,540
want to call the most attention to it

917
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,399
seems to me that we need to publish in

918
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:29,230
order to inform work outside the

919
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,420
research group especially engineering

920
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,950
work and it seems to me that I see

921
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,859
proposals that every eye

922
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:37,899
TAF cycle that need this document

923
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,750
including during this last ITF cycle

924
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:42,970
including this meeting week I've had

925
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:46,150
three conversations where I appointed

926
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:49,990
people who were presenting at this IEF

927
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:52,780
to this draft because there were things

928
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:57,910
in their proposals that were covered in

929
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:59,859
here as impediments to deployment if you

930
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:03,160
look at if you look at the dip from zero

931
00:43:59,859 --> 00:44:05,290
three you'll see a lot of changes in

932
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,129
section two but that's those are mostly

933
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:11,470
formatting changes I was mostly adding

934
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:13,660
anchors to allow cross refs from other

935
00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:14,290
parts of the document so you see a lot

936
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:19,000
of deaths

937
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:21,520
but not very much change text there's a

938
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:23,589
new section called section three this

939
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,329
was the so this is summarizing the

940
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:30,339
discussion we had at IETF 105 and so

941
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:35,050
that summarized summary is on the next

942
00:44:30,339 --> 00:44:37,720
slide if you have comments on that let's

943
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:38,819
not wordsmith this as a group and the

944
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,980
last session on Friday

945
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:45,579
now afternoon but please send feedback

946
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:47,440
on the list or get a pull request and I

947
00:44:45,579 --> 00:44:50,440
I was really happy about the editors

948
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:57,339
affiliation change but but maybe nobody

949
00:44:50,440 --> 00:45:01,480
else cares but I cared so I asked thrown

950
00:44:57,339 --> 00:45:03,759
question in ITF 105 but it turns out

951
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:05,619
that the question that I asked didn't

952
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,079
change the answer very much I don't

953
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:10,329
think well I should have asked was do we

954
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,089
understand this lesson enough well

955
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:16,329
enough for people who think about this

956
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:18,430
lesson to assess risk if the answer is

957
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,720
yes we're talking about engineering if

958
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:22,390
we're talking about no it's still

959
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:26,410
research I think that's the question we

960
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:28,480
actually talked about at ITF 105 so the

961
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:29,470
good news is that the research group

962
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,770
ignored

963
00:45:29,470 --> 00:45:35,618
Spencer's question and talked that's

964
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:37,619
always the right thing to do of the the

965
00:45:35,619 --> 00:45:41,050
lessons that are summarized in the draft

966
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:43,180
there are two of them that I don't think

967
00:45:41,050 --> 00:45:46,779
based on the discussion we had at IETF

968
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,939
105 we unders we understand these well

969
00:45:46,779 --> 00:45:51,219
well enough for people to assess risk

970
00:45:48,939 --> 00:45:53,890
one of them is endpoints trusting in

971
00:45:51,219 --> 00:45:57,189
intermediate devices one is intermediate

972
00:45:53,890 --> 00:46:00,578
devices trusting endpoints and for these

973
00:45:57,189 --> 00:46:03,928
two lessons Spencer thinks we need to

974
00:46:00,579 --> 00:46:06,459
revisit the internet threat model and

975
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:09,759
note that the IAB has an active

976
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:12,249
discussion on this on the Model T

977
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:13,979
mailing list and if you click on that in

978
00:46:12,249 --> 00:46:17,979
the slides you get the mailing list

979
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:20,979
signup thing yari

980
00:46:17,979 --> 00:46:22,899
Arco who is one of the document authors

981
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:25,658
that of that I think the current

982
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:27,189
combined draft but not you know it's

983
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:28,809
still an individual draft it hasn't been

984
00:46:27,189 --> 00:46:31,928
adopted by the IEP

985
00:46:28,809 --> 00:46:34,539
yari says that that that work is really

986
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:37,900
you know they're not finished they're

987
00:46:34,539 --> 00:46:40,059
beginning so given that the IAB is

988
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,390
talking about that you know the asking

989
00:46:40,059 --> 00:46:44,829
the community to talk about the larger

990
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:50,640
question I'm not quite sure what we can

991
00:46:44,829 --> 00:46:54,489
say as PRG so I'll stop there and let

992
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,158
both both Theresa and and probably

993
00:46:54,489 --> 00:46:58,989
explain to me equal I should have said

994
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:02,380
today no I think you asked the right

995
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:05,140
question o5 but this question is kind of

996
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:07,239
related and more specific so if you

997
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:09,819
define risk as just like the Trust's

998
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:11,679
sort of but we had a lot of things about

999
00:47:09,819 --> 00:47:14,499
that deployment is it gonna get deployed

1000
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,989
and so on and I think I think asking the

1001
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:19,238
broader question is absolutely fine

1002
00:47:16,989 --> 00:47:20,890
about a sweat model yes this is really

1003
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,779
interesting and we should follow it I'm

1004
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:25,989
not sure like what we can contribute to

1005
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:28,659
it maybe we can sort of give our or

1006
00:47:25,989 --> 00:47:31,239
angle our questions about like what does

1007
00:47:28,659 --> 00:47:34,299
trust mean in our context and maybe that

1008
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:40,719
can help inform those discussions thank

1009
00:47:34,299 --> 00:47:43,569
you hi Brian Cromwell speaking as an

1010
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,669
individual as the editor of the

1011
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,900
questions talk I'll plan out that your

1012
00:47:45,669 --> 00:47:48,069
two questions there question number two

1013
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,009
and question number three and the

1014
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:52,299
questions talk but expanded so the

1015
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:54,039
questions arc was basically looking at

1016
00:47:52,299 --> 00:47:55,239
you know this endpoint trusting the

1017
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,919
intermediate device how can you get

1018
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:58,689
trustworthy path properties to you and

1019
00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:00,220
intermediate Rises trusting endpoints

1020
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:04,118
these are sort of a superclass

1021
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,439
questions there I think I mainly wanted

1022
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:09,280
to come up and encourage people in this

1023
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:12,640
room who have ideas in this space to go

1024
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,760
and participate on the Model T list in

1025
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:17,319
the IB because that the there was just a

1026
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,930
message this morning on that list where

1027
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:22,180
basically they're there the sense of the

1028
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:25,810
room they had a meeting at 7:30 in the

1029
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:29,259
morning on Tuesday and still managed to

1030
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,700
get a lot of work done the this into the

1031
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:33,640
room there was that a lot of this stuff

1032
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,899
needs to be moved into the IETF sooner

1033
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,819
rather than later I don't know if that

1034
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,300
means that there's gonna be traps that

1035
00:48:36,819 --> 00:48:42,430
turn into a ball or what but since a lot

1036
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,660
of this is going to update the internet

1037
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:45,520
threat model which is the security

1038
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:47,049
considerations like guidelines for

1039
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,119
writing security considerations is that

1040
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:53,710
the RFC that they need to update or

1041
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:56,410
obsolete in order to do that um the

1042
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:58,060
wider questions about this end point

1043
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:00,700
intermediate device trust and intervene

1044
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:03,460
device endpoint trust should be

1045
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:05,649
addressed as part of that effort having

1046
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:09,700
spent five years of effort on that

1047
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:12,450
question I am it's Friday and I'm not

1048
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:15,189
gonna go down a rabbit hole of cynicism

1049
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:17,049
but I mean there's work to do there and

1050
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:18,849
explicitly reason that I wanted to frame

1051
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:22,359
the questions in the questions draft

1052
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:24,579
much more in a much tighter scope with

1053
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,900
respect to like these properties was to

1054
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:27,790
see if there was a way to frame that

1055
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,920
question in order to make progress on it

1056
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:33,210
and maybe I should take take the

1057
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,740
questions draft to the Model T people

1058
00:49:33,210 --> 00:49:38,890
I'm not sure I'll think about it

1059
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:42,848
yeah but like any be this this is this

1060
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:46,270
is kind of the this is the spin bit in

1061
00:49:42,849 --> 00:49:47,140
the room rate that you know this is the

1062
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,240
question that we've been we've been

1063
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,319
we've been working on pretty hard for a

1064
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,060
while people who have ideas in this

1065
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,730
space should take it to Model T thank

1066
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:56,349
you yeah and like I said I think quote

1067
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,480
that you know what we've been trying to

1068
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:06,520
do in here in all of our work has been

1069
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:08,980
to inform research in and outside the

1070
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,440
work that the research group and inform

1071
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,730
engineering which is obviously outside

1072
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:14,440
the research group hi Colin

1073
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,930
hi

1074
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,589
my name is Colin Perkins um I think if

1075
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:22,569
there are things individuals

1076
00:50:19,589 --> 00:50:24,790
participating here wish to provide as

1077
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:25,990
input to the Model T list as individuals

1078
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:33,970
I think that would be a very useful

1079
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:37,569
exercise I think this we should

1080
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:39,459
distinguish from revisiting the internet

1081
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:42,040
for its model that the standards

1082
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:45,579
community uses to frame their standards

1083
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:48,250
and doing research which thinks about

1084
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:49,359
some of the threats related to this and

1085
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,280
I think there's nothing stopping is

1086
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,740
doing research about perfo where

1087
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,660
networking and how its effects end

1088
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:59,020
points and so on provided this group is

1089
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,680
not trying to directly drive water so

1090
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:01,930
yeah

1091
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,089
that don't stop thinking about these

1092
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:05,980
issues but separate the research

1093
00:51:04,089 --> 00:51:09,160
questions from the standards process

1094
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:14,260
questions right so this is this is the

1095
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:16,660
retrospective on engineering draft that

1096
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:18,460
I'm talking about here it's so if I

1097
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,310
understood what your we are saying there

1098
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,260
is that we should do we can do research

1099
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:27,339
in that space but not necessarily as

1100
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:28,540
part of the retrospective draft do you

1101
00:51:27,339 --> 00:51:31,569
see what I'm you see what I'm saying

1102
00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:32,859
did we oh we're talking we're talking

1103
00:51:31,569 --> 00:51:35,230
about moving forward and that won't

1104
00:51:32,859 --> 00:51:38,740
happen in the what not to do draft I

1105
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:40,119
think right right I mean this this group

1106
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,939
has produced a graph that says we

1107
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:46,839
believe these things are problematic

1108
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:49,450
yeah and that that will be published and

1109
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:52,000
sure yeah I don't think this group

1110
00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:54,098
should be trying to influence what the

1111
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,680
standards process is doing and how this

1112
00:51:54,099 --> 00:51:59,530
the IETF community defines its threat

1113
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,720
model if people from this group wish to

1114
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:03,670
participate as individuals in that swell

1115
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,649
I mean it's an open process anyone can

1116
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:08,380
participate sure that's not an input

1117
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:10,750
from the IRT F to that process but I

1118
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:13,000
mean this group can't separately look at

1119
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:15,670
issues related to it provided it isn't

1120
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,250
directly trying to change what the ITF

1121
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:19,839
considers this process sure yeah they

1122
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:21,960
can't the end thank you for helping me

1123
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,759
with that

1124
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,719
let's hurt occur I say I think in the

1125
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:30,719
ITF we get too hung up on

1126
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:32,429
this document is this work is not

1127
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,799
complete until it's published and we

1128
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:37,349
can't publish it until X and then X is

1129
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:39,659
blocking Y and the reality is is that

1130
00:52:37,349 --> 00:52:41,549
for things like you know the it's work

1131
00:52:39,659 --> 00:52:43,439
going on here and we're going on in

1132
00:52:41,549 --> 00:52:44,909
Model T a hopefully there's a lot of

1133
00:52:43,439 --> 00:52:47,729
overlap and people will contribute but

1134
00:52:44,909 --> 00:52:50,489
be both groups will end up feeding

1135
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:52,589
information to to each other and and

1136
00:52:50,489 --> 00:52:53,909
sure absolutely you've got to continue

1137
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:55,979
working because hopefully you'll

1138
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:57,569
influence the Model T group regardless

1139
00:52:55,979 --> 00:53:00,658
of whether it's published with a number

1140
00:52:57,569 --> 00:53:02,429
at the end of it or or a ID with a

1141
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:04,649
number at the end of it to continue just

1142
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:08,089
driving the work forward and both groups

1143
00:53:04,649 --> 00:53:11,549
will feed each other right thank you

1144
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:15,089
so my proposed stick next steps were

1145
00:53:11,549 --> 00:53:19,009
basically to do a largely editorial

1146
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:21,919
revision to fix up the phrasing around

1147
00:53:19,009 --> 00:53:25,739
the question I should have asked at 105

1148
00:53:21,919 --> 00:53:28,618
and do a research group last call on 0 5

1149
00:53:25,739 --> 00:53:31,529
resolve issues raised during class call

1150
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:34,019
and request publication as an IRT have

1151
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:37,049
stream informational draft and then

1152
00:53:34,019 --> 00:53:44,069
begin informing proposals inside and

1153
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:47,159
outside the research group and so like I

1154
00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:51,049
say my last slide was going to be maybe

1155
00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:53,880
time for this bird to leave the nest and

1156
00:53:51,049 --> 00:53:56,369
please discuss and I'll go ahead and

1157
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:01,979
leave the proposed snag the next steps

1158
00:53:56,369 --> 00:54:04,799
up if anybody runs for the microphone we

1159
00:54:01,979 --> 00:54:06,989
have two minutes so yeah we can have a

1160
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:08,939
couple of comments I'm in favor of

1161
00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:14,459
research group last call and I'm willing

1162
00:54:08,939 --> 00:54:16,408
to with you today hood thank you so one

1163
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:22,408
are you still Teresa are you the girl

1164
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:27,479
with the hair so quick question from the

1165
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:30,359
chair my perception watching this

1166
00:54:27,479 --> 00:54:32,939
document evolve over time is that the

1167
00:54:30,359 --> 00:54:35,189
velocity is going down right is your

1168
00:54:32,939 --> 00:54:36,569
like in terms of like changes to it and

1169
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,819
like things that we're adding to it it's

1170
00:54:36,569 --> 00:54:41,038
like there was sort of this explosion of

1171
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:44,009
effort and now it's sort of

1172
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:46,499
is there anything that could be gained

1173
00:54:44,009 --> 00:54:47,669
by keeping it open it looks to me like

1174
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:51,959
it's slowing down is that your

1175
00:54:47,669 --> 00:54:54,029
perception as well well so so it makes a

1176
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:57,209
difference what's moving in as well as

1177
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:59,400
how fast what-what was moving was the

1178
00:54:57,209 --> 00:55:01,169
contributions and that's what you're

1179
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,449
remembering where it's like oh the first

1180
00:55:01,169 --> 00:55:05,640
few times I did this it's like well we

1181
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:09,329
at you know we added we added material

1182
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,729
on we had we at you know we added

1183
00:55:09,329 --> 00:55:13,469
material on diffserv or you know

1184
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:15,359
whatever you know whatever it was

1185
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:19,189
so the sections of the contributions

1186
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,089
which are in section 5 now I think

1187
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:23,428
because those section numbers keep

1188
00:55:21,089 --> 00:55:26,069
changing but the contributions that are

1189
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:28,880
there we kept adding those what has been

1190
00:55:26,069 --> 00:55:30,900
changing and I don't know that the I

1191
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,509
don't know that the word came out of the

1192
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:35,759
changes have been and quite trailing off

1193
00:55:33,509 --> 00:55:37,140
but what it's been changing has been

1194
00:55:35,759 --> 00:55:40,380
that we've been more adding more and

1195
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:41,969
more text that were summarizing the

1196
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:44,279
contributions and the lessons learned

1197
00:55:41,969 --> 00:55:45,900
from those contributions we haven't

1198
00:55:44,279 --> 00:55:48,479
edited we haven't added any

1199
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:51,089
contributions and a couple ITF cycles

1200
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:53,698
and we haven't added any lessons and a

1201
00:55:51,089 --> 00:55:56,249
couple of ITF cycles so I think we may

1202
00:55:53,699 --> 00:55:57,659
be at the point where I think we may be

1203
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:59,999
to the point where it's more important

1204
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:02,809
for people to read this outside the

1205
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:07,618
research group than it is for us to

1206
00:56:02,809 --> 00:56:09,059
continue to improve it okay thanks so I

1207
00:56:07,619 --> 00:56:10,949
guess yeah we'll wait for the next

1208
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:13,349
revision and then we'll start our Josie

1209
00:56:10,949 --> 00:56:17,759
that works for you all thank you very

1210
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:20,459
much it really turns out to be critical

1211
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:22,769
to attend the Pecha Kucha talks because

1212
00:56:20,459 --> 00:56:25,379
we keep using words from last night like

1213
00:56:22,769 --> 00:56:26,968
yeah we're spin bidding this or we're

1214
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,259
going down the rabbit hole or you know

1215
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:29,969
things like that that we're discussed

1216
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:33,659
there that's turned out to be a really

1217
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:37,019
key part of the ITF week if those videos

1218
00:56:33,659 --> 00:56:40,769
will be available soon right Aaron not

1219
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:44,968
an official ATF activity but it's almost

1220
00:56:40,769 --> 00:56:46,468
official ATF terminology now right it's

1221
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:48,780
a working group forming not official

1222
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:55,080
activity

1223
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:55,080
okay guru Bob you're next

1224
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:21,340
so so there is a gory first and this is

1225
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:22,839
Bob and you know it just before the

1226
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,660
Pecha Kucha didn't make them the best

1227
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:27,880
set of slides but mostly stuffing is

1228
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:29,920
actually okay and I think I think we're

1229
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:34,540
ready to talk about this aren't we the

1230
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:38,050
title is MTU is hard getting packets

1231
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:43,540
bigger bigger packets don't simply get

1232
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:46,150
there I mean Bert right

1233
00:57:43,540 --> 00:57:48,820
we start with an application it sends

1234
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:50,860
some data and we have a notion of how

1235
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:54,160
big a piece of data we concerned in TCP

1236
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:55,600
that's MSS it reads Mike's Datagram lots

1237
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,640
of different words are used here and

1238
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:59,740
then the transport has some notion of

1239
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,420
Kohan which you can send and the network

1240
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:03,250
layers got a notion of how bigger packet

1241
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,440
is and in fact it's got more than one

1242
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:07,660
notion because it's got a size of

1243
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,700
actually the subnet it's using and the

1244
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:11,799
size it thinks he's using and the

1245
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,839
interface size there's lots of things

1246
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,610
going on here it's not just as easy as

1247
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:18,310
sending a big packet down a pipe and it

1248
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:20,280
comes out on the on the network are you

1249
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:23,830
going to interpret at some point Bob oh

1250
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:26,980
okay but the solution to this is great

1251
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:28,660
we did it years and years ago and we

1252
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:30,370
take big piece we MIT and smaller in the

1253
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,879
network and they come out big at the end

1254
00:58:30,370 --> 00:58:37,960
because you reassemble them read RFC 791

1255
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:40,630
you figure out how it all works and then

1256
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:42,180
we discovered and in 1987 so this is

1257
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:44,080
kind of relatively recently

1258
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:45,580
fragmentation was a harmful thing to do

1259
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,890
because when you brick pack it up into

1260
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,299
lots of pieces they don't all arrive in

1261
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:50,350
the same order and what happens if one

1262
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:51,460
of them doesn't get there and what I

1263
00:58:50,350 --> 00:58:55,240
don't see if you get bits of ones that

1264
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:57,460
you didn't actually send and yeah it's

1265
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:59,740
not possible to kind of do this so what

1266
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:01,720
we want to do is get the network to tell

1267
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:04,240
you how big a packet to send

1268
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:06,098
isn't that was signal if I can just add

1269
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:09,759
and it's only getting worse from them

1270
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:11,349
so with all the new kinds of boxes in

1271
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:13,990
the middle that decide they know better

1272
00:59:11,349 --> 00:59:15,849
than the end so it's yeah fragmentation

1273
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:18,368
has gotten worse than it was at the

1274
00:59:15,849 --> 00:59:20,320
beginning yeah and there's some helpful

1275
00:59:18,369 --> 00:59:22,060
boxes that don't leave the RFC's and

1276
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:24,130
tries to put packets together or try and

1277
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:27,009
do other helpful things for you so I'm

1278
00:59:24,130 --> 00:59:29,859
pregnant subproblems right save the day

1279
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:31,270
let's not really do fragments let's just

1280
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:33,220
tell them that work if you can't send a

1281
00:59:31,270 --> 00:59:35,650
big packet send a signal back for your

1282
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:38,109
path and will will tell you how big of

1283
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:41,800
packet to send it's all very great and

1284
00:59:38,109 --> 00:59:43,420
good it was done in 1919 1191 the

1285
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:46,030
transport simply gets a signal from the

1286
00:59:43,420 --> 00:59:53,890
path saying here's how big a packet you

1287
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:56,109
should send that was a good idea yeah

1288
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:59,710
except that wasn't such a good idea to

1289
00:59:56,109 --> 01:00:02,859
do ICMP messages was it Bob well again I

1290
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:05,320
think it was a fine idea but the there's

1291
01:00:02,859 --> 01:00:08,440
a lot of boxes decided not to send them

1292
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:09,849
or filter at them out or in theory there

1293
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,320
were even some boxes that didn't

1294
01:00:09,849 --> 01:00:15,160
actually have a route back to the source

1295
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,630
which surprised me and this is because

1296
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:18,879
these people building paths actually

1297
01:00:16,630 --> 01:00:20,650
built two paths one went this way one

1298
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:22,660
went that way so if something went wrong

1299
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:24,130
in the forward direction the ICMP

1300
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,049
message can come back because there's no

1301
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:28,300
we're getting back on that path so we

1302
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,930
don't think paths that is not as easy as

1303
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:33,790
you think

1304
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:35,919
and yeah and it was subtly tricky to

1305
01:00:33,790 --> 01:00:38,859
implant in TCP as well because of the

1306
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,270
MSS thing and what TCP decided to do was

1307
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:42,759
simply decide at the beginning

1308
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:45,369
hey how big a packet can you send and

1309
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,920
the boxes in the middle on the path read

1310
01:00:45,369 --> 01:00:49,420
the MSS value and they change it to

1311
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,859
reduce it to the correct size it should

1312
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:53,349
have been sent to because obviously

1313
01:00:50,859 --> 01:00:55,330
they're not better than the endpoint so

1314
01:00:53,349 --> 01:00:57,220
what the endpoint learns is I can only

1315
01:00:55,330 --> 01:01:00,009
use this size across the network path

1316
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,930
it's called MSS clamping widely deployed

1317
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:03,970
great technology it's what makes the

1318
01:01:01,930 --> 01:01:06,819
network work with TCP so that's really

1319
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:08,470
good it's not an IETF way of doing it

1320
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:11,859
but it's the way it works currently and

1321
01:01:08,470 --> 01:01:15,120
sadly this is where we got to but

1322
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:17,830
there's more and oh yeah and

1323
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:20,140
some people think fragmentation is still

1324
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:21,730
harmful after we've done all this and we

1325
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:25,420
have to think about it because ipv6

1326
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:27,850
hopefully has fragmentation but but of

1327
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,830
course we made it so the routers in the

1328
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:31,360
middle didn't do it only the endpoints

1329
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:32,950
which we thought was better and we

1330
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:38,320
thought it would help discourage the use

1331
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:40,180
of fragmentation but apparently not so

1332
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:42,160
so we have this document and it's and

1333
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:46,000
with the RSC editors so now it's going

1334
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,379
to be BCP sometime this year oh wait

1335
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,790
wait wait wait wait hey wait wait wait I

1336
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:51,610
don't wanna go that I can I get that

1337
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:52,680
fast and where did I get to back here

1338
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:59,200
yeah

1339
01:01:52,680 --> 01:02:01,779
so resetting um if ICMP was harmful then

1340
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:05,740
maybe the transport shouldn't really

1341
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:14,040
rely upon ICMP so back in a while ago we

1342
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:16,600
invented P ah if we take what we got -

1343
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,590
yeah yeah yeah right right that's fine

1344
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,380
yeah

1345
01:02:17,590 --> 01:02:23,500
missing one slide there didn't show the

1346
01:02:20,380 --> 01:02:25,990
slider is we invented something else but

1347
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:28,570
we'll come back to that if ICMP was was

1348
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:33,339
harmful and it was harmful in various

1349
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:34,780
ways one way was we do see some ICMP

1350
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,700
messages that contain just the wrong

1351
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,230
information these horrible people

1352
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:40,270
building Reuters actually might to get

1353
01:02:38,230 --> 01:02:42,220
some cord wrong I think some learner

1354
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,330
little-endian versus big-endian are the

1355
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:45,790
number you get back he's kind of just

1356
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:47,860
swapped yo so you get kind of like a bit

1357
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:50,560
of wrong advice that's just awkward

1358
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:51,880
that's not really the big problem with

1359
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:54,880
the signal big problem with the signal

1360
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:58,180
is when these handing network layer

1361
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,000
people designed path MTU discovery they

1362
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:03,100
thought this was a great signal and they

1363
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,050
didn't know how to check whether it was

1364
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,299
a signal from somebody who actually saw

1365
01:03:05,050 --> 01:03:08,860
your packets on your path or whether it

1366
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:10,210
is somewhat helpful somewhere else in

1367
01:03:08,860 --> 01:03:13,510
the exact he was just telling you to use

1368
01:03:10,210 --> 01:03:16,030
a certain packet size other time that

1369
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:22,660
wasn't really a big issue no we call it

1370
01:03:16,030 --> 01:03:25,090
like a dosa Tyco any network signal

1371
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:29,319
useful network signal can be abused I

1372
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:32,680
guess answer you have to have a way to

1373
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,240
and so you can find out he's got an

1374
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:35,919
encapsulated packet maybe we should have

1375
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,479
always checked that and checked it

1376
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:39,520
actually match the floor we were trying

1377
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,680
to send at the transport so we can do it

1378
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:44,470
that's great and if we have it then

1379
01:03:41,680 --> 01:03:47,319
maybe the ICMP message are a little bit

1380
01:03:44,470 --> 01:03:49,919
useful maybe they're hints useful advice

1381
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:52,240
from the network about what to do

1382
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,160
maybe the transport layer can use this

1383
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:56,680
to check to see whether the network path

1384
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,569
actually supports it and if it does hey

1385
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:01,089
that's a great idea we get to the right

1386
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,680
value very quickly and if the transport

1387
01:04:01,090 --> 01:04:04,810
layer finds it doesn't work then it

1388
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,700
doesn't say the ICMP message must have

1389
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,620
been right and I'm wrong it simply says

1390
01:04:06,700 --> 01:04:12,009
that size doesn't work I would choose a

1391
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:13,569
different size so we can go quite a long

1392
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:18,280
way with this this is quite a good way

1393
01:04:13,570 --> 01:04:24,120
of doing things and and it's the way

1394
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:27,130
that PLP and tud now saves the day PLP

1395
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:28,810
path packetization layer path MTU

1396
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:31,390
discovery puts the problem at the

1397
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:33,960
transport layer and it takes signals in

1398
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:38,020
from these probes decide what to do

1399
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:41,590
HP and implemented in SCTP it's it's in

1400
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:44,680
the quick spec and there's a spec with

1401
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:46,630
the iesg on how to do it was done it was

1402
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:49,000
a other ways of doing this this is now a

1403
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:53,260
general method and I think the working

1404
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:55,150
transport TS vwg at the bottom is going

1405
01:04:53,260 --> 01:04:56,440
to be published next year prediction i

1406
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:58,750
don't know when things really get

1407
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:01,810
published but this is a mechanism that's

1408
01:04:58,750 --> 01:05:03,580
kind of robust and works well it tastes

1409
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:07,029
pass signals and does useful things with

1410
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:09,160
them and you can use ICMP messages

1411
01:05:07,030 --> 01:05:12,640
optionally to help you find about the

1412
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:17,830
path hmm maybe you can use other signals

1413
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:19,330
and maybe extension headers yeah we can

1414
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:21,549
go on an extension headers model and

1415
01:05:19,330 --> 01:05:24,340
extension headers something proposing

1416
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,960
ipv6 don't work across all paths pretty

1417
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,960
start actually a problem you can get

1418
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,030
path information there's just hints just

1419
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:32,530
useful stuff so if it works in some

1420
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:34,690
place and tells you something useful

1421
01:05:32,530 --> 01:05:36,430
that you can use it so there's an

1422
01:05:34,690 --> 01:05:38,770
interesting thing maybe past signals

1423
01:05:36,430 --> 01:05:40,720
don't have to be accurate they just have

1424
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:42,460
to be good advice or there you can probe

1425
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:45,578
and check they work

1426
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:48,700
are we going forward there we go so next

1427
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:51,250
thing how much of this is real in future

1428
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:53,859
well the first thing is how big a packet

1429
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:56,950
can we actually send and don't really

1430
01:05:53,859 --> 01:05:58,690
know operators being deploying rooters

1431
01:05:56,950 --> 01:06:00,819
and switches I support big packets in

1432
01:05:58,690 --> 01:06:03,040
many parts of the internet many people

1433
01:06:00,819 --> 01:06:06,819
at home can't send big packets what's

1434
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:08,890
the real state of play which parts the

1435
01:06:06,819 --> 01:06:11,200
Internet do what I mean we don't

1436
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:12,879
actually know if you know just come and

1437
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:15,848
tell me and I don't have to this talk

1438
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,790
again if not I'm going to try and start

1439
01:06:15,849 --> 01:06:20,349
measuring this the other thing is how

1440
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:22,540
about extension headers we know they

1441
01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:26,020
don't reliably work we've got lots of

1442
01:06:22,540 --> 01:06:27,910
evidence that some people drop them what

1443
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,650
about those people who forward them

1444
01:06:27,910 --> 01:06:31,328
where can they be forwarded how much can

1445
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,980
we use them for something useful this is

1446
01:06:31,329 --> 01:06:35,200
why Bob's here because Bob and I have a

1447
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:37,300
nice draft that says let's use a hop by

1448
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,759
hop extension header to figure out the

1449
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,109
MTU of the path if we get it we have a

1450
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,480
hint we have a great piece of

1451
01:06:41,109 --> 01:06:46,328
information if we don't well it doesn't

1452
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:48,339
matter we will carry on doing the PLP

1453
01:06:46,329 --> 01:06:51,849
and tud algorithm and find a way

1454
01:06:48,339 --> 01:06:53,710
ourselves so this is good um I'm

1455
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:56,260
promoting a couple of tools we're using

1456
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:58,720
path spider is a measurement tool for

1457
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:01,000
testing lots of different hosts

1458
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:02,799
different paths through the network and

1459
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,440
gathering some big mapping of what is

1460
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:08,109
actually done that's quite useful in

1461
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:09,670
this and we want that data we also have

1462
01:07:08,109 --> 01:07:11,500
another tool called path trace which

1463
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:13,480
takes a particular path or tries to

1464
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,430
figure out where on the path something

1465
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,799
happens that changes the packets or the

1466
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:20,140
forwarding behavior if we use these

1467
01:07:17,799 --> 01:07:21,790
tools together we can map the entire of

1468
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:24,009
the Internet and figure out whether

1469
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:26,500
everybody's house will support all these

1470
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:27,760
mechanisms and we can't do that we'll

1471
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:30,160
have to do a smaller measurement

1472
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,660
campaign alas but we'll try and make it

1473
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,520
a big one and try and give some real

1474
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:35,980
data I like the idea of doing

1475
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:39,790
measurements now and we did some

1476
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:41,710
measurements already and yannick do you

1477
01:07:39,790 --> 01:07:45,640
want to and say which one was your probe

1478
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:47,500
my probe was the one in Aberdeen yeah

1479
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,930
and I live in Palo Alto so I think you

1480
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:54,160
can guess which air mine and we're

1481
01:07:49,930 --> 01:07:56,290
trying to figure out why my you know my

1482
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:58,839
measured results for hop-by-hop

1483
01:07:56,290 --> 01:08:02,290
zero percent so if we have two guesses

1484
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:05,500
either the ISP or my actual home router

1485
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:08,920
but though we'll see what we find out

1486
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:10,510
but this is real data and this is why

1487
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:11,710
you need two types of tool wanted to

1488
01:08:10,510 --> 01:08:13,390
figure out what's going along the path

1489
01:08:11,710 --> 01:08:15,370
from want to just do the mapping

1490
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:17,049
exercise we're going to work with some

1491
01:08:15,370 --> 01:08:19,269
people and figure out why these answers

1492
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:20,439
are here so do not take this as a

1493
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:23,620
measurement of what the internet

1494
01:08:20,439 --> 01:08:25,450
supports take it as an indication that

1495
01:08:23,620 --> 01:08:27,790
we can do good work in this space and

1496
01:08:25,450 --> 01:08:29,439
it's not hopeless there are places where

1497
01:08:27,790 --> 01:08:32,430
you can even use hop by hop options to

1498
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:34,960
find out useful stuff could be cool and

1499
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:36,970
this is a some reason tip we want to

1500
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,420
deploy more probes and you're not there

1501
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:41,470
was only like three columns here and

1502
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:43,180
talk to us if you like these

1503
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:45,130
measurements talk to us if you want to

1504
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:47,350
measure paths we're talking just about

1505
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:49,120
sending bigger packets once we have the

1506
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:51,010
probes we can test other things that

1507
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,390
happen on paths and we are really

1508
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,970
passionate about trying to measure these

1509
01:08:52,390 --> 01:08:56,350
other things but you do have to have

1510
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:59,230
some prerequisites to join our

1511
01:08:56,350 --> 01:09:02,440
measurement activity either give us good

1512
01:08:59,229 --> 01:09:04,719
data which is always welcome or offered

1513
01:09:02,439 --> 01:09:06,490
to host a probe but have a big MTU

1514
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:09,630
support so we can probe for the empty

1515
01:09:06,490 --> 01:09:12,219
you another ipv6 support a preferably

1516
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:14,400
ipv6 extension header support so we can

1517
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:18,220
actually measure extension headers and

1518
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:20,469
summary and doing MTU is hard actually

1519
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:22,330
it's not hard just to find it is taking

1520
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:24,940
a long long time to get here

1521
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:27,460
the IETF has made lots of bad decisions

1522
01:09:24,939 --> 01:09:30,040
on the pathway we believe we're now

1523
01:09:27,460 --> 01:09:31,029
making the right decisions unfortunately

1524
01:09:30,040 --> 01:09:33,970
the other people probably thought that

1525
01:09:31,029 --> 01:09:35,950
too but yeah I think we are it's not a

1526
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,480
network problem unless you're talking

1527
01:09:35,950 --> 01:09:39,179
about tunnels in which case everything

1528
01:09:37,479 --> 01:09:42,279
is completely different sorry

1529
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:44,200
it is a transport problem unless you're

1530
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:46,839
talking about tunnels are the only thing

1531
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:49,380
you can trust is your own probes sent by

1532
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:51,850
your own endpoint to test your path but

1533
01:09:49,380 --> 01:09:53,830
you can get lots of helpful hints from

1534
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:56,440
other devices on the path to help you

1535
01:09:53,830 --> 01:10:01,000
know how to build those probes and I

1536
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:03,099
think that's where we're at right and I

1537
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,870
have a I have two of these probes in my

1538
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:07,330
house at the moment and I'm looking for

1539
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:10,030
another home in the San Francisco Bay

1540
01:10:07,330 --> 01:10:11,950
Area so if you have access to a data set

1541
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:14,230
that you know in the more in the middle

1542
01:10:11,950 --> 01:10:16,559
of the network please let me know we

1543
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:23,620
could meet naked give it you

1544
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:24,940
hi Colin Perkins um is can you I mean

1545
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:27,640
whether here or just to the mailing

1546
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:29,769
lists of summarize what you need to run

1547
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:31,600
one of these probes and if do you have

1548
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:35,520
an easy script to test if someone's

1549
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,520
network is suitable for running it

1550
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:50,530
possibly and let me think and I think

1551
01:10:43,060 --> 01:10:53,800
the question I think it's Friday yeah

1552
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:55,150
and we have a number of these crosses

1553
01:10:53,800 --> 01:10:56,800
and we are considering other ways of

1554
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,089
doing this experiment as well so if

1555
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,760
you're interested in the experiment just

1556
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:02,200
contact us I think please remind please

1557
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:04,180
actually using that out to the list as

1558
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,860
well I think you got a fair amount of

1559
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:08,020
people in this room and on that list

1560
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,910
that might be willing to help and yeah

1561
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,040
we request to the list that's what we'll

1562
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:14,410
do and then that will let you follow up

1563
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:21,130
in the way you need to yep sure so I

1564
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:23,860
mean is it like a custom hardware do we

1565
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,880
have a picture I did or did we I think

1566
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,639
we took the picture ID to the slide deck

1567
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,980
to slave on slide eight place it's a

1568
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:33,040
it's a small box that runs Linux and

1569
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:34,299
looks like a home router to run it as we

1570
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:36,070
currently have it we could run it as a

1571
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:39,220
VM because we know that some people want

1572
01:11:36,070 --> 01:11:40,450
to run it as a VM but there are

1573
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:41,470
different ways of measuring we might use

1574
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:43,720
different poles for different things

1575
01:11:41,470 --> 01:11:45,040
okay thank you tell us if you're

1576
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:51,640
interested we'll send an email to list

1577
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:56,470
ask you people thank you and I think

1578
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:59,710
you'll stay in the right it's not so

1579
01:11:56,470 --> 01:12:03,130
much fun without Bob it's really nice to

1580
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:04,870
have it like ipv6 network layer people

1581
01:12:03,130 --> 01:12:12,700
on transport people in the same box you

1582
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:14,680
see so um this is a different talk it's

1583
01:12:12,700 --> 01:12:16,110
maybe not quite as concrete and it talks

1584
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:22,379
about of his bit of history about

1585
01:12:16,110 --> 01:12:23,969
asymmetric path characteristics so

1586
01:12:22,379 --> 01:12:26,639
I've got to take you for a little bit of

1587
01:12:23,969 --> 01:12:29,280
view from TCP if you're less interested

1588
01:12:26,639 --> 01:12:31,979
in TCP or just in multimedia or even

1589
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,659
quick or something then there's a little

1590
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:41,219
bit of stuff later but let's learn about

1591
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:43,320
TCP and TCP connections have a use for

1592
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:45,209
two parts of the path they use data in

1593
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,219
the forward part of the path on other

1594
01:12:45,209 --> 01:12:50,129
control signaling and they receive acts

1595
01:12:47,219 --> 01:12:51,659
in the return part of the path and we

1596
01:12:50,129 --> 01:12:53,639
use these acts to control the speed at

1597
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:55,739
which the TCP sender works so they help

1598
01:12:53,639 --> 01:12:58,649
with the congestion control and the

1599
01:12:55,739 --> 01:13:02,159
basic rule is a TCP receiver sends an

1600
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:05,219
ACK for every two MSS of data read two

1601
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:07,228
packets that's more normal except not

1602
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:09,449
quite always we send it at every segment

1603
01:13:07,229 --> 01:13:12,449
to increase the Seawind at the beginning

1604
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:14,339
in some more or less randomly hard to

1605
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:17,820
express way but actually works quite

1606
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,949
well for just a little while and we also

1607
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,719
use them whenever there's a loss and to

1608
01:13:19,949 --> 01:13:25,469
make sure the loss information gets

1609
01:13:21,719 --> 01:13:27,959
through and then you have an asymmetric

1610
01:13:25,469 --> 01:13:29,369
path one path goes in one way or another

1611
01:13:27,959 --> 01:13:31,320
path comes in another way they might

1612
01:13:29,369 --> 01:13:34,049
actually just be on the same cable as

1613
01:13:31,320 --> 01:13:36,268
the two directions are different and the

1614
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:38,179
amount of acts you get back can

1615
01:13:36,269 --> 01:13:40,949
constrain the amount of data you send

1616
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:45,539
simple reason for this could be you have

1617
01:13:40,949 --> 01:13:47,009
much lower bitrate on one direction and

1618
01:13:45,539 --> 01:13:48,898
higher bitrate on the other direction

1619
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:50,550
the high bitrate link can't be used

1620
01:13:48,899 --> 01:13:54,599
because it fills up the return link with

1621
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:56,789
Ickes and TCP doesn't really know how to

1622
01:13:54,599 --> 01:13:59,729
deal with this there's there's bits of

1623
01:13:56,789 --> 01:14:01,530
pieces but most people have deployed

1624
01:13:59,729 --> 01:14:04,590
boxes on the path which is why it's

1625
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:06,959
interesting here that help you and the

1626
01:14:04,590 --> 01:14:08,699
first is an easy box you simply compress

1627
01:14:06,959 --> 01:14:10,979
the data because acts are quite

1628
01:14:08,699 --> 01:14:12,808
compressible usually you can press them

1629
01:14:10,979 --> 01:14:15,389
away using heavy to compression

1630
01:14:12,809 --> 01:14:17,340
rock does this works well used widely in

1631
01:14:15,389 --> 01:14:19,829
cellular environments helps a lot with

1632
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:23,849
this asymmetry problem you could deploy

1633
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:26,308
ax thinning RSC 34.9 again a little bit

1634
01:14:23,849 --> 01:14:28,679
of history and talks about act thinning

1635
01:14:26,309 --> 01:14:31,229
as a way of filtering the acts that are

1636
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:33,149
necessary acts accumulative you can get

1637
01:14:31,229 --> 01:14:34,979
rid of all the ones you don't need if

1638
01:14:33,149 --> 01:14:36,160
you're smart in the network and you

1639
01:14:34,979 --> 01:14:38,440
understand which

1640
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:40,840
which which acts are more valuable than

1641
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,849
which whether the AK is cumulative or

1642
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:45,370
reordered or whatever you could just

1643
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:48,970
filter them you could imagine some boxes

1644
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:50,769
are smarter than other boxes and some

1645
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,330
boxes are really smart because they use

1646
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:55,000
these methods called compacting

1647
01:14:52,330 --> 01:14:57,190
compounding and expanding which means

1648
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:59,530
that they regenerate the act clocking in

1649
01:14:57,190 --> 01:15:00,759
some way so actually when they remove

1650
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:04,179
the acts they kind of put them back

1651
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:06,460
again which all seen great stuff and

1652
01:15:04,180 --> 01:15:08,080
maybe doesn't fit today security model

1653
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:12,210
but they've seen as good stuff at the

1654
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:14,440
time and he's still widely done for TCP

1655
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,670
there's a mere more stray sitting at the

1656
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,349
bottom which is really cool if you're

1657
01:15:15,670 --> 01:15:19,690
doing measurements which is the acts

1658
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:21,970
first scheduling scheme which says that

1659
01:15:19,690 --> 01:15:23,650
acts are tiny bits of data so why don't

1660
01:15:21,970 --> 01:15:25,270
put them at the front of the queue so if

1661
01:15:23,650 --> 01:15:28,599
you have accent data then just shove all

1662
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:30,760
the acts to the front and if you think

1663
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,800
that's amusing then have a look at it if

1664
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:36,910
you don't understand the issues with

1665
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,290
that then think it's a problem but

1666
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:41,230
they're widely deployed these methods

1667
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:44,400
and they sit on the path they deal

1668
01:15:41,230 --> 01:15:49,019
primarily with differences in capacity

1669
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:51,129
capacity is a big issue always was and

1670
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,960
isn't actually the biggest issue the

1671
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:56,050
biggest issue is when you have a radio

1672
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:59,080
link if you have a radio link of any

1673
01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:01,960
type which kind of you know it's just

1674
01:15:59,080 --> 01:16:04,090
many types of links we actually find in

1675
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:06,760
the internet that it's not actually the

1676
01:16:04,090 --> 01:16:08,440
volume of debt that's the problem the

1677
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:09,970
problem is that when you transmit a

1678
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:11,710
packet you incur a certain amount of

1679
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:14,410
resource in actually sending it over the

1680
01:16:11,710 --> 01:16:16,360
radio link supporting use different

1681
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:18,760
technologies or different configurations

1682
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:21,400
on the return link to the uplink every

1683
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:24,280
AK you send consumes radio resource it

1684
01:16:21,400 --> 01:16:27,099
may be the total cost of a sending an

1685
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:29,860
IKE is the same as sending a data packet

1686
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:31,900
so you could spend two data packets you

1687
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:33,480
send one act packet two data packets one

1688
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:35,500
act packet this is kind of

1689
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:39,070
disproportionate using one third of your

1690
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:40,600
radio resource for sending acts mmm not

1691
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:42,429
good actually much worse than this

1692
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:44,770
because the radio link in the return

1693
01:16:42,430 --> 01:16:47,080
Direction is often contention based or

1694
01:16:44,770 --> 01:16:48,940
demand assignment might see a completely

1695
01:16:47,080 --> 01:16:51,519
different technology completely

1696
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:53,759
Radio characteristics it costs more to

1697
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,830
send accident just to send data often

1698
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:58,000
really TCP doesn't know about all this

1699
01:16:56,830 --> 01:17:02,019
mean

1700
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:04,000
and so people deployed act thinning and

1701
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:06,100
other methods to solve this and they

1702
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:08,230
reduced the a crate rather than the arc

1703
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,719
volume in this case and it really has a

1704
01:17:08,230 --> 01:17:12,730
big effect on your system design that

1705
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:15,010
doesn't mean your network runs faster or

1706
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:17,019
slower because of this what it affects

1707
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:19,210
is the bottom-line cost for the person

1708
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:21,580
providing the network so if you're the

1709
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:23,620
radio operator the ISP you have a cost

1710
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:25,390
and this reduces your cost which

1711
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:27,370
probably reduces subscription costs for

1712
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:30,340
the service so there is a round effect

1713
01:17:27,370 --> 01:17:32,860
it does affect the user okay all the

1714
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:35,050
background done and this is what TCP

1715
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:36,610
does here's do you lay back after slow

1716
01:17:35,050 --> 01:17:38,710
start if you want to pretty slide of it

1717
01:17:36,610 --> 01:17:41,620
you start sending lots of acts thing you

1718
01:17:38,710 --> 01:17:44,290
send less acts and it works this is real

1719
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:47,650
plot and next slide

1720
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:49,030
and what about quick aha quick and we

1721
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:51,309
should think about quick because quick

1722
01:17:49,030 --> 01:17:53,290
let's take a different security model if

1723
01:17:51,310 --> 01:17:55,300
you were smart you would realize that

1724
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:58,180
all this great stuff that's in keeping

1725
01:17:55,300 --> 01:18:02,170
the internet afloat for years no longer

1726
01:17:58,180 --> 01:18:04,060
works well okay so we have the same path

1727
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:06,430
but the path is different because we use

1728
01:18:04,060 --> 01:18:10,090
quicken we encrypt the acts and the data

1729
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:12,190
packets was quick trying to do it tries

1730
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:15,239
to send according to the current spec

1731
01:18:12,190 --> 01:18:17,980
and Ike every two packets it mimics TCP

1732
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:20,739
so actually it's just in how did the

1733
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:22,629
same problem as TCP and he's got an act

1734
01:18:20,739 --> 01:18:26,739
delay interval it's slightly better

1735
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:28,300
because and if you've got a they lost

1736
01:18:26,739 --> 01:18:29,650
then he only acts for a little bit of

1737
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:31,870
time and then it realizes you don't have

1738
01:18:29,650 --> 01:18:33,580
to send acts continuously I didn't need

1739
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:36,580
to use delay that's after saw start

1740
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:38,290
because that was a TCP thing but the

1741
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:41,680
basic thing is you can't use any of

1742
01:18:38,290 --> 01:18:44,050
these performance enhancing devices on

1743
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:46,239
your path even though they might have

1744
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:50,710
been really simple radio layer stuff

1745
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:52,360
they still don't work with this so what

1746
01:18:50,710 --> 01:18:55,239
is TC what does it look like when you

1747
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:57,429
use quick and real measurements from

1748
01:18:55,239 --> 01:18:59,379
various quick stacks sure they implement

1749
01:18:57,429 --> 01:19:01,870
the spec yeah they're implementing the

1750
01:18:59,380 --> 01:19:02,769
ITF spec that's great so they do I carry

1751
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:05,469
two packets

1752
01:19:02,769 --> 01:19:09,309
and how much volume updates they sent oh

1753
01:19:05,469 --> 01:19:11,590
it's actually worse in the measurements

1754
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:14,170
we've done this is a 10 megabyte down

1755
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:15,820
Lord yes it is Aksum bytes for those

1756
01:19:14,170 --> 01:19:18,280
people who saw his presentation I forgot

1757
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:20,980
to the vertical column for the total

1758
01:19:18,280 --> 01:19:24,670
aggregate of traffic quick sent twice as

1759
01:19:20,980 --> 01:19:28,239
many bytes as TCP so it's the protocol

1760
01:19:24,670 --> 01:19:30,849
itself needs less Cemetery in other

1761
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:32,829
words the ACT traffic more impacts quick

1762
01:19:30,849 --> 01:19:34,539
than it did for TCP paths that are

1763
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:38,409
asymmetric will have bigger problems

1764
01:19:34,539 --> 01:19:41,739
why um packets are smaller the blue part

1765
01:19:38,409 --> 01:19:43,299
is the easy bit and TCP packets tend to

1766
01:19:41,739 --> 01:19:46,690
be a little bit bigger than quick

1767
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:48,099
packets previous talk applies let's do

1768
01:19:46,690 --> 01:19:50,949
this stuff and get the packets bigger

1769
01:19:48,099 --> 01:19:53,320
because the overhead is significant the

1770
01:19:50,949 --> 01:19:55,869
red part on the Linux stack is the

1771
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:57,579
actual access just simple TCP segments

1772
01:19:55,869 --> 01:20:00,400
and we got too quick and we find the

1773
01:19:57,579 --> 01:20:03,190
combination of IP and transport is about

1774
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:05,219
the same okay you can wiggle in you can

1775
01:20:03,190 --> 01:20:08,469
tell me that the crypto stuff Inc quick

1776
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:09,940
could have been done in TCP but actually

1777
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:11,980
it's not very important that in terms of

1778
01:20:09,940 --> 01:20:17,079
total performance the quick acts are not

1779
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:20,409
as compact as the TCP acts yeah that's

1780
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:22,558
what the spec says hmm how do we fix

1781
01:20:20,409 --> 01:20:24,940
this

1782
01:20:22,559 --> 01:20:27,489
maybe we just change the acting policy

1783
01:20:24,940 --> 01:20:30,070
and we have to thinning in TCP so we can

1784
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:33,579
do this in quickly and said one lakh

1785
01:20:30,070 --> 01:20:35,530
every ten segments and yeah could do it

1786
01:20:33,579 --> 01:20:38,230
people have talked about it maybe people

1787
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:40,719
talk about it more in the IETF maybe we

1788
01:20:38,230 --> 01:20:44,018
can fix this maybe we just change the

1789
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,969
protocol to understand the path this is

1790
01:20:44,019 --> 01:20:49,119
with - and this is no over a satellite

1791
01:20:45,969 --> 01:20:53,369
link where we have asymmetric capacity

1792
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:56,049
also asymmetric radio considerations and

1793
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:58,659
liking every two packets looks like this

1794
01:20:56,050 --> 01:21:01,210
if we changed like every 10 packets lo

1795
01:20:58,659 --> 01:21:03,249
and behold the chord we have seen

1796
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:05,769
actually being people using just works

1797
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:08,139
oh well this may be a few things to

1798
01:21:05,769 --> 01:21:10,059
consider but really and we can change

1799
01:21:08,139 --> 01:21:12,729
the behavior to it with this so

1800
01:21:10,059 --> 01:21:15,249
conclusion hmm if we knew the past

1801
01:21:12,729 --> 01:21:16,540
capacity resources had a symmetry we

1802
01:21:15,249 --> 01:21:19,599
could know what to do

1803
01:21:16,540 --> 01:21:21,820
is it a great signal from the network no

1804
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:24,670
I tried to argue actually this is a

1805
01:21:21,820 --> 01:21:26,559
transport problem so a cement asymmetry

1806
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:29,080
in the network I think is not a great

1807
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:31,570
thing to signal because you don't really

1808
01:21:29,080 --> 01:21:33,580
most the time nor what path you're using

1809
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:35,620
if you're on the look radio link

1810
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:37,750
yourself if you attach it to a Wi-Fi or

1811
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:40,210
direct it to a cellular device maybe you

1812
01:21:37,750 --> 01:21:42,280
can say something about your local link

1813
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:44,580
that would certainly help in the same

1814
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:46,990
way as it helped for path MTU discovery

1815
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:48,430
but really I think this particular one

1816
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:53,290
is something that used to be done at the

1817
01:21:48,430 --> 01:21:55,390
transport and and I think we probably

1818
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:58,330
need to do some form of a congestion

1819
01:21:55,390 --> 01:21:59,380
control rate adaptive aking to deal with

1820
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:02,769
the fact that the paths are not

1821
01:21:59,380 --> 01:22:05,050
symmetric so this one isn't a greater

1822
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:07,420
talk here because really after looking

1823
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:09,400
at it all we find out is not a lot the

1824
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:11,770
path can help with we have to live with

1825
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:13,719
the fact that path is asymmetric so we

1826
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:16,090
need tools to know how asymmetric it is

1827
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:18,550
so we can debug it because one of the

1828
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:20,380
things I need to know are somebody using

1829
01:22:18,550 --> 01:22:22,660
this network is whether these paths are

1830
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:24,430
symmetric your work what's happening to

1831
01:22:22,660 --> 01:22:26,500
my traffic so I can understand what's

1832
01:22:24,430 --> 01:22:28,150
going on which is complicated but the

1833
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:30,010
fix is actually I think at the transport

1834
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:32,920
layer without signals from the path in

1835
01:22:30,010 --> 01:22:35,230
this case unless somebody tells me

1836
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:44,910
otherwise which is why I am presenting

1837
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:44,910
it seven minutes for questions comments

1838
01:22:54,240 --> 01:22:57,969
mr. Dawkins thank you for bringing this

1839
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:00,400
here Gauri

1840
01:22:57,970 --> 01:23:05,080
this is this is terrific for us to think

1841
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:07,629
about the one thing that I was gonna say

1842
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:15,190
just to make this more of a research

1843
01:23:07,630 --> 01:23:17,200
problem probably is it did I didn't hear

1844
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:19,230
you talking a lot about the situation

1845
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,389
where like the physical path this is

1846
01:23:19,230 --> 01:23:23,740
changing that's okay I think I think

1847
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:25,930
you're right Spencer because I think

1848
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:27,700
that's what can cause this as well as

1849
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:30,070
the radio link well I'm talking about

1850
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,950
the remembering problems that adapt

1851
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:36,460
yes and then the plane flew over the

1852
01:23:32,950 --> 01:23:38,650
mountain yeah and so remembering might

1853
01:23:36,460 --> 01:23:40,930
make things better or you might be

1854
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:43,420
remembering old information and have to

1855
01:23:40,930 --> 01:23:45,310
recover from that so I think I think

1856
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:46,750
that like I say I think this is terrific

1857
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:50,080
and I think this is terrifically

1858
01:23:46,750 --> 01:23:53,230
important this is directly relevant to a

1859
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:55,710
project proposal that I saw in an IETF

1860
01:23:53,230 --> 01:23:59,230
working group within the past three days

1861
01:23:55,710 --> 01:24:02,590
and surprise I pointed them at what not

1862
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:04,900
to do but this is a much this is a this

1863
01:24:02,590 --> 01:24:06,340
is a much better description of

1864
01:24:04,900 --> 01:24:08,139
specifically what they're looking at

1865
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:10,180
thank you for thank you for bringing it

1866
01:24:08,140 --> 01:24:12,550
yeah and and just to fill up what

1867
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:14,410
Spencer said if we if we have boxes on

1868
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:16,480
the path we might have various things

1869
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:18,610
chained together on the path we saw that

1870
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,200
earlier that it'd be nice to have right

1871
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:22,780
good tools to know what was happening

1872
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:25,360
here so we can debug this stuff at a

1873
01:24:22,780 --> 01:24:27,190
higher level you know you can't just

1874
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:29,080
believe things happen magically at the

1875
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:30,250
higher level you need to have tools in

1876
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,320
the network to understand what's going

1877
01:24:30,250 --> 01:24:34,840
on to make this stuff evolve at the

1878
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:37,990
higher level then question please

1879
01:24:34,840 --> 01:24:39,910
thank you Tim Costello from BT yes very

1880
01:24:37,990 --> 01:24:43,480
good presentation and nice results in

1881
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:47,110
there I work also on 5g standards set up

1882
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:49,269
coming from their issue on traffic

1883
01:24:47,110 --> 01:24:53,009
steering so eighty triple s we call it

1884
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:56,230
over there and which uses the multipath

1885
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:59,910
protocols in here so your path can

1886
01:24:56,230 --> 01:25:03,599
change mid midst

1887
01:24:59,910 --> 01:25:07,750
mid anything really over wireless

1888
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:10,270
satellite or residual band have you got

1889
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:13,210
consideration of that in here that I

1890
01:25:10,270 --> 01:25:18,010
could then go and look at no but I mean

1891
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:20,140
don't trust the path at all you could

1892
01:25:18,010 --> 01:25:22,960
trust it for a while and it really can't

1893
01:25:20,140 --> 01:25:26,440
change and yeah yeah I'd buy that and I

1894
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:28,000
hope it doesn't change so fast that it

1895
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:31,419
disrupts what goes on to higher-level

1896
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:32,950
and that might be interested because

1897
01:25:31,420 --> 01:25:34,750
some people would motivate it should

1898
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:36,700
change faster that it doesn't change the

1899
01:25:34,750 --> 01:25:38,680
service that's given across the network

1900
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,139
so here we have a little bit of tussle

1901
01:25:38,680 --> 01:25:43,330
between where the past trying to help

1902
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:45,730
you by doing the migration or

1903
01:25:43,330 --> 01:25:48,640
and you are trying to cope with the

1904
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:50,080
fight the past moving so yeah I be

1905
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:50,890
interested to talk and figure out what

1906
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:57,100
the problems are

1907
01:25:50,890 --> 01:26:00,580
thank you Andrew but Gregor firstly I

1908
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:02,590
think the common thing there is with you

1909
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:06,790
know memory and in transports and so

1910
01:26:02,590 --> 01:26:09,870
forth is the layers below transport need

1911
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:12,280
to supply signal at a rate that is

1912
01:26:09,870 --> 01:26:14,349
tolerable for transport to learn what is

1913
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:18,389
going on and transport needs to be

1914
01:26:14,350 --> 01:26:21,430
mindful of its own learning rate and so

1915
01:26:18,390 --> 01:26:24,430
effectively look like a Kalman filter

1916
01:26:21,430 --> 01:26:27,160
and know how wrong it could be right I

1917
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:31,180
mean the interesting things there might

1918
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:33,519
be under aren't ya yeah I know I'm just

1919
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:36,520
making sure people know the first thing

1920
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:38,020
Andrew is could we just have a hot

1921
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:40,180
signal we used to have those in the

1922
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:43,120
olden days it doesn't necessarily have

1923
01:26:40,180 --> 01:26:45,040
to say hey my pop asymmetry has changed

1924
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,050
and it's no like this just uh

1925
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:47,710
something's changed underneath that I

1926
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,660
can believe

1927
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:51,910
I know it came on path therefore I can

1928
01:26:49,660 --> 01:26:54,250
trust it and I just the transport then

1929
01:26:51,910 --> 01:26:55,540
says oh maybe time to probe now rather

1930
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:58,150
than kind of waiting a little bit longer

1931
01:26:55,540 --> 01:27:03,310
might help a lot we haven't tried that

1932
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:05,620
in here yeah I mean maybe we could find

1933
01:27:03,310 --> 01:27:07,630
a better name but Python physics probe

1934
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:10,380
solicitation yeah it seems like it he

1935
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:10,380
seems like a cool idea

1936
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:16,540
Eric Kinnear just to note about the

1937
01:27:14,650 --> 01:27:18,219
something has changed signal we don't do

1938
01:27:16,540 --> 01:27:20,920
anything like that on a path right now

1939
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:22,990
but at least within a client device when

1940
01:27:20,920 --> 01:27:25,930
something changes we take a signal and

1941
01:27:22,990 --> 01:27:26,950
we say hey we should probably look at

1942
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:28,930
some of the things that we're currently

1943
01:27:26,950 --> 01:27:30,970
estimating about the transport that we

1944
01:27:28,930 --> 01:27:33,130
have and not necessarily toss everything

1945
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:34,480
away but but be much more aggressive

1946
01:27:33,130 --> 01:27:36,520
about updating to the fact that we may

1947
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:38,530
have a significantly different situation

1948
01:27:36,520 --> 01:27:40,600
than we did a second ago that's the

1949
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:48,009
first hop signal an interface signal I

1950
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:51,010
guess is it yeah it was Spencer Dawkins

1951
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:52,960
okay you know kind of going back to the

1952
01:27:51,010 --> 01:27:55,120
what not to do draft you know work or

1953
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,860
deep in the territory of things that

1954
01:27:55,120 --> 01:28:00,010
have been impediments to

1955
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:02,349
oh man of the past and the assertion

1956
01:28:00,010 --> 01:28:04,510
during my presentation was that we

1957
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:07,750
understood the issues well enough to do

1958
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:12,610
engineering so for people to be thinking

1959
01:28:07,750 --> 01:28:14,400
about about that as you know as we have

1960
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:17,199
the discussion I think would be

1961
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,989
terrifically helpful to maybe them to me

1962
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:21,460
into the research group yeah and we

1963
01:28:19,989 --> 01:28:23,650
wouldn't want to repeat those bad

1964
01:28:21,460 --> 01:28:25,929
stories being too explicit might

1965
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:27,969
actually be a way of repeating that so

1966
01:28:25,929 --> 01:28:29,830
let's figure out how to not repeat the

1967
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:32,610
bad stuff and do something good yeah

1968
01:28:29,830 --> 01:28:37,269
move on to new and exciting mistakes

1969
01:28:32,610 --> 01:28:41,739
necklace cream chunk nice I have two

1970
01:28:37,270 --> 01:28:44,560
small questions comments at first are we

1971
01:28:41,739 --> 01:28:47,949
sure it's because of a symmetry or large

1972
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:51,460
ITT to what extent the entity has an

1973
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:53,290
impact on that do we we could we can do

1974
01:28:51,460 --> 01:28:55,360
measurements together if you want I mean

1975
01:28:53,290 --> 01:28:58,360
I think it's or even to experiment the

1976
01:28:55,360 --> 01:29:01,570
same characteristics with a high tea tea

1977
01:28:58,360 --> 01:29:05,920
but no asymmetry we have links to do so

1978
01:29:01,570 --> 01:29:08,409
okay we should do that and so there

1979
01:29:05,920 --> 01:29:11,230
there are probably pop issues that

1980
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:14,619
arrive due to higher Artie T which are

1981
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:16,388
either separable or sometimes mixed in

1982
01:29:14,619 --> 01:29:22,690
with them unless would be interesting

1983
01:29:16,389 --> 01:29:24,369
thing to unpick about paths okay just to

1984
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:26,980
very quickly interject about Erica near

1985
01:29:24,369 --> 01:29:29,619
I was looking at some data the other day

1986
01:29:26,980 --> 01:29:31,540
that suggested that with a constant rgt

1987
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:33,940
if you change the asymmetry of the path

1988
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:35,290
you see these effects so that it's not

1989
01:29:33,940 --> 01:29:38,259
actually the rgt it really is the

1990
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:42,420
asymmetry okay I just I'd like to cut

1991
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:44,860
the line after people who I in the line

1992
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:48,850
thank you for this useful information

1993
01:29:44,860 --> 01:29:50,830
and also on you mentioned I'm a second

1994
01:29:48,850 --> 01:29:53,679
point was it really key to your first

1995
01:29:50,830 --> 01:29:55,900
comment on what you do at the client

1996
01:29:53,679 --> 01:29:58,119
level at the moment and there are things

1997
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,920
that are done in specific client

1998
01:29:58,119 --> 01:30:02,380
implementations in quick and that are

1999
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:03,790
not clearly exchanged between the client

2000
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:07,449
and the server at least is that in the

2001
01:30:03,790 --> 01:30:10,330
standard today and we have a draft in

2002
01:30:07,449 --> 01:30:11,740
quick to actually exchange

2003
01:30:10,330 --> 01:30:14,559
information between clients and servers

2004
01:30:11,740 --> 01:30:17,200
that the XP machines you have on the

2005
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:19,240
path on one path on one way that you can

2006
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:22,300
actually use and measure asymmetry and

2007
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:23,830
exchange information publicly between

2008
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:26,950
Canton's not publicly because it's still

2009
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:28,690
within the quick secure the years it's

2010
01:30:26,950 --> 01:30:31,030
still that's something that may be worse

2011
01:30:28,690 --> 01:30:33,700
considering to measure asymmetry and

2012
01:30:31,030 --> 01:30:35,080
then decide if you adapt use these

2013
01:30:33,700 --> 01:30:37,300
informations to adapt your

2014
01:30:35,080 --> 01:30:39,820
acknowledgement rights yeah okay yeah

2015
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:41,590
yeah yeah yeah and to be useful has to

2016
01:30:39,820 --> 01:30:43,059
work across all paths so we need some

2017
01:30:41,590 --> 01:30:50,020
sort of standard in that space I buy

2018
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:52,870
that as an interesting few a stand

2019
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:56,440
through that study to PBR impact or

2020
01:30:52,870 --> 01:31:02,860
every chain on PBR would I like to

2021
01:30:56,440 --> 01:31:07,139
comment on BB are yes BB rv1 wasn't as

2022
01:31:02,860 --> 01:31:11,080
good BB our v2 is by definition better

2023
01:31:07,140 --> 01:31:12,880
right I don't know and somewhere buried

2024
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:14,680
in those slides I mention things about a

2025
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,360
rate based methods and other

2026
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:18,700
interactions so I think there are

2027
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:27,250
there's more to this to come as we

2028
01:31:18,700 --> 01:31:29,470
unravel this story feedback yeah yeah

2029
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:31,480
yeah feedback is something that we have

2030
01:31:29,470 --> 01:31:34,210
to get right and yeah yeah okay so I

2031
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:36,519
mean that's fun and I'm so pleased that

2032
01:31:34,210 --> 01:31:38,800
people started asking questions here and

2033
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:41,770
I think that there are follow-on things

2034
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:43,300
we could work on so happy to talk about

2035
01:31:41,770 --> 01:31:46,510
that using the research group mailing

2036
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:49,290
list yeah please do okay thank you very

2037
01:31:46,510 --> 01:31:53,170
much thank you for presented and who

2038
01:31:49,290 --> 01:31:55,450
commented I was in the room I hope

2039
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:57,880
please raise your hand if you have not

2040
01:31:55,450 --> 01:32:02,440
signed those blue piece of paper

2041
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:07,030
oh okay I'll come to you and thank you

2042
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:09,219
and see I in what one corner thank you

2043
01:32:07,030 --> 01:32:16,170
very much for staying to the very very

2044
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:16,170
very very very end of IETF 106

2045
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:20,860
[Laughter]

2046
01:32:47,130 --> 01:32:49,190
you
