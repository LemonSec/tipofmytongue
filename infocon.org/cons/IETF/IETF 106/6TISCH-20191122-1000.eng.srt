1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:12,080
to give a chance for people to arrive

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:15,410
with a bit of latency and with this

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,990
we'll be looking for minutes takers

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,810
is there a candidate to help us take

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,250
some minutes the etherpad is indicated

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,979
on this page it's also indicating the

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,650
next page it would be really cool that

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:29,330
you guys can attend the etherpad and

9
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:32,000
takes some notes in particular you're

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:34,070
going to talk to the mic then please

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,250
make sure that the minutes capture

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:39,530
correctly what you're going to say and

13
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:43,489
with this so do we have a summary a ping

14
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:48,200
on the minutes nice thank you very much

15
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:57,649
do we have JavaScript or a small room

16
00:00:48,200 --> 00:01:03,410
I'm not sure anybody going to Jaber okay

17
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:08,090
you can okay thank you meeting so this

18
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:09,889
is 60s this is a usual ITF meeting so we

19
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:12,950
go by all the rules of the ATF and

20
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:15,139
there's a list of best practices but

21
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:17,829
processes or response at cetera and in

22
00:01:15,139 --> 00:01:19,939
particular we've got the best practices

23
00:01:17,829 --> 00:01:22,490
applying to IPR

24
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:24,279
so if you're aware of IPR on anything

25
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,958
that's going to be discussed today

26
00:01:24,279 --> 00:01:30,679
please tell the room or let the shares

27
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:34,369
know by at the end of the meeting with

28
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:36,099
this remember you are being filmed the

29
00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:38,329
movie will be played on YouTube

30
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:43,240
thousands and hundreds of people will

31
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:47,990
vision visualize it so be very smart and

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:50,479
so will publish the minutes and the

33
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,279
recording you need to sign the blue

34
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,979
sheets we are kind of going to pass them

35
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:57,079
along in a few minutes please go online

36
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,579
on the ether pad and contribute two

37
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,208
minutes taking and validating the

38
00:01:58,579 --> 00:02:06,758
minutes and you'll find the usual links

39
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:06,759
about the 60s activities on this page

40
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,290
and with this we can start the agenda

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,640
bashing so basically we're going to tell

42
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,040
you where we are with this working group

43
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,540
our progress the status of documents and

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,970
related documents not a working row so

45
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,700
it goes

46
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:24,510
to the milestones and then we'll decide

47
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,530
what we do next well we'll have ten

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,470
minutes on the status of the

49
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,530
architecture then go to minimal security

50
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:34,440
that's gonna be Manisha then we'll have

51
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,990
Michael if he joins he sent us some

52
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:40,230
slides is not there yet and we'll have

53
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:42,000
Jay go remotely so Jay go did you I see

54
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:46,250
you so I hope you could set up your

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,510
mythical correctly then we have okay

56
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,100
okay that's nice we can hear you already

57
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,959
so that that's good and then we have

58
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:56,209
tanks fighting face same thing did you

59
00:02:51,959 --> 00:03:01,760
could you set up your mythical correctly

60
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:06,630
thanks very well I hope it works and

61
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:09,390
maybe the most unusual and final

62
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,640
discussion we'll have today is what's

63
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:14,130
next because as we will see we have

64
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,679
pretty much concluded all the work items

65
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,590
for which we were chartered which kind

66
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,510
of means that either we reach out or we

67
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,190
just sell out so that's going to be the

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:25,200
discussion so if you have items that you

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,959
want to discuss in this working group in

70
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,609
the future then it's it's a it's a good

71
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,860
time to speak now okay and with this a

72
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,930
little bit of status for the twelve on

73
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:40,050
the other working groups so as you know

74
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:42,510
six teachers spent more time actually

75
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:45,570
pushing work another working group that

76
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:47,760
doing individual work inside this

77
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,400
working group we we mostly worked around

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,730
an architecture and open source

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,650
implementations and interrupt tests and

80
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,090
to make all those things happen then we

81
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,190
had a number of dependencies and a

82
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,790
number of working groups so there is a

83
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:06,000
list of documents that we actually

84
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:08,910
promoted in other working groups so in

85
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,190
6lo we've got all the fragmentation work

86
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,820
so there are two documents they are both

87
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:18,269
passed well groups last call and we

88
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,950
started getting feedback from the affero

89
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:23,130
on the minimum fragment so there was a

90
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:25,200
new recipient of the minimum fragment so

91
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,270
those two draft are basically on in a

92
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:31,240
good shape for to go through iesg and

93
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,580
they are in suresh carrying health

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:36,040
we also promote you to work on 6lowpan

95
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:37,900
neighbor discovery so that's one of them

96
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,340
is now RFC eight five four five and then

97
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,739
we've got the address protection in the

98
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:45,099
backbone router which is an T proxy so

99
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:48,880
also all this work is in good shape and

100
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,570
and continuing through the is G we have

101
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,550
this new draft that was proposed to

102
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,790
completely get rid of multicast enable

103
00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,310
discovery using software registrar's

104
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,110
this is new job submission it's it's

105
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,150
related to the other three so that's why

106
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,920
it's listed here but I don't know what's

107
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,780
going to happen with it it's not needed

108
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:11,380
in the sixty's architecture it's beyond

109
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,030
six dish it's on the backbone and then

110
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,290
we've got the dead lifetime which is

111
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:19,929
also going through ESG at four we've

112
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:23,470
been promoting the Sdn model and that's

113
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:26,590
where the Dow projection goes there's

114
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:29,890
also this work on a leaf which would not

115
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:31,989
be aware of ripple so using only eight

116
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:35,050
five four five to signal the presence of

117
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:39,160
the leaf to the repo rotting and mapping

118
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:42,070
that into repo so that's going well both

119
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,200
documents have progressed I would say

120
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,610
immensely about the since the last IETF

121
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:49,360
there were several rounds of each of

122
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,940
those documents and roll is planning to

123
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,680
push quite heavily on the unaware leaf

124
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,110
because many documents are actually

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,450
dependent on that one including the

126
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:04,960
sixties architecture by the way and

127
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:07,000
enrollment priority I think the the

128
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,010
chairs have been asking for reviews on

129
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,290
that one to get through the age what to

130
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,550
do through the work of Wisconsin and

131
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,380
then we've get an email with the

132
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:19,150
constraint voucher and I hope that

133
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,219
Michael could tell us about it but it's

134
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:22,210
not there did you have knows about the

135
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,610
constraint voucher

136
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:30,729
okay so maybe Michael when he speaks on

137
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:33,310
the dead net the design team work on

138
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:35,020
zero touch will be able to give us news

139
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:39,070
on the constraint voucher because it's

140
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:42,299
really meet under zero touch is is the

141
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:44,070
constraint voucher so here is the

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,740
milestones

143
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,760
that we had I mean two of them Suresh ah

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:52,290
still waiting for accept but I mean

145
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,510
considering that it's just about

146
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,630
submitting the draft to ASG and that the

147
00:06:54,510 --> 00:07:01,950
draft have actually been submitted to

148
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:04,860
Zermatt so the the dt securities you're

149
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:07,950
attached is mostly empty of its contents

150
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,310
we kept it just to keep the working

151
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,830
group informed about the progress and

152
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:18,180
virtual work so i guess it will never be

153
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,460
submitted to ASG or it will be moved to

154
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,920
animal or place that will take care of

155
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,340
it

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,290
and so there we go the only item that's

157
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,619
left is evaluate the work of progress

158
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,300
and talk about which are trying or

159
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,480
completing the work basically yes it's

160
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,190
not a way of saying yes

161
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:40,770
and with this we moved to the first

162
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:43,460
presentation and that's me actually on

163
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,460
the architecture

164
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:08,900
I will move to the mic so the 60s

165
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:12,140
architecture may be viewed as maybe the

166
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:16,429
most encompassing work at six dish

167
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,690
because that's really what shows what we

168
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,030
wanted to achieve in this working group

169
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,800
and why we pushed so many work items in

170
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,479
different working groups and and the

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,000
overall picture that we wanted to build

172
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,260
so there are a number of components that

173
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,080
we are done at home

174
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:32,900
unlike the minimal security MSF etc a

175
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,409
six six P protocol and then a good

176
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:38,720
number of work items which actually done

177
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,789
outside the working group but the

178
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:43,460
architecture is the document that puts

179
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:45,469
all things in perspective and also

180
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:48,290
indicates direction we want to take for

181
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,570
new work which may not happen in 60s at

182
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:54,980
all such as row for instance this buff

183
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:57,050
that we had on Wednesday so there are

184
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,460
really two pieces in one document and we

185
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:01,189
could have done to document some people

186
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:03,260
said we should but we have a very

187
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,090
high-level architecture that goes into

188
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:08,660
the domain components and articulates

189
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,340
them and then we've got a deeper dive

190
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,550
into some components which are most

191
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,380
specific - six - and - Tom being

192
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,079
explained for instance there is this

193
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:25,280
concept of a track that is now inherited

194
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:27,410
by the work at Rome so we actually well

195
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,150
we went through the ASU review so that

196
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,410
we had for review since the last IETF

197
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:35,720
that Eric maja Roman and in German with

198
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:38,630
Benjamin obviously we we went through a

199
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,600
deep review of the security section but

200
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,850
not only Benjamin has been going very

201
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,550
slowly through the whole document and

202
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:53,960
thanks to Manish Shah and you actually

203
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:55,640
thank you we actually did a lot of work

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:59,990
on the security section and expanded

205
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:04,280
quite a bit so that's that's one of the

206
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:06,470
big changes we also extended the

207
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,750
discussion of the various forms of

208
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,640
diversity that are viable ratios which

209
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,270
are not necessarily the pre off that of

210
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:16,060
and in that net so we would clarify that

211
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:21,439
we expanded on the joint process as well

212
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:23,869
and the minimal thing and I insisted

213
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,940
that we are well and not annamaria but

214
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,710
that we are too many references and they

215
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,650
were not really well classified into

216
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:35,060
normative and non normative with the

217
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:37,370
understanding that this is not a Star

218
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:39,800
Trek document this is a an informational

219
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:44,200
track but there is still a meaning for

220
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:47,209
normative and that meaning is if you

221
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,610
need to understand the reference to

222
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:53,680
understand this document then the

223
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:56,090
reference is normative right so it's not

224
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,520
normalization if you like it it's really

225
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,900
like you can't understand this document

226
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,460
without understanding the other if

227
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:04,189
that's the case then the reference is

228
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:05,900
normative otherwise just you can avoid

229
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:08,060
reading it it's informative just for

230
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,680
your own reading if you like - so we

231
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,380
actually had to move and shuffle around

232
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:15,800
the references to clarify what's

233
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:18,680
normative the problem with that is by

234
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:21,370
putting more documents into normative we

235
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,050
also created a good number of miss Roth

236
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:27,200
miss Roffe being those documents which

237
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:30,560
are normative reference to euros but are

238
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,070
not yet roc so you cannot publish the

239
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,040
architecture before all of the mistress

240
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:39,820
are also published as RFC and there are

241
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,990
now like six or seven miss rafts

242
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:45,170
including the raw document that I showed

243
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,480
including minimum security including MSF

244
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:51,079
etc all those documents are now

245
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,300
normative references and we have to wait

246
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,760
for those to be RFC before the

247
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:57,890
architecture is RFC so the RFC is the

248
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,850
architecture is really the document that

249
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:03,199
will close the door of all the work that

250
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,970
has been done at 6:00 - when this is

251
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,690
either IFC then all the work we've done

252
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:10,310
is there as well and that also makes

253
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,700
sure that the architecture is completely

254
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:15,589
compatible and represents well the work

255
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,540
which is done in the other document even

256
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,100
if they change will have to change the

257
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,400
architecture - to represent that

258
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:24,350
correctly and that's pretty much I had

259
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:28,970
to say about the architecture so

260
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:30,740
we have any question okay so so if

261
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:33,440
you're interested in the work that we

262
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:35,900
try to start with row by W reliable

263
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,060
variable Wireless you can see a row as

264
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:42,500
being the next phase four six dish but

265
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,150
focusing on the writing aspect of it

266
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,480
that's why it's it's done in the writing

267
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:51,230
area and most besides precisely on the

268
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,300
operation of a sixties track now row is

269
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,360
not specific to sixty shot or it seemed

270
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:59,089
to be abstract to be completely lay off

271
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:01,280
free operation but it's near it's

272
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,810
certainly from the the designs that

273
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,579
we've done for tracks and all this

274
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:07,040
capability to have this direct acyclic

275
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,540
graph to a certain destination and make

276
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,349
intelligent forwarding decision there on

277
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,380
this track

278
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,780
so row we'll be focusing on that if the

279
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,240
group forms and that's pretty much it

280
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,510
for now

281
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,510
Thank You Posca

282
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:43,610
[Music]

283
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:46,040
okay so I will talk about the minimum

284
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:48,320
security document which was renamed to

285
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:54,500
be the constraint drawing protocol for

286
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:56,510
six days after one is three review the

287
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,970
current statuses the document is in

288
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:01,370
third it's in thirteenth version that

289
00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:04,040
the IRG reviews have been received as

290
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,950
well as up there and sec their reviews

291
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:08,930
and general the goal of this

292
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:11,390
presentation is essentially to go

293
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,910
through the main changes in twelve and

294
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:21,230
thirteen and discuss the issues raised

295
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:23,209
during the IRT reviews so after the last

296
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:25,339
meeting we discussed some text

297
00:14:23,209 --> 00:14:27,709
prohibiting the mixing of different

298
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:31,700
levels of what entity authentication

299
00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:36,319
tags this was incorporated in twelve we

300
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:39,110
added a new subsection is an ASN replay

301
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:43,910
attack after the last meeting

302
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:46,190
discussions and we also added some

303
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:49,819
mandatory support for extended tokens at

304
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:54,950
JRC as was received a comment offline

305
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:58,250
from Klaus Harkin from core we received

306
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,290
obviously two to two reviews be a pre I

307
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,600
usually use one of their and one

308
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:05,990
secretary review there were mostly needs

309
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,089
one concerned one added a new

310
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,550
requirement that concerns three

311
00:15:08,089 --> 00:15:12,680
commissioning of a device where we added

312
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:14,479
the requirement that the pressure key

313
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,989
must be changed in case the device is

314
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,360
recommission and during the Secretary

315
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,930
will these were most units that we

316
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:28,010
received

317
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:30,439
I usually reviews we got four discusses

318
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:36,860
and three no objections and one year

319
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:38,149
setting from Suresh the so the comb in

320
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,800
the main goal of the presentation today

321
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:43,700
will be to go through the open issues

322
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:47,839
that we have on in is G from is G

323
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,480
reviews one issue that was brought up

324
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,019
was related to the you

325
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,040
of well-known UI for code rip and

326
00:15:53,019 --> 00:16:08,930
essentially as it stands for you was the

327
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:10,939
/ /j URI as a URI we use /j yeah I think

328
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:13,160
Adam had a suggestion like co-op column

329
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,820
colon slash slash six to stop a slash

330
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:18,529
dot well-known slash a was this addition

331
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:21,649
so so that there was a couple of

332
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:26,000
parallel discussions on it essentially

333
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:29,029
we in during the drawing phase we it was

334
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,639
deemed okay that we can use /j as long

335
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:35,269
as we use sixty sharp ax as the

336
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:37,459
well-known host name the problem was the

337
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:38,240
after the join exchanged the parameter

338
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:41,029
updates

339
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,889
part of the protocol where sixty sharper

340
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,480
was missing well-known Yura host so what

341
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,449
we did what we proposed is the

342
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:52,730
resolution is to use sixty sharper also

343
00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:54,829
in that case as well so that it is

344
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,449
isolated from all other uses of slash

345
00:16:54,829 --> 00:17:00,979
stray yeah this is the proposal so

346
00:16:58,449 --> 00:17:02,510
proposal make it but it is also one of

347
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,400
his comments which said like how do you

348
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:05,959
handle subdomains he just wanted some

349
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,160
clearer text on handling on submarines

350
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:09,860
it was part of the comment but I would

351
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,990
like to solicit she only has sex Edition

352
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:13,579
as well here so this was added this was

353
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:15,890
all added I mean I didn't bring it up

354
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:18,379
here because it we converts them that on

355
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:20,780
the list but Michael added this in the

356
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,980
document essentially all the proposed

357
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:26,720
text in the from from the male tried so

358
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,610
this should be resolved I mean we still

359
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,990
haven't published the version the

360
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:37,159
official version of the document but

361
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:39,950
it's in the working copy one comment

362
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,350
that would receive from media in regards

363
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:45,730
the parameter update response message

364
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:49,250
which which is as it now stands empty

365
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:51,380
the parameter this is response to the

366
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:54,169
parameter update message which is a cop

367
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,600
confirmable message and essentially we

368
00:17:54,169 --> 00:17:58,490
define for well for generality

369
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:00,699
essentially another message that is a

370
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:04,520
response but that is essentially empty

371
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:09,320
that is piggybacked over over coop

372
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:11,420
over coops confirmable response and the

373
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,460
question raised was is completely

374
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,710
legitimate was like why define our own

375
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,770
our own protocol message when the

376
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:21,230
response is confirmable and that when so

377
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:23,510
that we have an indication of reception

378
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:27,410
at the sender of the parameter update

379
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:31,160
message so I mean why keep it

380
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,750
essentially and the proposes resolution

381
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,160
is essentially to remove the parameter

382
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:42,440
update response message from the

383
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:45,740
protocol yeah so another issue that was

384
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:53,330
oh one another comment that was received

385
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:54,830
was from Benkei deck yes again so for

386
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,330
the congestion control parts like I

387
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,340
gonna discuss it or it likely your a

388
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,409
greater than genius and it's done III

389
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:05,179
consider it done because it was on the

390
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:06,740
on the list yes yeah yeah it's it has

391
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:08,390
been discussed on the list and it was

392
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:10,930
incorporated in the document so I

393
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,160
believe we are good to go there here I

394
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,500
essentially the issue that I'm going

395
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,780
through are the issues that haven't have

396
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,430
had their resolutions in the in the

397
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,510
working copy of the document and no make

398
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,860
sense now I just thought like you know

399
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:23,330
you wanted to discuss like all the stuff

400
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,699
that came up during eval because you put

401
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:30,379
all the positions ends oh okay no yeah

402
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:32,240
no what the proposed resolution there

403
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,640
one is quite simple and it were starting

404
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:40,610
so so it should be fine so regarding

405
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:42,890
this issue that been Caidic raised it

406
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:48,560
concerns the traffic analysis of quadric

407
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:51,950
messages and essentially asking if we

408
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,419
can muddle up if you can make more

409
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:55,430
difficult if we can make traffic

410
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,970
analysis more difficult what options

411
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,220
would be available to us and Michael

412
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,710
responded to this on the mailing list

413
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,270
recently essentially summarizing the

414
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,870
types of traffic that are in the network

415
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:12,800
and saying that this kind of traffic is

416
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:15,860
protected at layer 2 in the network and

417
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:18,940
that this is pretty much all we can do

418
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,939
about it at this point

419
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:34,299
another issue is related to the use of

420
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:38,299
sexy sexy exempt mechanism in 15 for

421
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:42,289
standard and this was a this was a

422
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,789
comment received bump by Bank addict he

423
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:46,759
says I think we may need to say more

424
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:49,158
about how JP knows the SEC isn't is in

425
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:50,690
effect since that affects the critical

426
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,049
piece of the security posture of the

427
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:56,120
network and this true that in the

428
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,750
current text we don't have the clear

429
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:02,330
link between house Exantus set other

430
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:05,179
than it was considered out of scope so

431
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:09,500
what I propose here we had we have this

432
00:21:05,179 --> 00:21:12,649
join rate parameter that can be used by

433
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,899
the Dre RC to enable any particular node

434
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:18,768
in the network to act as a joint proxy

435
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:22,100
so I I what I propose is that we link

436
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:25,389
the user of the join rate parameter with

437
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:29,899
the SEC exempt mechanism such that when

438
00:21:25,389 --> 00:21:33,469
the jrc enables a particular node to

439
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:38,268
acted as a drawing proxy ii m to get set

440
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:44,870
at that particular node there are given

441
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:48,019
in psychic seemed is it's not per join

442
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:51,439
proxy it's in in join proxy for each

443
00:21:48,019 --> 00:21:52,789
joining node so so you can't set it

444
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,000
until you know who is going to be

445
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:58,070
joining okay but you need a policy to

446
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,740
yet you read the policy that you are

447
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:02,450
allowing you know join but the first

448
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,039
complexities of course coming out of the

449
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,379
blue you don't know who do that one end

450
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:10,220
so so a first message to get in will

451
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:12,620
always get error because you are not

452
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,360
allowing it but then it up layer you can

453
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,168
see that okay check out the policy if

454
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,469
they you know join generate generate is

455
00:22:18,169 --> 00:22:23,029
non zero then we allowed configuration

456
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,639
except for that know that I'm just

457
00:22:23,029 --> 00:22:28,490
sending a message but but it's it's it's

458
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:30,709
not like for forty snow this actually

459
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:31,760
for remote draw that remote node is

460
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:34,210
allowed to

461
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,129
exempted security management in Pakistan

462
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:38,480
okay okay thanks for the con and I think

463
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:40,640
the one the one of the problem is that

464
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,730
when we of course after he had finished

465
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,490
joining we want to drop the SEC X and so

466
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:48,740
he we he of course doesn't send any

467
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,660
anymore pockets in clear but some you

468
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,210
know attacker mic'd you know send

469
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:56,810
packets in clear claiming to be him

470
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,920
because and actually do some nasty said

471
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:59,480
that's why you want to remove the

472
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,570
psychics and so it that it take it

473
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,220
dropped automatically by the Mac so we

474
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:07,939
do this after certain time out then for

475
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:10,040
a for a pledge or because we don't have

476
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,910
a way of knowing at the Jaypee that the

477
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:15,170
pledge joined essentially we have yes

478
00:23:13,910 --> 00:23:16,850
that's actually one of the comments I

479
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,300
had earlier was that it actually would

480
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,320
be better to for JP to know when the

481
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,430
process is finished

482
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:27,070
I like currently and it's also you know

483
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,620
because one of the problem there is that

484
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:32,870
when we sent the final response back

485
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:34,399
that's actually sent in clear because we

486
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:37,729
don't have that one has a hundred keys

487
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:39,530
yet the problem is that the AK is coming

488
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,300
back with using the same security level

489
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:43,190
that was you know be sending so and we

490
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:45,260
have to respond to we have to be able to

491
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,300
receive that ACK which means they still

492
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,879
have to have an SEC accept own at that

493
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,320
point it's not transmitting that and of

494
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:53,840
course he if he doesn't get it we have

495
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,870
to retransmit and so so there's it did

496
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,490
either be the timeout or some you know

497
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:01,280
actually first time we see him sending

498
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:03,080
us any encrypted message we know that he

499
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:05,270
has you know received he has the keys

500
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,270
and we can drop the SEC extent that's

501
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:09,950
actually it's one optional or or I don't

502
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:14,560
know what this could could it depends or

503
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:20,020
the protocol little bit okay okay thanks

504
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:26,270
so okay so to sum up essentially we

505
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:29,540
enable the SEC exempt to be set when

506
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:32,780
drawing rate is nonzero but we still

507
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:36,830
need to process an incoming message from

508
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:40,010
from each pledge before the SEC exempt

509
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,659
is set for again for again it's not

510
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:44,120
global it's yapper

511
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,470
you know appear and the drawing rate who

512
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:48,080
is something that is a good

513
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,879
that's how about for the no global 42

514
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,129
note so in procs who has a global

515
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:54,949
setting join rate that tells you whether

516
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:56,899
it's allowing anybody to join and when

517
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,820
he sees the first you know message he

518
00:24:56,899 --> 00:25:09,018
even said check except for that note

519
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:11,090
that okay understood then there was an

520
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:14,330
issue also raised by Bank a duck on the

521
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:16,820
use of quadric max enjoin attempts

522
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:19,730
parameter that appears only twice in the

523
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:20,360
text and this is essentially a remnant

524
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:22,850
from the

525
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:26,209
time join request was a non confirmable

526
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:27,830
message so as now we rely on quarter de

527
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:30,950
clave declared failure to the

528
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:33,740
application we simply can remove this

529
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:39,919
and remove it from the text this this is

530
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:42,529
the most simple resolution another

531
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:45,860
common from Bank ADA considers the

532
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:49,730
parameter additional info that was

533
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,918
deemed under specified because in one

534
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,700
there is one example given in the text

535
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:58,279
that during the processing of the error

536
00:25:55,700 --> 00:26:00,980
message in this parameter we can include

537
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:02,539
a subset of keys that were not we that

538
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:06,830
were not being that could not be

539
00:26:02,539 --> 00:26:08,779
processed so the idea was the Tenakee

540
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:10,580
compliant with link layer keystroke that

541
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:12,830
is defined in the document can be

542
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:17,870
included but apparently there is more

543
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:26,629
text needed here to to make this to not

544
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:29,799
make it under specified one other issue

545
00:26:26,629 --> 00:26:33,678
that was raised by bank attack is the

546
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:36,110
the missing of the label of the elyda t

547
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,200
for each message he says that he feels

548
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:40,309
that it's little unusual to have a

549
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,250
consolidate registry for Quadra

550
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:45,678
parametres that are used as map labels

551
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,870
across different messages without some

552
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,409
indication of which map labels are valid

553
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:54,018
in which messages so essentially the

554
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:56,690
resolution to this should be to add a

555
00:26:54,019 --> 00:26:59,090
paragraph rate arising and summarizing c

556
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,610
d dl c

557
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:04,580
fragments which already indicate a bit

558
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:11,899
what what parameters are valid in which

559
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:15,409
quadruped objects so clarifying question

560
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,760
we don't need to change the IANA section

561
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,040
for that right we just put that

562
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,470
somewhere else yes yes that's crackers

563
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,240
doesn't matter try now whether this is

564
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:25,760
used that message all that means as long

565
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,020
as it's being declared yes yes that's

566
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,640
correct so the next steps is just to

567
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:33,800
incorporate this resolution that we

568
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,860
discussed here and to publish

569
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,840
essentially on the 14th version and to

570
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:41,120
declare - I agree that essentially we

571
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,770
have we believe we have addressed all

572
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:47,419
the issues that were raised as part of

573
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:49,520
the review process that's all from me

574
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,020
many thanks Parishad do we have a

575
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:58,730
question in the room to haul anything

576
00:27:51,020 --> 00:28:07,220
can heal famous last word on this okay

577
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:10,130

another HS I think I'm not able to

593
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:05,340
slides

594
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:33,040
and someone asked me to so we all sleep

603
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:19,180
to present the the information element

604
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,430
the calculation for six dish and join

605
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:22,690
our enrollment information which is

606
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:28,020
rational zero zero six

607
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:30,490
and next please be brief I hope so

608
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:33,129
what's the status of the of this draft

609
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:36,820
we have already passed individual DLC in

610
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:39,640
case we have the last call you have a

611
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,840
one revision from Carlos Gomez waiter

612
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:46,570
really thank and we are going for the

613
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:50,860
version zero seven from shore revision

614
00:30:46,570 --> 00:30:52,929
for judges and we noticed some few typos

615
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,580
and I covered on the interpretation of

616
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:57,730
the a of the link Oh case but this

617
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,610
checklist it's a simple it doesn't

618
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:02,890
change the core of their of the draft

619
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,479
and they do I also thank fear of about

620
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:07,300
the the

621
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,890
enlightenment or how to manage date the

622
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,520
name of the hundred fifteen foreigner

623
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,950
naming

624
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,910
now and remember three sixteenths he

625
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:23,430
mentioned this and for the future next

626
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:28,180
slide please so whatever we have changed

627
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:32,130
here it's a few filtration titles okay

628
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:34,710
and subsection 1 1 pitch 1.3 it's the

629
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:37,360
usage and meaning of a rotary

630
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:40,720
advertisement Association we should be

631
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:43,240
cleared so we clear it up okay and we

632
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,130
close the the expressions at the closing

633
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,190
of section 1 we have improved them and

634
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:51,040
some feel description or the change also

635
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:53,620
when on stage section 2 de to join how

636
00:31:51,040 --> 00:32:01,030
to arrange them in the order word they

637
00:31:53,620 --> 00:32:03,189
appear on the hospital then the cigar

638
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:05,560
decoration and we can lead locally glare

639
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:08,140
can be using description of the pivot

640
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:13,169
which was in Austria each other should

641
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:16,470
have been and fire finally has a small

642
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:21,700
citation explicitly for the area of fc8

643
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:23,700
81-57 if the subtype next please just

644
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:27,790
very few questions

645
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,890
finally we are going to move to 0-7 okay

646
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:36,490
after the all the comments we have

647
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:39,340
received and then I expect we hope this

648
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:43,150
draft will go through the ilg at the

649
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:46,330
next step and that's it for for this

650
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:49,390
draft happy this rough in fact has been

651
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:51,669
very stable for the last versions ok

652
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:57,360
only small changes and I think it's

653
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:57,360
ready to move on any questions

654
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:13,879
well actually actually yes you got I

655
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:15,920
guess from my UT direct right the

656
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,590
document is submitted to the ASG for

657
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,750
review with idea evaluation and it's in

658
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:23,860
the air in hands of Suresh again like

659
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:28,760
pretty much every document okay so

660
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:31,010
that's what we are just yet you know the

661
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,320
old in literally chart and you'll get

662
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:40,940
all those review okay right Thank You

663
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:45,669
Johnny start based on the length of make

664
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,670
you know roll in January as restricting

665
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,300
January or February

666
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:53,030
[Music]

667
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:55,280
many thanks rush so thank you you go for

668
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:56,090
staying without that this late time

669
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,220
don't worry

670
00:33:56,090 --> 00:34:04,850
of your day don't even show you tomorrow

671
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:10,100
already so thank you very much no

672
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:16,730
question on this okay and we'll move on

673
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:21,429
then and next winner is it's for pretty

674
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,429
much thanks hey can you please join

675
00:34:30,389 --> 00:34:38,820
don't you think fine showing up think

676
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:52,200
they can you please show on the mythical

677
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:52,200
mythical Joe big suspense tada

678
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:14,360
hello hear me

679
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:20,900
yes thanks I press the button hope

680
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:23,030
you're there can you only try thanks a

681
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:26,770
please because maybe the button

682
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,770
evacuated you instead of accepting you

683
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,360
[Music]

684
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,410
there we go

685
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,330
you should be starting okay can you see

686
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,799
the buttons to switch the slides or do

687
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:45,470
you want me to switch the slight sting

688
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:53,500
say I didn't see the button to switch

689
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:57,410
sighs yep yeah thanks

690
00:35:53,500 --> 00:36:00,230
so they said update for the latest

691
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:05,120
version of the MSF minimal scale

692
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:09,560
function and will show the next slide

693
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:13,609
base so since the last re camp meeting

694
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:15,830
we have three main issues raised up the

695
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,100
first rate is the rules for salaries

696
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:20,660
which is pointing out to Pascal and

697
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,630
because of the curve its version the MSF

698
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,910
doesn't specify where the Souza's pick

699
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:30,470
it up though when generating the 6pu

700
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:32,299
request and so we should have to know

701
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,470
that maintaining a candidate is helpful

702
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,660
for this at least and know the world

703
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,819
keep listening for the clearance of the

704
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:44,330
cells and to check whether is a

705
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:47,330
collision sound ourselves and then when

706
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:50,650
generate the 6p request package it will

707
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:54,950
pick up the cells from this cell phone

708
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:58,150
so the another issues is the schedule

709
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:01,549
consistency pointed out by Christine and

710
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:04,760
the issue is when the mode is despaired

711
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:08,210
from the network such as when the power

712
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,740
of the south is reserved his parents

713
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:15,670
will live in the parent schedule of ever

714
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:19,250
without knowing the neighbor is gone

715
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:23,150
that we used to have the keepalive

716
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:25,940
mechanism for each node it will stand

717
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:31,250
some Q line message to to the neighbor

718
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:33,350
it has a sales and half before and if

719
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:37,630
this icky blob is not act by his

720
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:42,980
neighbor and the neighbor will be Claire

721
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:48,500
declared as unreachable and and then it

722
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:50,780
will stand a bit clearer to the neighbor

723
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:53,510
it may be filled but it will remove the

724
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:57,920
cell cell to the neighbor from its

725
00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:01,340
schedule so we used to have it in the

726
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,220
previous version like 0-2 version of the

727
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,140
master and we removed out from those

728
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:07,700
trees because at the time we don't have

729
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,560
the dynamic scheduling for the

730
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,899
autonomous house at that time the

731
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:15,620
Ottoman cell wall installed apparently

732
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:19,700
in the schedule and in that sense they

733
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:23,140
may because they for install one cell

734
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:26,450
for our neighbors but now the MSF has

735
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,060
dynamic scheduling so those cells could

736
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:32,450
be removed the only installer wouldn't

737
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:37,549
necessary so so we bring it back in the

738
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:40,970
latest MSF job and the third one is we

739
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:43,970
added the downstream traffic adaptation

740
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:46,669
feature for the latest MSF and this is

741
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:53,779
the main thing I'm going to explain in

742
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:55,790
details and next one please so firstly

743
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,490
is the strategy of a downstream traffic

744
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:00,980
interpretation is pretty similar to the

745
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,350
upstream one and has two counters and

746
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:06,740
the number cell use themselves elapsed

747
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:09,140
and them cell use the world blood plus

748
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:13,160
when the frame is received from its

749
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:15,640
parents on a our Excel and themselves

750
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:15,640
the elapsed

751
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:22,160
number will increase me will increments

752
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:26,450
to win the current Salazar Excel to his

753
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:30,348
parents the different is the upstream

754
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:35,240
for upstream traffic it has a negotiated

755
00:39:30,349 --> 00:39:39,799
txl at the initial but initially there's

756
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:42,979
no negotiating or excel for each node so

757
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:46,790
we decided to counting the auto or

758
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:51,380
excels at the beginning to start to this

759
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:54,680
downstream traffic adaptation so to use

760
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:58,220
them that that there is a tool there's

761
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:00,950
one problem is during network a forming

762
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:04,848
face those cells are used actually by

763
00:40:00,950 --> 00:40:06,980
its children and these parents at the

764
00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:10,609
same time and this CUDA caused a

765
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:13,730
collision on these cells and which when

766
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:16,430
the massacre is detecting the usage of

767
00:40:13,730 --> 00:40:21,670
the downstream traffic is actually will

768
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:25,399
detect a lower value for this cell usage

769
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:30,290
but after the networks formed and the

770
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:32,109
traffic from his parents will transfer

771
00:40:30,290 --> 00:40:35,270
to the negotiate eh cells

772
00:40:32,109 --> 00:40:36,920
so the man-made traffic is coming from

773
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:40,700
his parents which is a downstream

774
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:42,500
traffic on this auto or Excel which is

775
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:48,078
ideal for a downstream traffic

776
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:51,490
adaptation so for the for the reason

777
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,250
that mostly down to traffic are

778
00:40:51,490 --> 00:41:00,649
generated after networker is formed so

779
00:40:55,250 --> 00:41:04,369
we can was a SAP to this this this

780
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:08,540
drawback on a theory in the network is

781
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:15,819
forming face and next slide please

782
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:18,200
I think they just one meter pointer is

783
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:20,180
basically when the network is being

784
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:22,399
formed I mean what you see there is

785
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,669
mostly control in that data right

786
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,160
because network is the diet and so those

787
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:31,819
collisions are a lot related to these

788
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,430
and Diu messages and we are working

789
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:36,520
right now after all to minimize the

790
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,390
chances of collisions like this by

791
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,940
intruding

792
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:42,828
introducing some some trickle mechanisms

793
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,880
in the das so the prime should actually

794
00:41:42,829 --> 00:41:49,670
also be addressed at the operator at the

795
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,880
repo layer so as to to avoid most of

796
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:55,339
those collisions anyone so I mean saying

797
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,740
is that's cool that you do this way and

798
00:41:55,339 --> 00:41:59,660
we are trying to limit the chances that

799
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:04,279
these events during the date rock

800
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:06,730
formation no that's good thanks for the

801
00:42:04,279 --> 00:42:10,309
information

802
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:14,059
so we also implement the downstream

803
00:42:10,309 --> 00:42:16,369
traffic we implemented Japan I was

804
00:42:14,059 --> 00:42:20,569
opened up with an invitation and will

805
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:23,930
create a pure as especially for this

806
00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:28,240
feature and currently had marched and we

807
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:32,799
tested it through a test pad from our

808
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:36,680
office building and we deploy our knows

809
00:42:32,799 --> 00:42:39,680
ni rooms from the building and each room

810
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:43,640
we have four open Lobby so the totally

811
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,440
thirty-six smells there and so we run

812
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:52,190
this code through the thirty six mils

813
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:54,740
and run in network and to control node

814
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,140
and or enter by being we through the

815
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,479
impurity architecture which provides a

816
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,670
test bath and we are able to flash

817
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,359
models and also reading the 0 output

818
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:08,299
front melt which are asked to know to do

819
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:16,038
some analyze about network performance

820
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:18,680
and in the next slice and we the the

821
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:21,500
experience that has to face first we are

822
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,129
waiting for all knows synchronized and

823
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,960
building networks and the figure on the

824
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:29,599
right is showing the structure of the

825
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,710
networks after the routing is

826
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,440
established and by default there's a

827
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:39,279
background upstream traffic around one

828
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:43,039
packet per 30 seconds upstream

829
00:43:39,279 --> 00:43:45,319
transmitting and to generate a

830
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:47,869
downstream traffic and we just using the

831
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:51,680
ping command provides by the OS and

832
00:43:47,869 --> 00:43:59,780
we're paying to a one home node

833
00:43:51,680 --> 00:44:02,899
be 5f1 there and with a spade of one

834
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,300
pain for two seconds is roughly once

835
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:08,839
loved one packet of course offering

836
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:12,829
duration and the reason why we only just

837
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:14,900
paying this first hop now it is the

838
00:44:12,829 --> 00:44:18,260
experiment that's trying to show the

839
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:25,910
crowning correctness of the MSF

840
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:29,809
downstream epic adaptation and so we are

841
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:34,970
recording the data such as the traffic

842
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:38,599
changes which is when the pain pinkman

843
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:41,868
stars wind pains ends in terms of Numb

844
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:43,730
transmission per seconds and also the

845
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,819
number of th cells including the auto

846
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:49,640
txl and negotiate T Excel to see the

847
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:52,490
changes of them cell according to the

848
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:58,790
changes of the traffic and in the next

849
00:44:52,490 --> 00:45:03,950
slide was showing the result so there

850
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:09,558
are four figures here and is grouped by

851
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:11,868
two on the left side figure I'm sorry

852
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:14,900
yeah but I guess we have a question and

853
00:45:11,869 --> 00:45:20,630
the Trevor my name is Ryan can you go

854
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:23,540
back to the previous slide also why did

855
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:30,079
you choose there get to be a target

856
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:36,410
without the children I without children

857
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:39,290
I was noting tenth the thinking the idea

858
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:41,990
is I won't just won't choose the first

859
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:45,799
hop one I think if you have a children

860
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:50,540
or nowadays it doesn't really influence

861
00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:56,140
the behaviors but maybe your question is

862
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:56,140
a y note paying a second elope note

863
00:45:56,349 --> 00:46:03,819
because I think there is no different

864
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,569
paying the note with children or not

865
00:46:03,819 --> 00:46:07,610
just calm it maybe it

866
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:10,520
better to choose the target with at

867
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:19,100
least one child like in the lesson that

868
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:23,120
left most part I think mm-hmm yeah they

869
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:26,600
feel pained and note because the the

870
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:28,970
first time not a will respond pain Iko

871
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:33,410
Iko response is actually there's no

872
00:46:28,970 --> 00:46:36,230
traffic into interactive with the second

873
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:40,160
that the children of the first hope

874
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:41,870
knows right I think they just kinda fine

875
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:45,470
right in your picture you say that the

876
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,970
target is f1 but on the text you say

877
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:51,950
it's seventy one which is on the left

878
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:58,220
and so the question is I'm sorry yes I

879
00:46:51,950 --> 00:47:06,200
that's a title sorry yeah thanks for

880
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:08,779
pointing out which one is a typo by the

881
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:13,160
way is it so is it twenty one that I

882
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:29,270
fight to target everyone is the one is

883
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:35,029
target probably the okay probably here

884
00:47:29,270 --> 00:47:37,820
is a the I didn't fixes a typo here you

885
00:47:35,030 --> 00:47:47,360
can see these figures on the top is

886
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:51,370
saying bf7 one yeah I think this is just

887
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:54,590
a typo it doesn't influence the results

888
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:57,440
so so there's a four figures here on the

889
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:59,900
left the results for his de Groote and

890
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:04,340
on the right side is the result for its

891
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:07,360
target and for the upper figures that is

892
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:12,260
showing the number of transmissions

893
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:15,760
during overtime and the bottom figure is

894
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:19,210
for the number of th cells over time

895
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,210
there are

896
00:48:19,219 --> 00:48:28,579
serve things choose to see and first it

897
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:31,279
is for the decorate on the bottom

898
00:48:28,579 --> 00:48:35,259
figures you can see is using the auto to

899
00:48:31,279 --> 00:48:38,239
excel as beginning to standing the pain

900
00:48:35,259 --> 00:48:41,390
requested to its decorate which is

901
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:51,289
showing in the green lines in the figure

902
00:48:41,390 --> 00:48:57,469
and then it installed it to th cells to

903
00:48:51,289 --> 00:49:03,169
th cells to the to the terminals and the

904
00:48:57,469 --> 00:49:07,819
cells are removed from removed from its

905
00:49:03,169 --> 00:49:13,839
schedule and as well on the target mo

906
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:17,150
side and you can see it installed in an

907
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:22,969
additional T Excel because as beginning

908
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:25,959
has a 1 T Excel there so so is a result

909
00:49:22,969 --> 00:49:32,239
with two at the exit there there's a

910
00:49:25,959 --> 00:49:34,308
there's a time for target notes you can

911
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:37,219
just see it's showing there's a cerise

912
00:49:34,309 --> 00:49:39,319
out there which is as the right

913
00:49:37,219 --> 00:49:42,109
beginning its dropped two to one so I

914
00:49:39,319 --> 00:49:46,159
smelled ourselves faster in there Ryan

915
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:49,609
here I have a question the the upper

916
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:54,380
graphs are analyzed using it at all

917
00:49:49,609 --> 00:49:56,229
cells right the uppers the upper figure

918
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:01,329
is showing the number of transmissions

919
00:49:56,229 --> 00:50:04,848
for all the cells for auto cell yes I

920
00:50:01,329 --> 00:50:07,789
think I think it would be just a comment

921
00:50:04,849 --> 00:50:13,549
maybe it would be a good if you analyze

922
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:21,769
it per cells right instead of going for

923
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:25,909
the all cells total cells how you show

924
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:30,140
if only one so what do you would like to

925
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:35,299
see from line is for diya

926
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:38,180
total cell analysis maybe it would be

927
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:43,809
nice if you just put other per cell

928
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:48,828
maybe maybe many lines hmm cell analysis

929
00:50:43,809 --> 00:50:51,410
and just a comment yeah I show you here

930
00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:55,400
is trying to using this value to

931
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:58,009
matching the speed of a the pinging if I

932
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:00,859
summarize them together you can see the

933
00:50:58,009 --> 00:51:03,589
lines is actually increasing one

934
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:07,880
transmission for two seconds I was

935
00:51:03,589 --> 00:51:11,720
trying to trying to connect to this of

936
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:15,940
this lines to the actual speed of a the

937
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:20,470
downstream traffic yeah that's the idea

938
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:26,809
to show you some okay thank you

939
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:29,569
yeah thank you what doesn't show here is

940
00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:32,089
if there were packets which were lost

941
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:36,019
due to starvation of cells did you

942
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:38,089
experience starvation like not enough no

943
00:51:36,019 --> 00:51:45,890
your packets and so you have to drop the

944
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:49,249
packet just that during this experiments

945
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:52,848
it doesn't occurs it doesn't worker is

946
00:51:49,249 --> 00:51:56,140
because I actually increasing the queue

947
00:51:52,849 --> 00:51:59,239
buffer size I think this is the reason

948
00:51:56,140 --> 00:52:01,730
yes it's just basically it will occur if

949
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:04,279
the traffic change is too fast for the

950
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:06,529
6p protocol to allocate its lanes cells

951
00:52:04,279 --> 00:52:09,650
right so if it's a ping and there is a

952
00:52:06,529 --> 00:52:11,630
packet every two seconds then maybe that

953
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,880
gives you enough time to allocate this

954
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:18,289
the cells I think it's pretty much the

955
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:21,380
answer so it can only adapt you know at

956
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:24,470
a certain speed so you changes of the

957
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:27,380
demand must be slow out and the changes

958
00:52:24,470 --> 00:52:29,419
at which you can adapt to it yeah that's

959
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:32,710
true okay in a network like this because

960
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:32,710
the demand comes multi huh

961
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:44,940
[Music]

962
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:47,970
yeah so we are running so we believe the

963
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:52,349
drop to the set the 0-7 version is ready

964
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:55,109
then we we start a two weeks walking

965
00:52:52,349 --> 00:52:59,760
group let's go around one months ago and

966
00:52:55,109 --> 00:53:02,910
we didn't receive comments either were

967
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:07,010
responding hopefully people review it in

968
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:09,149
just no comments and so right after the

969
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:11,880
meeting this time we will publish

970
00:53:09,150 --> 00:53:14,580
another version there are eight but the

971
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:17,970
man is just title fixing and to some

972
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:22,770
more refining is there's no real content

973
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:25,020
changings and for the current version we

974
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:25,920
believe is relative to send me to the

975
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:31,009
iesg

976
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:35,570
and we need some comments from the

977
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:40,650
community and also the six eight chairs

978
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:42,960
yeah okay yes I mean what compressed

979
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:45,270
called completed without any comments so

980
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,300
I left it kind of opening that maybe

981
00:53:45,270 --> 00:53:50,430
that would be late commands and well I

982
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,050
wanted to discuss now what we do with

983
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:54,470
this document so we have not getting

984
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:57,690
commands we have experimental code it's

985
00:53:54,470 --> 00:54:00,390
it does what it's supposed to do it's

986
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:02,280
just one possible scheduling function it

987
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:06,109
doesn't tell you that everybody has to

988
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:08,580
schedule this way so I think that's

989
00:54:06,109 --> 00:54:10,619
that's good enough even if we don't have

990
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:12,598
come well good let's call commands to

991
00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:15,839
move forward with this document and ask

992
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:19,560
for publication they wanted to get worst

993
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:21,150
advice on that there were a number of

994
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:28,220
people working of our long time on this

995
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:30,270
document and so as an extra and so

996
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:31,770
personally if there's not interest in

997
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:33,150
the looking to progress it I don't want

998
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:35,670
it but if it's like bunch of

999
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:37,380
implementations and doing it I think

1000
00:54:35,670 --> 00:54:39,390
it's like a mitigating factor so like

1001
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:42,630
you know just try a couple more times to

1002
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:45,629
prod a few people personally the draft

1003
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,830
as possible for instance Ryan you seem

1004
00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,410
to be very interested in this topic

1005
00:54:46,830 --> 00:54:51,180
would you would you mind I mean I mean

1006
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,899
if we reopen the welcome press color or

1007
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,879
you know wait

1008
00:54:51,900 --> 00:55:00,770
- to a skull publication would you mind

1009
00:54:53,880 --> 00:55:04,920
trying to do a review of it yeah just

1010
00:55:00,770 --> 00:55:10,529
you know make sure for you as if you

1011
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:13,950
want it to implement so so Ryan is an

1012
00:55:10,529 --> 00:55:16,079
example of somebody who read it and did

1013
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,308
not ask funny change in the walk of

1014
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,779
Lascaux because he was okay with this

1015
00:55:17,309 --> 00:55:20,160
back that's fine so it's really a

1016
00:55:18,779 --> 00:55:22,589
question of you know it's just sentim

1017
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:24,690
sure it's fine and that's it like I I

1018
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:26,490
don't mind like just doing you like the

1019
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:28,559
I'll you get I your to the review for it

1020
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:30,000
anyway so if you find like one of the

1021
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,250
people who look look at it and say it's

1022
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,079
okay and this has been a long-standing

1023
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:36,960
work in this working group program we

1024
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:40,380
started with other documents which

1025
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,520
migrated into this one I mean it so it's

1026
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,200
been a long-standing and there are

1027
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,720
multiple people working on it I'm pretty

1028
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,279
confident it's quite good and then it's

1029
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:48,509
like a no - repo you

1030
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:49,920
somebody could devise another ones

1031
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:51,450
that's like we impose that everybody

1032
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,490
worked this way it's just just

1033
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:55,529
totalizing at its one possible way of

1034
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,939
doing this job that's fine and as long

1035
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:58,559
as you document like in the Shepherd

1036
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,630
right up the implementations as well

1037
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:02,339
let's could be very useful like you know

1038
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:05,010
the question comes up why it's it needed

1039
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:07,680
okay so thankful if you can send out the

1040
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,329
implementation info to like or past

1041
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,180
color Thomas L know who's gonna ship at

1042
00:56:09,329 --> 00:56:13,470
it or somebody else Melissa movie but

1043
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:17,390
this was already on one of the slides

1044
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,390
before no no in that Shepherd right I

1045
00:56:18,529 --> 00:56:24,270
started actually and all the rest go now

1046
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:26,549
if somebody's interesting in experiment

1047
00:56:24,270 --> 00:56:28,049
experimenting with shepherding I can let

1048
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:30,089
the you know give away the job but

1049
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:37,680
otherwise I will be just doing it sounds

1050
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:41,160
good thanks just additional information

1051
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:45,359
also the MSF was implemented in the

1052
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,140
sixty simulator and also there's also a

1053
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:47,880
pending

1054
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,538
pull request in the Kentucky energy

1055
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,910
about it so they're made there are many

1056
00:56:50,539 --> 00:56:57,990
implementation of emesis that's what as

1057
00:56:53,910 --> 00:57:00,240
far as I know and we have we have a

1058
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:02,549
comment from from jabber

1059
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,779
yes Yuki Tanaka saying that he will

1060
00:57:02,549 --> 00:57:08,710
review the latest MSF draft and

1061
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:10,360
comments on the mailing list yes I will

1062
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:23,170
be waiting for your review comments

1063
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:25,990
before pushing the button thank you and

1064
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:29,830
so I don't see Michael coming so like we

1065
00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:35,200
so before it might be in rats so anyway

1066
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:38,799
I could I could just push these slides

1067
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:40,899
and we can just look at them basically

1068
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:44,230
the work is no more happening at 60 it's

1069
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,970
it's all about saying eh it's happening

1070
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:49,560
elsewhere we keep 60 show where as long

1071
00:57:45,970 --> 00:57:52,180
as 60 she's interested which it is and

1072
00:57:49,560 --> 00:58:02,680
then you know that does not change the

1073
00:57:52,180 --> 00:58:04,870
the destiny of six - in any fashion so

1074
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:06,910
basically yes I mean that little to

1075
00:58:04,870 --> 00:58:08,859
consider what's going on at at Lake we

1076
00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:11,560
need to look at follow-on constraint

1077
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:15,660
voucher which is really the future of

1078
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:15,660
this document that's pretty much it

1079
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:27,780
so if yes the basically the rest of this

1080
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:30,990
session is to talk about the future of

1081
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:33,210
this work and the only document that

1082
00:58:30,990 --> 00:58:36,029
could have still be opened in the

1083
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:39,120
working group would be this so can

1084
00:58:36,030 --> 00:58:41,490
office T if the discussion leads to -

1085
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:44,130
you know closing the working group then

1086
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:47,790
we'll see if we need to reopen this

1087
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:49,890
document in like or just you know

1088
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:51,090
consider that it's whatever happens in

1089
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:57,540
the other working groups is enough to

1090
00:58:51,090 --> 00:58:59,370
cover zero touch description so that's

1091
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:04,440
something we can discuss outline with

1092
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:05,759
the like lectures as well yeah as as you

1093
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:09,540
said it doesn't make a difference to

1094
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:10,920
what's gonna happen - six - and so I'm I

1095
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:18,660
think you can just get started off how

1096
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:21,990
does it stay here well the question to

1097
00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,940
the room now is do people see that there

1098
00:59:21,990 --> 00:59:25,439
is work that should happen in this

1099
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,360
working group for which we were not

1100
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:30,360
chartered is there an interesting

1101
00:59:27,360 --> 00:59:34,340
discussion that we could for which we

1102
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:37,380
would need to create new documents my

1103
00:59:34,340 --> 00:59:40,020
reading of what's going on is there are

1104
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:42,510
two main aspects which I've been

1105
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:44,970
discussed in these three of six station

1106
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:48,050
from which we did not complete work one

1107
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:52,560
was scheduling time slots along a track

1108
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:54,990
and the other one was shuffling the the

1109
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:57,330
cells in order to defeat some some

1110
00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:00,899
tracking attacks that was Marcos work

1111
00:59:57,330 --> 01:00:04,200
makuu Tanaka's work in both cases it

1112
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:07,350
seems to me that the work is not really

1113
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:12,629
ITF work but mostly I Triple E work if

1114
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:17,069
it happens and so I hardly see that we

1115
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:20,160
need our canvas which other 6-4 under

1116
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:23,400
viewing this work which tells me that

1117
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:27,779
all the work that I was aware of that

1118
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:30,540
was supposed to happen at 6:00 - is now

1119
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:34,380
past well group Glasgow apart from the

1120
01:00:30,540 --> 01:00:36,029
zero touch thing which also tells me

1121
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:39,540
that unless somebody just

1122
01:00:36,030 --> 01:00:42,810
now to say hey we've got new work this

1123
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:46,980
is probably the last time we meet so I

1124
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:49,080
talked to Eric and Suresh and well the

1125
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:51,900
advice was pretty much this right we

1126
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:54,270
complete the document that we have

1127
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:56,550
running so we keep the mailing list

1128
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:57,150
active we keep the workgroup quoted code

1129
01:00:56,550 --> 01:00:59,580
following

1130
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:03,210
see all those documents goes through the

1131
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:05,279
iesg we probably don't need to meet

1132
01:01:03,210 --> 01:01:09,360
again as a working group at the IETF

1133
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:11,370
and we keep the mailing list active for

1134
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:16,200
the future just in case that's pretty

1135
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:17,910
much yeah suresh krisshnan so that kind

1136
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:19,319
of makes sense right so one thing I kind

1137
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:21,089
of like I wanna add there is like let's

1138
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,160
say in this period we keep it open if

1139
01:01:21,090 --> 01:01:26,370
something comes up we will see how

1140
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,649
things go but yeah generally I see this

1141
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:31,049
heading for closure

1142
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:34,160
rather than a recharger right well it's

1143
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:36,870
like some amazing what comes up why not

1144
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:39,359
now it's not like the work on all this

1145
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:42,420
is finished like I said we are trying to

1146
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:45,540
create row at the routing area which

1147
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:48,690
will focus on the concept of track and

1148
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:53,070
generalize it over multiple macfay so

1149
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:54,750
people in the room invited to follow the

1150
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:56,490
work which happens in reliable and

1151
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:59,190
viable wireless which is really the

1152
01:01:56,490 --> 01:02:01,790
logical continuation of this particular

1153
01:01:59,190 --> 01:02:04,890
aspect of the six dish architecture

1154
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:07,140
Marko confirm rise and just comment to

1155
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:09,270
clarify my personal opinion on the

1156
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:12,589
belonging of the draft on circuit of

1157
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:15,509
jamming and schedule shuffling to ITF or

1158
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:17,850
typically I think it belongs to ITF in

1159
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:20,880
fact just reading the introduction from

1160
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:22,200
the Charter it mentions 15-4 does not

1161
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:24,630
define how the network communication

1162
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,430
scale was built so this is a kind of a

1163
01:02:24,630 --> 01:02:28,410
gray area because the attempt here was

1164
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:31,319
to complete the building of the schedule

1165
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:33,180
in fact second in the latest discussions

1166
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,520
we had in the list in the draft mostly

1167
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:37,169
with militia and Michael Richards and we

1168
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,140
were starting to think about how to

1169
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:43,820
handle the king as to the keys use for

1170
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:46,230
that permutation possibly to Inca GP and

1171
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:49,640
that working is something is definitely

1172
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:59,990
not going to happen ethically

1173
01:02:49,640 --> 01:03:02,058
so do you have comments on that show so

1174
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:05,299
my personal opinion is the document is

1175
01:03:02,059 --> 01:03:08,089
like in-between in what considers the

1176
01:03:05,299 --> 01:03:10,519
the scheduling part it's more I Triple E

1177
01:03:08,089 --> 01:03:12,799
related while what considers how the

1178
01:03:10,519 --> 01:03:15,109
schedule is built is related to six dish

1179
01:03:12,799 --> 01:03:18,200
so there are both aspects to the story

1180
01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:23,509
in my opinion the Rakeem can happen over

1181
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:25,098
here though is there energy I mean we

1182
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,750
can you can start to walk using the

1183
01:03:25,099 --> 01:03:29,000
mailing list and depending on how that

1184
01:03:26,750 --> 01:03:34,490
progresses we can decide to beat again

1185
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:36,559
on this suresh krisshnan so marco do you

1186
01:03:34,490 --> 01:03:38,509
think you can split up the pieces of the

1187
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,400
draft into stuff that's relevant here

1188
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:42,680
and just put the rest of the stuff in an

1189
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,630
appendix so we can so which rough that

1190
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:47,839
because we luckily jamming two things

1191
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:49,490
right well okay so jamming one is

1192
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:51,170
freaking one that's to read different

1193
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:52,788
aspects right so do you want to focus

1194
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,710
the discussion on jamming because we

1195
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:57,640
discussed a lot on jamming last time I

1196
01:03:54,710 --> 01:04:00,890
talked to him about the details but

1197
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:03,410
there was a big reason why it could not

1198
01:04:00,890 --> 01:04:04,730
be done at the apparel a yeah I mean I

1199
01:04:03,410 --> 01:04:06,379
need to go through the minutes of

1200
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:08,900
lifestyle because now it escapes my mind

1201
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:11,240
but but you mean the full software

1202
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:12,859
implementation of this sorry you need

1203
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:14,750
the full software implementation of this

1204
01:04:12,859 --> 01:04:16,759
the moment some hardware module is

1205
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:18,559
involved we say that really moves to

1206
01:04:16,759 --> 01:04:20,720
Italy there was something beyond that

1207
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:26,690
that to do we security or something like

1208
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:28,308
that I forgot do you remember something

1209
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:31,670
about it what we discussed last time

1210
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:33,890
Tarot last time we discussed the you

1211
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:36,609
know Marcos proposal on shuffling that

1212
01:04:33,890 --> 01:04:40,190
the time slot to defeat tracking attacks

1213
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:43,788
we ended up with a problem which was

1214
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:45,890
related to security which made it so

1215
01:04:43,789 --> 01:04:48,109
that you had to do something at I Triple

1216
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:50,269
E to make it work and I just don't

1217
01:04:48,109 --> 01:04:54,440
remember the details of that but that

1218
01:04:50,269 --> 01:04:57,399
was my conclusion of last time is if we

1219
01:04:54,440 --> 01:05:01,009
go through the minute that we could only

1220
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:02,540
progress that work with changes that the

1221
01:05:01,009 --> 01:05:05,690
I Triple E level that

1222
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:08,420
was that's my memory of last time okay

1223
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:09,530
so suresh krisshnan again so marco can

1224
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:11,360
you start a thread on the mailing list

1225
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,740
trying to see if there's an interest to

1226
01:05:11,360 --> 01:05:14,360
work on this because it may or may not

1227
01:05:12,740 --> 01:05:15,830
be relevant is one thing is their

1228
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:17,720
energies and other things I want to see

1229
01:05:15,830 --> 01:05:18,980
both of them okay so start a thread on

1230
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:21,020
the mailing list we're not closing the

1231
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,790
group right now right so I would think

1232
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:25,490
like probably a year away or something

1233
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:27,020
right kind of the timeline so if you can

1234
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:30,529
drum up support for the work and this

1235
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:32,360
relevant stuff will do it I can start it

1236
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:34,580
again because there was support in the

1237
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:36,350
group with three positive reviews when

1238
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:37,870
authors asked for adoption but there was

1239
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:40,549
never a call happening

1240
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:42,440
yeah but then like I said last time we

1241
01:05:40,550 --> 01:05:45,650
discussed it extensively at this meeting

1242
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:48,260
and my memories that we could not do it

1243
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,850
here because it had dependencies on I

1244
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:52,660
Triple E that we could not solve it in

1245
01:05:49,850 --> 01:05:55,069
this room that's my memory of it right

1246
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:57,950
and maybe wrong but I mean you're

1247
01:05:55,070 --> 01:05:59,210
welcome to to to like start a thread on

1248
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:01,009
the mailing list and see where we are

1249
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:03,500
and make sure see if my memory is

1250
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:06,590
correct on this for the scheduling of

1251
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:09,730
cells we want it to do here to do that

1252
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:12,680
work here initially it could have been

1253
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:15,200
everywhere because it's mostly defining

1254
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:18,410
a data model that comes from you know

1255
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,240
magical guard up there and it's being

1256
01:06:18,410 --> 01:06:23,480
pushed to the devices it's a data model

1257
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:25,399
thing an information model so do we

1258
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:30,530
define this data model information model

1259
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:32,330
at the HF hie I mean it's this gray area

1260
01:06:30,530 --> 01:06:34,310
it could have happened here but the

1261
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:36,290
point is we lost the energy nobody

1262
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:38,480
really did anything there that one

1263
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:40,340
document started and they died so

1264
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:44,030
keeping shout out for something and nope

1265
01:06:40,340 --> 01:06:45,850
no people doing the job doesn't help now

1266
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:48,560
if we see those documents showing up

1267
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:50,630
then so how it will be in your hands to

1268
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:52,520
tell us then we continue we meet yeah

1269
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:54,980
that's what I said like so marker starts

1270
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,900
like to see if there's like interest and

1271
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:59,000
support and relevance and then if it is

1272
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:01,430
we can't we take it if not no right

1273
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,040
that's pretty much it like so in my mind

1274
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:05,750
there is no I supposed to you're

1275
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,370
shuffling idea which is great by the way

1276
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:11,330
so that's why you get positive reviews

1277
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:13,279
including me there is no position why it

1278
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:15,560
should be I triple your ITF it's a date

1279
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:16,320
about oh now I understand right we don't

1280
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,690
want to discuss

1281
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,160
actual technology I'm just talking about

1282
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:22,170
the mechanics how we can go about this

1283
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,879
right so let's let's do this on the list

1284
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:25,560
like this like few people here that's

1285
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,960
like I don't want to make the decision

1286
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:29,490
here but just go on the list see this

1287
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,500
interests and then we'll figure out what

1288
01:07:29,490 --> 01:07:33,359
to do right as I said we have time time

1289
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:35,010
to figure this out it's not urgent sir

1290
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:37,140
and then there's this question of

1291
01:07:35,010 --> 01:07:40,590
freaking so my memory my status in my

1292
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:42,330
own mind of freaking was like most of

1293
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:44,300
the time it's not useful because ASN

1294
01:07:42,330 --> 01:07:47,009
will not show up or something like that

1295
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,290
everything is useful when you want to

1296
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:50,850
evacuate some devices because that's

1297
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:55,200
pretty much the only way you can get

1298
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:57,600
away you can remove somebody yes so so

1299
01:07:55,200 --> 01:08:00,960
what else exactly needs to be done is

1300
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:04,860
what I'm confused so why do we need to

1301
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:06,360
work on wreaking the moment good

1302
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:09,720
membership change you're supposed to

1303
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:11,280
recognize anyway and we found a way to

1304
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,259
distribute new piece for this

1305
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,870
permutation together with the process

1306
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:17,609
described in code JP and that has some

1307
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:19,260
complications for the moment where you

1308
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:21,690
have overlapping between the old king

1309
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,220
material and a new one and we were

1310
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:24,929
starting to think of a way to handle

1311
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:27,570
that issue there were similar discussion

1312
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:29,040
with militia in my own on the list is a

1313
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:31,469
clarification we're talking about

1314
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:33,510
interaction of the permutation mechanism

1315
01:08:31,470 --> 01:08:35,490
by Marko and minimal security minimal

1316
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:38,580
security already defines the wreaking

1317
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:41,010
mechanism which doesn't play so well

1318
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:46,080
with the permutation mechanism of

1319
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:48,359
Marcus's correct so if your mechanism

1320
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,390
comes into play we will have to look at

1321
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:54,720
keys as well as long as we don't do the

1322
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:58,109
permutation game what we have is good

1323
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:00,420
enough absolutely ok let's retry Frank

1324
01:08:58,109 --> 01:09:02,460
stuff but it's not our intention to

1325
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:05,040
change anything in Kahn's opinion the

1326
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:06,660
way it works this is just an extension

1327
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:08,550
more keys to be delivered in the

1328
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:10,680
wreaking messages and how you can make

1329
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:13,010
this very wrecking work it has no impact

1330
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:15,470
on code rip itself does it mean that

1331
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:25,100
everything could be done in one document

1332
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:27,330
that's ideal to me also interpret

1333
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:30,150
interoperability is something we are

1334
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:32,340
quite interested now since the standards

1335
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:34,979
wrapping up and there are many updates

1336
01:09:32,340 --> 01:09:38,100
since the last plug test I'm just

1337
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:44,639
wondering is there any plan for plaque

1338
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:47,010
test like 460 Sh well thankfully you can

1339
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,050
speak on the elf of tomorrow something

1340
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:56,310
tom has been rereading that kind of

1341
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:59,640
activity yeah so why no for planning I

1342
01:09:56,310 --> 01:10:02,580
need to talk with Thomas to see other

1343
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:05,240
plane what I know is a judge is working

1344
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:07,620
on some trying to do some

1345
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:12,690
interoperability with Kentucky

1346
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:16,610
implantation so yeah we may doing

1347
01:10:12,690 --> 01:10:21,960
something but I can let you know later

1348
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:23,790
thanks from Deborah we have a question

1349
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,920
from Diego - Horner what would happen

1350
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:30,660
with potential new scheduling functions

1351
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,610
if they ever appear like we said we have

1352
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:35,910
a mailing list we don't close the

1353
01:10:32,610 --> 01:10:37,589
working group we just don't have a plan

1354
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:39,120
to meet next time that's pretty much

1355
01:10:37,590 --> 01:10:41,910
where we are right now I mean there is

1356
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,559
not enough content that's very active to

1357
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,240
justify asking for a meeting next time

1358
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,620
unless you know something explodes on

1359
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:49,590
the mailing list and then well so well

1360
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,300
on this side which might sounds good so

1361
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:53,040
like a suresh krisshnan so the working

1362
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:54,570
group is kind of gonna go dormant like

1363
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,950
waiting for the documents to finish and

1364
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:57,929
if what comes up it's happened before

1365
01:10:55,950 --> 01:11:00,059
like same thing happened for dat right

1366
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:02,250
so we didn't meet like twice and then

1367
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:04,500
they did like so documents came up and

1368
01:11:02,250 --> 01:11:06,390
they found work so it's really about

1369
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:10,200
like work showing up and interests in it

1370
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:12,090
to keep it going but the default is it's

1371
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:13,530
gonna close if nothing let's say we put

1372
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:17,490
a time line once the documents are done

1373
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:20,460
its closest that's the plan but it's

1374
01:11:17,490 --> 01:11:24,360
open until then really do if not

1375
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:27,510
something new comes up we continue yes I

1376
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,610
believe that 60-ish was a fantastic

1377
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:31,950
experience it was very interesting in

1378
01:11:29,610 --> 01:11:34,410
the fact that it was orchestrating a lot

1379
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:36,030
of work in multiple documents and

1380
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:39,780
providing the architecture that ties

1381
01:11:36,030 --> 01:11:40,929
them all together and so that's one

1382
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:43,719
aspect of it the second

1383
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:46,270
spectres driving open-source there were

1384
01:11:43,720 --> 01:11:47,980
multiple open-source implementation and

1385
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:52,360
the working group also acted as a hub

1386
01:11:47,980 --> 01:11:54,309
outside of the IETF to to integrate

1387
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,160
those those open-source implementations

1388
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:59,020
and finally the interaction with Etsy

1389
01:11:57,160 --> 01:12:02,110
for all this black test

1390
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:03,910
so those three aspects put together and

1391
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:06,219
orchestrate it from within an IETF

1392
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:08,200
walking Rock I think that was a really

1393
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,450
really interesting experience and that

1394
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:13,179
leads to effective code running and

1395
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:16,030
interpreting open-source implementation

1396
01:12:13,180 --> 01:12:19,570
and RFC's here and in multiple groups I

1397
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:22,420
think this group did very well and I

1398
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:24,340
wish to thank you know us probably the

1399
01:12:22,420 --> 01:12:26,140
best last time we meet I wish to thank

1400
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:28,420
the IDS and and all the participants of

1401
01:12:26,140 --> 01:12:31,000
other like like six or seven years for

1402
01:12:28,420 --> 01:12:45,340
which we did six - for the intensive

1403
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:49,830
work that happened okay and we are just

1404
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:49,830
scheduling you back an hour of your life

1405
01:12:50,040 --> 01:13:03,190
so I would like to say we bit again but

1406
01:12:55,150 --> 01:13:07,990
no the meeting is that wrong did

1407
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:10,259
everybody sign the blue sheets everybody

1408
01:13:07,990 --> 01:13:10,260
signed

1409
01:13:16,579 --> 01:13:21,170
you

1410
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:21,170
[Music]

1411
01:13:31,180 --> 01:13:33,240
you
