5
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:51,550
right after a really nice snack break

6
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:52,930
because no one shows up so we have much

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:55,569

circulating please do sign the blue

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,730
sheets that helps both identify who's in

40
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:35,939
the room as well as how big a room we

41
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,939
get

42
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:44,629
we have two sessions the first session

43
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,719
you're here now so thank you

44
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:50,200
agenda is unmodified so this has been

45
00:02:47,719 --> 00:02:55,280
what's basically been posted for a while

46
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:57,108
for the second session this is the

47
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,900
second session great we've had a little

48
00:02:57,109 --> 00:03:03,769
bit of a change the one number ten and

49
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:10,159
bold is in addition a late request that

50
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:14,950
was added I think we've been doing a

51
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,950
better job of using the list as well as

52
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,709
incremental meetings or periodic

53
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:23,599
meetings among working group authors

54
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:26,090
that all of those are advertised on less

55
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,108
than open to all we've been doing a

56
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,780
pretty good job but it's really

57
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:31,489
important when there's a discussion to

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,370
use the list as much as possible that

59
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:35,840
ensures that well for new drafts and

60
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,359
ensures that the working group is aware

61
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,579
of what you're doing for working group

62
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:43,609
drafts it helps ensure that we have good

63
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:46,879
communication and good agreement and on

64
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:50,989
the drafts and as we know we're here to

65
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:57,108
have a consensus on drafts to submit for

66
00:03:50,989 --> 00:03:59,389
publication as RFC's we follow an IPR

67
00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:00,949
disclosure process here I think most

68
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:03,229
people are familiar with it at this

69
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:08,439
point but basically we do formal IPR

70
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:11,930
calls at both adoption and last call and

71
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:13,849
response by all contributors and authors

72
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,099
is required in order to move to the next

73
00:04:13,849 --> 00:04:20,289
stage whether that be adoption or

74
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:20,289
submission to the IESE for publication

75
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:28,159
since the last meeting we've had three

76
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:32,750
RFC's published so that's that's really

77
00:04:28,159 --> 00:04:36,080
great we we sort of were a little slow

78
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:40,070
getting going but now we are pushing out

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,710
documents which is a reflection of the

80
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:45,620
work that those in the room and those on

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:48,289
the list have helped us achieve so thank

82
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,960
you for all your work we have a number

83
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:52,020
of documentaries

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,090
that have gone through last call we're

85
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:56,479
gonna talk about status on those we

86
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:01,770
don't have to talk about details on them

87
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:05,758
and they're on the as I said they're on

88
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,349
the agenda we have some document we only

89
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,960
have one document that's not on the

90
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:15,719
agenda that's the bounded latency we

91
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,549
don't do we have anyone in the room who

92
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,430
is a bounded latency author Ethan is do

93
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,979
you know what the plan is for Sean

94
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,360
sorry not Ethan Sean what's the plan for

95
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:31,219
the next update of the document please

96
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,220
come to the mic and let us know

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,409
state your name and tell us what the

98
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,289
plan is the next step yes some mama who

99
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:57,979
from epfl

100
00:05:53,289 --> 00:06:01,000
the idea is that for the next draft for

101
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:03,919
the next ITF you are planning to

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,919
finalize some sections that are related

103
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,250
to the calculation of the delay bound

104
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:13,099
which is mostly some mechanism that is

105
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:17,569
the depth that can be used in debt net

106
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:25,280
and we hope that we can finish it in

107
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:29,440
IETF 108 which is in I guess to have a

108
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:34,190
final version of the whole draft to be

109
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,780
to go for the next level right and for

110
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:37,909
the current for the current state we

111
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:41,239
have some terminology update and some

112
00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:44,300
consistency check for that net based on

113
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:47,750
the other drafts that is existing and

114
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,259
that's it great thank you for that they

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,259
appreciate it

116
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,849
so where are we in terms of our

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,620
deliverables and milestones we had a set

118
00:06:55,849 --> 00:07:01,400
of core deliverables that were called

119
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,250
out when the working group was formed we

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,080
are really in good shape compared to

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,060
where we were let's say a year ago we

122
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,030
have our overall architecture published

123
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,539
we have the core data plain documents

124
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:16,638
that have passed last call and the the

125
00:07:14,539 --> 00:07:18,740
debt net over TSN was the first

126
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,440
technology subnetwork technology that we

127
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:25,849
had called out and we those documents

128
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,830
are closed you'll hear from the authors

129
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,380
how close we are hopefully we'll see

130
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:33,169
something IETF 107 that we can get to

131
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,509
last call the flow information document

132
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:38,990
also is proceeding along and we do hope

133
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:40,960
to get to last call there was some

134
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,880
discussion that you'll hear about

135
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,489
between the flow information model

136
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:48,560
authors and the yang models authors and

137
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,800
there might be some additional updates

138
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,099
based on that the egg models were is on

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,529
the agenda and that's in process the the

140
00:07:55,099 --> 00:08:00,320
other part of that was pretty important

141
00:07:57,529 --> 00:08:02,210
that was called out in the Charter

142
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:04,340
and my initial milestones was the

143
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,969
security document and we're looking to

144
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:09,650
do last call by IETF 107 that too is on

145
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,470
the agenda we'll get an update one of

146
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:14,508
the points that came up with our Adu is

147
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:16,190
whether to do an early review or just a

148
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,870
standard review from the security area

149
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:20,030
we're actually going to request an early

150
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:25,100
review as soon as the authors tell us

151
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:27,138
that they think it's good to go so we

152
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:33,320
have a question of what's next and this

153
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:35,709
question is based on who would like to

154
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:40,459
contribute to what and then what the

155
00:08:35,708 --> 00:08:44,660
iesg says is our ID say is acceptable

156
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:46,760
work activities for the working group

157
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:51,500
and we've thrown out a couple of items

158
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:53,510
and the this the the intent here is to

159
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,720
spend a couple of minutes just getting

160
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,589
the reaction of the room but will a mean

161
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,510
towards a Charter discussion at the next

162
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,660
meeting and some of that Charter

163
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:10,370
discussion may also bring in some of the

164
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,550
results of the raw Boff where that

165
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:19,670
discussion was really I took it as debt

166
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:21,979
net over wireless my are no last week

167
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,060
for myself and you can agree our hope is

168
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:28,760
is that that is becomes a complementary

169
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:32,089
activity whether the isg chooses to do

170
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:33,950
it as a its own working group or within

171
00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:37,010
this working group either way as long as

172
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,860
the works done I think will I think we

173
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,900
should all see it as a benefit so that

174
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,160
maybe also something that brings in that

175
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:45,050
we'll have to watch what happens with

176
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,610
the isg is the result of the of that

177
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:52,040
Boff so Lou Anderson I'm obviously not

178
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:55,640
up to speed really so the security

179
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:01,490
document what state is that in now very

180
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:11,569
close really close to what you guys

181
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:13,730
cause okay I don't have a look at either

182
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:22,249
microphone or away from the mic

183
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:23,689
okay david black yeah told me security

184
00:10:22,249 --> 00:10:25,189
documents oh yeah a lot of good work on

185
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:27,980
security documents lot of good texts in

186
00:10:25,189 --> 00:10:31,248
there however one of the reasons

187
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:33,439
requesting an early security area review

188
00:10:31,249 --> 00:10:35,600
is the IHF version of no battle plan

189
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,129
survives initial contact with the enemy

190
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,299
we could see some interesting things

191
00:10:37,129 --> 00:10:39,939
come out of that review and the sooner

192
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:43,269
the sooner we learn that the better

193
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,269
great thank you

194
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:49,849
so one of the reason one of the items

195
00:10:47,989 --> 00:10:51,619
here was a set up for someone who we

196
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:53,480
thought would be in the room but instead

197
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:55,939
we'll just go talk refer to his may list

198
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,259
so greg mirskiy sent a comment to the

199
00:10:55,939 --> 00:11:03,738
list about the OEM for MPLS and document

200
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:05,389
and we had oh here he is and we he

201
00:11:03,739 --> 00:11:07,029
didn't come to the mic so also we'll

202
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,980
talk about it

203
00:11:07,029 --> 00:11:14,439
so the he's gonna come to the mic so

204
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:14,439
they will give him a minute

205
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:33,770
Gregg Marissa tea well their authors

206
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,910
believe that om for dead net over in the

207
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:40,279
West Network provides their needed

208
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,250
technical solution and the document is

209
00:11:40,279 --> 00:11:49,000
stable and we would like to work in

210
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:53,960
group consider adoption of this work

211
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,330
okay thank you we so we had talked about

212
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,750
this at the last meeting and there was

213
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:03,770
some moderate support the issue with why

214
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,870
we didn't do an adoption until now was

215
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:07,160
there was very few people who would read

216
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:09,680
it the people who had read it seem to

217
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:13,370
have liked it but very few at this point

218
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:16,219
our feeling is we're gonna do an

219
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:19,550
adoption call and see if there's

220
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,550
sufficient support and if there isn't

221
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:24,920
we'll go we'll go from there right so if

222
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:26,390
I may lean in really close because I'm

223
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:27,770
sorry there's just a lot of noise but no

224
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:29,089
don't get close because there's noise

225
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,490
behind that be calm okay

226
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:33,260
because actually I hear it's very well

227
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,400
miss so that's why I'm stepping back

228
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:42,920
because okay so you probably aware that

229
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:46,459
there is another document for om over

230
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:50,110
death net IP I've sent some proposal

231
00:12:46,459 --> 00:12:54,910
because in opinion of offers there is a

232
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:59,209
big challenge technical problem of

233
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:02,240
mapping or a.m. session between and

234
00:12:59,209 --> 00:13:06,229
points are on to their death net IP flow

235
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,420
that to be monitored so I send some

236
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:10,279
proposal appreciate your comments

237
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:14,079
thoughts let's discuss it in the mailing

238
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:17,540
list and then once we reach some

239
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:20,330
solution that we agree with then we'll

240
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,660
get to their consideration for adoption

241
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:26,990
of second document it's great I really

242
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:29,439
appreciate you fostering the discussion

243
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:29,440
in that area

244
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:36,380
I have hunger I have a question about

245
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,560
the chatter actually we eat bean

246
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,220
it helped me well we are contribute in

247
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:48,349
the work of SR v6 bass that's not and

248
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:50,779
the others including me are very very

249
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,730
confused whether this part of work it

250
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:56,709
belongs to the current chatter or it

251
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:59,570
will be included in the rich header part

252
00:13:56,709 --> 00:14:01,518
I think it's a good discussion to have

253
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:07,070
one of the things that we'll have to

254
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:09,579
work out is is that work happen here or

255
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:12,740
in spring

256
00:14:09,579 --> 00:14:14,810
generally the if you're talking about

257
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:17,600
new data playing mechanisms you go to

258
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:19,160
the group that owns owns that unless

259
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,690
there's an agreement to do it elsewhere

260
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:27,680
right now they own the data that data

261
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:30,440
plane so we would need agreement from

262
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,089
that working group to do it here without

263
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:36,140
that agreement we're gonna assume that

264
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:38,839
it's gonna you would have to do the work

265
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:41,510
in spring so the new there I believe you

266
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,310
have a new data playing mechanism and

267
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:45,800
that probably will have to be done there

268
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,670
but it's a good topic to raise and we'll

269
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,589
have to work that out with our ad and

270
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:54,589
the ad of that group it's a different ad

271
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:57,860
so we'll have to work that out of where

272
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:02,060
the work happens actually I am totally

273
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:05,720
okay with doing that job being spring it

274
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,489
doesn't matter but I think because the

275
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,769
MPI is a face that than that and

276
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:13,399
ip-based and that belong standard so I

277
00:15:09,769 --> 00:15:15,890
think maybe naturally as a six basis and

278
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:19,910
that should belong to ten that as well

279
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:23,300
so I'm little confused and considering

280
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:28,339
that it is very busy in spring recently

281
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:31,399
and we have a time slot in spring in

282
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:34,459
previous session but there is no time

283
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:38,300
left for presentation and I think even

284
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:41,689
we have some time slot there will not be

285
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,800
a lot of discussions on that I think in

286
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,180
the current spring stage right

287
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,479
you have to go run over there it is

288
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:51,449
happening right now yes so as as the

289
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:56,040
older I prefer to put this part of work

290
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:58,890
in 10 L first I think sure but you the

291
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,980
chairs or AP have other suggestions we

292
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:03,860
can't discuss yes it's near technology

293
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:07,290
they're really gonna have first say oh

294
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,510
so it's really gonna be the working that

295
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:12,449
working group chairs call and then the

296
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:14,279
ad is call I think you know from our

297
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:16,380
perspective like that we were talking

298
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,600
about related to wireless we'd like to

299
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,630
see the work done and where it happens

300
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,370
is secondary but okay but they they sort

301
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:27,060
of have to say they don't want it before

302
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:30,600
we can say we want to take it okay so I

303
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,849
will talk with the chair self a spring

304
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,589
first sure and if that will be something

305
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,570
that we'll also talk over with our D

306
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:40,279
Deborah okay okay thank you

307
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:43,110
all right thank you any other comments

308
00:16:40,279 --> 00:16:46,920
please feel free to make also follow-on

309
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,980
comments to the list another great way

310
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,949
to ensure that your topic is included in

311
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,320
the discussion for IAT f-107 is to have

312
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:57,120
a draft that you can an individual draft

313
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,070
that you bring forward and submit

314
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,540
towards the debt networking group that

315
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:06,120
will help us make sure that we don't

316
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:07,918
miss your topic the this is our last

317
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:09,659
slide on the administrative piece we

318
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,110
want to give the working group a heads

319
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:18,419
up that were talking about doing another

320
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:23,240
joint session with with I Triple E at OU

321
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:27,449
2.1 TSN we had a really good session in

322
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:31,200
Bangkok after the IETF at the start of

323
00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:34,470
the the Bangkok I Triple E meeting so

324
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,290
that was exactly a year ago and we're

325
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:39,000
going back to Bangkok next year and the

326
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,120
I Triple E is meeting the week before us

327
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:45,990
so the thinking is we would like we'd

328
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:50,550
like to propose and investigate doing

329
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:56,429
another joint workshop or meeting on the

330
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:57,600
Saturday before the IETF so the I Triple

331
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:00,179
E ends on the fryer

332
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,418
we would immediately the next day we

333
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:05,730
would have the this meeting that's the

334
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:10,410
straw man proposal this is not yet

335
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,730
confirmed but we wanted to first let the

336
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:14,309
working group know that this is being

337
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,669
discussed and second just get a feeling

338
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,990
from the room of how many people a

339
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:21,059
participated in the last one so that'll

340
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:23,789
be question one and then question two is

341
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,080
would be interested or I'm not like

342
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:28,320
we're not looking for commitments but be

343
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:31,139
interested in participating in this next

344
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,030
one so well how many people participated

345
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:38,960
in the last one okay so it's it's a

346
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:42,720
small number but reasonable set and

347
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:48,299
interested in the if we have one next

348
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:51,000
year think they're they might attend so

349
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:55,260
a bit more so that's that that's helpful

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,840
thank you Greg mercy City question two

351
00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:02,669
chairs you think it will be the same

352
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:08,490
format as more lecture or discussion it

353
00:19:02,669 --> 00:19:12,450
depends a lot I would love to see more

354
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,490
discussions yes that was last time that

355
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:18,750
was the the first of this occasion and

356
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:24,809
maybe we should figure out ways to

357
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:28,740
foster more discussion okay depends on

358
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:30,629
how many people show up and we were when

359
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:32,760
we started we envisioned a small group

360
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,590
and it turned out to be a really big

361
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,510
group yes and that makes it a little

362
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,949
harder to get the discussion but it's a

363
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,700
it's good input that we should figure

364
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:43,590
out how to have foster more to spell I

365
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,809
think it's okay that we have the first

366
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,480
more like introduction to technologists

367
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:50,720
so might be in the second we can do

368
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,150
something for both parties

369
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,730
more like go for papers and people will

370
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:59,010
submit some proposals for the shorter

371
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:01,980
presentations so basically break it not

372
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,650
a big presentation that does an overview

373
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:10,020
over technology but people talk about

374
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:11,040
specific use cases and problems thank

375
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,950
you for that

376
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:21,240
good ideas okay we're gonna move now on

377
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:41,910
to the the first topic which is the

378
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:44,610
framework hi hi my name is manoj welcome

379
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:47,490
i will share you where we are with the

380
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:49,620
data paragraphs the first presentation

381
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:53,580
is about the framework you might

382
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:55,560
remember that we have decided to have a

383
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:58,169
building block approach regarding the

384
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:01,500
data playing drops so that is the first

385
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:03,990
of the a draft I will speak about each

386
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,920
of them so let's start with the with the

387
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:11,520
framework the current version of the

388
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:15,660
framework document is version 3 this

389
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,910
content is quite stable and it it is

390
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:20,760
providing an overall framework for a

391
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:22,650
deterministic network data plan so it is

392
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:25,440
covers the concept and the

393
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:28,560
considerations that are generally common

394
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,360
for any of the data animistic networking

395
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,460
data plain specifications inside the

396
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,770
document we have sections dealing with

397
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,280
the.net data plane there are some

398
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:44,250
encapsulation related consideration

399
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:50,970
deadness specific metadata's are also

400
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:55,140
covered we have framework topics on the

401
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:58,920
IP data plane and MPLS native line and

402
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:01,200
also some functions building blocks and

403
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:04,380
scenarios are covered like Service

404
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,410
protection aggregation and systems and

405
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,420
some network in the document we have

406
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:14,640
also a section dealing with the

407
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:17,450
controller plane considerations we have

408
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,560
the chef area review for this document

409
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:24,220
and there was a very last call it was

410
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:27,460
finished and the beginning of

411
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:30,400
Dober and we have received pretty good

412
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,350
comments how to improve the documents so

413
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,559
all the clarification a deteriorate

414
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:39,219
changes are resolved in the version 3

415
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:42,220
which is the current version so based on

416
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,850
that the authors think that it is ready

417
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:47,140
for submission for the EIS G so that is

418
00:22:45,850 --> 00:23:11,590
the current status on the framework

419
00:22:47,140 --> 00:23:15,360
document and it questions comments ok so

420
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:20,110
the next summer is about for data plane

421
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,629
documents two of them are the IP and

422
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:25,780
mpls data plane and two of them are

423
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:28,120
related to subnet scenarios where death

424
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:31,480
net nodes are interconnected over sub

425
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:33,520
network for each of this document we

426
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:38,980
have a version 3 and we will go through

427
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:42,400
all of them in the death net IP data

428
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:45,730
plane document it is specifying the

429
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:50,700
death net data plane over an IP packet

430
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:53,140
switch network in the current

431
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,010
specification of the IP data plane and

432
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:59,440
the format of the death net flow we

433
00:23:57,010 --> 00:24:03,220
don't have a sequence number so that

434
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,270
means that from that perspective we have

435
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:09,760
only forwarding sub-layer related

436
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:13,330
specification also the death IP data

437
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:15,129
plane procedures are described and we

438
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:16,960
have also section dealing with the

439
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,370
management and control information

440
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,299
summary based on the feedbacks and

441
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:27,399
discussions on the list there were one

442
00:24:24,299 --> 00:24:30,520
technical change in the document and it

443
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:34,870
is related to the ECN that ecn is

444
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:38,620
omitted from the flow identification

445
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:40,600
possibilities and there is also there

446
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:42,550
were some recent discussion and on the

447
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,090
list regarding the use of the five

448
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:48,550
topples and this is what I have

449
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:51,040
highlighted at the bottom of the of the

450
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:54,550
slide that in order to maximize the

451
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:59,500
reuse of five double based Mahoney's and

452
00:24:54,550 --> 00:25:03,280
solutions it is envisioned that an

453
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:06,210
system and that net application should

454
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:09,940
not mix that net and known that not

455
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:15,700
traffic within the same singular five

456
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:18,760
that work the next document is the MPLS

457
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:21,450
data planning document it is dealing

458
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:26,950
with the that net data plan when we have

459
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:29,980
MPLS based at work in case of MPLS we

460
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:31,780
have description for both sub layers for

461
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,360
the service sub layer and also the

462
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,639
forwarding sub layer and also the data

463
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,490
plane procedures are defined in the

464
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,440
document so the flow identifications we

465
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,480
are using labels and for the segment's

466
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,470
number that not control guard is used

467
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,210
and similarly to the previous data plane

468
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:52,780
document we have a management and

469
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:59,980
control playing related considerations

470
00:25:52,780 --> 00:26:02,440
in the document during the change of the

471
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,110
document there were only editorial

472
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:08,080
changes and fine tuning so the technical

473
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:13,620
content of the document has not changed

474
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:18,129
when we have created the version 3 and

475
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:20,020
now let's speak about the two data plane

476
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:23,200
documents which are dealing with subnets

477
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:27,280
scenarios the first is the IP over MPLS

478
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:31,510
document in that case to death net IP

479
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:34,320
nodes are interconnected over MPLS

480
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:38,440
subnet so that is the scenario but the

481
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,830
document covers it is describing the

482
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:45,520
data plane scenario the encapsulation

483
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:48,500
and it is also showing four IP over MPLS

484
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,389
procedures how the flow identification

485
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:54,830
and how the traffic treatment is that

486
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:56,720
and again as for all the data plan

487
00:26:54,830 --> 00:27:00,530
documents we have a management and

488
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,620
control information summary the same

489
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:05,990
apply for this document as well and we

490
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,330
have created version 3 there were only

491
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:11,120
editorial changes and fine tunings in

492
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:15,879
the document so it is also pretty pretty

493
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:21,139
quite stable and last let's speak about

494
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:26,870
the scenario where to mpls that nodes

495
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:29,330
are interconnected over IP subnet here

496
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:32,629
is a failure on the figure so death net

497
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:34,520
over that net MPLS over that IP is what

498
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:37,400
we are covering and this is also the

499
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:41,150
procedures that we are describing and

500
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:43,820
here again for preparation for the

501
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:46,730
controller plan discussions the

502
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:49,280
considerations regarding management and

503
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:54,790
control is also included in the document

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:57,379
that is that document had also just

505
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:00,050
editorial and fine tunings when we have

506
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:06,910
created the version 3 so it is quite in

507
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:09,500
a good shape and in a stable format so

508
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:12,790
currently with the version 3 of these

509
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:16,160
documents the Shefford view were done

510
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:20,210
and we have also a very brief last call

511
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:23,390
it finished 11th of November so this

512
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,670
version 3 is the latest version included

513
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:29,030
all the comments that we have for the

514
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:31,100
document during during the work and the

515
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:33,620
others think that these documents are in

516
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:37,639
a pretty good shape so that they are

517
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:42,800
ready for submission to the ESG and it

518
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:46,460
combines questions there was a comment

519
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:49,310
that came in this week the IP document

520
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,900
you want to talk to that yeah this is

521
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,929
something I have highlighted on the

522
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:57,440
slides this is not yet included in this

523
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:59,660
format I will make a version for for

524
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,670
that document in order to make that

525
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:02,300
happen and there were also comments

526
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:05,120
regarding

527
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,800
references normative and informative

528
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,959
references I think this is also

529
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,930
something should be cleaned up that was

530
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,210
also recently on the under list okay so

531
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,590
for the last slide you said that it's

532
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:19,310
ready it sounds like there's one more

533
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:22,639
version before yeah it's ready but I

534
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:25,250
think we know exactly that to do word by

535
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,290
word with that document so this is via

536
00:29:25,250 --> 00:29:29,360
thing that yes when that version four

537
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:32,840
are created then it is ready for the

538
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,169
submission okay maybe we can get it done

539
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:37,820
by the end of the session more but well

540
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:39,410
things are going on well we'll make the

541
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,450
changes and push them and get it

542
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:48,310
published that's that yeah as usual all

543
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:48,310
right thanks okay any comments questions

544
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:57,110
just a note it turns out everyone up

545
00:29:53,540 --> 00:30:01,060
here is a contributor to this work so

546
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:04,129
Ethan is actually shepherding this and

547
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:07,610
sort of owns owns the documents from a

548
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:09,500
process standpoint so let's just want to

549
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:17,600
make sure everyone knows that and Ethan

550
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:19,910
do you want to add anything not really

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,740
except that these are the first Shepherd

552
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,050
write-ups I've done and I still have the

553
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,030
marked as you know waiting for review so

554
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:27,500
I I appreciate a little bit of input

555
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:30,790
just to make sure they're everything's

556
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,790
consonant okay

557
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:47,160
okay and now let's speak about three

558
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,070
documents where we have was a new

559
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:52,049
content from the compared to the

560
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:55,678
previous version and they are the TSL

561
00:30:52,049 --> 00:30:58,620
related documents so we have two data

562
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,230
plain documents dealing with that over

563
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:03,600
TSN subnets scenario when we are

564
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:06,750
interconnecting IP or MPLS that not

565
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,709
nodes over TSN network and the last one

566
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:13,880
is dealing with the scenario when TSN

567
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:18,240
domains are interconnected by a dotnet

568
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:22,440
network for these documents we have

569
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:26,190
version 1 version 0 was created after

570
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:32,280
the split of the IP and mpls data pin

571
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:35,970
solution documents and these are

572
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,860
practically the new documents for the

573
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:40,080
documents we have created a new document

574
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:44,610
structure that is valid for all the

575
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:48,090
three and we have made at several points

576
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:51,389
clean up and we have also filled up with

577
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:56,389
some tags where we had not yet text so

578
00:31:51,390 --> 00:32:00,299
there are new stuff in these troughs

579
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:03,870
first we speak about when to IP dotnet

580
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:07,440
nodes are interconnected over a TSN sub

581
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:10,918
network because we are speaking about

582
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,169
that net IP data plane they should take

583
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:15,390
only about the debt net forwarding sub

584
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:18,570
layer so this is what is covered in the

585
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:21,450
document service protection is not

586
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:23,220
possible end to end however in the TSN

587
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:25,590
sub network this is something what you

588
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:30,510
can provide when you are interconnecting

589
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,250
the IP that net nodes on the right side

590
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:39,510
you can see the structure of the

591
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:42,750
document just below here you can see the

592
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,610
scenario so this is the TSN sub Network

593
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,779
and the two IP that not poles are

594
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:50,019
interconnected

595
00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:52,600
the concept to describe this scenario is

596
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:56,169
that we are focusing on IP that nodes

597
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,600
which are TSN aware so this is something

598
00:32:56,169 --> 00:33:01,659
you can see here on the right side so

599
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:04,449
this is the TSN of our talker or

600
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:08,139
listener so this is the role but IP debt

601
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:13,149
net node place from the TSN sub network

602
00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:15,360
perspective we have also collected the

603
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:19,539
management and control information

604
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,959
related aspects because you have to map

605
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:26,429
the debt NetFlow us to TSN streams when

606
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:30,970
you are crossing that that sub Network

607
00:33:26,429 --> 00:33:34,169
the document is containing requirements

608
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:37,149
for the for a TSN aware IP dotnet node

609
00:33:34,169 --> 00:33:39,519
such nodes are member both the

610
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:45,850
death-knell domain and the TSN sub

611
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:49,509
network within the TSN sub network that

612
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:54,519
IP that not node has a TSN a vertical or

613
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:57,129
listener role and the death net flow IDs

614
00:33:54,519 --> 00:34:00,730
and the flow related parameters

615
00:33:57,129 --> 00:34:03,639
requirements are met two related TSN

616
00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:06,669
Stream IDs and stream related parameters

617
00:34:03,639 --> 00:34:09,879
so this is a requirement that we what we

618
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:12,629
have to solve when we are speaking about

619
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:17,069
management and control plan

620
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:20,109
there is also some interesting scenario

621
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:22,810
when you are triggering the setup or a

622
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:26,739
modification of a TSN stream in the TSN

623
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:30,219
sub Network and this is where management

624
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:32,408
and control plane interactions might be

625
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:36,759
required between the death net and TS n

626
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:40,000
sub Network the document does not have

627
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:41,770
any requirements on TSN unaware IP that

628
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,699
not nodes because you have no new

629
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:48,219
requirements on them however this is

630
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:51,129
something that we have marked in the

631
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:55,689
management and control consideration

632
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:58,569
that in such a case is it might be even

633
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,190
more problematic or more complex to to

634
00:34:58,569 --> 00:35:02,880
start

635
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:05,670
such a triggering between the two domain

636
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:12,360
because the IP that not node is not at

637
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:14,880
all aware about that sub Network the

638
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,850
second sub not related scenario is

639
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:23,040
covered in the in the next document this

640
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:25,650
is the MPLS / TSM scenario where a TS

641
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,670
and sub network interconnecting two MPLS

642
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:33,180
dotnet nodes they are speaking about the

643
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:35,040
MPLS data plane so both the service and

644
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:39,180
the forwarding sub layer are described

645
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,880
in the document you can do service

646
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:45,629
protection both in the TSN domain and in

647
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:49,800
the MPLS that not domain however has

648
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:52,080
Service protection interworking can be

649
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,120
made this is something that is left for

650
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,080
further study in the current version of

651
00:35:54,120 --> 00:36:00,839
the document and here the concept is

652
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:03,390
very similar to the previous one so you

653
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:05,310
have your MPLS that not node and it

654
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:07,650
should be a TSM ever to occur or

655
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:14,160
listener from the TSN Sun network

656
00:36:07,650 --> 00:36:20,880
perspective so again you have to map the

657
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:26,009
MPLS death net flows to TSN streams in

658
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,860
the network so that means that that

659
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:33,300
these MPLS that not knows has a TSN ever

660
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:35,760
talk or listener role the flow ideas and

661
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,650
the related parameters have to be mapped

662
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,040
to the streams and the related

663
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:43,680
parameters and if you have to change

664
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,540
anything you need some triggering and

665
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,430
the interaction between the management

666
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:54,029
and control plane of the dotnet domain

667
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:56,430
and the TSN domain the same statement

668
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:59,970
applies for the TSN aware and pls that

669
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,870
not knows as I have said in the in the

670
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:05,910
previous case and just highlighted again

671
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:09,920
that the Service protection interworking

672
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:09,920
scenarios are left for further study

673
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:18,220
but not least we have a data plan

674
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:23,410
document dealing with the scenario had

675
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:28,149
to interconnect TSN domains over that

676
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:31,120
not MPLS network in this case the

677
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,490
concept is that the TSN stream what is

678
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,810
there inside the TSN domain it is

679
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:41,439
treated as a dotnet app flow and the

680
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:44,529
death net domain behaves like big fat

681
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,010
TSN relay note from the TSN domain

682
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:52,300
perspective and the service proxy

683
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:55,690
function this is what is making that

684
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,750
mapping of TSM streams to death not

685
00:37:55,690 --> 00:38:03,450
flows and this is what can be treated

686
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:08,980
like like a port in that big fatty SN

687
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:11,140
relay not so but we are defining in the

688
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:14,590
document is this Worr concept is

689
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,290
described and also the TSN over MPLS

690
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:21,820
data plane a procedure I defined in

691
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:23,910
detail there are some TSM related

692
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:28,690
functions that not serve a related

693
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:31,240
service proxy related functions data

694
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:33,730
service and forwarding sub layer also

695
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,879
described in detail and the Service

696
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:40,990
protection interworking is also left for

697
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,480
further study in that case but might be

698
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:47,649
interesting to highlight here that we

699
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:51,370
have slightly modified or created this

700
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:55,930
scenario specific version had this proxy

701
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:58,870
is working with the TSN side of the of

702
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:01,569
the network if you look to for example

703
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:05,380
to the architectural document there is a

704
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:08,080
high-level figure here in this document

705
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:13,930
we have a much more precise depiction of

706
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:17,650
those scenarios again management and

707
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,330
control plan related consideration you

708
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:22,990
have to map the data that flows and the

709
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,700
TSN streams and that mapping is

710
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,479
something what is happening at the

711
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:28,419
service box

712
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,710
a function of the mpls that not H node

713
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:36,670
and that that not H node is a member of

714
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:39,430
both domain and it is acting from the

715
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:44,020
TSN domain perspective as a as a tsa

716
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:45,940
relay node here again we need some

717
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:49,570
interaction at the management and

718
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:52,420
control plane when a TSM stream is set

719
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:56,230
up modified or tilled land you have to

720
00:39:52,420 --> 00:40:00,190
know it in the MPLS domain and react

721
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:03,160
accordingly and just again highlighting

722
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:06,430
Service protection interworking is left

723
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:10,690
for further study so this is where we

724
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:12,819
are with these documents but we intend

725
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:16,150
to have as a next step to collect the

726
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:18,520
feedback from the group that there

727
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:21,310
whether there are any missing items or

728
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:23,580
something but you would like to describe

729
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:27,070
in more detail or somewhat differently

730
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,590
and then also to add the conformance

731
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:31,830
language to these data plane documents

732
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:40,869
so that is the plan

733
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:43,150
questions comments Ethan Grossman I note

734
00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:45,250
in the security consideration sections

735
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:49,510
of these various drafts that they're

736
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:51,190
they're quite small and in looking at

737
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:54,180
the security considerations for the

738
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,970
other data plane drafts the iclicker

739
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,100
data planes IP and mpls we've been

740
00:40:57,970 --> 00:41:02,500
looking in the security group for things

741
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:05,230
that are time-sensitive specific and

742
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,670
data plane specific have you given much

743
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:09,400
thought to that are you confident that

744
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:12,250
there isn't anything specific to the TSN

745
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,160
of the security considerations for fir

746
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:17,500
these or or do you think that that's a

747
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:19,180
subject that needs further study this is

748
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,920
something that needs further study so we

749
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,930
have identified that this is just

750
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:26,619
something to be to be done in the future

751
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:29,230
versions so this is something to be done

752
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:30,820
okay so presumably we will fill it there

753
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,619
is a section waiting for that in the

754
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,849
security yeah and so presumably we're

755
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:35,680
going to fill it in there

756
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:38,170
yeah one question that came up and just

757
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:39,940
discussing the structure was well say we

758
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:41,920
publish the security considerations

759
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:43,420
draft then we get another data plane

760
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,059
like some wireless thing or something

761
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:47,709
then obviously this draft will be closed

762
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:51,640
so everything will have to go into the

763
00:41:47,709 --> 00:41:53,649
data plane specific document so I was

764
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,359
just curious whether it's a good idea to

765
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:56,979
keep using this model or whether we

766
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,920
should figure we're going to migrate to

767
00:41:56,979 --> 00:42:02,049
a model where that information that's

768
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:14,979
specific to that data plane goes in the

769
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:18,670
data plane drive I think at the point

770
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:21,129
it's for further discussion so I'm happy

771
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:22,959
to have any working solution in order to

772
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:26,019
fill out those sections and being in

773
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:28,359
line with the other documents so okay

774
00:42:26,019 --> 00:42:31,718
can I just have a communication to your

775
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:35,078
question so you because actually the

776
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:38,349
security document was gated by the base

777
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:40,900
data plane actually and the architecture

778
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:44,699
and my understanding is you want to

779
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:47,829
avoid any kind of situation like saying

780
00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:51,579
this is it for now in the security

781
00:42:47,829 --> 00:42:55,059
document and from a borderline if there

782
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:57,269
is any new data plane draft that has to

783
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:59,829
do with its own security considerations

784
00:42:57,269 --> 00:43:02,649
did I get to find that that's what you

785
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:04,390
are after yeah I mean I don't see how

786
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,160
else to do it unless we pull all the

787
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,719
stuff out and and it's just it goes

788
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,709
there now but since those drafts have

789
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,599
already been last called

790
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:12,339
and we couldn't find anything anyway

791
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:13,989
we're sort of in at the moment we're in

792
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:17,170
a consistent state because we couldn't

793
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:18,519
find anything but if we go forwards and

794
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:21,640
we do find something that it might be

795
00:43:18,519 --> 00:43:23,439
interesting but my view is is the we

796
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,690
have a base set of documents we're sort

797
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,089
of the foundational documents and as we

798
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,979
move forward we can either refer back to

799
00:43:28,089 --> 00:43:33,009
those foundational documents and say

800
00:43:29,979 --> 00:43:34,930
those we addressed the security

801
00:43:33,009 --> 00:43:36,369
considerations there or if we identify

802
00:43:34,930 --> 00:43:38,919
something new we do that in the new

803
00:43:36,369 --> 00:43:40,829
document we do have to make sure that

804
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,519
those foundational documents do

805
00:43:40,829 --> 00:43:47,380
adequately cover the security

806
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:49,029
considerations and we will do that and

807
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:52,000
do it early review as we talked about

808
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:54,190
and make sure we have a nice consistent

809
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:57,510
security Directorate review of all the

810
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:00,790
documents and they'll keep us honest

811
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:03,880
just to bring another example I mean SR

812
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:07,270
v6 contributions as a new that no data

813
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:09,460
plan I think there's that s our v6

814
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:12,040
document should have its own security

815
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:16,960
consideration complete that's my

816
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:20,980
personal view okay so I guess for the IP

817
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,440
and mpls that one maybe do we cut it off

818
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:27,610
there and and say or do we include TSN

819
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,300
and then cut it off after that what is

820
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:33,550
there right now basically in in oh in

821
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,650
the TSN one no and no security in the

822
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,810
security document do you cover TSN or D

823
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:39,790
coverage yes there is a placeholder that

824
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:41,560
says to be written so it's like

825
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,540
something that is there's nothing that I

826
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:45,400
would say cover the core technology and

827
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,620
move all the TSN considered security

828
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,630
considerations this the TSM document

829
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:52,150
okay I think the way then that way it

830
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,070
covers our core technology only okay

831
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,140
done and if you'd like you can make a

832
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:58,150
statement that that will be covered in

833
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,910
in the technology specific documents and

834
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:07,830
for example the TSM and that would be an

835
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:10,420
informational reference okay great so a

836
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:13,270
timeline what are you thinking in terms

837
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:19,090
of having a version that you believe is

838
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:23,500
stable enough for last call for the TSN

839
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:28,510
documents your media I think we need at

840
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:30,490
least two meeting cycle I'm sorry did

841
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,290
you say one or two I just don't do

842
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:35,970
meeting side because that that we do my

843
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:40,720
expectations all right great so

844
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:45,009
targeting where we Madrid yeah Madrid

845
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:51,330
okay how many have read this version of

846
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:53,910
the document that's really very few

847
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:57,310
clearly these documents have not had

848
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:59,080
adequate review to really know what the

849
00:45:57,310 --> 00:46:00,259
working group thinks about to the

850
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,220
working side

851
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:07,220
no no from a process standpoint I would

852
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:10,490
hope for one but two sounds

853
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:13,970
we'll go adjust our milestones

854
00:46:10,490 --> 00:46:16,459
accordingly I think you know aiming for

855
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:19,640
two is better I think the next what we

856
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:21,560
can discuss is when we have most of the

857
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,290
conformance language so that I also

858
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,190
expect some and some further

859
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:28,820
consideration so this is why I think

860
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:31,940
that at least two cycles okay keep in

861
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:37,010
mind we are contribution driven so if

862
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:39,050
you feel like you're willing please

863
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,640
review the document if you see things

864
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:42,470
that you'd like to see changed please

865
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,600
send this suggested changes through the

866
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,368
list you do enough of those you get at

867
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,680
it as a contributor or an author so

868
00:46:46,369 --> 00:46:54,440
there's opportunity here some go I just

869
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:56,930
suggest that maybe we can send this part

870
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:59,869
work also to the actually because I

871
00:46:56,930 --> 00:47:04,190
think TSM people may very interested in

872
00:46:59,869 --> 00:47:08,720
how to do the mapping between the tenet

873
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:11,420
and Tessa because in the previous joint

874
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,939
meeting a lot of people they are they

875
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:18,650
are curious about how to use their three

876
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:22,580
deterministic technologies and how to

877
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:24,500
use them with TSN so I think maybe there

878
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:27,950
will be a lot of potential view

879
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,109
reviewers there yeah actually that is

880
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:33,560
just a suggestion okay so this is just

881
00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:36,049
as once we have a stable document to

882
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,210
send it to the I Triple E or is the

883
00:47:36,050 --> 00:47:39,859
suggestion to send it to the I Triple E

884
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:44,210
as is and say please help us

885
00:47:39,859 --> 00:47:48,440
yes know which one is charge for state

886
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:52,940
wait for stable or I think this this

887
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:54,770
version is good enough and so I heard

888
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,080
the author and by the way I'm not an

889
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:59,630
author on these I heard the author say

890
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,520
that he'd like to get the serious review

891
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,030
once the conformance language was there

892
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:08,359
you know so maybe I think I would like

893
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:10,940
to also call like the feedbacks in

894
00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:14,170
general right I prefer the practice of

895
00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:17,470
sending a stable document to another

896
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:19,180
musician so it's written maybe is better

897
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:22,770
to do it like it becomes more Steve I

898
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:22,770
mean without conformist language

899
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,650
actually I just want to perhaps the mold

900
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:31,420
reviewers will they will give more

901
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:33,880
feedback to other drafts but I think

902
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:38,010
when the draft is they Bowie is also

903
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:52,810
okay good suggestion thank you very much

904
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:55,450
any other comments okay so the next

905
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:59,799
topic is update on flow information

906
00:48:55,450 --> 00:49:02,379
without I will talk about a bit of

907
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:05,710
reminders what it is about and then

908
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:10,140
explain the updates of draft and and

909
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:26,310
what are the next steps so the focus of

910
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:30,640
this document is so the the flow

911
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:33,490
information as the title says plus the

912
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,859
information mundo for the service and

913
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:38,140
this is from the from the document that

914
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,390
both the figure and the text what is an

915
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:43,839
information model and what is data model

916
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:46,230
so the subject of this document is the

917
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:49,750
flow information model and the service

918
00:49:46,230 --> 00:49:53,170
information model and data models are

919
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:55,120
the subject of the yank document you

920
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:59,590
will hear about after the my

921
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:02,350
presentation so what happened since the

922
00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:06,160
last IETF we had version four for the

923
00:50:02,350 --> 00:50:12,520
last IDF and two updates since then

924
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:15,759
version 6 and version 5 in version 5 we

925
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:18,460
had a number of editorial updates

926
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:22,300
in up in the language and current many

927
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:24,310
clarifications in the text and in in the

928
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:27,040
attribute formats for example making it

929
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:31,330
clear in that well-known names are

930
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:33,520
attributes and the formally empty

931
00:50:31,330 --> 00:50:36,850
placeholder Security section has been

932
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:39,190
filled in security considerations have

933
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:42,430
been added and these were mainly

934
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:48,220
contributed by Dolph Eric who is now a

935
00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:51,700
new co-author of the document in after

936
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:54,370
that in version 6 practically speaking

937
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:59,169
there was one technical change a new

938
00:50:54,370 --> 00:51:03,220
attribute has been added for IP flow

939
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:06,040
identification the IPSec spi this is a

940
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:10,000
security parameter index which is a kind

941
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:12,670
of an identification tag if IPSec is

942
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,890
used so that has been added to the

943
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:20,620
parameter list for fly identification

944
00:51:14,890 --> 00:51:22,299
and just a reminder this is the

945
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:26,140
structure of the attributes this is what

946
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:29,950
we is captured in in the draft so as I

947
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:32,580
as I said the key parts are data flow

948
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:36,279
and the service information with the

949
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,759
parts but it's very important input for

950
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:43,570
these how how we describe up flow

951
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,780
application flow and this is many to one

952
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:48,460
mapping from left to right so multiple

953
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,950
up flows can be mapped to at that net

954
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:56,530
flow and wonderful data flows can be

955
00:51:50,950 --> 00:52:01,779
mapped to the net service so where we

956
00:51:56,530 --> 00:52:04,180
are what is next this first question we

957
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:08,790
keep repeating to the group and this is

958
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:12,040
there any missing attributes and this I

959
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:16,390
would like to ask people to review that

960
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:20,590
often and then we give comments on the

961
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:23,740
last two item actually we had a working

962
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:26,620
session as you saw an email list last

963
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,740
night and it's very important that to

964
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:30,130
ensure

965
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:33,770
that this document and the end document

966
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:37,070
absolutely in line actually we find some

967
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:42,140
gaps kaesong we'll talk about it in the

968
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:44,480
next slide in detail and this leads to

969
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,480
the other question we told before that

970
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,220
it's a the flow information model draft

971
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:52,070
is ready as is for working with plastic

972
00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:55,279
all now actually I would say after

973
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:57,250
filling in these gaps between the two in

974
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,619
some form

975
00:52:57,250 --> 00:53:03,740
we think that authors think hey we are

976
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:06,500
close and ready for working class Co so

977
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:09,740
that's it on on my side

978
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:12,170
David David black I'm not correct merci

979
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:14,240
I'm gonna ask an OEM question anyway and

980
00:53:12,170 --> 00:53:17,060
this is actually a bigger scope question

981
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,839
of which is the car which is the horse

982
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:23,630
and how do we cope with it which is MPLS

983
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:28,930
om looks like a fairly clean add-on via

984
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:32,660
the ACH IPO am looks like anything but

985
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:36,348
how far along do we have to get with IPO

986
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:38,930
am to figure out that we don't need

987
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:42,830
anything else it's probably gonna be

988
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:45,290
turn out to be mostly in the IP data

989
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:47,119
playing draft if we wanted up neat

990
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,550
needing to do something clever about

991
00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:53,839
flow identification get the OEM flows to

992
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:56,390
behave how do we skin this one that's a

993
00:53:53,839 --> 00:54:01,150
good question and actually I haven't

994
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:05,839
really seen the discussion on this in

995
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:06,710
the list so yeah that seems to be a bit

996
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:10,420
of an open question

997
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:12,589
no ideas have been bought so far and

998
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:16,760
that's a good question in the sense of

999
00:54:12,589 --> 00:54:18,589
how do we get done because as you my

1000
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,190
understanding of Greg's points and

1001
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:25,520
proposal was to not to bind together the

1002
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:29,270
MPLS and IP om but let the MPLS OEM

1003
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:32,540
progress and then progress later as we

1004
00:54:29,270 --> 00:54:35,390
can with the IPO am yeah

1005
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:37,220
the one question I heard from your point

1006
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,750
is should we hold the flow information

1007
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:42,439
whether

1008
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:43,790
until we get done with the I promise I'm

1009
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:46,850
not sure what I'm suggesting we're

1010
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:50,270
observing is that as you said the

1011
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:53,390
Empress om OM is clean it's pretty clear

1012
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:59,000
that that that know how to tag the head

1013
00:54:53,390 --> 00:55:01,460
identify the OEM flows as Oh am i my

1014
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:05,000
suspicion is that Greg's proposal

1015
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:06,860
affects IP flow identification and hence

1016
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:09,050
is gonna hit he's gonna hit the IP data

1017
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:12,500
playing draft is gonna hit this one and

1018
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:18,650
I do you want I guess the question the

1019
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:22,880
to you is chairs is how how much do you

1020
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:25,670
want somewhere i the choice is something

1021
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,170
like do we push pause and unscramble

1022
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,710
enough of only Emily we know what its

1023
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:30,530
gonna look like

1024
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:32,690
or do we carry on get the get the IPD

1025
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,400
deplane done and then come back and

1026
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,470
figure out how to do OEM possibly

1027
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,820
revenue IP data playing if necessary so

1028
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:42,529
so i think you're really making a

1029
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,920
comment on the two talks ago not this

1030
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:46,040
one

1031
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,810
quite possibly but uh as good an excuse

1032
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:53,060
to ask anything as both as its gonna hit

1033
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:55,340
both rash right sorry i have to eat the

1034
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:58,220
mic this is an interesting question

1035
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:03,230
as chairs because we're also

1036
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:06,200
contributors to it so as with the chair

1037
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:07,820
hat on and with what we think is the

1038
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:09,379
consensus of the working group and i'm

1039
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:12,700
stating it so anyone can come to the mic

1040
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:16,840
and tell us we're wrong including the ad

1041
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:20,299
as chairs we've said we're going to

1042
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:23,870
define the core get those out and keep

1043
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:24,380
pushing along and duo a.m. when it shows

1044
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:28,370
up

1045
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:33,080
we've also has made the technical call

1046
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:36,140
that OAM is going to have to follow the

1047
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:39,440
path of the flows so has to meet our

1048
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:41,150
flow definitions and we certainly have

1049
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,620
had some conversations of ways that

1050
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:45,710
could be done but we don't have a

1051
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:47,779
document it at you know greg that's the

1052
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:50,090
status right we don't have a document

1053
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,790
that gives us an answer yet so we don't

1054
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:54,340
have confirmation of that

1055
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:55,990
okay I think it's a stand point we're

1056
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,720
saying we're gonna move we're gonna move

1057
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:01,750
forward and understand that OEM is gonna

1058
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:03,250
trail and yes we understand that there's

1059
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,540
risk here and it's important for the

1060
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,850
working group to understand those risk

1061
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,400
here and okay

1062
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:12,819
I think it's a question which is that

1063
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:16,420
that the working group consensus is

1064
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:19,270
believed to be that the IP data plane

1065
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:23,800
draft needs to move forward without Prok

1066
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:26,950
without further further delay as OAM

1067
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:29,500
gets unscrambled if it impacts the IP

1068
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,359
data plane we get to complete we we get

1069
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,920
to come back and revise that and deal

1070
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:36,310
with that when we get there right and

1071
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,930
just for your information I even had the

1072
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:41,529
conversation this week with Greg about

1073
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:44,740
it some of our thinking on this is to do

1074
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:46,570
wait David I'm answering your question

1075
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:48,839
if you're distracted you're not going to

1076
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,840
hear it

1077
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:56,770
Stewart let me finish so the the the

1078
00:57:53,110 --> 00:58:00,450
thinking is on OAM is that we'll end up

1079
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:04,600
having to do some wider flow rules that

1080
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:06,730
cover both the OEM traffic and the six

1081
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:08,440
tuple for the data flow and that's

1082
00:58:06,730 --> 00:58:09,700
probably as good as we're gonna get now

1083
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,590
we're gonna have to run that through the

1084
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:13,600
whole process see if anyone has better

1085
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:15,310
ideas but that's what we think we're

1086
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:23,470
gonna sort of the direction we're going

1087
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:25,180
to end up so maybe I stepped at the

1088
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:27,730
wrong moment or something this is a

1089
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:31,330
pretty jet lag meeting but there isn't

1090
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:35,590
even a way for regular IP of getting an

1091
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:38,350
OEM message to be congruent with it this

1092
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:40,750
is way more fundamental than any problem

1093
00:58:38,350 --> 00:58:42,970
we're trying to solve here and that's

1094
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:45,310
why I gave the answer that I just did

1095
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:47,859
which is the only thing we have is is we

1096
00:58:45,310 --> 00:58:52,600
can have multiple flows be congruent by

1097
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:56,290
adjusting our flow rules yeah I mean I

1098
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:59,980
just think this is so hard that we know

1099
00:58:56,290 --> 00:59:02,080
how to do it for MPLS but oh but for for

1100
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:05,050
IP I don't think there exists a solution

1101
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,750
anywhere in the ITF I agree and so the

1102
00:59:05,050 --> 00:59:09,050
question for the

1103
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:11,360
working group is do we not push the data

1104
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:14,150
plane the IP data playing document

1105
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,070
forward and wait until we have an OEM

1106
00:59:14,150 --> 00:59:18,260
solution or do we push it forward and

1107
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:23,000
try to align our OEM solution with the

1108
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:25,070
IP document though that's the question

1109
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:27,020
for the working group and I think you've

1110
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:30,380
heard what the chairs think the

1111
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:32,960
consensus is its opportunity of the

1112
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:34,940
working group now to say disarray okay

1113
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,650
what I think I heard is the latter which

1114
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:41,120
is push IP data playing doctrine phones

1115
00:59:36,650 --> 00:59:43,190
make sense and revising senior remarks

1116
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:45,580
like I would say aligning and modified

1117
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:48,260
aligning only with IP data plane

1118
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:51,680
modifying the IP data plane if and as

1119
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:56,240
necessary so as a contributor like I

1120
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:59,060
think we we had a good job and effort

1121
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:02,540
actually made effort to make the IP data

1122
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:05,150
plane in line with IP principles and I

1123
01:00:02,540 --> 01:00:07,640
think it's good to go and if we develop

1124
01:00:05,150 --> 01:00:15,260
OAM it's a hard problem but that should

1125
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:17,660
be in line with IP principles anyways so

1126
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,370
please scale to balance we you mention

1127
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:20,810
you asked is all the possible wave

1128
01:00:19,370 --> 01:00:22,970
signal in your flow well listed in this

1129
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:24,470
document and there's another one which

1130
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:25,759
is actually not listed I was just

1131
01:00:24,470 --> 01:00:29,020
wondering if you're interested in adding

1132
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:31,730
it to it so if you have a ripple domain

1133
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:34,730
and so you're using ripple to to do the

1134
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:36,650
routing inside that domain then there is

1135
01:00:34,730 --> 01:00:39,110
work at a troll which actually enables

1136
01:00:36,650 --> 01:00:41,870
to what do what we call rod projection

1137
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:43,760
which is really installing a route from

1138
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:46,339
the roots directly into the network and

1139
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:48,080
this this rod is what we call a track in

1140
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:49,810
six dish it's a complex route have been

1141
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:54,440
something very akin to what we do here

1142
01:00:49,810 --> 01:00:57,440
and it is signaled in the packet using a

1143
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:59,420
hop-by-hop header which contains some

1144
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,450
information which is akin to a vrf

1145
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:04,610
information so our local and global he

1146
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:06,259
arrives so the local ones really tie the

1147
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:09,920
destination of the packet which is the

1148
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:12,200
exit of this track with a number which

1149
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:14,570
is locally significant there and that

1150
01:01:12,200 --> 01:01:17,060
basically tells you which routing table

1151
01:01:14,570 --> 01:01:18,590
you need to look at for the spider and

1152
01:01:17,060 --> 01:01:19,630
you can have huge numbers of those

1153
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:22,540
things in a ripple net

1154
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:24,820
so that's how we actually signor not

1155
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:27,160
really the flow but the path that this

1156
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:29,320
the flow is supposed to go which also

1157
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:31,600
means that you could place the OAM and

1158
01:01:29,320 --> 01:01:33,010
the data on the same path and they will

1159
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:35,890
follow it to the destination which is

1160
01:01:33,010 --> 01:01:37,660
the case I wanted to give to Stuart that

1161
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:42,310
we actually have one case where we know

1162
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:44,379
how to merge the flow and the IOM into

1163
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,850
the same thing so is it something want

1164
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:49,150
to capture here or do you see it as an

1165
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:51,819
exception that's not interesting so one

1166
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:56,770
way I understood what you said is that

1167
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:59,260
that technology is kind of Association

1168
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:02,670
of explicit routing encoded in the data

1169
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:08,830
plane little packets like spring and

1170
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:11,590
with the benefits of making like spring

1171
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:15,420
can be very it's more like what you put

1172
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:18,700
in the packet is more like topology

1173
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:21,070
identification like a v rfid not the

1174
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:24,580
source route path right okay so it's a

1175
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:26,320
different other you just I if you if you

1176
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:29,920
knew about multiple routing that's more

1177
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:32,350
like that yes so so we actually the

1178
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,980
mechanisms that we built the IP data

1179
01:02:32,350 --> 01:02:38,319
plane on or closer to policy routing so

1180
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:40,300
if you look at policy routing you can do

1181
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:43,120
very similar things and you don't have

1182
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:46,270
to have topology and it you don't have

1183
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:49,299
the topology IDs you have an MRT or the

1184
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:52,060
SIDS that you have in spraying you just

1185
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:53,410
have policies so I think what you're

1186
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:57,460
saying is we would want that we should

1187
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:59,589
pursue a path that maps different flows

1188
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:01,780
to the same basically policy the policy

1189
01:02:59,590 --> 01:03:03,700
tells you which flow is good in which

1190
01:03:01,780 --> 01:03:05,410
rib and now you stamp the rib in the

1191
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:07,589
packet and the packet follows this rib

1192
01:03:05,410 --> 01:03:11,980
the question is this is how we signal

1193
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:13,570
the equivalent of a flow in our packets

1194
01:03:11,980 --> 01:03:15,940
it is something worth capturing it you

1195
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:18,310
are missing attributes well that that's

1196
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:20,800
a flow a notification attribute but let

1197
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:23,020
me a flow its topology but I see it's

1198
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,700
something below it's not a flow I as a

1199
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:29,350
it's it's routing

1200
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:31,450
kind of remember but but that is that

1201
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:34,720
can be a good

1202
01:03:31,450 --> 01:03:37,450
technology choice I would say a lower

1203
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:40,930
layer not seen at the level of flow

1204
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:42,910
information but but if we can maybe

1205
01:03:40,930 --> 01:03:45,250
double check offline if what what you

1206
01:03:42,910 --> 01:03:49,149
see as a flow information flow idea out

1207
01:03:45,250 --> 01:03:50,410
of that one flow plus the OEM into that

1208
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:51,940
particular topology because that's

1209
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:54,339
redesigned for it right it there are

1210
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:56,259
many of them it's design want of flow so

1211
01:03:54,339 --> 01:03:58,509
at some point it's family but it's not

1212
01:03:56,259 --> 01:04:00,309
the same thing so I think it would be

1213
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:02,920
great if you collaborate with Greg on

1214
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:06,160
his document and try to capture these

1215
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:08,019
ideas and help us move that that work

1216
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:09,549
forward because I think it I think it's

1217
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:22,348
actually quite it would fit in quite

1218
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:22,349
well yes ok thank you Thanks next maxi's

1219
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:27,960
yong-seok a song if you could

1220
01:04:45,400 --> 01:05:04,490
oops okay you see the clicker it works

1221
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:06,590
this is your song and I will present our

1222
01:05:04,490 --> 01:05:10,339
work about ten and a configuration young

1223
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:14,150
model and thank you for the contribution

1224
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:20,180
of other elders here is the history of

1225
01:05:14,150 --> 01:05:23,150
our work this this draft is accepted as

1226
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:26,720
a working group document after IETF well

1227
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:30,350
- and in the first version we separate

1228
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:34,029
the done edit apology young another

1229
01:05:30,350 --> 01:05:36,890
document and the yen version - we

1230
01:05:34,030 --> 01:05:38,920
received some feedback from the working

1231
01:05:36,890 --> 01:05:41,900
group and we update the following

1232
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:45,500
attributes we end the sequence number

1233
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:47,810
generation considering the OEM and we

1234
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,990
end then a service decapsulation and

1235
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:53,720
also then I transfer tano decapsulation

1236
01:05:49,990 --> 01:05:57,529
in version 3 we do a lot of work about

1237
01:05:53,720 --> 01:06:01,580
the configuration structure update in

1238
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:03,860
item well for and while 5 in version 4

1239
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:06,830
which is the current version we modify

1240
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:09,680
the scope of the 10 and Yamoto merely to

1241
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:13,160
go aligned with the information model

1242
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,350
work and here is the previous word

1243
01:06:13,160 --> 01:06:18,259
basically we define a 10 and a

1244
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:21,770
configuration module which is defined

1245
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:24,260
for that net flow paths built building

1246
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:27,680
of flow statements reporting and then

1247
01:06:24,260 --> 01:06:32,030
add functions configurations we defined

1248
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:36,279
through 4 modules inside the this young

1249
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:38,900
model which include the attributes of

1250
01:06:36,280 --> 01:06:42,160
application flow survey sub layer and

1251
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:45,740
forwarding sub layer and some network

1252
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,750
this is based on the net data plan

1253
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:53,290
protocol stack defined in the

1254
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:56,290
architecture document and in this world

1255
01:06:53,290 --> 01:06:59,500
I tried to do some modification to go

1256
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:03,790
along with the structure as the previous

1257
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:06,480
slide show because in the information

1258
01:07:03,790 --> 01:07:09,820
model there is that another service

1259
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:12,400
attributes so we end the than a service

1260
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:15,070
module to include the service quality

1261
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:17,520
attributes such as the latency the lost

1262
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:20,140
the miss Audrey and we also end the

1263
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:22,230
endpoints attributes to indicate the

1264
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:25,480
start point and the end point of the

1265
01:07:22,230 --> 01:07:28,720
dinosaurus and maybe the encapsulation

1266
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:32,980
type attributes is also needed it can be

1267
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:35,500
MPs or IP and we keep the tended

1268
01:07:32,980 --> 01:07:39,880
configuration module stable just as the

1269
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:41,770
previous slides but after some

1270
01:07:39,880 --> 01:07:44,200
discussions with the other of an

1271
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:46,200
information model there is a call

1272
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:48,939
meeting and we also meet each other

1273
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:53,290
yesterday and we find that these two

1274
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:56,110
Mojo's models are still not well aligned

1275
01:07:53,290 --> 01:07:58,150
yet so the mapping between the

1276
01:07:56,110 --> 01:08:01,300
information model and llamado are still

1277
01:07:58,150 --> 01:08:04,120
to be defined and we plan to work

1278
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:07,030
together after this meeting perhaps we

1279
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:10,630
will have a call meeting every week to

1280
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:13,420
make this work down and the picture

1281
01:08:10,630 --> 01:08:15,720
shows that in the left hand is the

1282
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:20,529
information model we see that there are

1283
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:25,420
three boxes and in the right hand that

1284
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:27,519
is the ten oh sorry I write this wrong

1285
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:30,640
this is the the structure of the young

1286
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:32,589
model and we have four elements so maybe

1287
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,589
how to map the information model

1288
01:08:32,589 --> 01:08:38,680
attributes to the young model attributes

1289
01:08:35,589 --> 01:08:42,040
and make it very easy to understand

1290
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:45,880
there is our next step work and that's

1291
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:48,660
all thank you just to clarify here and

1292
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:52,560
the next step so we are planning to have

1293
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:54,750
virtual meetings working sessions like

1294
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:58,900
we are having for the data plane

1295
01:08:54,750 --> 01:09:01,089
announced on the list to move forward I

1296
01:08:58,899 --> 01:09:04,149
don't think it will be weekly we will

1297
01:09:01,089 --> 01:09:06,660
need to figure out when but that's part

1298
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:06,660
of the plan

1299
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:12,720
David black wearing transport area tech

1300
01:09:10,290 --> 01:09:14,939
advisor hat small request

1301
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:16,589
boo-boo top out in the past as you work

1302
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:20,099
towards the next revisions draft which

1303
01:09:16,589 --> 01:09:24,149
looks like a lot of work there is still

1304
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:26,520
in this version the dscp and the DSA

1305
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:29,729
bitmask pair that needs to be changed

1306
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:30,960
with dscp list just it's it's small item

1307
01:09:29,729 --> 01:09:33,000
that should be double sooner or later

1308
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,830
thank you I think we're gonna end up

1309
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:37,500
with a major revision one of the

1310
01:09:34,830 --> 01:09:40,710
comments that I saw is it's it's very

1311
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:43,109
flat and not taking care taking into

1312
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,910
account sort of some of the layout you'd

1313
01:09:43,109 --> 01:09:47,880
want to have an extensible free

1314
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:50,220
foundation for future augmentation and

1315
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,319
so I think you're gonna see oh I mean

1316
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:54,840
I'm expecting major changes I'm just uh

1317
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,160
let's let's check this box now so we

1318
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:56,730
don't have to go back and discover

1319
01:09:56,160 --> 01:09:58,139
whoops

1320
01:09:56,730 --> 01:10:02,700
we forgot to check out three versions

1321
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:05,280
from now that's all if I understand this

1322
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:09,120
right I I remember that you have very

1323
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:12,570
similar comments in the previous meeting

1324
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:16,340
so we haven't updated the draft based on

1325
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:18,960
your comments I remember down this okay

1326
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:20,490
just since it's clean major revision

1327
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:21,600
come and let's you simply check check

1328
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:23,670
check the box while were there no

1329
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:26,340
problems okay thank you if you find that

1330
01:10:23,670 --> 01:10:31,800
there is something wrong please that has

1331
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:35,220
no final meaning this thank you thank

1332
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:38,010
you so we're actually running a bit

1333
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:40,230
ahead which is right which is pretty

1334
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:45,090
rare which is actually really good

1335
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:46,740
because our tech advisor David black

1336
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,670
can't be here for the second session and

1337
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,790
really wanted to be here for the

1338
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:52,800
security document if the if even if

1339
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:57,560
you're willing can you go now great so

1340
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,560
we're gonna move that slot up

1341
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:10,569
[Music]

1342
01:11:28,940 --> 01:11:34,559
okay all right I'm Ethan Grossman and

1343
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:39,150
this is an update for the security

1344
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:42,450
considerations draft so the intent of

1345
01:11:39,150 --> 01:11:45,480
the draft is to be a reference in a

1346
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:46,590
toolkit for network designers who have

1347
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:49,769
not necessarily dealt with

1348
01:11:46,590 --> 01:11:51,830
time-sensitive networks before so this

1349
01:11:49,770 --> 01:11:53,730
is relatively new in the IETF so we

1350
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:55,230
figured we'd have a clearinghouse for

1351
01:11:53,730 --> 01:11:57,889
that kind of information so this

1352
01:11:55,230 --> 01:12:00,209
document doesn't address the general

1353
01:11:57,890 --> 01:12:02,070
considerations for security for IP and

1354
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:03,900
mpls networks we leave that to the

1355
01:12:02,070 --> 01:12:06,330
existing documentation we're very

1356
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:11,519
focused on only the time specific

1357
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:13,350
aspects of it and the relation of this

1358
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:17,130
drafts to the security considerations

1359
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:19,590
sections in the other debt net drafts is

1360
01:12:17,130 --> 01:12:21,710
that basically each of those drafts is

1361
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:24,450
to have its own security section

1362
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:27,480
addressing issues specific to that

1363
01:12:24,450 --> 01:12:29,670
particular draft topic but then having a

1364
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:32,129
reference to this draft to cover all of

1365
01:12:29,670 --> 01:12:34,290
the more general technology independent

1366
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:36,120
and and other considerations that's that

1367
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:42,120
way we don't have to duplicate these

1368
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:44,849
many pages in each draft so at the

1369
01:12:42,120 --> 01:12:47,370
moment the technology independent

1370
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:49,830
section in other words regardless of

1371
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:53,430
whether you're on an IP based network or

1372
01:12:49,830 --> 01:12:54,900
MPLS that section is fairly mature at

1373
01:12:53,430 --> 01:12:58,680
this point this drafts been running for

1374
01:12:54,900 --> 01:13:00,750
nigh on two years and we've had a fair

1375
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:02,780
number of eyes on that part and if

1376
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,070
there's a fair amount of organization

1377
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:06,420
there's a few little bits to fit in and

1378
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:09,090
fill in but that part's pretty mature

1379
01:13:06,420 --> 01:13:10,740
the thing that we thought we're really

1380
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:13,530
going to do is the next big thing was

1381
01:13:10,740 --> 01:13:14,490
the IP and mpls specific sections we

1382
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:17,280
thought well there's got to be stuff

1383
01:13:14,490 --> 01:13:21,330
that's specific to both time-sensitive

1384
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:23,820
networks and the IP implementation

1385
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:26,519
versus the MPLS implementation so we've

1386
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:28,950
had as many people as I could manage to

1387
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:32,370
wrangle into discussing this look at

1388
01:13:28,950 --> 01:13:34,398
this and so far the result is that we

1389
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:36,559
haven't really found any unique

1390
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:39,919
that are both related to time-sensitive

1391
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:43,999
and not covered in the general case but

1392
01:13:39,919 --> 01:13:46,939
are specific to that data plane so we

1393
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:48,199
have later I have hoping we can have a

1394
01:13:46,939 --> 01:13:49,820
little bit of conversation but maybe

1395
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:52,209
it'll just get deferred to the list but

1396
01:13:49,820 --> 01:13:54,860
my sense is that if you've ever read

1397
01:13:52,209 --> 01:13:57,800
read the Gladwell book about blink

1398
01:13:54,860 --> 01:14:00,110
there's this thing where people who have

1399
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:02,059
been doing something for a long time

1400
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:04,398
just have a certain sense of intuition

1401
01:14:02,059 --> 01:14:06,169
but it's not just intuition from nowhere

1402
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:07,969
it's intuition from many years of

1403
01:14:06,169 --> 01:14:10,550
working on it so I guess what I was

1404
01:14:07,969 --> 01:14:12,349
asking is that if you could think about

1405
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:14,749
that statement I mean at the moment our

1406
01:14:12,349 --> 01:14:16,999
stance is there's nothing technology

1407
01:14:14,749 --> 01:14:18,769
specific about these so we got sections

1408
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:20,898
in the Security draft that say IP

1409
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:23,780
nothing specific it's all just the

1410
01:14:20,899 --> 01:14:26,809
general stuff MPLS nothing specific just

1411
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:28,219
the general stuff does that ring true or

1412
01:14:26,809 --> 01:14:29,780
does that leave a bad feeling in your

1413
01:14:28,219 --> 01:14:31,909
stomach because I haven't gotten anybody

1414
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:34,129
to come with anything specific but I'd

1415
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:36,469
settle for a general feeling about it so

1416
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:37,699
that's just one way to approach what to

1417
01:14:36,469 --> 01:14:39,499
me at the moment is kind of an

1418
01:14:37,699 --> 01:14:43,999
intractable problem is trying to figure

1419
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:45,499
that out so that's one thing so the TSN

1420
01:14:43,999 --> 01:14:48,079
specific section we discussed a little

1421
01:14:45,499 --> 01:14:50,449
earlier is not started yet but we're

1422
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:52,398
going to defer that to the the TSN

1423
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:56,808
specific draft so that's off of my plate

1424
01:14:52,399 --> 01:14:59,780
good the other thing that is I'm in a

1425
01:14:56,809 --> 01:15:01,459
quandary about going forwards is this in

1426
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:04,070
the use cases draft if you've read it

1427
01:15:01,459 --> 01:15:07,579
you know that at the end of it I sort of

1428
01:15:04,070 --> 01:15:10,340
collected all of the related security

1429
01:15:07,579 --> 01:15:12,018
related statements from every other

1430
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,539
draft that I could find at the time it

1431
01:15:12,019 --> 01:15:16,309
hasn't picked up the new ones lately but

1432
01:15:14,539 --> 01:15:17,898
basically particularly from the use

1433
01:15:16,309 --> 01:15:19,399
cases draft because they were like all

1434
01:15:17,899 --> 01:15:22,309
these little kind of funny statements

1435
01:15:19,399 --> 01:15:25,789
and there's not really a requirements

1436
01:15:22,309 --> 01:15:27,800
document so I thought well how is

1437
01:15:25,789 --> 01:15:29,539
anybody going to review the security

1438
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,639
draft without understanding what the

1439
01:15:29,539 --> 01:15:33,050
criteria and the requirements are so I

1440
01:15:31,639 --> 01:15:35,479
said well collect all these things

1441
01:15:33,050 --> 01:15:37,280
that's as close as we have and that way

1442
01:15:35,479 --> 01:15:38,840
people can look at those and say well

1443
01:15:37,280 --> 01:15:40,518
this is kind of what's expected do we

1444
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:43,249
think that we're covering the territory

1445
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:46,369
so my question is well what do I do with

1446
01:15:43,249 --> 01:15:47,840
that stuff I mean do I leave it in the

1447
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:49,460
draft if I do then that's our

1448
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:51,920
a process of updating it and make sure

1449
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:54,080
I've got all the stuff to date that's

1450
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:56,840
been added since you know that was last

1451
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:58,880
worked on which was many months ago or

1452
01:15:56,840 --> 01:16:00,440
do we just chuck it and figure it

1453
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,320
doesn't really belong in the security

1454
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:05,269
draft anyway

1455
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:06,830
interesting questions to ponder we may

1456
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:10,310
have a second for a discussion if we do

1457
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:12,800
and we'd like to I'd like your

1458
01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:16,119
employment I will okay so I look forward

1459
01:16:12,800 --> 01:16:18,260
to your input any minute now right now

1460
01:16:16,119 --> 01:16:21,230
discussion okay so there were three

1461
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:22,340
questions that I had intended to ask one

1462
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:24,110
of them the third one we've already

1463
01:16:22,340 --> 01:16:26,030
actually managed to resolve about the

1464
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:28,009
security Directorate review is it going

1465
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:31,250
to be before after working group last

1466
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:32,420
call and we decided that we would go for

1467
01:16:31,250 --> 01:16:34,790
it at the beginning of last call we

1468
01:16:32,420 --> 01:16:36,260
would also submit for an early review in

1469
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,820
other words it would be four before it

1470
01:16:36,260 --> 01:16:39,920
was passed to the iesg we would also

1471
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:41,480
have the security Directorate have a

1472
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,880
look at it first in parallel with our

1473
01:16:41,480 --> 01:16:48,619
working group last call so I'm happy to

1474
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:51,409
have that result the other couple things

1475
01:16:48,619 --> 01:16:53,170
are about the data playing technology

1476
01:16:51,409 --> 01:16:58,159
specific things does anybody have any

1477
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:59,510
thing to say about that and the security

1478
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:03,080
related statements from the use cases

1479
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:05,300
any thoughts about that so I did but

1480
01:17:03,080 --> 01:17:07,309
some people who drew a blank on airplane

1481
01:17:05,300 --> 01:17:10,610
technology specific threats I thought

1482
01:17:07,310 --> 01:17:14,690
are come to the mic and explain why my

1483
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:16,610
gut feel is that it's okay or I'm not

1484
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:18,290
really upset about it and let's just see

1485
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:20,059
if I can get somebody up to the up

1486
01:17:18,290 --> 01:17:23,810
microphone to debate me and we'll learn

1487
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:25,969
something reason is that the security

1488
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:29,530
reasons draft is very much written from

1489
01:17:25,969 --> 01:17:33,170
a threat model perspective it takes a

1490
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:36,019
general functional model of time

1491
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:37,730
sensitive networking and outlines all

1492
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:40,489
the various threats that could disrupt

1493
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:42,709
that at that level it's got pretty

1494
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:45,559
complete threat coverage now if I plug a

1495
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:49,099
data plane in underneath that time

1496
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:50,719
specific of networking I wanted up we're

1497
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:52,969
finding that general function model is

1498
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,949
specific manifestations data plane the

1499
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:57,800
threats haven't changed but how they

1500
01:17:54,949 --> 01:17:59,299
impact the data plane probably has but

1501
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:00,300
with the security drive haven't been

1502
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,570
written with

1503
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:05,670
primarily in terms of threats and not in

1504
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:07,710
terms of specific manifestations in the

1505
01:18:05,670 --> 01:18:09,750
data plane the fact that we can't find

1506
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:13,250
any new threats against the data plane

1507
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:13,250
is not that big a surprise

1508
01:18:13,849 --> 01:18:20,790
interesting point does that mean that we

1509
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:24,449
should be talking about those specific

1510
01:18:20,790 --> 01:18:25,949
impacts on the specific data planes or

1511
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:27,269
does it mean we're sticking with threat

1512
01:18:25,949 --> 01:18:30,719
models and call it good

1513
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:33,750
I think you cast a die I think divers

1514
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:35,909
cast awhile ago to write the security

1515
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:38,250
the overall security draft as an overall

1516
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:40,170
deterministic networking security draft

1517
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:41,790
and that leads to its current Phet model

1518
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:43,980
structure so I'm not criticizing that

1519
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:46,440
try and just sort of have a look at is

1520
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:49,138
there a gap there and the answer is well

1521
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:51,058
no it's our they did did did

1522
01:18:49,139 --> 01:18:53,760
implementing deterministic networking on

1523
01:18:51,059 --> 01:18:57,380
a specific data plane add new threats to

1524
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:59,730
deterministic networking perhaps not

1525
01:18:57,380 --> 01:19:02,670
know but I understood what she said I

1526
01:18:59,730 --> 01:19:04,980
thought but my question was we haven't

1527
01:19:02,670 --> 01:19:07,290
we specifically did not address the

1528
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:08,579
impacts on a specific data plane is this

1529
01:19:07,290 --> 01:19:10,199
a place where we should be thinking

1530
01:19:08,579 --> 01:19:14,250
about that and not be talking so much

1531
01:19:10,199 --> 01:19:16,079
about the threats but about that subject

1532
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:17,610
referred truth and beauty perspective I

1533
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:19,799
would say no that when when you're

1534
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:21,269
looking at a threat to specific data

1535
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:24,829
plane mechanism it's a security

1536
01:19:21,270 --> 01:19:24,829
consideration for that data plane draft

1537
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:30,300
so another way of David I like the way

1538
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:33,869
he phrased that it actually triggered

1539
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:36,659
some additional thoughts that I hadn't

1540
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:38,639
had so they the you know what's really

1541
01:19:36,659 --> 01:19:41,940
different by the way this is Lou as

1542
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:43,170
contributor or not as chair what's

1543
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:45,780
really different between the different

1544
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:48,960
data planes is how we do flow

1545
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:51,179
identification that's about it and so

1546
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,309
maybe we should focus on that and

1547
01:19:51,179 --> 01:19:55,880
highlight even in your general section

1548
01:19:53,309 --> 01:19:57,659
about technology specific threats to

1549
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:01,050
articulate that the difference between

1550
01:19:57,659 --> 01:20:03,420
them is how we identify flows and so the

1551
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:07,949
additional threat there or vulnerability

1552
01:20:03,420 --> 01:20:11,000
whatever the right word is is that it it

1553
01:20:07,949 --> 01:20:15,000
may be easier or harder or one flow to

1554
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,179
impersonate another flow or to

1555
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,650
potentially deny services based on the

1556
01:20:18,179 --> 01:20:21,449
number of fields that are used but

1557
01:20:19,650 --> 01:20:23,009
that's really about it between the

1558
01:20:21,449 --> 01:20:24,419
technology specifics the rest of it is

1559
01:20:23,010 --> 01:20:28,170
all about service and that's gonna be

1560
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:33,449
common and when we get om done we'll

1561
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:36,739
have another difference right right okay

1562
01:20:33,449 --> 01:20:39,210
so the next steps were looking at are to

1563
01:20:36,739 --> 01:20:41,690
basically at this point finish it up and

1564
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:55,079
get through working group last call and

1565
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:56,699
security review right thank you so we

1566
01:20:55,079 --> 01:20:58,409
still are running a little bit ahead but

1567
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:02,159
I think if we try to squeeze in another

1568
01:20:58,409 --> 01:21:04,549
we might run it run out of time in the

1569
01:21:02,159 --> 01:21:06,929
session so what we're gonna do now is

1570
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:10,670
break until the second session the

1571
01:21:06,929 --> 01:21:13,559
second session is back in this room in

1572
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:15,059
half an hour so instead of a 20-minute

1573
01:21:13,559 --> 01:21:47,550
break we're gonna have a half-hour break

1574
01:21:15,059 --> 01:21:57,809
so see you all here at 5:40 there will

1575
01:21:47,550 --> 01:22:00,719
be all kinds of interesting friends they

1576
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:07,590
really reliable of course they will

1577
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:08,969
delays on TDM that's all well that's

1578
01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:10,230
history and that's what people have been

1579
01:22:08,969 --> 01:22:14,610
doing that's we're trying to move away

1580
01:22:10,230 --> 01:22:20,040
from the other thing too we might want

1581
01:22:14,610 --> 01:22:23,820
to watch out for a lot of people when

1582
01:22:20,040 --> 01:22:25,590
they think they buy a wire or serve as

1583
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:27,219
an internet service for example from

1584
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:29,400
their a turbulent area

1585
01:22:27,220 --> 01:22:34,510
I'll find what they think thereby

1586
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:42,639
they're buying a moment sex right yes

1587
01:22:34,510 --> 01:22:44,200
well I'll not even if I mean so if

1588
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:45,550
anyone missed signing the blue sheet

1589
01:22:44,200 --> 01:22:52,389
either raise your hand or come on up

1590
01:22:45,550 --> 01:22:53,860
here almost like Oh a.m. it's like to a

1591
01:22:52,390 --> 01:22:55,960
certain degree you just have to get the

1592
01:22:53,860 --> 01:23:04,330
thing out there and then find out what

1593
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:12,940
happens once it gets out in the wild and

1594
01:23:04,330 --> 01:23:16,530
isn't limited to but I think a lot of

1595
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:16,530
really new territory
