and after that we have discussion about

33
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:43,199
- working group items first one is RTO

34
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:46,508
consider and career as a reviewer

35

00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:49,990
consider draft so that we can think

37
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,500
about it's a draft it's ready for

38
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:56,680
working the plastic or not and next one

39
00:04:53,500 --> 00:05:00,639
is accurate Asian press Asian prosperous

40
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,770
discussion and in this one yeah we also

41
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,310
chaired think you know this is close to

42
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,169
the working group Roscoe but beforehand

43
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,270
we would like to check you know there

44
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,580
are no I need technical respect

45
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:16,150
remaining issue or if there is any

46
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,430
procedural issues so be because of that

47
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,070
we have no several presentation first

48
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,900
mal Sarah will talk about update for

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:28,449
Asian prosperous and then after that Bob

50
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:30,280
my I don't I didn't get realists ride

51
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:32,440
yet but if you want to speak up you can

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:42,219
skip speak up something about accurate

53
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:45,180
is yen it's your choice you if you have

54
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:52,090
any technical I don't want to talk about

55
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:56,440
non technical stuff you can skip okay

56
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:57,880
that's fine sorry I'd have to quickly

57
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,969
prepare a slide but I wouldn't be able

58
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,860
to do it in time for that sort but right

59
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,210
maybe I'll just come to the mic and try

60
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:16,060
and explain it I might try I might try

61
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:18,580
one slide okay and after that media will

62
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,130
talk about registration policy for TCP

63
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:24,130
header so this is related accurate easy

64
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,169
and discussion and then after that's no

65
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:29,080
we will discuss about procedure

66
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:31,990
discussions for his activities and easy

67
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,650
entrust us the meaning of procedure

68
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:39,370
discussion is not focusing on technical

69
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:42,219
style just focus on how to proceed this

70
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:44,180
draft so that's not some meaning of this

71
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:46,969
discussion

72
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,530
and after that we have a for

73
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:53,539
presentation for non working group items

74
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:56,900
first one is high stud probably we will

75
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:59,300
talk about it and after that my fish

76
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:03,349
talk about young model for TCP

77
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:07,580
configuration and after that caress talk

78
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,470
about TCP octo and then after that a lot

79
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,320
will talk about some congestion

80
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:15,710
experience so that's the today's agenda

81
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:20,259
any comment questions suggestion about

82
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:25,159
this agenda okay

83
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:30,110
maybe on so now let's talk about working

84
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,750
group status so unfortunately we haven't

85
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:35,630
have we published any RF she's since

86
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,449
Montreal but we have lots of working

87
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,590
group items and that's close to

88
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:45,680
publication let's take a look

89
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:47,719
TCP M combat a draft we have completed

90
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:53,060
working group last ago and then we have

91
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:56,060
submitted to our yesterday and 77 93

92
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:00,680
based draft this draft has been

93
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:02,900
continuously updated and then current

94
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,000
plan according to the authors no current

95
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,698
plan to update these reflect some meds

96
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,310
review and the micros review and then

97
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:13,400
also we have two reviewers Korea and

98
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:16,580
probing and after we got already is no

99
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:20,060
we think and if it looks okay we are

100
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,820
thinking about issuing initiating

101
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:26,780
working group rustical so our current

102
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:30,139
front its initiating working group

103
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:34,309
rustical re 2020 if possible and that's

104
00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:38,750
a plan so we expect maybe was to submit

105
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:43,869
their abuse aureus is possible so be

106
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,870
great I appreciate your support and

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:52,400
21:40 based draft this draft recently

108
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:55,610
updated three days ago and it's add new

109
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:57,480
a pending appendix for automating the

110
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,329
initial window increase

111
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:05,190
then after this basically in this

112
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:07,500
version they also think this draft is

113
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,930
modern was ready for working replace to

114
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,839
call and they don't have any specific

115
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:15,479
front of lady anymore that's so if we

116
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,970
were interested please lead disrupt and

117
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:28,350
it please submit your comment to the

118
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:30,089
mailing list and next one's luck and we

119
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:33,870
have been discussing this draft a long

120
00:09:30,089 --> 00:09:36,329
time and then that chaired think this

121
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,420
draft is close to working group last

122
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:41,489
call but we are right now checking the

123
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,639
final thing and then one of the things

124
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:48,060
we are checking is if the intended

125
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:51,449
status of this stuff should be PS OS

126
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:53,609
should be experimental and we are

127
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:55,800
getting a data point on the mailing list

128
00:09:53,610 --> 00:10:00,570
but at the same time we would like to

129
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,880
get data points in this room so I think

130
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:07,470
people already familiar with Fatty's

131
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:10,769
back so if we will think rock dust

132
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:25,339
should be published as proposed standard

133
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:30,870
please raise your hand okay thank you

134
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:34,620
and if you think locked rocks should be

135
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:51,390
published as experimental traffic please

136
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:53,460
raise your head okay Sarah okay I wonder

137
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:56,250
chairs no offense I just wonder if the

138
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:58,860
chairs wants to say why it was PS rather

139
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:06,330
than exp because we all seem to agree it

140
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:08,040
is PS okay so I think there are a very

141
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:10,380
solid definition of the PS and the

142
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,880
experimenter amanda's Manny Parra so

143
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,920
basically that hasn't many

144
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:21,540
implementations and they'd spider that

145
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:23,430
might be enough and also I we don't know

146
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:29,910
crea vision but to explain it to his

147
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:31,140
back proving I had one brief comment on

148
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:34,199
working group Lashkar

149
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:35,550
I do think the draft is complete but I

150
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,910
gave the feedback to the authors that

151
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,770
it's currently not that readable it

152
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,839
needs an editorial path to make it easy

153
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:45,150
to consume right now it's too verbose

154
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,920
and too complicated so that's the only

155
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:48,720
thing that's remaining I think but we

156
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:55,589
should go to dr. Blasco is just an

157
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:58,820
editorial comment okay so this is Chris

158
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:02,040
lemons on Jabar saying point of order is

159
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,010
this sort of thing often best done as a

160
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,750
hum instead of a direct quote and by the

161
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:11,150
way this is Mahesh Shaitan and Anja and

162
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:11,150
I would add +1 to that okay

163
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,779
anyway I think this I just like to get

164
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,488
data point and the final decision made

165
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:25,920
on czar mailing this we will make an

166
00:12:23,489 --> 00:12:34,199
announcement very soon on the mailing

167
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:39,569
list ok next one is RT or consider okay

168
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:43,049
and then I and then RKO functional I

169
00:12:39,569 --> 00:12:46,049
think we're as I say I think this draft

170
00:12:43,049 --> 00:12:48,600
is very close to backing refresco so we

171
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:51,449
have our located some slot and then gory

172
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:57,959
you know we'll provide a feedback as

173
00:12:51,449 --> 00:13:01,229
assigned reviewers and then next one is

174
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:06,388
accurate Sen and in general generalized

175
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:10,230
vcn and recently we have many discussion

176
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:13,859
on these two draft and the chair think

177
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:17,069
this drug these two draft is also close

178
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:20,609
to the working group rustico but at the

179
00:13:17,069 --> 00:13:23,910
same time that she'll think we need to

180
00:13:20,609 --> 00:13:25,350
check several points before we move on

181
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:28,410
to the backing replace the work that's

182
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:31,290
why we allocate some time to discuss

183
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,379
this one so basically it's the purpose

184
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:37,469
of the discussion today it's if there is

185
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:40,169
any remaining technical points issue

186
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,470
before we going to go back in row Brasco

187
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:47,040
and then next point is what's the best

188
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:50,579
way to proceed this draft so we will

189
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,919
have a discuss later okay

190
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:58,758
that's about it's any comments about

191
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,759
change just right over chair something

192
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:17,850
okay so moving on to the presentation

193
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:19,230
okay Corey hi Corey first I'm gonna try

194
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:21,480
and talk a little bit about the RT or

195
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:26,070
considered draft this is just my own

196
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:29,519
review the purpose

197
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:32,100
of the sides isn't to make a

198
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,570
pronouncement on this it's just to try

199
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,730
and illustrate what we might want to

200
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:39,269
comment on as we go to a wicking group

201
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:42,329
last call and hopefully it helps other

202
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:47,370
people think and conclude on this piece

203
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:59,849
of work see if I can over what my slides

204
00:14:47,370 --> 00:15:01,259
say okay so yep that's just me so um I

205
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:02,810
had a bit context on reading this which

206
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:05,279
might be useful

207
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,810
Marc's been doing doing this document

208
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,180
for a long time he started off just

209
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,339
doing it and then it got more and more

210
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:13,949
concrete right at the time we did our

211
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:18,029
RCA 2 8 5 which he's know a little while

212
00:15:13,949 --> 00:15:19,740
ago and Mark commented on 825 and we

213
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:24,420
included some of the advice from this

214
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,940
into RFC 808 5 just the UDP advice and

215
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,329
I've written a document as a individual

216
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,860
and I read a whole lot of of documents

217
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:33,479
and I came to my own conclusion then I

218
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,790
went back to look at the RSC series to

219
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,110
see what it said I've now gone back and

220
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,050
looked at this document to see whether

221
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,720
it says the same thing and the final

222
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:45,089
point is this is my context the other

223
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,089
thing is this it represents BCP status

224
00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:50,699
it was originally a TCP oriented

225
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:52,769
document now is a little bit wider in

226
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,479
scope but it comes from TCP and so it

227
00:15:52,769 --> 00:16:00,449
gives the TCP background so good news I

228
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,010
read it again it is readable yeah I mean

229
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,949
my opinion is readable so anyone else

230
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,810
can read it it seems correct to me maybe

231
00:16:04,949 --> 00:16:08,459
there's bits to wigglin maybe there's

232
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:11,279
bits to discuss but the general thrust

233
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:13,160
is definitely in the right direction in

234
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:15,240
one or two places it says vague things

235
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,550
I'll come to those in a second

236
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:20,279
I don't know better ways to do these but

237
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:24,300
it is BCP so we should see whether the

238
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:26,399
BCP is actually some people can check

239
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,439
when somebody compares with this and

240
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,529
also comes to the same conclusion as NCC

241
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:37,469
guidelines so independent we came to the

242
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:39,209
same thing biggest question and I think

243
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,960
I know the answer but it's not entirely

244
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:44,540
clear

245
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:47,420
but and was quite small sorry and and

246
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:52,099
does he intend to update the existing

247
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:54,899
RFC's have been published and the words

248
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,700
kind of suggests it doesn't and then

249
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,730
some of the details kinda suggest it

250
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:03,089
might let you relax implementations that

251
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:10,050
exist of protocols beyond what is

252
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:11,910
specified in there RFC's i'm this makes

253
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:16,859
me a bit unsure about what what it's

254
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:18,829
doing and if it will yeah it's a

255
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:21,030
question so comment once a question that

256
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,678
yeah we can create hope with some oh

257
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:23,970
great

258
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,660
yeah and it might have a big impact on

259
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:30,210
how the working group sees that if we

260
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:33,420
otherwise you have two updates against

261
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:35,520
other RFC's so we should check that

262
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:36,900
first and then get feedback so this is a

263
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,129
general question on the whole thing it's

264
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,070
the most difficult questions so it's

265
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:43,110
comment one and here's once i don't

266
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:45,750
think we can easily get out of but mark

267
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:49,189
uses the word in steady state the RTR

268
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:51,720
should be based on recent observations i

269
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:55,440
don't give any idea about how to

270
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:59,490
quantify recent so that's probably okay

271
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:02,610
but we could say it was we could explain

272
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:03,870
what recent was if we knew if you have

273
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,540
opinions on this we can make the text

274
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:09,919
better otherwise it's kind of not that

275
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:14,309
useful as should to evaluate and

276
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:15,809
similarly in the same thing time stop

277
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:18,780
measurement should be taken regularly

278
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:20,670
and then it says the notion of regularly

279
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:22,710
should be defined as at least once per

280
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,110
RTT i think in this case marks done

281
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,970
exactly what I hope to do in comment too

282
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:28,590
but the text is mine good and it should

283
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,880
be more like the blue text below

284
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:33,178
in other words combine the two together

285
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:35,940
and just say it should be taken at least

286
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,890
once per RTT and you're done so do you

287
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:39,960
have thoughts Michael on that one a

288
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:46,110
little bit too I think or number three

289
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:50,490
either way good if you can read it okay

290
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:53,040
Michael Mike Ovitz I don't have a

291
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,620
comment on number two

292
00:18:53,040 --> 00:19:00,120
you brought up the definition of recent

293
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,770
I think given that the point of this

294
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,250
document is to try and be a bit more

295
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:07,110
vague in how we wanted to create a bit

296
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:09,810
more very room yes I think we should

297
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:12,060
make an effort to not try and define

298
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:15,330
reasons and leave it up to implementers

299
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:17,540
and and see if that passes okay so I

300
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,159
recommend we get rid of this shirt

301
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:24,720
because what's the point in relaxing it

302
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,220
and then having your should so but isn't

303
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,700
that a way of updating this back I mean

304
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:32,100
if you have a spec that says I mean if a

305
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,050
previous back has an as a capital shot

306
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,820
in it and then this one is trying to

307
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:38,100
relax the other one with them but not

308
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:40,340
but not with the capital shot then what

309
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:42,840
and then this has no meaning right I

310
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,070
think we want to probably overrule the

311
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:46,770
previous one with a more relaxed

312
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:48,899
definition so that in that way I think I

313
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,870
should be a capital shot but still it

314
00:19:48,900 --> 00:20:01,560
should be left Vegas if that's possible

315
00:19:51,870 --> 00:20:04,080
as a question I not a good idea okay you

316
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:07,080
just say may do whatever it likes and

317
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,790
can take or whatever I mean should

318
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,310
without a boundary is not really

319
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:13,500
something that's measurable should

320
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,710
without a boundary should should being

321
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,420
recent is not really about because you

322
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:21,620
there's no way I can look at that and

323
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,390
compare it with anything else okay so

324
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:25,919
okay this is this is me kind of doing a

325
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:27,240
review to try and create some discussion

326
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,690
here so we can go to working group last

327
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,320
call

328
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,300
not me pronouncing Jemaine younger yeah

329
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,770
I agree that it would be nice to have a

330
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,440
little more crisper definition of

331
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:39,960
reasoned in general I don't see a reason

332
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,030
why a BCP can't say should I think I'm

333
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,670
hoping you're not saying no that is okay

334
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:47,040
I like I like I like my own rewritten

335
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:49,290
blue text here which says shouldn't sex

336
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,129
it's kind of some sculpture or some

337
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:55,020
example of what this should means okay

338
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:58,290
that's what Janice said okay that's fine

339
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,230
I think probably these two can be read a

340
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:03,540
bit more and we can probably get

341
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:05,760
consensus I would imagine there's some

342
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:13,830
knit some choice of words

343
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:16,379
which really are nits and what about CC

344
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:18,629
guidelines you asked me about this this

345
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,580
is current an individual it may go

346
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:26,280
forward

347
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:28,710
it wasn't adopted this IETF and it tries

348
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:31,050
to set a much bigger box on another

349
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,300
group of stuff I would like to suggest

350
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:35,220
this is an unrelated document and it

351
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:38,970
does not have any impact on publishing

352
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:43,890
this here it will inevitably refer back

353
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:46,110
to this if that goes ahead Nia : I think

354
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:48,720
you did a very great and working group

355
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:50,370
last call with you here let's just do

356
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,960
the working group has corn game like one

357
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:54,209
or more than one or two more of these

358
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,640
reviews and get that given out the door

359
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,870
I don't think we need those we I mean

360
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,100
like great that you did it right but I

361
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,810
don't think we need those reviews before

362
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,219
working class called order to get ready

363
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:04,980
to work in class cause this is like

364
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,980
something you do in work oh I I was

365
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,750
asked to do a review and I pulled up

366
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,550
this stuff and these slides are now

367
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:14,610
available go read it yourself

368
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:17,610
and review shows we should really go for

369
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:19,199
working of last call yeah the reason why

370
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,209
we asked to review rights in the be hoe

371
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,360
hand we didn't get much feedback on this

372
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:28,860
rap that's why we assign the reviewers

373
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:32,370
here right now it's done corey one

374
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,080
question so these are determine our

375
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:34,649
comments from my point if it's not major

376
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,620
issues

377
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:41,490
so let's know after so you basically

378
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:45,270
okay with yeah

379
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,800
so you basically okay with proceeding

380
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,500
you working in brush to go as long as

381
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,850
you know we can sort it out - yeah my

382
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,500
comments for working great last call

383
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,379
will be these comments if the text

384
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:57,900
remains like this and these apart from

385
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:01,140
the first one there are none of these

386
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:02,520
comments which are which will block a

387
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,840
working group must call the first one

388
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,450
should be clarified I think by the

389
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,750
chairs so the intent of the document is

390
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:12,990
clear does it update other RFC's or does

391
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:16,890
it not because that is an important

392
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:18,480
thing to get right yeah you asked me

393
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,820
it's readable

394
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,220
I have comments there's one big question

395
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:24,540
and it would be ready for working great

396
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,470
last call does not conflict with

397
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:32,220
anything else I know of okay yeah

398
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:34,020
another reviewer what do you think I'll

399
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:36,540
first apologize for not having done the

400
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:39,720
review sooner and I am writing up some

401
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,690
things right now but it's I read through

402
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,240
the draft carefully and I think it's

403
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:48,240
it's it's well-written except there is

404
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,850
one major question that's a

405
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,030
clarification point or question of scope

406
00:23:50,850 --> 00:24:00,330
really of the document so the document

407
00:23:54,030 --> 00:24:02,190
isn't eCPM it says that the let me pull

408
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:04,439
the text search is horrible the text the

409
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,970
draft says in section 3 the principles

410
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,050
we are try on this document or protocol

411
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:10,650
agnostic and widely applicable so that's

412
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:14,960
point one

413
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,960
however the draft continues to say that

414
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,480
the requirements of this document only

415
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,730
apply to cases where loss detected by a

416
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:26,490
timer is repaired by a retransmission of

417
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:29,460
the original data and there are other

418
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:31,460
ways of doing recovery but this document

419
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,250
doesn't consider those transports

420
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:36,390
effectively the document precludes quick

421
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,530
because quick does not actually require

422
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:40,260
you to retransmit

423
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:43,889
it will requires you to detect loss now

424
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,140
I think there's a very simple way to fix

425
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,920
this which is to remove the requirement

426
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:51,780
for retransmission protocols that only

427
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,360
do retransmissions from the draft I

428
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:56,580
don't think it changes the the thrust of

429
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:59,969
the draft I think it's perfectly fine

430
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:01,649
without that I'll apologize to mark for

431
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,040
bringing this up this late I'm great I'm

432
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:06,030
grateful that he's not on the call

433
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,320
because when he when he else at his

434
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:10,879
computer later on I won't be there to

435
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,550
hear it but I'm happy to write this up

436
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,740
now and and send it but this is this is

437
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:18,780
a question I suppose do we want to say

438
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,490
this is for TCP or do we want to say

439
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,820
this is broader or for other protocols

440
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:24,810
and include quick in it explicitly or

441
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:28,320
it's somewhere in the middle right now

442
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:30,179
which is maybe alright I don't want to

443
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,010
have to go to change the whole thing

444
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,180
it's still useful as it is

445
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:35,070
I don't wanna make this go through a

446
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,040
whole of the process again that's okay

447
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:40,050
pretend that you and Ray be on that

448
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:42,830
meaning does about me that's Hugh

449
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:45,300
Acheson mailing list

450
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:47,220
Praveen I had a clarification question

451
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:48,899
actually for Jonah so when I say quick

452
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,670
doesn't do retransmission we're done

453
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:52,410
we're still with reliable delivery you

454
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:53,850
will end up retransmitting the payload

455
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,730
at some point if it's not the packet

456
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:58,980
right so I mean any reliable transport

457
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:08,280
in this probably applies to maybe maybe

458
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:12,420
in certain ways but not others I think

459
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,700
that's true but really what I care about

460
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:17,190
is loss detection ultimately the RTO is

461
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:19,830
about detection not about actually the

462
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,930
retransmission of the data after that so

463
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,310
I think I'm trying to say that if the

464
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:25,740
scope of the document is limited to

465
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:31,679
detection it applies much more broadly

466
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:33,660
than it does right now curry fellows at

467
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:36,600
the beginning I said IRC i-285 applies

468
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:39,150
to udp-based transports that applies to

469
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:41,399
quick this aligns I think with that

470
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:42,950
because Marc provided input to that so I

471
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:48,270
think this is probably just a circular

472
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:50,640
dependency as far as I can see as in you

473
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:52,770
asked does it apply to quick because

474
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:56,370
this says no only retransmission

475
00:26:52,770 --> 00:27:00,290
protocols RFC 808 5 does apply to quick

476
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:05,219
and has the same guidance in so we just

477
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:06,750
know yeah I mean this specific text

478
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:08,580
that's in the document that explicitly

479
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,260
goes ahead and precludes which is why I

480
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,939
think it's it's strong about it doesn't

481
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:19,200
need to be and it's an easy fix

482
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:21,060
I think it can be fixed easily so if it

483
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,380
actually was not intended to say that

484
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,000
like if they actually wanted to talk

485
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,800
about loss detection you're not about

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,360
because mission is unnecessary right but

487
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,190
like I also don't have any problem with

488
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,250
it because we have the experience with

489
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,720
TCP it's a PCP for TCP which is very

490
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,550
applicable to TCP and you can of course

491
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,680
use it for other protocols it would make

492
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:39,000
sense to you but it's like not binding

493
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:43,530
in that sense for other protocols which

494
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,880
is also fine so it's so Gaiden 3 yeah if

495
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,779
it's really just like if they didn't

496
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,799
intend or like

497
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:53,009
we didn't intend to say it we should

498
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:56,219
remove Morocco yaah grunting grunting

499
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:59,669
that is very important is that always

500
00:27:56,219 --> 00:28:02,419
even though its loss deduction was

501
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:04,769
detection means that we quite likely

502
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:06,299
retransmitted and retransmissions are

503
00:28:04,769 --> 00:28:08,549
always they have to do with the

504
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,799
congestion control so whenever you play

505
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,869
with the timer's that's related to

506
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:15,210
consistent Rockets also very clearly

507
00:28:12,869 --> 00:28:23,488
said also India conscious the motor

508
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:27,210
principles please read that and to add

509
00:28:23,489 --> 00:28:29,669
to that is an area especially when we

510
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:35,279
only have a few packets to send and we

511
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:38,249
are then everything is related to

512
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:41,399
retransmission timers then it's a very

513
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:43,799
delicate area because then when you have

514
00:28:41,399 --> 00:28:48,389
a lot of load that is the area where the

515
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:58,408
consistent collapse also happens if you

516
00:28:48,389 --> 00:29:05,539
are transmitting two months also we

517
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:08,219
respond to you okay so any more comments

518
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:14,239
then we we will move on to the next

519
00:29:08,219 --> 00:29:14,239
month zero

520
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,689
good morning everyone I'm Marcelo Angela

521
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:52,810
and I'm here to give a brief update on

522
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:58,130
the EC n plus plus general ICC and draft

523
00:29:52,810 --> 00:30:00,620
so this is a short recap so the ec n

524
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:04,760
plus plus draft the purpose is to enable

525
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:06,620
ec n marking in tcp control packets that

526
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:13,490
was precluded in the original

527
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:18,169
specification this table will show the

528
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:21,700
difference between the original 3168 ec

529
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:25,340
n specification and our proposed draft

530
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:28,220
basically the original specification

531
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:33,050
didn't enable the marking of any control

532
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,810
packet in the draft we allow this in two

533
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:38,120
different scenarios in case where a key

534
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:40,460
CN has been negotiated or is being

535
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,790
negotiated in the case that occasion is

536
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:45,830
not being negotiated so for most of

537
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:48,800
packet is the same thing you can mark

538
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:52,189
them except for a couple of cases where

539
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:55,970
you can only mark them as long as I mean

540
00:30:52,190 --> 00:31:05,000
you have are trying to negotiate

541
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:08,900
occasion we have so we have had a very

542
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,790
thorough review from Michael in the last

543
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:18,290
money over the last couple of months we

544
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:20,320
changed quite a few things I would say

545
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:23,170
that most of them were like

546
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,240
clarifications rewarding justifications

547
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:29,510
rearrangements Neen but essentially we

548
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,280
were like most editorial and and not

549
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:32,720
only editorial but clarifications in

550
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:34,850
this type of things right to improve

551
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,910
readability and this type of things and

552
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:42,860
there is one main change that we have

553
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:46,790
done based on Michaels comment that is

554
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:50,899
the following right in the previous

555
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:53,899
version of the draft the only the only

556
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:58,070
situation that you can actually mark the

557
00:31:53,900 --> 00:32:00,740
seen packet as ICT was if we were also

558
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:03,110
trying to negotiate occasion right the

559
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,950
reason for that is because a key CN

560
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:09,649
allows enables you enables the server

561
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:13,100
the one receiving the seen mark with AK

562
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:17,800
CCM to feedback the congestion signal in

563
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:23,030
case the scene was C marked right

564
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:25,100
standard I mean the current 3168 EC ends

565
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,810
I mean server supporting this spec does

566
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,290
have the means to provide that's it

567
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:34,490
right so we have the long discussions

568
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:37,129
before about this and the decision was

569
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,530
that unless you're able to feedback the

570
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:42,170
congestion signal back to the client you

571
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:44,960
should not be able to mark the scene

572
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,580
right that's why we only enabled the

573
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,980
marking of the scene if you were

574
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:58,220
negotiating a kiss en Michel suggestion

575
00:32:51,980 --> 00:33:00,230
was he still wanted to allow the marking

576
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,930
of the scene in cases where you were not

577
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:06,560
negotiating occasion and he proposed

578
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:09,380
that you do that as long as you keep the

579
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:12,290
initial window to one right you react as

580
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,930
if you have receive a mark a congestion

581
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:16,520
signal even though you will not receive

582
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:20,480
anything because there is no way for you

583
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:22,760
to get the signal back right so we we

584
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,530
thought that this was okay I mean it

585
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,940
doesn't break anything I mean it's I

586
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,950
mean you're putting yourself in the

587
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:30,920
worst case however the performance of

588
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:32,660
this will probably be worse than then I

589
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:34,130
mean you have a preferred front panel T

590
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,370
because of doing this yes

591
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:39,650
mark okay clarifying question so you

592
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:43,100
assuming that the accuracy and is the

593
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:45,830
only way to provide feedback right good

594
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:48,770
question a good good question so as

595
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:53,000
current what we are stating in the draft

596
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:55,370
is you can mark this if you have some

597
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,620
way to get the feedback back either a

598
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:59,360
Kishin or any other mechanism that will

599
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,159
be refined in the future because as far

600
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,260
as I know currently there is no other

601
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:05,730
standard that actually allows them yeah

602
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:10,260
that's my point in borracho

603
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:15,240
not to tie it on with any other metric

604
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:18,240
that words are in there yes and you can

605
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,259
also mark it as long as you if you don't

606
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:26,459
have a way to get the the the feedback

607
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:30,690
Mack you use initial window of one right

608
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:33,960
basically react as if you had fun - yes

609
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,369
media me it could even I just realized

610
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,960
it could can even generalize this a

611
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:39,419
little bit more because what we usually

612
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,918
the advice we give to UDP traffic that

613
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:42,418
is not congestion control is you kind of

614
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:44,638
sent more than one packet per under time

615
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:47,158
so if you keep your window forever at

616
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,899
one I don't know why you would do that

617
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,000
with TCP but maybe there's a case you

618
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:55,710
can actually mark all your packets also

619
00:34:51,000 --> 00:35:06,839
your X with it is he capable ECT cable I

620
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:08,790
mean that good make sense but if you

621
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:11,250
don't respond to congestion isn't it one

622
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,829
every three seconds or something because

623
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:18,980
you're not congestion responsive it's

624
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:18,980
one per RTT of your with that feedback

625
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:30,990
yeah except for safety level which is

626
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:33,510
one Sprott ET and the second one of

627
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,368
something that doesn't actually respond

628
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:38,150
which is once every three seconds but

629
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:40,800
this is this is probably the first case

630
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,450
if you know the RTT it's one priority if

631
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:49,579
you don't know the RTT it's once every

632
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:49,578
second thank you for reading it more I

633
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:59,730
have a suggestion

634
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:04,260
given that ECE is meant to be a sticky

635
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:07,770
bit could it be possible to keep the

636
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:11,460
initial window to one MSS until the

637
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:15,030
first act indicating that which can

638
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,300
indicates that no see e mark was

639
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:19,290
received and then the image initial

640
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:23,720
window can

641
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,720
Lupul initiation window can be applied

642
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,410
that sounds basically the the ECE base

643
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:35,940
is supposed to be sticking yes so it

644
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:38,700
could

645
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:42,540
after the initial handshake the court

646
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:51,750
also the see ecoute points that occurred

647
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:53,370
during the handshake so also you would

648
00:36:51,750 --> 00:37:01,500
only need to temporarily limit the

649
00:36:53,370 --> 00:37:13,049
initial window to one I don't want to

650
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:17,280
argue about this with you later so I was

651
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:19,920
just thinking about taking advantage of

652
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:27,210
the fact that ECE is sticky in standard

653
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:31,290
IO 61 6 8 so the stick could record the

654
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:33,150
the state of C II in during the

655
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:37,259
handshake even though it won't be

656
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:40,620
visible until after the handshake so for

657
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:43,470
the first RTT it might be necessary to

658
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:45,569
limit the initial window to 1 but

659
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:49,230
subsequently it could be increased

660
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:59,580
once the it is confirmed that no c e

661
00:37:49,230 --> 00:38:02,840
mark occurred during the handshake know

662
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:06,840
that the point is ECE comes back valid

663
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:12,180
after the handshake and at that point

664
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:14,310
you get the information what do you mean

665
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:16,589
AC comes back valid after the handshake

666
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:19,080
that the the 3 bits are used in the

667
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:23,280
handshake to say what the bits mean and

668
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:28,460
so there is no point where ECE means ECE

669
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,460
if a ket n is being negotiated

670
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:34,170
for the case here this is for the three

671
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:38,140
one six eight case the classical TN case

672
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:41,980
okay so all again men because I was in

673
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:45,460
completely the other case yeah right

674
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:48,880
so in Theon six eight ECE bit is sticky

675
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:52,480
yep so we can have it be sticky also

676
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:57,580
during the handshake phase although it

677
00:38:52,480 --> 00:39:00,520
is set during the handshake anyway so

678
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,060
you can only tell whether it was set by

679
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,300
a seee mark during the handshake

680
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,990
after the handshake has completed yep

681
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:13,750
so at that point you can find out

682
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:16,779
whether a CE mark occurred during the

683
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:23,710
handshake and restore the initial window

684
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:26,500
to the normal value but how can you tell

685
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:28,030
that it occurred during the handshake

686
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,630
because you've had it because it was

687
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,980
sticky it will it will won't what's the

688
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:42,220
difference between the two cases that

689
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:47,710
tells you whether it is because it's

690
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:51,970
clear assuming you've got some other

691
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:53,410
packets in the round-trip time okay but

692
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,750
unfortunately that's not exactly how

693
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:59,140
it's usually implemented because in a

694
00:39:55,750 --> 00:40:01,000
lot of cases it will just disable easy

695
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:03,540
and if you see you see in the indus in'

696
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:16,300
and not give you any feedback anymore

697
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:17,970
yeah that's what neurosis just we've

698
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:21,760
already told them that it shouldn't and

699
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:23,799
they're accessible RC 3168 says it

700
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:30,460
should and it's not a bug and he won't

701
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:32,410
move Brad Grimes I think that that even

702
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:34,630
though there's an implementation that is

703
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,430
potentially wrong right if we can

704
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:39,160
clarify here I think we should try and

705
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:42,790
clarify to clear up that situation that

706
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:43,629
not doing so is on us and not on the

707
00:40:42,790 --> 00:40:47,220
Linux people

708
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:51,249
that it's that would be very very useful

709
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:54,098
because on measurements 84% of servers

710
00:40:51,249 --> 00:40:57,359
in the world do this this behavior where

711
00:40:54,099 --> 00:40:58,479
they turn off ACN if they see only sin

712
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:01,299
okay

713
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:03,700
so just just do to understand this so

714
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:09,029
they situate so if I understand this I

715
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:12,609
don't know what your name is sorry sorry

716
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:14,890
Jonathan so I am as far as I understand

717
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:17,410
Jonathan suggestion seems seems

718
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:19,180
acceptable seems reasonable right the

719
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:23,489
problem is that there are

720
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:27,009
implementations that will behave in a on

721
00:41:23,489 --> 00:41:28,690
on desire way if that action did if we

722
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:30,630
take if you took that approach so the

723
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:33,029
question is whether we should want to

724
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:36,519
acknowledge the existence

725
00:41:33,029 --> 00:41:39,989
implementations and try to avoid having

726
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:43,359
a problem with them or do this that

727
00:41:39,989 --> 00:41:46,059
seems to work unless I'm except for the

728
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:52,509
fact that 80% of the server seems to

729
00:41:46,059 --> 00:41:55,450
take it in the wrong way so don't say

730
00:41:52,509 --> 00:42:00,989
bad behavior only occur on ze mark or

731
00:41:55,450 --> 00:42:05,140
also for ECT media do the measurement so

732
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:06,279
let me wake up first so actually it's

733
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,348
not a problem because like if that

734
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:09,969
occurs you won't negotiate easy and with

735
00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:11,289
the server right and then you're in the

736
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:12,700
state where just not like you should

737
00:42:11,289 --> 00:42:14,799
easy and capable and you shouldn't set

738
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,359
any easy nfx so if you negotiate easy

739
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,910
and with the server then you're right if

740
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:20,769
you don't get feedback right then you

741
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:22,450
should be able to be then you should

742
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:23,649
know that there was no marking and you

743
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:25,660
can probably increase your window again

744
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,979
but I think we should double-check how

745
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:28,660
this is implemented if it's actually

746
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:29,739
implemented as sticky or not I mean it

747
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,828
should be but I'm not sure how it's

748
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:34,420
implemented that's the one part so like

749
00:42:32,829 --> 00:42:36,099
if it's actually implemented a sticky we

750
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:38,979
can do that the other part is that if

751
00:42:36,099 --> 00:42:40,900
you said to Seema if you said easy and

752
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:42,578
capable and DCE Mac Mac said it's

753
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,989
usually just to see Mac where they fall

754
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:46,569
back there a few implementations will

755
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:48,219
also fall back on the etc' and I think

756
00:42:46,569 --> 00:42:50,140
that isn't that even mentioned in the

757
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:51,670
draft that this behavior exists yes so

758
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,879
like maybe we should also put a warning

759
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:56,970
here in addition on where we say where

760
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,050
we talk about like these case

761
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:03,359
okay so essentially looks like we need

762
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,810
to verify a few things but we're going

763
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,859
forward with Jonathan's suggestion

764
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,970
correct okay excellent okay any I don't

765
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:17,250
know if I don't think I have anything

766
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:23,118
else yeah so next steps what do we will

767
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:23,119
discuss later okay good yeah thank you

768
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:31,160
next Bob you want to say something about

769
00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:31,160
accurate Eason while you are fine okay

770
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:51,690
you need five minutes or something then

771
00:43:43,490 --> 00:44:03,240
okay oh you can directly connect HDMI

772
00:43:51,690 --> 00:44:12,560
cable to your laptop but you can you can

773
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:12,560
connect see you

774
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:47,420
yeah I can sup agenda with media okay

775
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:49,669
what will you can send side to me okay

776
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,500
it's the traffic only saying even if you

777
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:56,089
don't negotiate classic you see and you

778
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,890
can set ect in the Sun if you have a

779
00:44:56,089 --> 00:45:02,960
congestion window phone or you have to

780
00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:04,790
at least negotiate classic ecn I don't

781
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,010
know what it says but it should be

782
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,570
saying that you can only set it up if

783
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,160
you're negotiating classic you see and

784
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,330
that's what that's what I thought it

785
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,920
should say I don't know if that's what I

786
00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:17,960
wrote but okay oh yeah

787
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,150
while Bobo is preparing tonight video

788
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:29,020
we'll talk about legislation policy for

789
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:29,020
TCP header flags good morning

790
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:35,450
okay so I just submitted on Monday a

791
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:36,950
very short draft to make a proposal and

792
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:38,240
it's like it's one of these very

793
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:41,810
exciting topics where you talk about

794
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:48,520
registration policies so what we have

795
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:51,259
right now is that we have our C 27:18

796
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:54,380
2780 that specifies the registration

797
00:45:51,260 --> 00:46:00,710
policy for the TCP header flex standard

798
00:45:54,380 --> 00:46:03,020
section and we have 31 80 68 which

799
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:04,880
actually forms a registry for these

800
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,589
slicks so firstly there was there was a

801
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,670
registration action but no registry then

802
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:12,589
we had a registry and then after that we

803
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:14,270
had an experimental RFC that assigned

804
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:15,770
bit number seven which is not really

805
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,180
what the registration policy said I

806
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:20,660
don't know how that happened was before

807
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:25,640
my time and then recently we decided

808
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:27,259
that we move 35 40 to historic and also

809
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:33,259
change the entry in the registry and put

810
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:35,000
it to reserve so that was our see 83 11

811
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,170
you can still follow me with all the RFC

812
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:41,630
numbers Friday morning and

813
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:43,190
I'm using trick here 83 11 doesn't make

814
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,280
any recommendations what to do about

815
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,630
like you know how we can use seven bit

816
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,310
number seven again it says like it's

817
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,770
open for experimentation but like what

818
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:55,790
do we do about the registration in the

819
00:46:51,770 --> 00:46:57,470
regice regice tree and so we now want to

820
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:59,720
use it again for equity CN and we are

821
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:01,160
not sure what to do here

822
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,660
so what I'm proposing here is actually

823
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,140
to change the registration policy to

824
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:08,750
experimental because like what what it

825
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,520
depends on like how we apply use of

826
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:12,290
experimental and proposed standard in

827
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:13,790
this working group but to my feeling

828
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:16,220
whatever we want to do with those bits

829
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:18,470
we will publish an expert experimental

830
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:21,830
RFC first and similar as we are in this

831
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:23,839
situation was accurate ACN right now we

832
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:26,210
really want to make using the bit part

833
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,300
of the experiment usually so how can we

834
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:31,370
ever use a bit if we want an experiment

835
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:34,220
but then we have send as action registry

836
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:36,109
so the the the end of this thought

837
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,459
process would be that we use a bit for

838
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:38,750
an experiment we don't put it in the

839
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:40,340
registry which also doesn't make sense

840
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:42,590
because we have a registry so actually

841
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:43,910
announce that it's used so that's why I

842
00:47:42,590 --> 00:47:46,280
would like to change the registration

843
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,049
policy here of course we have to be very

844
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,460
careful of course we need like strong

845
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,620
agreement that we really want to do that

846
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,810
but like s proposed standards all

847
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:56,960
experimental RFC skills basically

848
00:47:53,810 --> 00:47:59,060
through my like same process usually

849
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,260
they also have IETF consensus but I

850
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,000
think it's actually more important that

851
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,340
this group in this room has consensus

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,350
about it and we should really make sure

853
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:08,330
that also the experiments talk about

854
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:10,279
what happens if the experiment fails how

855
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,900
or how you can like change anything that

856
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:13,370
is under experimentation these kind of

857
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,590
things so it has to be carefully

858
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:17,089
discussed in every experimental RFC but

859
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:20,390
I think we and this group can make sure

860
00:48:17,090 --> 00:48:24,950
that this happens do you want me to show

861
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:26,569
the next slide okay so this is like one

862
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:28,339
proposal there other proposals we could

863
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,080
only apply this to the equity CN bit

864
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:32,420
because it was already messed up or like

865
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:34,460
the the nonce bit actually the reserve

866
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,410
bit because that was already messed up

867
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:37,580
and there's also chance for temporary

868
00:48:36,410 --> 00:48:38,779
assignment but it doesn't really say

869
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:41,870
exactly what a temporary assignment

870
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:44,000
isn't what it means or we can just like

871
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,710
not assign it and and go on with the

872
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,600
experiment or whatever or like we could

873
00:48:45,710 --> 00:48:49,250
change equities en to propose to end it

874
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,999
and not change the registry and I care

875
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:51,559
about this later

876
00:48:49,999 --> 00:48:56,169
when we try to use an expert right oh

877
00:48:51,559 --> 00:48:58,699
just one thing before this presentation

878
00:48:56,169 --> 00:49:00,529
tell we're organized discuss about how

879
00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:03,439
to proceed accurate easy and and then

880
00:49:00,529 --> 00:49:05,119
press the stuff so that's not your if

881
00:49:03,439 --> 00:49:07,669
your comment is directed to this

882
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:10,579
proposal please make a comment all right

883
00:49:07,669 --> 00:49:12,739
if you right now I don't want to talk

884
00:49:10,579 --> 00:49:14,199
about weekly yeah yeah good I actually

885
00:49:12,739 --> 00:49:16,239
do have a comment about this proposal

886
00:49:14,199 --> 00:49:21,259
actually can go to the next slide

887
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:27,889
no no I don't know but no because it's

888
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:31,699
not defined and he'll know so I would

889
00:49:27,889 --> 00:49:34,609
submit that basically any use of these

890
00:49:31,699 --> 00:49:36,349
flags is going to be in its initial

891
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:38,649
deployment phase which is from twenty

892
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:41,689
twenty to twenty twenty-nine

893
00:49:38,649 --> 00:49:43,098
experimental de facto so I think that

894
00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:44,689
the document or the you know the

895
00:49:43,099 --> 00:49:48,019
documentation about this registry should

896
00:49:44,689 --> 00:49:51,649
actually reflect the reality and that's

897
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:53,959
what this does so do it I'll notice that

898
00:49:51,649 --> 00:49:55,759
we did a we you know so you and I

899
00:49:53,959 --> 00:50:00,348
actually did a very small experiment

900
00:49:55,759 --> 00:50:02,029
last year that that compared in a small

901
00:50:00,349 --> 00:50:05,689
slice of the network the deployability

902
00:50:02,029 --> 00:50:09,829
of these actual flags without a

903
00:50:05,689 --> 00:50:12,739
registration to experimental TCP options

904
00:50:09,829 --> 00:50:14,629
and this came up favorably like it was

905
00:50:12,739 --> 00:50:18,319
there was no like the difficulty of

906
00:50:14,629 --> 00:50:19,549
deployment was the same so given that I

907
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,979
think we even have data that says that

908
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:23,479
yes this is experimental and you know

909
00:50:21,979 --> 00:50:28,158
make their make the document reflect

910
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:32,058
reality so adopt publish last call home

911
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:33,589
we're done repeat the good news like

912
00:50:32,059 --> 00:50:35,929
what we actually found is that using the

913
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:43,879
bits is easier than using new TCP hops

914
00:50:35,929 --> 00:50:46,069
right so gory first I think you've

915
00:50:43,879 --> 00:50:51,589
applied the slow start method to writing

916
00:50:46,069 --> 00:50:53,899
Internet drafts yes I like the idea of

917
00:50:51,589 --> 00:50:56,509
doing this no I don't like your draft

918
00:50:53,899 --> 00:50:58,969
and no I don't like the choice of

919
00:50:56,509 --> 00:51:00,469
keywords in your draft and no I don't

920
00:50:58,969 --> 00:51:01,999
like the spelling mistakes and other

921
00:51:00,469 --> 00:51:03,210
stuff so thank you for making a draft

922
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:07,529
quickly

923
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:09,540
I think we need to kind of get the the

924
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:11,910
detail right because there's a couple of

925
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:13,890
things that kind of really go oddly one

926
00:51:11,910 --> 00:51:15,750
is the fish this should at the one up

927
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:18,598
here like should discuss the scope the

928
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,130
experimental potential failure causes of

929
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,410
something that kind of might last for a

930
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,770
long time why don't we say must discuss

931
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:28,740
I mean let's let's describe or must must

932
00:51:25,770 --> 00:51:30,450
have this bit in the document that goes

933
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,859
ahead because then then we say it's

934
00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:33,029
going to be there and we can look at it

935
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:33,720
and then we can make the decision and

936
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:37,740
then move on

937
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:44,660
rather than should because why wouldn't

938
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:44,660
you you should write something in your

939
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:56,070
we do the experimental thing then and I

940
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,868
think we really should put it in the

941
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:59,460
registry because this this could last

942
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:01,230
for a long time and we should just be in

943
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,940
there documenting the way you say I like

944
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:09,599
that part and I even get the details

945
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:11,130
right here oh you want you to write your

946
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,980
own draft and I just like I don't want

947
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:15,300
to write my own draft no your idea of

948
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:21,720
just throwing something out there and

949
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:26,240
going I'll happily help David black

950
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:29,069
author of 83 11 yes do this at the time

951
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,200
the HP eleven was done I already had

952
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,869
more than enough stuff I was cooked with

953
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,790
net draft and did not I don't think the

954
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:37,680
tray sponsor was ever mentioned had it

955
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:39,650
mentioned at the time I would have

956
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,669
gently declined to have taken on

957
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:43,290
consumer had already had more than

958
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:49,710
enough scope creep adventures on 83

959
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:52,020
eleven rod Grimes I've read the draft

960
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:54,210
I'm in agreement with them with Corey on

961
00:52:52,020 --> 00:53:05,339
what I see here I like much more than

962
00:52:54,210 --> 00:53:07,170
what I read in the draft yeah I mean the

963
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:08,549
only there was only one real negative in

964
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:10,700
the draft and that was the word that was

965
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:13,200
recent used and I don't I don't like

966
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,089
time-variant sayings in drafts so that

967
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,980
that we shouldn't talk because recent

968
00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:21,570
only applies for a short period of time

969
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:24,720
so that but the the other one is how do

970
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:27,660
we handle the the must situation that's

971
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:30,029
in the draft of we must negotiate before

972
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:33,210
use of the bits which effectively means

973
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:35,790
the bits or permanently have a default

974
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:38,550
state where they're unused so if you if

975
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:41,640
you don't negotiate there's no way to

976
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:44,430
ever use the bit so I think I would like

977
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:47,040
to see language added that would allow

978
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:49,649
the bit somehow to be used it's it's a

979
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:52,650
it's a little teeny last code point that

980
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:54,660
is available even with even after all

981
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:57,089
the negotiations fail there's a

982
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:58,828
possibility to use it so when I was what

983
00:53:57,089 --> 00:54:00,540
I was trying to say in the draft if you

984
00:53:58,829 --> 00:54:02,280
use a bit you need to add some kind of

985
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:03,630
negotiation mechanism to make sure that

986
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:06,420
like whatever you define in your

987
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:08,190
experiment can be changed but like

988
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:09,630
there's no negotiation to use a bit like

989
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:13,170
because like I don't know how that would

990
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:14,520
work okay yeah sounds like there's a

991
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:16,440
little bit of words nothing to do here

992
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,910
because one of the one of the things you

993
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,859
might want to do is use these bits to

994
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:22,020
negotiate the use of the bits all right

995
00:54:19,859 --> 00:54:23,730
like cuz I mean like so any any encoding

996
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:25,200
is is probably gonna have a trick like

997
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:26,880
that like you know so we did with our

998
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,049
you know we we actually did a little bit

999
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:29,640
of an experiment where we just used all

1000
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,450
three of them because they're just

1001
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:32,160
sitting there are no one's ever gonna

1002
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,450
use them and we stuck the back and the

1003
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,940
spin bet on them because it was easier

1004
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:38,730
to get the spin bit to be implemented on

1005
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,980
TCP than it was on quick which is a

1006
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:43,800
different comment for a different room

1007
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,540
but yeah so tightening up the stuff

1008
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,490
about negotiation and making sure that

1009
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:49,319
it's clear that these are usable and you

1010
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:50,700
know it is not restricting how you can

1011
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:52,349
get them to the state where you can use

1012
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:53,790
them as good so I mean I think this is a

1013
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:55,470
really important point because the point

1014
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:57,660
is if you have proposed on it you don't

1015
00:54:55,470 --> 00:54:58,799
have to think about like negotiation

1016
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:00,810
anymore because you're sure this

1017
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,680
mechanism is like what we want and we

1018
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:06,210
never want to change it ever again right

1019
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:09,000
for an experiment it's really important

1020
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:11,369
to be able to like change some things so

1021
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,410
so is negotiation presume to work with

1022
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:15,060
options and if so aren't we just then

1023
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,879
joking ourselves to the problems with

1024
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:21,930
options I'm not saying anything about

1025
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:25,020
this is there some other mechanism that

1026
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:28,379
I'm not in I mean an accurate easy and

1027
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:30,270
we actually use bits for negotiation and

1028
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:30,900
then we use the field with the three

1029
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,279
easy end

1030
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:33,630
it's in a different way and that gives

1031
00:55:32,279 --> 00:55:37,170
you an additional level of negotiation

1032
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:42,480
so there are other options yes mm-hmm

1033
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:46,619
I'm just particularly thinking about how

1034
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:49,279
non some did things historically which

1035
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:52,680
is they there was no explicit

1036
00:55:49,279 --> 00:55:58,609
negotiation for use of that bit at the

1037
00:55:52,680 --> 00:56:03,890
time it was presumed to be available if

1038
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:06,000
ecn was negotiated and then post

1039
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:09,118
handshake

1040
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,119
if the the end points was verify between

1041
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:19,859
themselves whether the functionality was

1042
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:24,690
actually there can i clarify the nonce

1043
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:26,549
some was on the set on the sin and but

1044
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:33,660
it was a declaration and the receiver

1045
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:35,250
didn't have to do anything about it I'm

1046
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:38,910
nearly absolutely sure about that

1047
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:40,289
because I looked into it but there no

1048
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:41,879
I'm actually quite sure that's not the

1049
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:43,980
case but because we use exactly the same

1050
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:48,029
bin to make it to negotiate a courtesy

1051
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:50,039
and we you said bid to negotiate a

1052
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:53,670
courtesy and if that was used with nuns

1053
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:57,869
it wouldn't work you're right

1054
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:59,460
yes so I think I think Jonathan is right

1055
00:56:57,869 --> 00:57:02,640
but I'm not sure what the implications

1056
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:08,270
for these draft for this draft is what

1057
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:16,288
should a what is like what is enduring

1058
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:18,509
I'm basically saying that requiring an

1059
00:57:16,289 --> 00:57:20,940
explicit negotiation during the

1060
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:26,520
handshake might be inconsistent with

1061
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:28,680
previous usage to say is that if you

1062
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:32,490
want to use this bit you need some way

1063
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:35,129
of negotiation it in order to change the

1064
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:37,859
mechanism that is using the bit somehow

1065
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:39,960
it doesn't say you have to use a bit for

1066
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:41,520
negotiation it doesn't say like you have

1067
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:43,289
to use an option or whatever it doesn't

1068
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,810
say how you do you negotiate and win but

1069
00:57:43,289 --> 00:57:45,070
you have

1070
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:48,779
you have to have a way because it's

1071
00:57:45,070 --> 00:57:48,780
experimental to change your experiment

1072
00:57:48,990 --> 00:57:53,680
okay I think we can discuss the

1073
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,180
semantics offline and and and I think

1074
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:57,640
actually Nantes did not a good job about

1075
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,990
defining the experiment and trying to

1076
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:01,060
figure out you know what could fail and

1077
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:03,279
how to change it but I also don't know

1078
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,170
how non that assigned to this bit

1079
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,480
because that doesn't seem to be what the

1080
00:58:05,170 --> 00:58:09,610
procedures are saying and I'm not old

1081
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,900
enough for that I'm sorry like somebody

1082
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,330
maybe somebody remembers I would really

1083
00:58:10,900 --> 00:58:14,680
like to know some broad crimes I'm in

1084
00:58:13,330 --> 00:58:16,210
agreement with Johnathan here that I

1085
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,549
think we've discussed this enough I

1086
00:58:16,210 --> 00:58:20,110
think we're in and we've got some paths

1087
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:22,060
forward we need to do a little bit of

1088
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:23,260
research and figure out maybe what some

1089
00:58:22,060 --> 00:58:26,380
of these other things that might be

1090
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:29,830
possibilities are but this is a really

1091
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:34,510
good start to move things forward thank

1092
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:37,480
you I I'm

1093
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:40,540
I'm stood up so far and I'm surprised

1094
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:42,040
Michael hasn't either but I just want to

1095
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:44,740
make sure that we're not thinking that

1096
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:48,720
because you put X P of the top four

1097
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:53,830
draft it means it's more reversible yeah

1098
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,569
you know it's the the question of

1099
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:57,130
whether something is an experiment

1100
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,750
doesn't depend on what you put at the

1101
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:04,750
top of the draft it depends on whether

1102
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:06,550
it's reversible and so I I think maybe

1103
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:08,230
the least we should do is write into

1104
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:12,010
this thing some some statement like that

1105
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:16,270
say it must they're working it must be

1106
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:18,840
clear that the the experimental status

1107
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:22,060
is not used just to get a code point in

1108
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:24,610
India in the TCP header you have it

1109
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:26,320
prove that it's reversible it actually

1110
00:59:24,610 --> 00:59:29,830
the draft says it's not result

1111
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,600
reversible if you use these bits then

1112
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:33,700
you use them if you deploy it then they

1113
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:35,200
are in use then it's not reversible

1114
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,210
anymore that's the problem about that's

1115
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,980
why we had the Senate's action before

1116
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:40,780
but what the draft does say is that

1117
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:42,760
because it's not reversible you have to

1118
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:45,340
make sure you can still change your

1119
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:48,240
mechanisms you propose so you need some

1120
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:48,240
negotiation for that

1121
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,430
I'm broad crimes again I I think to

1122
00:59:54,450 --> 00:59:57,960
address what Bob just said would would

1123
00:59:56,430 --> 01:00:00,990
be to add the language that there must

1124
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,060
be a deployment plan before the bits can

1125
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,580
be even negotiated there has to be a

1126
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:07,380
deployment plan which would include a DP

1127
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:12,119
deployment plan by adding that as a

1128
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:13,410
requirement so I think the Oni I think

1129
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,970
it's what you're actually saying there

1130
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,618
and the care must be taking an

1131
01:00:14,970 --> 01:00:18,480
experiment since you should discuss the

1132
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,920
scope of the experiment in the potential

1133
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,900
failure cases of what you're talking

1134
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,400
about is the deployment plan so good

1135
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:25,410
like my point actually is I don't think

1136
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:26,610
that it's a way to deploy if you studied

1137
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:28,770
deployment and you've been successful

1138
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:30,300
even so like the mechanism you're

1139
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:32,340
proposing doesn't work in the way you

1140
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:34,410
want it to be right if you did deploy it

1141
01:00:32,340 --> 01:00:36,810
there's no way to under ploy it anymore

1142
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:39,629
but you can still use the bit because

1143
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:41,279
you have a negotiation no because you

1144
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:42,720
negotiate what you do with a bit not the

1145
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,170
use of the bit there's no way to

1146
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:48,390
negotiate the use of the bit so that's

1147
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:54,750
the whole point here why why it was an

1148
01:00:48,390 --> 01:00:55,650
experimental before it gen-i anger I

1149
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,510
don't know why there's so much confusion

1150
01:00:55,650 --> 01:01:00,359
around this I think this is very

1151
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:02,670
straightforward I think we should adopt

1152
01:01:00,359 --> 01:01:04,380
this it seems sensible yeah there's

1153
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:08,160
there's review later on to figure out if

1154
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:11,520
bid that was previously assigned can be

1155
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:16,109
reversed or not Simon can be reversed if

1156
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:18,869
you have no deployment yeah respond to

1157
01:01:16,109 --> 01:01:20,220
the previous speakers point you can have

1158
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:21,660
a plan for deployment a plan for

1159
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:24,600
deployment doesn't mean deployment I

1160
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:26,190
have plan for deploying many things it

1161
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:27,779
doesn't mean that they are deployed and

1162
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,520
so really the question at the point when

1163
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:32,100
you want to reverse something is to look

1164
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,050
and see as we always do if it's already

1165
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,460
been deployed if it's not deployed go

1166
01:01:34,050 --> 01:01:37,050
ahead and reverse it if it's reasonable

1167
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:38,480
pain go ahead and reverse it if it's not

1168
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:42,990
reasonable pain you can't reverse it

1169
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:47,250
this is Trey Polster draft was intended

1170
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:49,410
to say and it should say it just just to

1171
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:52,740
point out the Nam's experience we

1172
01:01:49,410 --> 01:01:57,629
believe it was only ever deployed by on

1173
01:01:52,740 --> 01:02:00,680
one testbed but it took us 19 years to

1174
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:02,850
establish that it wasn't deployed I

1175
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:03,990
didn't say that any of these experiments

1176
01:02:02,850 --> 01:02:04,950
will be quick

1177
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:06,660
Jahangir I think

1178
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:09,240
I think that number differs depending on

1179
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:11,759
who you ask the same swing true of

1180
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:12,930
pretty much any technology but that's

1181
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,599
that's not the point that's why I think

1182
01:02:12,930 --> 01:02:16,770
we we sort of hand this off to the iesg

1183
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,079
to figure out what to do with that

1184
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:20,490
decision I think it took us 19 years

1185
01:02:19,079 --> 01:02:21,710
because 15 years nobody was interested

1186
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:24,689
in the bed

1187
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:30,630
David white plus plus plus one on what

1188
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:33,510
merely just said okay thank you it's cut

1189
01:02:30,630 --> 01:03:10,770
so Danny okay Bob you want to say say

1190
01:02:33,510 --> 01:03:15,170
something to try and stand there and I'm

1191
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:21,660
gonna be talking about a cure ACN which

1192
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:24,990
is a proposed update to the TTP wire

1193
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:29,520
protocol you can think of it a bit like

1194
01:03:24,990 --> 01:03:32,660
when sach updated TTP to get more

1195
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:34,920
accurate feedback about drop and this is

1196
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:38,310
updating that is to be water particle to

1197
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:46,319
get more accurate information about ACN

1198
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:53,310
feedback right so a couple of recap

1199
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:55,259
slides the idea is - well there's the

1200
01:03:53,310 --> 01:03:58,529
ACN field in the IP header and then

1201
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:03,210
three three bits use three flags in the

1202
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:06,420
TCP header in order both to negotiate

1203
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:09,440
and then use over load and use those so

1204
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:14,099
much like we've just been talking about

1205
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:16,680
to really solve a problem with the 3168

1206
01:04:14,099 --> 01:04:17,250
feedback that I was Jonathan calls it

1207
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,640
was sticky

1208
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:24,099
you could only you could only

1209
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:27,970
feedback 1 congestion experienced mark /

1210
01:04:24,099 --> 01:04:31,450
round-trip time and the structure

1211
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:33,189
accurate ACN was that you have these

1212
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:34,779
these three bits in the header but once

1213
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:36,460
you once you're established once your

1214
01:04:34,779 --> 01:04:38,680
connections established you use those a

1215
01:04:36,460 --> 01:04:40,569
three bit counter which is continually

1216
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:42,609
repeated to count in the number of C

1217
01:04:40,569 --> 01:04:45,970
marks which means that if you have a

1218
01:04:42,609 --> 01:04:48,819
thinning or loss or whatever that you'll

1219
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:50,500
still see when you get do get a back

1220
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:51,940
through you'll see where the counters

1221
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:56,049
got to but obviously being only three

1222
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:58,960
bits it can only last up to eight

1223
01:04:56,049 --> 01:05:02,230
increments of the C II can't er and then

1224
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,029
you use that with the other fields at

1225
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:07,599
number and signals number to work out

1226
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:11,519
how many bytes if you want to and there

1227
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:16,809
was a supplementary accuracy an option

1228
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:17,828
with variable length for a number of

1229
01:05:16,809 --> 01:05:21,309
fields and that's what I'm going to talk

1230
01:05:17,829 --> 01:05:23,170
about today and that and that was it was

1231
01:05:21,309 --> 01:05:28,950
added in so that you can have

1232
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:32,170
information about more fields such as

1233
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:36,970
the EC T 1 and e ste 0 if you want to

1234
01:05:32,170 --> 01:05:43,680
get feedback on them and so we've had

1235
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:45,730
one suggestion that to cut the current

1236
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,348
sorry these slides were drawn very

1237
01:05:45,730 --> 01:05:51,190
quickly so I may have to explain them or

1238
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:55,630
I'm done a good job of explaining them

1239
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:58,509
visually properly the current design is

1240
01:05:55,630 --> 01:06:02,680
the top one and the proposed design is

1241
01:05:58,509 --> 01:06:05,230
to have both of them and for the initial

1242
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:06,549
value in the first field to determine

1243
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:10,180
which order the fields are in for the

1244
01:06:06,549 --> 01:06:12,250
rest of the connection alright and the

1245
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:15,879
initial values are chosen so the first

1246
01:06:12,250 --> 01:06:18,279
one is one in the least me for a bit and

1247
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:21,730
the alternative has a one in the most

1248
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:23,829
end at least significant bit if you

1249
01:06:21,730 --> 01:06:28,210
can't work your hex out just so you have

1250
01:06:23,829 --> 01:06:31,390
to check one bit yeah okay

1251
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,550
and that's also been pointed out that if

1252
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:35,500
someone's monitoring the path that means

1253
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:36,880
that you're affected your counters are

1254
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:38,710
fixed we've got halfway through the path

1255
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,450
when used to halfway through the number

1256
01:06:38,710 --> 01:06:42,849
space when you start and so even if you

1257
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:45,580
miss beginning of the connection you can

1258
01:06:42,849 --> 01:06:47,290
tell for quite a long time which all of

1259
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:49,710
the fields are and things like that all

1260
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:51,359
right okay

1261
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:56,470
[Music]

1262
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:57,730
so that was one thing we did oh that's

1263
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,629
what we're proposing to do we haven't

1264
01:06:57,730 --> 01:07:00,520
put that in the draft yet

1265
01:06:58,630 --> 01:07:05,440
it's we've written a text and my waiting

1266
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:10,210
to see what people say so Bob just took

1267
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:11,680
check the accuracy an option requires

1268
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,030
you to support the option which is kind

1269
01:07:11,680 --> 01:07:15,520
of a question whether you want to do

1270
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:18,220
that if you support one option you could

1271
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,410
support two options and we could have an

1272
01:07:18,220 --> 01:07:22,930
invariant format two different crimes

1273
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:24,700
two different yeah two two things that

1274
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:26,529
identified it very clearly from the

1275
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:27,970
beginning rather than kind of embedded

1276
01:07:26,530 --> 01:07:29,560
in the data and they could have a fixed

1277
01:07:27,970 --> 01:07:32,470
format is that any more difficult to

1278
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:35,349
deploy the to kind version I propose

1279
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:38,230
that and joko said no so I come up with

1280
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:40,359
this sure and that was a good thing to

1281
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:43,750
do to propose something else to see if

1282
01:07:40,359 --> 01:07:45,970
it was better or more ugly I'm just

1283
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:48,730
wondering whether the first one has as

1284
01:07:45,970 --> 01:07:50,589
in using two kinds is actually a simpler

1285
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:52,300
format and easier to see what's going on

1286
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:55,119
right oh and I suppose this has the

1287
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:56,349
advantage that it is for the case where

1288
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,400
someone's measuring and this is the

1289
01:07:56,349 --> 01:07:59,230
beginning of the connection this is

1290
01:07:57,400 --> 01:08:01,390
clearer what's going on if you miss the

1291
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:04,630
beginning of the connection or you know

1292
01:08:01,390 --> 01:08:06,819
packet gets lost and you don't see the

1293
01:08:04,630 --> 01:08:10,210
first packet first or they get reordered

1294
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:12,400
you know this one still works but the

1295
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:15,010
kind one will work all the time yeah you

1296
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,779
know Ruud Grimes either solution would

1297
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:18,279
work I kind of like this and that it

1298
01:08:16,779 --> 01:08:19,839
does give you that middle of the flow if

1299
01:08:18,279 --> 01:08:21,600
you miss the negotiation at the

1300
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:23,439
beginning you do have a detection

1301
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:27,190
mechanism to know whether you're looking

1302
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:33,189
at a t0b or ECB while the flow is

1303
01:08:27,189 --> 01:08:34,899
running you can tell that but if you

1304
01:08:33,189 --> 01:08:37,330
don't capture that when you're trying to

1305
01:08:34,899 --> 01:08:39,189
do monitoring data you don't know what

1306
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:41,318
was negotiated in the beginning of

1307
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:41,559
during the setup so you don't know what

1308
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:45,550
the

1309
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,310
to value fields are you agree with that

1310
01:08:45,550 --> 01:08:50,230
but without they will have the coin will

1311
01:08:48,310 --> 01:08:53,109
be different anyway if you use the kind

1312
01:08:50,229 --> 01:08:54,879
two kinds but this does mean that you

1313
01:08:53,109 --> 01:09:02,770
say one kind out of the numbers basis

1314
01:08:54,880 --> 01:09:06,880
okay yes yeah right so shall we go ahead

1315
01:09:02,770 --> 01:09:12,250
with this one yeah I mean there I know

1316
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:14,290
there endless ways to design but and so

1317
01:09:12,250 --> 01:09:17,100
what we do is we use the initial value

1318
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:19,180
to that identify the field right

1319
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,620
basically so we could actually do this

1320
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,120
for all the fields and then we could

1321
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:27,760
just like order them in any order we

1322
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:29,680
want always explain what you want to do

1323
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:31,510
that because at some point you might

1324
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:36,850
figure out you like want to have the CE

1325
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:38,470
Marking first are you implying that we

1326
01:09:36,850 --> 01:09:41,890
you can do this more than once in a

1327
01:09:38,470 --> 01:09:43,690
connection or only at the beginning no

1328
01:09:41,890 --> 01:09:45,550
you could you can pick an initial value

1329
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:49,689
for each of the fields that identifies

1330
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:53,529
the fields the field and I mean I have

1331
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:55,660
to think you need to look at one field

1332
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:57,790
that has like a code point that tells

1333
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:59,980
you the order of all the fields you

1334
01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:01,750
don't need each field to tell you where

1335
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,190
it is because they could conflict then

1336
01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:04,450
one could say I want to be at the front

1337
01:10:03,190 --> 01:10:10,030
the other one says no I want to be at

1338
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:12,610
the front no one will be identify which

1339
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:14,950
one it is and what I'm saying is you can

1340
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:19,900
use the initial value to identify which

1341
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:21,880
field you're looking at yeah just just

1342
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,309
in the first field maybe you don't have

1343
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:25,570
to look at any other fields otherwise

1344
01:10:24,310 --> 01:10:27,640
you have to look at all the fields and

1345
01:10:25,570 --> 01:10:29,650
you know and just in the first field you

1346
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:32,800
can have more start starting values in

1347
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:34,870
future in the first field to say what

1348
01:10:32,800 --> 01:10:39,010
the order of the other fields are yeah

1349
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:41,800
yes okay yes I think Jonathan here the I

1350
01:10:39,010 --> 01:10:44,680
think the point here servers six

1351
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:48,040
permutations of these three fields

1352
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:51,400
possible and so we can have six

1353
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:53,480
different init values no to identify

1354
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:55,460
each one there's

1355
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:57,440
more because that the idea of this sorry

1356
01:10:55,460 --> 01:11:00,410
I didn't give the introductory idea

1357
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:01,969
which is that even already you don't

1358
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:03,739
have to have all the fields you can have

1359
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:04,880
two of them if this one's never changed

1360
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:07,179
or you can have one of them with both of

1361
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,330
the last two have never changed and so

1362
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:13,850
and and what I'm wanting to be able to

1363
01:11:11,330 --> 01:11:15,260
do is with the initial values of that

1364
01:11:13,850 --> 01:11:17,660
first field you could say there are four

1365
01:11:15,260 --> 01:11:19,010
fields you could have a you know or a

1366
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:21,080
fifth field or whatever you know you can

1367
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:23,450
you can it's a pretty big number space

1368
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:29,720
I'm sure you can handle that case in the

1369
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:33,769
future yeah Jahangir this is a salt

1370
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:35,480
problem how big I'm sorry I haven't read

1371
01:11:33,770 --> 01:11:38,720
the draft and so I'm gonna ask how big

1372
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:40,549
are each of these count of 24 bits okay

1373
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:42,680
so if you're willing to put aside a bit

1374
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,210
even from me what media was saying I'm

1375
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,680
just gonna be a little bit more specific

1376
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:47,470
and we shouldn't design this here at the

1377
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:50,270
mic that's a bad idea

1378
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:53,470
but if you're gonna it's it's a lot

1379
01:11:50,270 --> 01:11:55,850
easier if you if you identify each field

1380
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:58,580
on its own you don't have to care about

1381
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:03,890
the the ordering of the fields in here

1382
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:05,180
at all it's very easy to do the

1383
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,530
difference was this design is actually

1384
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:08,450
said you don't set the bit aside right

1385
01:12:06,530 --> 01:12:09,950
he'd like you just wrap around at some

1386
01:12:08,450 --> 01:12:14,570
point so it's a bit connect should be 0

1387
01:12:09,950 --> 01:12:16,519
even so you use this ordering that's

1388
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:17,809
right so I'm I think I think what I'm

1389
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:19,460
suggesting is having a little bit more

1390
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:22,730
structure in the in the in the field

1391
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:25,520
itself where you have three bits a to

1392
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:28,040
determine what in field it is and after

1393
01:12:25,520 --> 01:12:31,489
that you have a counter we the field we

1394
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:34,310
we thought about doing but it's if it's

1395
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:36,230
unnecessary in other words if you can do

1396
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:40,030
all the negotiation by just the initial

1397
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:40,030
value then these can just be counters

1398
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:50,090
because discussion Jana you have any

1399
01:12:48,590 --> 01:12:55,790
proposal in the send it to the mailing

1400
01:12:50,090 --> 01:12:57,320
list yeah actually we used to have a

1401
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,970
different design at the very beginning

1402
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,130
then we make more simple we changed now

1403
01:12:58,970 --> 01:13:02,750
we're changing it back and we ruble but

1404
01:13:01,130 --> 01:13:04,550
like I think the important question here

1405
01:13:02,750 --> 01:13:07,340
for the group is do people want to

1406
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:09,380
support only one kind of option

1407
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:11,300
for like this version or two people want

1408
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:14,210
to support also the different ordering

1409
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:15,830
for yeah for this draft right now

1410
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:16,280
because you can always add this later

1411
01:13:15,830 --> 01:13:24,410
actually

1412
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:26,269
okay Sonia brought this up about it like

1413
01:13:24,410 --> 01:13:29,210
if you want to use something like FRS or

1414
01:13:26,270 --> 01:13:31,580
whatever that actually uses the etc1

1415
01:13:29,210 --> 01:13:34,960
field then this the second ordering

1416
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:34,960
would be much more beneficial for you

1417
01:13:35,230 --> 01:13:43,250
eat ect ect

1418
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:46,370
yeah and as I see no elf rest but yeah

1419
01:13:43,250 --> 01:13:49,250
so the question I see is do we want to

1420
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:53,660
allow reporting different combinations

1421
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:56,450
in other words is the so can you make a

1422
01:13:53,660 --> 01:13:58,040
simple pricey of the question we just

1423
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:00,110
ask the group whether this is a use of

1424
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:01,970
place to dig without without how we

1425
01:14:00,110 --> 01:14:05,380
encode it but just is it useful to

1426
01:14:01,970 --> 01:14:08,450
actually look at that yes Camille I

1427
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:10,010
don't mind whether they a teachers do

1428
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:11,720
this or whether the church do it but I'm

1429
01:14:10,010 --> 01:14:13,940
asking the working if we can ask the

1430
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:17,410
working group whether this is a useful

1431
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:21,980
place to dig okay

1432
01:14:17,410 --> 01:14:26,440
consider yourselves asked okay right so

1433
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:29,389
what do we think okay question needs um

1434
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:31,839
so do we want to think about in this

1435
01:14:29,390 --> 01:14:41,750
kind of you know define two formats

1436
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:44,720
basically do so so that the point of

1437
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:46,850
this is to have a smaller option but is

1438
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:49,340
it likely in the life of a connection

1439
01:14:46,850 --> 01:14:53,000
that you will always have truncated

1440
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:56,240
options or in in the only two schemes

1441
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:59,990
that exist you would right but you'd

1442
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:02,510
only either use H t0 always or or use s

1443
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:04,340
t1 always and at the moment no one's

1444
01:15:02,510 --> 01:15:07,240
proposing to use both or what no that's

1445
01:15:04,340 --> 01:15:11,990
not sure se e se e wants to use both so

1446
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:15,410
in some cases you'd have to changing and

1447
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:17,900
and the way the draft works is that it

1448
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:20,210
says you can truncate it if the counter

1449
01:15:17,900 --> 01:15:21,950
hasn't changed that you must beacon

1450
01:15:20,210 --> 01:15:25,070
think three times of per round-trip time

1451
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:29,150
all of them just so it's clear that

1452
01:15:25,070 --> 01:15:33,380
someone has missed an AK okay thanks um

1453
01:15:29,150 --> 01:15:35,809
I think it's you know the the the option

1454
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:37,580
space is for some abuse cases pretty

1455
01:15:35,810 --> 01:15:39,800
well constrained so I think that would

1456
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:41,239
be well valuable and there's probably an

1457
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:42,410
encoding I mean again we won't do it at

1458
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:44,599
the mic but I'll probably do something

1459
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:47,269
to list on how maybe we could generalize

1460
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:50,090
this in an efficient way but yeah I

1461
01:15:47,270 --> 01:15:52,340
think this is I think if we can get away

1462
01:15:50,090 --> 01:15:54,710
with this usually being a eight byte

1463
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:58,460
option instead of a eleven byte option

1464
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:59,960
that would be good salary thanks rod

1465
01:15:58,460 --> 01:16:02,870
drums I'm just in support let's have

1466
01:15:59,960 --> 01:16:06,080
some discussion about yeah doing this or

1467
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:08,989
not right now we are running out of time

1468
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:11,059
and then this will be interesting so I

1469
01:16:08,989 --> 01:16:12,950
don't want that so please you know you

1470
01:16:11,060 --> 01:16:15,140
can summarize this discussion didn't

1471
01:16:12,950 --> 01:16:17,030
send it to the mailing list and then we

1472
01:16:15,140 --> 01:16:19,850
can discuss content you can continuously

1473
01:16:17,030 --> 01:16:22,250
discuss yeah okay so I just wanted to

1474
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:24,110
heads up on go and have a look at the

1475
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:29,390
draft because there's some reasonably

1476
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:31,009
extensive changes because due to comment

1477
01:16:29,390 --> 01:16:33,250
from Michael which actually made us

1478
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:38,510
realize there was a lot bigger problem

1479
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:40,430
when when we made the option we've just

1480
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:42,469
been talking about optional in other

1481
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:46,850
words so that you you could just work

1482
01:16:42,469 --> 01:16:49,190
with the three bit counter without the

1483
01:16:46,850 --> 01:16:51,290
option we've got all this stuff about if

1484
01:16:49,190 --> 01:16:54,019
a counter has changed you must send the

1485
01:16:51,290 --> 01:16:55,100
option but of course if you weren't

1486
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:58,370
sending the option you couldn't must

1487
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:59,690
send it and so we we had to put in some

1488
01:16:58,370 --> 01:17:02,030
additional stuff there but then we

1489
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:04,429
realized we hadn't actually got that any

1490
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:06,019
text for when you must send an ACK at

1491
01:17:04,430 --> 01:17:08,989
all even if you weren't sending the

1492
01:17:06,020 --> 01:17:12,350
option so we had to it was there's quite

1493
01:17:08,989 --> 01:17:15,290
a bit of text in there now about when

1494
01:17:12,350 --> 01:17:16,730
you send an ACK depending on what's

1495
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,790
changed even if you're not sending

1496
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:22,580
options as well as when you are alright

1497
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:28,040
so please go and read that because

1498
01:17:22,580 --> 01:17:30,880
that's all new stuff yeah thank you

1499
01:17:28,040 --> 01:17:30,880
okay

1500
01:18:02,400 --> 01:18:07,799
okay now I would like to talk about the

1501
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:11,190
procedural discussion for partition and

1502
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:14,909
Asian prosperous and then what I would

1503
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:16,710
like to discuss its how to proceed these

1504
01:18:14,909 --> 01:18:18,960
drafts so it's not a technical

1505
01:18:16,710 --> 01:18:20,310
discussion how it's like to focus on how

1506
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:25,980
to proceed

1507
01:18:20,310 --> 01:18:28,679
these two draft and then basically you

1508
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:30,509
know this why I don't want to need any

1509
01:18:28,679 --> 01:18:33,090
detailed discussion to think about how

1510
01:18:30,510 --> 01:18:35,870
to proceed is rough so please not avoid

1511
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:39,300
any technical discussion in this

1512
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:40,830
discussion and then first checkpoint we

1513
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:46,170
have a several technical discussion

1514
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:48,420
beforehand and so my initial check is do

1515
01:18:46,170 --> 01:18:49,860
this rough time remaining the technical

1516
01:18:48,420 --> 01:18:51,989
discussion point before working with

1517
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:54,330
Roscoe once he'll talk about some in the

1518
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:57,178
negotiation of feedback things and then

1519
01:18:54,330 --> 01:19:02,429
also both talks about some TCP option

1520
01:18:57,179 --> 01:19:05,760
format things but my I would like to

1521
01:19:02,429 --> 01:19:08,969
check if this is very big shows top of

1522
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:16,140
these this draft or to have any opinion

1523
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:17,640
on that actually would like to deep

1524
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,620
bundle the discussion of occurred easy

1525
01:19:17,640 --> 01:19:21,000
on and easy on plus plus here because we

1526
01:19:19,620 --> 01:19:22,980
cannot publish you see n plus pass

1527
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:25,290
without equity CN but we can publish or

1528
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:28,650
can move on equity C and before we have

1529
01:19:25,290 --> 01:19:31,710
for agreement on e CN plus plus so I

1530
01:19:28,650 --> 01:19:33,809
believe echo DC n is mostly ready I mean

1531
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:34,890
this this negotiation is not like an

1532
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:36,570
issue in the sense that it's like

1533
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,250
something was wrong it's something we

1534
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,509
actually had discussed before and now we

1535
01:19:38,250 --> 01:19:41,820
changed our mind so we should like

1536
01:19:39,510 --> 01:19:44,730
address it yes we still can but other

1537
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:47,120
than that it's ready and you want to

1538
01:19:44,730 --> 01:19:51,480
proceed both simultaneously

1539
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:53,610
okay okay okay

1540
01:19:51,480 --> 01:19:55,250
probably I have actually a question for

1541
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,839
Bob so there was some discussion about

1542
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:00,540
DC DC style feedback for incremental

1543
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:06,539
deployment so what was the outcome of

1544
01:20:00,540 --> 01:20:07,769
that and where are we yeah you're right

1545
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:13,349
I've forgotten to put that in those

1546
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:17,639
slides there we we were considering

1547
01:20:13,349 --> 01:20:21,589
writing a slight a slight addition in a

1548
01:20:17,639 --> 01:20:24,059
separate draft but that gave another

1549
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:26,549
negotiation you could do without curry

1550
01:20:24,059 --> 01:20:28,289
CN which it says you can do in the draft

1551
01:20:26,549 --> 01:20:33,119
it says you know this is this is a way

1552
01:20:28,289 --> 01:20:35,459
to extend it in future and both or a

1553
01:20:33,119 --> 01:20:37,558
number of companies have said we're

1554
01:20:35,459 --> 01:20:40,858
using DC TCP to style feedback

1555
01:20:37,559 --> 01:20:42,239
internally if we move to using accurate

1556
01:20:40,859 --> 01:20:46,589
ecn we're gonna have a transition

1557
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:51,449
problem and so can we use the accurate

1558
01:20:46,589 --> 01:20:53,399
easy n negotiation at the start but

1559
01:20:51,449 --> 01:20:55,348
still be using our old feedback scheme

1560
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:57,089
because we've got hardware that depends

1561
01:20:55,349 --> 01:20:59,939
on in all the rest of it but at least

1562
01:20:57,089 --> 01:21:05,459
then we can start using something

1563
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:08,369
different and and move to it as we get

1564
01:21:05,459 --> 01:21:12,479
in new hardware and things so that was

1565
01:21:08,369 --> 01:21:15,239
the problem and we've said yes we've got

1566
01:21:12,479 --> 01:21:17,309
the facility to do that you can you can

1567
01:21:15,239 --> 01:21:21,539
use different initial values of the ACE

1568
01:21:17,309 --> 01:21:23,999
counter in the three bit header to say

1569
01:21:21,539 --> 01:21:25,739
to tell the other end and negotiate with

1570
01:21:23,999 --> 01:21:27,869
the other end that I'm declaring I'm

1571
01:21:25,739 --> 01:21:31,438
using a different sort of feedback on

1572
01:21:27,869 --> 01:21:33,449
the on these bits and s you could do

1573
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:37,799
this instead of using the TCP option as

1574
01:21:33,449 --> 01:21:41,148
well so it's got that benefit but you

1575
01:21:37,799 --> 01:21:43,349
know that would require you the the one

1576
01:21:41,149 --> 01:21:45,929
this benefit of this is it

1577
01:21:43,349 --> 01:21:47,849
there's only eight numbers you know so

1578
01:21:45,929 --> 01:21:52,049
so it's a it's a small number space

1579
01:21:47,849 --> 01:21:53,489
already right and so what we were

1580
01:21:52,049 --> 01:21:59,489
thinking is of setting up an eye on a

1581
01:21:53,489 --> 01:22:06,449
registry on for those eight numbers the

1582
01:21:59,489 --> 01:22:09,568
draft uses yeah it uses for on the syn

1583
01:22:06,449 --> 01:22:12,829
ACK but but once once once you do the

1584
01:22:09,569 --> 01:22:15,179
first data packet you've got all eight

1585
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:16,438
and we're going to use one Bob I want to

1586
01:22:15,179 --> 01:22:18,059
cut it yeah all right now

1587
01:22:16,439 --> 01:22:20,150
you know I won't I don't know what the

1588
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:24,240
more focused technical discussion

1589
01:22:20,150 --> 01:22:25,589
right okay so I was asked that question

1590
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:30,809
of answer that question I've forgotten

1591
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:33,390
the original question to stop parking

1592
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:35,730
real practical no because that was that

1593
01:22:33,390 --> 01:22:39,690
would have been a separate draft anyway

1594
01:22:35,730 --> 01:22:45,209
oh yeah because you can add that sort of

1595
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:47,490
thing later okay so that answers my

1596
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:49,920
question but I do think that draft is

1597
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:53,190
important because it probably updates

1598
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:55,290
both DC TCP as well as accurate ezn so I

1599
01:22:53,190 --> 01:22:56,330
do think that we should get it out there

1600
01:22:55,290 --> 01:23:02,370
soon

1601
01:22:56,330 --> 01:23:05,309
sure yeah you could live in again yes I

1602
01:23:02,370 --> 01:23:07,200
really like to have this mechanism also

1603
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:09,780
in a separate graph because it shows how

1604
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:13,080
the negotiation scheme works and that's

1605
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:17,509
really what I want yeah Toby Pato

1606
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:22,350
procedural discussion okay so I think

1607
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:24,630
let's say you know we move forward to

1608
01:23:22,350 --> 01:23:27,420
accurate easy and draft and then both

1609
01:23:24,630 --> 01:23:30,090
you impress Prosser and then from Chad's

1610
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:33,180
point Oh bill we still have several

1611
01:23:30,090 --> 01:23:36,510
remaining points and then first one is

1612
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:39,240
bit severe occasion and then second one

1613
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:42,750
is I would like to check in dependency

1614
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:44,820
of the other related proposal basically

1615
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:48,600
right now we have a see my future might

1616
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:51,690
be we might have another proposal so but

1617
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:53,100
I what I would like to avoid it if we

1618
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,589
proceed accurately see an ancient

1619
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:59,940
process we cannot do any other issue

1620
01:23:55,590 --> 01:24:03,180
experiment that's I try to avoid such

1621
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:05,280
kind of things so before we proceed our

1622
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:08,460
creation among Asian prospers I would

1623
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:11,340
like to confirm there is no conflict or

1624
01:24:08,460 --> 01:24:14,220
a dependency for other proposals so that

1625
01:24:11,340 --> 01:24:16,740
we can safely proceed accretion and the

1626
01:24:14,220 --> 01:24:19,170
Gaussian process that's what I directed

1627
01:24:16,740 --> 01:24:21,660
the third point I would like to come

1628
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:26,820
from before we move up to the Viking

1629
01:24:21,660 --> 01:24:32,340
Rusco coming right

1630
01:24:26,820 --> 01:24:38,460
SCE proposes to reuse bit 7

1631
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:45,449
as a way of reflecting the ECG one code

1632
01:24:38,460 --> 01:24:47,460
point again non some did more or less

1633
01:24:45,449 --> 01:24:52,440
the same things although the details are

1634
01:24:47,460 --> 01:24:57,090
different the I think the crucial point

1635
01:24:52,440 --> 01:25:01,309
here is that this use of bit 7 would be

1636
01:24:57,090 --> 01:25:07,980
used when a key CN is not negotiated and

1637
01:25:01,310 --> 01:25:13,500
the ECE and CW are bits remain in the

1638
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:19,888
RFC through on 6/8 meaning yeah I think

1639
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:23,580
so that's to me or just obvious okay and

1640
01:25:19,889 --> 01:25:27,210
then also um if you have any other

1641
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:29,010
thoughts no this is a to major point you

1642
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:30,599
know we need to think about if you have

1643
01:25:29,010 --> 01:25:35,190
other point we need to think about

1644
01:25:30,599 --> 01:25:37,080
please stick up if no we just focus on

1645
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:39,119
to these two point to think about

1646
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:44,130
procedure accurate easy and easy and

1647
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:48,750
prosperous okay so first I would like to

1648
01:25:44,130 --> 01:25:50,520
discuss about PC bar location so now you

1649
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:54,719
know that we have a several choice um

1650
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:57,599
one choice is promote a creation to

1651
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,449
propose standard and allocate b7 for

1652
01:25:57,599 --> 01:26:04,290
tradition this is one option and then

1653
01:26:00,449 --> 01:26:07,409
second option is the media proposed

1654
01:26:04,290 --> 01:26:12,659
abouts registry frog thing and then

1655
01:26:07,409 --> 01:26:15,509
utilize this method and then apply B 7

1656
01:26:12,659 --> 01:26:18,089
fortunately CN but there are several you

1657
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:20,099
know possibility and so Michael Schaff

1658
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:24,659
mentioned that's no we only apply this

1659
01:26:20,099 --> 01:26:28,290
policy on bp7 or the other way is now we

1660
01:26:24,659 --> 01:26:32,400
can apply this policy all remaining

1661
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:35,790
reside bit and then the other way is you

1662
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:39,330
know I don't know this one exactly what

1663
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:42,840
does it means but in RFC 2070 80s you're

1664
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:44,949
a way to temporary assignment of the TCP

1665
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:46,989
header bit so we can

1666
01:26:44,949 --> 01:26:49,059
we might be able to you check that one

1667
01:26:46,989 --> 01:26:51,160
but I don't know if we have been seeing

1668
01:26:49,060 --> 01:26:54,790
any precedence in my as far as I know I

1669
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:56,679
don't know how it works and so but this

1670
01:26:54,790 --> 01:27:00,040
is documented so there could be a way

1671
01:26:56,679 --> 01:27:02,350
for this and then also if there is other

1672
01:27:00,040 --> 01:27:12,219
way to AutoCAD BC I would direct mode

1673
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:15,370
here so any comments I think I think the

1674
01:27:12,219 --> 01:27:16,780
SCE position would be to use the

1675
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:19,719
registry mm-hmm

1676
01:27:16,780 --> 01:27:20,349
subject to fine-tuning how the registry

1677
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:24,510
works

1678
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:30,010
so you mean you support medias proposal

1679
01:27:24,510 --> 01:27:32,620
yeah I brought Grimes the the applying

1680
01:27:30,010 --> 01:27:35,140
the policy to bit seven only in applying

1681
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:37,059
the policy to all subsequent bitches are

1682
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:39,250
super sets of each other so there's no

1683
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:41,590
reason that we cannot apply the at two

1684
01:27:39,250 --> 01:27:44,650
bit seven at this time and then later

1685
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,699
escalate that to apply to all of them so

1686
01:27:44,650 --> 01:27:47,259
that we could conduct a little

1687
01:27:45,699 --> 01:27:50,349
experiment here to find out how well

1688
01:27:47,260 --> 01:27:52,350
this works for one bit without changing

1689
01:27:50,350 --> 01:27:54,850
the status of the other three bits and

1690
01:27:52,350 --> 01:27:57,640
then later if the experiment went well

1691
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,650
we could we could expand the scope of it

1692
01:27:57,640 --> 01:28:07,050
to say that it covers all reserved TCP

1693
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:07,049
header bits okay yeah

1694
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:17,239
I can I can really yes we can't you yeah

1695
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:19,039
I'd like to add based on what I heard

1696
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:21,799
here in the room if there might be

1697
01:28:19,039 --> 01:28:25,340
another option because we have repeated

1698
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:27,860
in the term negotiation and one thing

1699
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:30,559
you could think about is to move

1700
01:28:27,860 --> 01:28:33,650
accurate easy end proposed standard for

1701
01:28:30,559 --> 01:28:35,570
the negotiation part of because that

1702
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:39,619
seems to be useful even to other schemes

1703
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:42,139
and then discuss separately what happens

1704
01:28:39,619 --> 01:28:46,400
after negotiation which could either be

1705
01:28:42,139 --> 01:28:48,380
proposed send out or experimental and as

1706
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:51,018
I heard that other word guys are not

1707
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:53,150
thinking about using the negotiation for

1708
01:28:51,019 --> 01:28:54,860
OPEC or compatibility and things like

1709
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:57,289
this I mean it seems to me that this

1710
01:28:54,860 --> 01:29:00,530
negotiation is can be crucial and it's a

1711
01:28:57,289 --> 01:29:03,170
relatively trivial thing to do it so I

1712
01:29:00,530 --> 01:29:05,389
think the powerful proposed standard for

1713
01:29:03,170 --> 01:29:08,750
the negotiation would be relatively low

1714
01:29:05,389 --> 01:29:11,239
so that to me at least putting the

1715
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:13,550
negotiation to proposed standard would

1716
01:29:11,239 --> 01:29:16,159
be an option that could possibly also be

1717
01:29:13,550 --> 01:29:17,989
beautiful but it's just a thought I've

1718
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:19,429
been thinking about this before so far I

1719
01:29:17,989 --> 01:29:21,348
wasn't really convinced it's a good

1720
01:29:19,429 --> 01:29:23,630
option but base but not but I get and

1721
01:29:21,349 --> 01:29:25,699
now in the room is I think it's it's

1722
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:27,860
something to discuss at least as another

1723
01:29:25,699 --> 01:29:30,250
venue and the good thing would be in

1724
01:29:27,860 --> 01:29:32,598
that case if it would be assigned by the

1725
01:29:30,250 --> 01:29:37,760
normal way it would be just propose

1726
01:29:32,599 --> 01:29:38,960
tender to allocate the bitch replying to

1727
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,059
that one directly I'm actually not sure

1728
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,949
how that would work because if you

1729
01:29:41,059 --> 01:29:45,199
negotiate something you need the default

1730
01:29:42,949 --> 01:29:46,969
behavior you need it do these define one

1731
01:29:45,199 --> 01:29:52,219
behavior right otherwise you negotiate

1732
01:29:46,969 --> 01:29:58,010
like wait basically I don't know I'm not

1733
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:59,269
sure well yeah I mean the other registry

1734
01:29:58,010 --> 01:30:02,059
that you mention is a couple of the

1735
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:03,559
other things so that is all part of the

1736
01:30:02,059 --> 01:30:05,690
negotiation and then when you do

1737
01:30:03,559 --> 01:30:07,880
afterwards is I mean there can be

1738
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:10,400
different specs for what happens after

1739
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:13,130
what SSU discussed I mean it's all deck

1740
01:30:10,400 --> 01:30:15,949
mode for if you think you think could be

1741
01:30:13,130 --> 01:30:19,699
another experimental whatever spec for

1742
01:30:15,949 --> 01:30:20,750
just so I don't know how exactly the

1743
01:30:19,699 --> 01:30:23,389
document would look like

1744
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:25,640
I just want to note its option and it

1745
01:30:23,390 --> 01:30:28,040
would have to benefit that the bid is

1746
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:29,960
allocated by a proposed standard that's

1747
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:31,850
relatively simple because it focuses

1748
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,370
only on on the on the three-way

1749
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:36,620
handshake so the problem is you

1750
01:30:34,370 --> 01:30:38,420
negotiate something and then you have an

1751
01:30:36,620 --> 01:30:41,150
extension that negotiate something else

1752
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:42,980
so if the extension is not understood

1753
01:30:41,150 --> 01:30:45,200
you have to fall back to the thing that

1754
01:30:42,980 --> 01:30:46,580
you negotiate it first right and if the

1755
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:49,760
first thing unique a shade doesn't

1756
01:30:46,580 --> 01:30:51,290
actually imply any mechanism then you

1757
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:54,440
have to have a default mechanism with

1758
01:30:51,290 --> 01:30:57,340
the negotiation otherwise this is

1759
01:30:54,440 --> 01:31:01,240
supposed to work yeah but I think even

1760
01:30:57,340 --> 01:31:05,480
even in the negotiation you can mandate

1761
01:31:01,240 --> 01:31:07,490
other guidelines on what to do

1762
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,620
afterwards because it would be proposed

1763
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:13,940
to end up possibly so you can mandate

1764
01:31:09,620 --> 01:31:15,620
what has to happen after that so you can

1765
01:31:13,940 --> 01:31:17,150
act requirements when the schemes after

1766
01:31:15,620 --> 01:31:19,490
I I mean I don't know how it exactly

1767
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:22,429
works and I don't want to engineer it

1768
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:24,410
right now I just mention that to me

1769
01:31:22,430 --> 01:31:27,590
after there's another option and it

1770
01:31:24,410 --> 01:31:30,760
means putting these parts of occurred is

1771
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:32,990
the proposed standard I would other

1772
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:35,450
finally other to conclude I would also

1773
01:31:32,990 --> 01:31:38,210
think I mean if you get implementations

1774
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:40,070
I mean even putting accurate easy and as

1775
01:31:38,210 --> 01:31:48,050
a whole to propose standard to me could

1776
01:31:40,070 --> 01:31:50,420
be an option this is Bob Brisco they the

1777
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:54,950
idea of splitting the negotiation from

1778
01:31:50,420 --> 01:31:58,340
the scheme it negotiates assume you use

1779
01:31:54,950 --> 01:32:00,769
the word after a lot in that but you've

1780
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:03,800
got the possibility of reordering you've

1781
01:32:00,770 --> 01:32:06,020
got TFO to deal with potentially which

1782
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:09,110
start sending data a bit well during the

1783
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:11,390
handshake so these things are intimately

1784
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:13,610
tied together you're you know and you've

1785
01:32:11,390 --> 01:32:15,740
got the possibility of losing the third

1786
01:32:13,610 --> 01:32:16,940
ACK in the handshake and you've got to

1787
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:19,490
deal with all those things and if you

1788
01:32:16,940 --> 01:32:22,400
try and split that into two completely

1789
01:32:19,490 --> 01:32:24,349
separate mechanisms it's nearly

1790
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:26,900
impossible you know you really need to

1791
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:30,950
do all that in one mechanism and have

1792
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:33,110
like me a set of default and then anyone

1793
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,829
who wants to start with something

1794
01:32:33,110 --> 01:32:37,308
different

1795
01:32:33,829 --> 01:32:41,570
can build on that rather than try and

1796
01:32:37,309 --> 01:32:43,280
have a clean that in an ideal world yes

1797
01:32:41,570 --> 01:32:44,808
you'd have a clean separation but we're

1798
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:51,768
way beyond that because we got so few

1799
01:32:44,809 --> 01:32:53,300
bits you know it's but if that's true

1800
01:32:51,769 --> 01:32:54,590
what you said I mean you're just telling

1801
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,269
me right now that what has been

1802
01:32:54,590 --> 01:32:58,489
discussed earlier is not possible that

1803
01:32:56,269 --> 01:33:05,389
is to use the negotiation for something

1804
01:32:58,489 --> 01:33:07,489
else and I don't understand that so you

1805
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:09,709
need negotiation to extend the scheme

1806
01:33:07,489 --> 01:33:14,388
but you need always a base scheme

1807
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:16,579
because that's what you find then let's

1808
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:20,329
have a scheme is a Keynesian and do that

1809
01:33:16,579 --> 01:33:25,639
as PS I mean that would be an easy

1810
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:31,188
solution point of individual continue to

1811
01:33:25,639 --> 01:33:33,530
contributor to be here just because

1812
01:33:31,189 --> 01:33:34,999
actually I think even if we do equities

1813
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:38,719
en it proposed on that we should change

1814
01:33:34,999 --> 01:33:42,228
the registration registry but this is

1815
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:45,079
then independent from each other I mean

1816
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:47,360
to be clear I disagree that need to

1817
01:33:45,079 --> 01:33:49,249
change the registration registry if you

1818
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,018
find another way for a Keynesian if you

1819
01:33:49,249 --> 01:33:52,728
don't find a way per acre BC a not

1820
01:33:51,019 --> 01:33:55,189
proposed standard then of course we have

1821
01:33:52,729 --> 01:33:57,050
to do something but I would strongly

1822
01:33:55,189 --> 01:33:59,510
suggest the working group to think about

1823
01:33:57,050 --> 01:34:01,880
the the first way because this would

1824
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:12,979
actually not require any changes in the

1825
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:14,749
registry right now okay so I start

1826
01:34:12,979 --> 01:34:20,689
thinking this is kind of you know

1827
01:34:14,749 --> 01:34:22,639
preference no argument and then or you

1828
01:34:20,689 --> 01:34:25,489
know if we discuss a little bit more can

1829
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:29,780
we convert some opinion or just this is

1830
01:34:25,489 --> 01:34:35,110
no people saying this is basically the

1831
01:34:29,780 --> 01:34:35,110
question which method people prefer and

1832
01:34:40,030 --> 01:34:45,530
so what I heard from an earlier

1833
01:34:42,290 --> 01:34:47,150
discussion was that I think people would

1834
01:34:45,530 --> 01:34:49,969
like to change the restoration policy no

1835
01:34:47,150 --> 01:34:53,089
matter what so I will work on the draft

1836
01:34:49,969 --> 01:34:54,530
and propose it again okay but maybe we

1837
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:56,179
can independent of that we can maybe

1838
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,590
take a ham if people think they would

1839
01:34:56,179 --> 01:34:59,719
like to go for proposed under or

1840
01:34:57,590 --> 01:35:01,130
experimental for equities in like I

1841
01:34:59,719 --> 01:35:06,770
personally I actually really don't care

1842
01:35:01,130 --> 01:35:11,900
I just wanted to move it ahead okay okay

1843
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:14,810
I can get the data point so if people

1844
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:16,820
think accurate easy and should be

1845
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:35,330
published as you know proposed standard

1846
01:35:16,820 --> 01:35:37,849
please raise your hand if you think a

1847
01:35:35,330 --> 01:35:41,679
cure edition is published other

1848
01:35:37,850 --> 01:35:54,500
experiment RFC please raise your hand

1849
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:59,690
with media why you something actually

1850
01:35:54,500 --> 01:36:02,570
and then but you know if we accept we

1851
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:04,250
try to publish okay edition as proposed

1852
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:07,219
standard do you have to restructure the

1853
01:36:04,250 --> 01:36:09,110
drug because right now the draft is very

1854
01:36:07,219 --> 01:36:12,080
well written as a experimental

1855
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:13,820
draft in my understanding because it's

1856
01:36:12,080 --> 01:36:15,440
discover how to do X remain what's the

1857
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,349
goal of the explain something like that

1858
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:27,320
right you need you have to modify that

1859
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:30,739
draft a drastic re I think I comment on

1860
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:33,049
Java from Chris lemons again a point of

1861
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:35,269
order is the sort of thing that the hum

1862
01:36:33,050 --> 01:36:39,679
would work better for instead of a

1863
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:41,449
counted vote it's okay I would say we we

1864
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:42,739
don't really have ref condensates like a

1865
01:36:41,449 --> 01:36:44,449
little bit half half with a slight

1866
01:36:42,739 --> 01:36:46,009
tendency for experimental if the draft

1867
01:36:44,449 --> 01:36:47,780
is written as experimental all the text

1868
01:36:46,010 --> 01:36:50,850
is in for extra minutes let's just go

1869
01:36:47,780 --> 01:36:54,840
for experimental okay but

1870
01:36:50,850 --> 01:36:58,230
Cory and I think the decision on this is

1871
01:36:54,840 --> 01:37:00,120
actually the chairs with their ad and so

1872
01:36:58,230 --> 01:37:02,580
I don't mind how you get the consensus

1873
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:04,050
opinion but you could ask who raised the

1874
01:37:02,580 --> 01:37:05,400
hand twice because they really just

1875
01:37:04,050 --> 01:37:08,400
think we should publish something so you

1876
01:37:05,400 --> 01:37:11,700
even discover the momentum if you wish

1877
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:13,920
to I'll leave it to you okay but I see

1878
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:16,019
still I think still we need to discover

1879
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:18,540
what in the media he had please update

1880
01:37:16,020 --> 01:37:21,030
your draft and then submit some proposal

1881
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:23,340
a little bit more about your flag

1882
01:37:21,030 --> 01:37:26,519
registration you need sorry judge me I

1883
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:30,090
mean just to just more to a point than

1884
01:37:26,520 --> 01:37:31,950
to of what Cory just said I mean this

1885
01:37:30,090 --> 01:37:35,040
this doesn't seem to be the case as

1886
01:37:31,950 --> 01:37:36,900
clerk like - hard people thinking that

1887
01:37:35,040 --> 01:37:39,900
should be one thing or should be the ER

1888
01:37:36,900 --> 01:37:41,429
thing since that a lot of people think

1889
01:37:39,900 --> 01:37:43,530
it should be published that it doesn't

1890
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:44,940
matter how okay right so I think that's

1891
01:37:43,530 --> 01:37:46,889
the situation I mean that I think the

1892
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:48,870
decision is pretty much irrelevant here

1893
01:37:46,890 --> 01:37:51,240
I mean you need to I mean the the

1894
01:37:48,870 --> 01:37:53,490
feedback of the room for me is this

1895
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:57,480
should go ahead it doesn't matter

1896
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:59,940
experimental or PS just go ahead so

1897
01:37:57,480 --> 01:38:01,950
maybe an hour way forward suggested way

1898
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:05,759
forward would be to ask the room if

1899
01:38:01,950 --> 01:38:07,349
people care strongly if it's published

1900
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:09,450
one way or the other

1901
01:38:07,350 --> 01:38:17,790
alternatively you can say can you live

1902
01:38:09,450 --> 01:38:19,110
with either one of these so if we want

1903
01:38:17,790 --> 01:38:20,880
to go for experimental we want to

1904
01:38:19,110 --> 01:38:23,309
allocate the bit we have to publish the

1905
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:26,760
registration change at the same time so

1906
01:38:23,310 --> 01:38:28,710
if people think we should um publish its

1907
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:30,330
experimental then like this is also an

1908
01:38:28,710 --> 01:38:32,040
agreement of this group to move quickly

1909
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:35,430
ahead with the registration policy

1910
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:39,060
change which I think it's a good thing

1911
01:38:35,430 --> 01:38:43,920
yeah right so at least I would like to

1912
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:48,450
see how many sub people suppose in the

1913
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:51,300
media registry draft and then so if you

1914
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:55,610
support medias flag registry draft

1915
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:55,610
please raise your hand okay

1916
01:39:02,429 --> 01:39:09,929
okay and how many people with doesn't

1917
01:39:06,929 --> 01:39:13,830
support me as Flag register graph please

1918
01:39:09,929 --> 01:39:42,600
raise your hand okay seems to be strong

1919
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:57,239
I got it way of doing yeah we can do

1920
01:39:42,600 --> 01:39:59,010
that okay so next things I would like to

1921
01:39:57,239 --> 01:40:03,269
check independent of the other related

1922
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:05,550
proposal you know we have some exchange

1923
01:40:03,270 --> 01:40:08,850
email with media and then but I would

1924
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:10,770
like to confirm accretion and this year

1925
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:13,770
will not conflict each other because of

1926
01:40:10,770 --> 01:40:16,140
negotiation scheme I'm sorry okay I

1927
01:40:13,770 --> 01:40:18,360
would like if I couldn't just go back to

1928
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:21,090
the previous discussion briefly so okay

1929
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:24,000
in terms of the shortest path the

1930
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:26,640
publishing accurate ecn I heard two

1931
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:29,670
different road blocks if we make it a

1932
01:40:26,640 --> 01:40:31,860
proposed standard then we have to do

1933
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:34,679
some editorial rewrite of the draft if

1934
01:40:31,860 --> 01:40:36,780
we choose to make it experimental we

1935
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:39,420
must get Mira's Draft all the way

1936
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:42,269
through to go to last call

1937
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:47,429
simultaneously that's and I heard a

1938
01:40:42,270 --> 01:40:50,280
little bit of its quibbling about the

1939
01:40:47,429 --> 01:40:53,010
details of Mirrors draft so I think we

1940
01:40:50,280 --> 01:40:56,190
should probably I have no idea what how

1941
01:40:53,010 --> 01:40:57,540
big the rewrite is and how big the Delta

1942
01:40:56,190 --> 01:40:58,860
is on what people want to see out of

1943
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:02,010
Mira's draft but I think we should spend

1944
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:04,080
maybe a little time seeing what the

1945
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:07,199
shortest path is since nobody seems to

1946
01:41:04,080 --> 01:41:10,559
care on the substance of whether which

1947
01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:12,870
classification is but it seems nice

1948
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:15,320
additional sense preference from my

1949
01:41:12,870 --> 01:41:15,320
point of view

1950
01:41:16,219 --> 01:41:21,139
Jen I don't cambium the amount of effort

1951
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:23,449
is roughly equal and I suspect that it

1952
01:41:21,139 --> 01:41:24,649
can go to PS if you simply delete those

1953
01:41:23,449 --> 01:41:26,898
sections that talk about it being

1954
01:41:24,649 --> 01:41:29,090
experimental and Maria's draft is

1955
01:41:26,899 --> 01:41:31,459
basically a paragraph long and that can

1956
01:41:29,090 --> 01:41:39,979
also get done quite rapidly and go there

1957
01:41:31,459 --> 01:41:41,570
as well so that is assuming that

1958
01:41:39,979 --> 01:41:44,059
everyone in this room and the only

1959
01:41:41,570 --> 01:41:48,590
people that might object but of course

1960
01:41:44,059 --> 01:41:50,449
there's a mailing list and so so you

1961
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:54,489
know people may not want to do Mia's

1962
01:41:50,449 --> 01:41:57,438
draft and then we're in you know it's

1963
01:41:54,489 --> 01:41:58,789
right crimes would there any reason that

1964
01:41:57,439 --> 01:42:07,610
we couldn't proceed forward with both

1965
01:41:58,789 --> 01:42:09,619
and then making this decision later gory

1966
01:42:07,610 --> 01:42:11,898
first I still assert it's the chairs

1967
01:42:09,619 --> 01:42:13,518
decision but what to do yeah but I'd

1968
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:20,989
like to provide information point me

1969
01:42:13,519 --> 01:42:23,659
this and the echo Sen Draft is only

1970
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:26,178
changing one thing people are trying to

1971
01:42:23,659 --> 01:42:28,518
implement this is probably good for PS a

1972
01:42:26,179 --> 01:42:33,050
if you feel it's mature enough is good

1973
01:42:28,519 --> 01:42:35,149
for PS the registry thing yeah sure but

1974
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:37,039
if we do this this probably becomes

1975
01:42:35,149 --> 01:42:39,320
sticky or immediately becomes equivalent

1976
01:42:37,039 --> 01:42:43,429
to P us because we the sticky allocation

1977
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:44,539
happens so I think the registry thing is

1978
01:42:43,429 --> 01:42:45,679
something we should definitely progress

1979
01:42:44,539 --> 01:42:48,469
as quickly as we can

1980
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:50,119
but I wouldn't get the other one on that

1981
01:42:48,469 --> 01:43:00,439
because it's a wider consensus car

1982
01:42:50,119 --> 01:43:01,759
that's my input I am so I was saying

1983
01:43:00,439 --> 01:43:03,559
that there could be a good argument the

1984
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:05,619
proposed standard because people are

1985
01:43:03,559 --> 01:43:07,699
starting to implement against this

1986
01:43:05,619 --> 01:43:09,289
therefore it will be seen in the

1987
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:12,678
Internet and therefore it will be

1988
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:16,039
effectively a sticky bit in the update

1989
01:43:12,679 --> 01:43:17,659
draft the other draft and therefore it

1990
01:43:16,039 --> 01:43:19,879
doesn't really matter what what path we

1991
01:43:17,659 --> 01:43:22,728
take through this if if your your draft

1992
01:43:19,879 --> 01:43:25,519
your draft matures quickly that can go

1993
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:28,460
quickly and if there is not consensus on

1994
01:43:25,519 --> 01:43:30,980
that discussion then this

1995
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:32,660
shouldn't block it right so so let's

1996
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:42,169
place PS is what I'm motivating yeah I

1997
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:45,410
get them like my anger I just like to

1998
01:43:42,170 --> 01:43:47,960
note I mean the key advantage of going

1999
01:43:45,410 --> 01:43:51,040
why RPS is that we have no dependency on

2000
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:53,600
IETF consensus and changed into registry

2001
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:56,390
so of course even if this working group

2002
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:57,980
decides to publish the registers change

2003
01:43:56,390 --> 01:44:01,700
fast it's don't need to get IETF

2004
01:43:57,980 --> 01:44:03,830
consensus and that's a question of its

2005
01:44:01,700 --> 01:44:06,290
own the benefit of doing PSS you can

2006
01:44:03,830 --> 01:44:08,390
trust you have used utilized IGF

2007
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:11,180
procedures and you're done at least in

2008
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:13,790
the working group so that to me it would

2009
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:17,180
be there could be a chance that the PS

2010
01:44:13,790 --> 01:44:19,430
is actually faster outside the TCP I'm

2011
01:44:17,180 --> 01:44:22,180
working who but it's up to it the

2012
01:44:19,430 --> 01:44:24,770
working group to decide what they want

2013
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:26,980
Jen Iyengar I actually was going to say

2014
01:44:24,770 --> 01:44:29,960
exactly that I was going to say that

2015
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:33,110
that is actually what that is one part

2016
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:35,270
that is faster and that's PS so

2017
01:44:33,110 --> 01:44:38,030
experimental because it brings in this

2018
01:44:35,270 --> 01:44:40,130
dependency can be the same speed or can

2019
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:41,780
be slower it's not gonna be faster so

2020
01:44:40,130 --> 01:44:44,480
this is definitely going to be faster

2021
01:44:41,780 --> 01:44:46,639
and with that it might be worth sort of

2022
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:49,549
getting a sense of the room again of

2023
01:44:46,640 --> 01:44:53,030
whether we want to do my question its

2024
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:55,660
new EPS then we can allocate several

2025
01:44:53,030 --> 01:44:58,099
activities yen and what about other

2026
01:44:55,660 --> 01:45:03,530
ischemia explain it do we want to

2027
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:05,630
terminate as experiment we disallow to

2028
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:17,349
do an other issue in experience that's

2029
01:45:05,630 --> 01:45:20,270
our conclusion well this is the thing

2030
01:45:17,350 --> 01:45:23,270
there may be other uses for page seven

2031
01:45:20,270 --> 01:45:25,969
wish do not conflict with a QC end

2032
01:45:23,270 --> 01:45:31,010
because they only come into effect when

2033
01:45:25,969 --> 01:45:32,630
a QC and negotiation fails that means we

2034
01:45:31,010 --> 01:45:35,180
should change the name of the bit I

2035
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:36,890
think at least accurate you if you are

2036
01:45:35,180 --> 01:45:37,820
using a condition beat is something

2037
01:45:36,890 --> 01:45:40,700
strange to me

2038
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:41,940
Yoshi Jana younger I don't think that's

2039
01:45:40,700 --> 01:45:44,340
I don't think that

2040
01:45:41,940 --> 01:45:45,629
is relevant to whether this is pious or

2041
01:45:44,340 --> 01:45:47,970
experimental that's a deployment

2042
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:49,950
question right so but this is our

2043
01:45:47,970 --> 01:45:51,180
experimental doesn't change the fact

2044
01:45:49,950 --> 01:45:52,530
that the bit on the wire is gonna

2045
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:57,420
conflict if you use it in two different

2046
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:59,040
ways so I think going to be s make sense

2047
01:45:57,420 --> 01:46:00,300
independent of that question I wouldn't

2048
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:12,690
I wouldn't bring those two questions

2049
01:46:00,300 --> 01:46:14,490
together okay in this Mia could have

2050
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:16,290
been actually in this good spirit of

2051
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:19,080
like moving on quickly I have two

2052
01:46:16,290 --> 01:46:21,960
requests one can we do a hum for again

2053
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:24,150
for experimental or propose sender and -

2054
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:27,060
can we do a hum for adopting the

2055
01:46:24,150 --> 01:46:29,070
registration quality change the purpose

2056
01:46:27,060 --> 01:46:30,720
of the phone because we already have the

2057
01:46:29,070 --> 01:46:40,440
humbuckers we had a discussion now and I

2058
01:46:30,720 --> 01:46:42,840
think people change their mind okay just

2059
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:46,440
to try and make the hums clear if we do

2060
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:54,060
the hums can we do a hum where you don't

2061
01:46:46,440 --> 01:46:55,769
care so we don't vote twice are you

2062
01:46:54,060 --> 01:47:06,660
saying we've had people out to vote

2063
01:46:55,770 --> 01:47:08,550
twice or once separately I think is a

2064
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:13,730
useful point you can reevaluate how you

2065
01:47:08,550 --> 01:47:13,730
like would like to proceed but darker

2066
01:47:17,990 --> 01:47:26,429
okay

2067
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:27,880
one more time it's okay okay let's see

2068
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:32,300
if you want to

2069
01:47:27,880 --> 01:47:34,219
um okay addition as a proposed standard

2070
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:38,179
please raise your hand if you don't care

2071
01:47:34,219 --> 01:47:43,429
and I know check rate if you don't key I

2072
01:47:38,179 --> 01:47:46,369
don't raise your hand if you don't I

2073
01:47:43,429 --> 01:47:48,829
would come to number don't care as well

2074
01:47:46,369 --> 01:47:51,519
so that if you really think this is fine

2075
01:47:48,829 --> 01:48:08,239
please raise your hand

2076
01:47:51,520 --> 01:48:11,510
yeah it should be PS if you think ok

2077
01:48:08,239 --> 01:48:17,869
decent should be experimental please

2078
01:48:11,510 --> 01:48:20,059
raise your hand if you think we don't

2079
01:48:17,869 --> 01:48:36,348
keep I don't care bye I want to publish

2080
01:48:20,059 --> 01:48:38,630
it please raise your hand okay we are

2081
01:48:36,349 --> 01:48:41,210
running out of time I think this is very

2082
01:48:38,630 --> 01:48:44,000
controversial stuff so I I think let's

2083
01:48:41,210 --> 01:48:50,750
let's keep chairs are done some time to

2084
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:52,280
think about it okay right guys are we

2085
01:48:50,750 --> 01:48:53,989
talking about anything in the bottom

2086
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:58,699
half of this slide at some point right

2087
01:48:53,989 --> 01:49:00,650
now I'm trying to do sorry Donna I would

2088
01:48:58,699 --> 01:49:03,409
like to cut a question if possible make

2089
01:49:00,650 --> 01:49:05,509
it short okay I honestly I don't think

2090
01:49:03,409 --> 01:49:06,769
it's it's controversial I think that

2091
01:49:05,510 --> 01:49:09,260
people here who don't care

2092
01:49:06,770 --> 01:49:11,420
still want to see it published which to

2093
01:49:09,260 --> 01:49:14,659
me counts as a vote towards going with

2094
01:49:11,420 --> 01:49:16,429
the shortest path so if if the people

2095
01:49:14,659 --> 01:49:18,348
there are more people going for PS and

2096
01:49:16,429 --> 01:49:19,909
there are a lot of people who say yes or

2097
01:49:18,349 --> 01:49:22,630
experimental don't care I would count

2098
01:49:19,909 --> 01:49:29,480
them towards towards either neither or

2099
01:49:22,630 --> 01:49:31,880
or or or to us yes okay let's discuss

2100
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:33,888
among each yes and then we we will try

2101
01:49:31,880 --> 01:49:37,579
to think about what's the best next step

2102
01:49:33,889 --> 01:49:40,260
probably I will ask several step so a

2103
01:49:37,579 --> 01:49:42,659
possibility and then

2104
01:49:40,260 --> 01:49:46,349
right the people choose the bus that's

2105
01:49:42,659 --> 01:49:47,420
what I'm thinking right now okay make it

2106
01:49:46,349 --> 01:49:50,250
quick

2107
01:49:47,420 --> 01:49:53,130
didn't people just make kind of choose

2108
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:54,510
the parts I mean like you have to

2109
01:49:53,130 --> 01:49:56,309
confirm on the mailing this yes but I

2110
01:49:54,510 --> 01:49:59,820
think it was pretty clear what was set

2111
01:49:56,309 --> 01:50:01,590
in the room yeah so like the of cloth

2112
01:49:59,820 --> 01:50:03,299
the chest should sit together and and

2113
01:50:01,590 --> 01:50:04,769
make sure that they all agree that

2114
01:50:03,300 --> 01:50:07,440
there's contenders in the room but like

2115
01:50:04,769 --> 01:50:09,500
my sense of the room is there is

2116
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:13,530
consensus room

2117
01:50:09,500 --> 01:50:16,800
but what's how it's not very clear to me

2118
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:23,579
how do it do we how do we all get to be

2119
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:27,179
7 that's not very clear to me that's

2120
01:50:23,579 --> 01:50:29,190
what we'd like to confirm on the mailing

2121
01:50:27,179 --> 01:50:30,599
list as well we have to confirm on the

2122
01:50:29,190 --> 01:50:31,860
main yes but if we go for proposed

2123
01:50:30,599 --> 01:50:35,190
standards and it's very clear how we

2124
01:50:31,860 --> 01:50:37,860
allocate the bit right in the draft or

2125
01:50:35,190 --> 01:50:40,848
in the our seat but at the same time we

2126
01:50:37,860 --> 01:50:44,219
see strong support for that opting there

2127
01:50:40,849 --> 01:50:51,559
supporting your draft so that's a

2128
01:50:44,219 --> 01:50:57,239
meaning of it there are two more bits

2129
01:50:51,559 --> 01:51:03,000
yeah there to move it's like a we could

2130
01:50:57,239 --> 01:51:05,579
pick please yeah no I think that the

2131
01:51:03,000 --> 01:51:07,739
first of all consensus in TCP must

2132
01:51:05,579 --> 01:51:10,018
always figured out on the mailing list

2133
01:51:07,739 --> 01:51:12,150
because we have for example people that

2134
01:51:10,019 --> 01:51:14,099
don't attend the meetings so anyway we

2135
01:51:12,150 --> 01:51:16,589
need to confirm this on the on the

2136
01:51:14,099 --> 01:51:18,659
mailing list at least this much share

2137
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:21,840
head on I also see here quite some

2138
01:51:18,659 --> 01:51:24,750
momentum on the proposed standard way to

2139
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:27,030
do it so that's probably what I would

2140
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:29,730
take out of this discussion and then

2141
01:51:27,030 --> 01:51:32,880
this means that we can separate out the

2142
01:51:29,730 --> 01:51:34,589
discussion for what registry trapped as

2143
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:37,619
we have to discuss the separately in my

2144
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:40,739
opinion and given that this was a very

2145
01:51:37,619 --> 01:51:42,539
late submission I also think we have

2146
01:51:40,739 --> 01:51:43,169
time to figure this out for example the

2147
01:51:42,539 --> 01:51:46,980
next meter

2148
01:51:43,170 --> 01:51:49,019
I would like to disagree a little bit

2149
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:50,518
here because it's not just decided yet

2150
01:51:49,019 --> 01:51:52,469
if your proposed standard or

2151
01:51:50,519 --> 01:51:53,620
experimental right so those an option if

2152
01:51:52,469 --> 01:51:55,420
you go for experiment

2153
01:51:53,620 --> 01:51:57,730
we should move very quickly ahead with

2154
01:51:55,420 --> 01:51:59,200
the registration change and given that

2155
01:51:57,730 --> 01:52:00,879
there's like logic women in the room

2156
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:03,040
already and we want to move quickly

2157
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:04,630
anyway it would be nice to at least kind

2158
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:07,150
of make a ham about it up in the room

2159
01:52:04,630 --> 01:52:10,690
now which anyway has under made because

2160
01:52:07,150 --> 01:52:13,059
we are Jared this share had on the disk

2161
01:52:10,690 --> 01:52:15,849
draft was submitted after the deadline

2162
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:19,450
and the presentation slides were

2163
01:52:15,850 --> 01:52:21,910
submitted very late so I usual tea CPM

2164
01:52:19,450 --> 01:52:25,630
means we don't do an adoption called in

2165
01:52:21,910 --> 01:52:27,430
that situation and Mia this would not be

2166
01:52:25,630 --> 01:52:30,250
a good idea and as I said for what I

2167
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:31,660
think I hear right now is we don't even

2168
01:52:30,250 --> 01:52:33,430
need it we can have the adoption

2169
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:35,830
discussion in my opinion on the mailing

2170
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:37,840
list later right when people had time to

2171
01:52:35,830 --> 01:52:41,680
think about the different variants this

2172
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:43,420
is Jared on yeah I'm accepting the chat

2173
01:52:41,680 --> 01:52:44,860
decision but this is also not a usual

2174
01:52:43,420 --> 01:52:46,390
situation because usually when you

2175
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,830
propose something that's not this

2176
01:52:46,390 --> 01:52:49,690
dependency right there's a dependency

2177
01:52:47,830 --> 01:52:51,850
here in this period of moving quickly

2178
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:53,290
and I submitted it very late but only

2179
01:52:51,850 --> 01:52:54,700
because I was discussing this was a

2180
01:52:53,290 --> 01:52:56,410
chance in the background and like

2181
01:52:54,700 --> 01:52:58,840
confirming that this is what you want to

2182
01:52:56,410 --> 01:53:01,260
do but like it's a chess decision

2183
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:03,310
definitely yeah

2184
01:53:01,260 --> 01:53:05,020
just a data point I've just checked

2185
01:53:03,310 --> 01:53:06,130
through the draw for what the changes

2186
01:53:05,020 --> 01:53:08,950
will have to be to make it not

2187
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:12,310
experimental for the I crazy CN draft I

2188
01:53:08,950 --> 01:53:13,630
mean and the only things are where it

2189
01:53:12,310 --> 01:53:15,430
talks about other experiments you just

2190
01:53:13,630 --> 01:53:16,600
have to say experiments you know because

2191
01:53:15,430 --> 01:53:19,690
it's not an experiment

2192
01:53:16,600 --> 01:53:21,190
yeah okay okay move on to the next stop

2193
01:53:19,690 --> 01:53:23,349
you know so I'll try to check in

2194
01:53:21,190 --> 01:53:27,070
dependency from as a proposal as I

2195
01:53:23,350 --> 01:53:31,720
mentioned so if people think you know

2196
01:53:27,070 --> 01:53:32,559
there's no conflict with a Cartesian SC

2197
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:36,490
s EE

2198
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:39,010
and if we use some cone if we have some

2199
01:53:36,490 --> 01:53:42,400
concerns please say your opinion if you

2200
01:53:39,010 --> 01:53:44,440
say rod crime sure are is ongoing

2201
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:47,679
discussion too in that area and I don't

2202
01:53:44,440 --> 01:53:49,870
believe we are at a conclusion okay one

2203
01:53:47,680 --> 01:53:52,900
exactly what the compatibility situation

2204
01:53:49,870 --> 01:53:56,140
is between a QC and SCE again between l4

2205
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:57,610
s and s EE independence and we would

2206
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:59,770
like more time to continue that

2207
01:53:57,610 --> 01:54:03,690
discussion before we talk very much

2208
01:53:59,770 --> 01:54:03,690
about it here okay got it

2209
01:54:04,449 --> 01:54:10,449
Corie fur has very quickly I think the

2210
01:54:07,270 --> 01:54:12,730
the first thing on the marking of ECC t1

2211
01:54:10,449 --> 01:54:14,169
and reporting of it we had a we had a

2212
01:54:12,730 --> 01:54:15,580
discussion here we thought that was

2213
01:54:14,170 --> 01:54:17,739
something that accurate ACN should

2214
01:54:15,580 --> 01:54:20,010
consider I think looking in the room

2215
01:54:17,739 --> 01:54:22,419
here we should consider whether

2216
01:54:20,010 --> 01:54:25,120
reporting ECT one behavior is also

2217
01:54:22,420 --> 01:54:25,719
possible inaccurate ACN on the second

2218
01:54:25,120 --> 01:54:28,929
one

2219
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:29,920
ts vwg did not make a call on that

2220
01:54:28,929 --> 01:54:32,560
situation

2221
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:35,230
it doesn't plan intend to look at

2222
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:37,030
potential conflicts currently there is

2223
01:54:35,230 --> 01:54:39,339
nothing to report we cannot report

2224
01:54:37,030 --> 01:54:46,269
anything on the second bullet from TS

2225
01:54:39,340 --> 01:54:47,949
vwg okay may you live in again so I'm

2226
01:54:46,270 --> 01:54:49,449
actually can I'm pretty sure that we

2227
01:54:47,949 --> 01:54:52,030
can't confirm right now that there's no

2228
01:54:49,449 --> 01:54:53,410
conflict because either you don't use it

2229
01:54:52,030 --> 01:54:57,309
in the handshake the propose we have

2230
01:54:53,410 --> 01:54:59,050
right now doesn't conflict right or you

2231
01:54:57,310 --> 01:55:00,880
use equities and - can you give shade

2232
01:54:59,050 --> 01:55:04,870
whatever you want as a feedback scheme

2233
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:06,100
or if you really want like a header bit

2234
01:55:04,870 --> 01:55:08,280
then you have to use one of the other

2235
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:11,890
two bits because we have two more bits

2236
01:55:08,280 --> 01:55:13,179
but like I see this it as independent

2237
01:55:11,890 --> 01:55:15,520
because that's what we want to use the

2238
01:55:13,179 --> 01:55:21,429
bit for now and that's what we have to

2239
01:55:15,520 --> 01:55:23,949
decide on rod Grimes if the if we change

2240
01:55:21,429 --> 01:55:27,070
equities hand to a proposed standard if

2241
01:55:23,949 --> 01:55:30,040
that negotiation fails that the

2242
01:55:27,070 --> 01:55:32,739
handshake fails as long as the bit

2243
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:37,360
that's allocated to accurate ECM then

2244
01:55:32,739 --> 01:55:39,099
becomes available for another use then

2245
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:40,750
we don't have a conflict there's a

2246
01:55:39,100 --> 01:55:43,600
qualifying thing though that bit has to

2247
01:55:40,750 --> 01:55:45,219
become available after the the handshake

2248
01:55:43,600 --> 01:55:47,140
has failed so it gives a deep it gives a

2249
01:55:45,219 --> 01:55:49,840
default state to the use of the bit and

2250
01:55:47,140 --> 01:55:51,940
that's that needs to be addressed so

2251
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,340
that's this is also true for the ECE pin

2252
01:55:51,940 --> 01:55:55,839
and the cwr bit like if you don't

2253
01:55:54,340 --> 01:56:04,570
negotiate it they are not used that's

2254
01:55:55,840 --> 01:56:06,900
just the way it is okay but probably you

2255
01:56:04,570 --> 01:56:13,210
have to clarify in the draft

2256
01:56:06,900 --> 01:56:15,699
you have to clarify in the draft no

2257
01:56:13,210 --> 01:56:17,980
because it's the same for ECE and see WR

2258
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:19,870
and it's not clarified in that draft

2259
01:56:17,980 --> 01:56:20,980
because all we say in the draft is you

2260
01:56:19,870 --> 01:56:22,690
know if you said the bit in the

2261
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:24,879
handshake then afterwards it has this

2262
01:56:22,690 --> 01:56:27,070
meaning it doesn't say what happens to

2263
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:29,770
the bits if the negotiation fails and

2264
01:56:27,070 --> 01:56:42,940
that's I think that's a right thing to

2265
01:56:29,770 --> 01:56:45,250
do okay good I might take we still need

2266
01:56:42,940 --> 01:56:48,700
to discuss a little bit more sorry okay

2267
01:56:45,250 --> 01:56:51,760
we are running off the time and I'm very

2268
01:56:48,700 --> 01:56:55,330
sorry that we have four individual

2269
01:56:51,760 --> 01:56:57,850
presentation yeah so let's move on

2270
01:56:55,330 --> 01:57:08,080
supposition but I'm very sorry but just

2271
01:56:57,850 --> 01:57:09,940
please make really quick Praveen going

2272
01:57:08,080 --> 01:57:11,620
to talk about high strut plus plus this

2273
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:14,830
is mostly a recap of the target at the

2274
01:57:11,620 --> 01:57:18,130
last IETF so for details you can refer

2275
01:57:14,830 --> 01:57:19,540
to that talk the only new information I

2276
01:57:18,130 --> 01:57:25,450
have here is some experimental results

2277
01:57:19,540 --> 01:57:31,300
from the lab measurements it's the one

2278
01:57:25,450 --> 01:57:33,730
about scroll down so the gist of this is

2279
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,860
that we use delay increase method of the

2280
01:57:33,730 --> 01:57:37,839
high stud people to exit slow start and

2281
01:57:35,860 --> 01:57:39,700
then we enter limited slow start now the

2282
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:42,430
reason we do that is because high start

2283
01:57:39,700 --> 01:57:51,010
my exit slow start prematurely and that

2284
01:57:42,430 --> 01:57:54,220
may cause performance problems so some

2285
01:57:51,010 --> 01:57:55,840
results here so for large our TT flows

2286
01:57:54,220 --> 01:57:59,320
we actually see a pretty significant

2287
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:03,280
improvement with a simulation of LAN so

2288
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:05,889
up to 39 percent on average for an NP 90

2289
01:58:03,280 --> 01:58:08,980
as well for short flows and 14 percent

2290
01:58:05,890 --> 01:58:10,840
for long flows we don't see too much

2291
01:58:08,980 --> 01:58:12,669
difference for short flows small RTD

2292
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:15,700
flows anything less than 100

2293
01:58:12,670 --> 01:58:17,110
milliseconds and but we see something

2294
01:58:15,700 --> 01:58:19,750
that is very consistent across all this

2295
01:58:17,110 --> 01:58:21,849
tests is that even if goodput doesn't

2296
01:58:19,750 --> 01:58:24,070
improve the number of retransmissions

2297
01:58:21,850 --> 01:58:25,300
decrease a lot which means we're putting

2298
01:58:24,070 --> 01:58:28,269
less load on the network

2299
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:29,770
we're not cpu limited here so the number

2300
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:31,610
of bytes on the network is reduced and

2301
01:58:29,770 --> 01:58:32,929
our tears are reduce

2302
01:58:31,610 --> 01:58:34,280
as well and there is some improvement to

2303
01:58:32,929 --> 01:58:37,730
loss recovery because fewer packets are

2304
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:39,199
lost we are awaiting results from a B

2305
01:58:37,730 --> 01:58:41,269
test I couldn't get that completed in

2306
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:42,949
time for this TCP meeting

2307
01:58:41,270 --> 01:58:44,810
but preliminary numbers shows again

2308
01:58:42,949 --> 01:58:46,280
reducing reduction retransmissions we

2309
01:58:44,810 --> 01:58:47,840
are going to get you numbers on the

2310
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:52,040
mailing list from two different online

2311
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:55,909
services shortly so currently this is D

2312
01:58:52,040 --> 01:58:57,739
point on by default in both windows 10

2313
01:58:55,909 --> 01:58:59,269
as well as the server side we have a

2314
01:58:57,739 --> 01:59:01,040
draft posted so if you haven't read it

2315
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:04,730
please review it and provide feedback

2316
01:59:01,040 --> 01:59:09,080
it's a really short draft and my request

2317
01:59:04,730 --> 01:59:11,839
to the group is word of the doctor so

2318
01:59:09,080 --> 01:59:19,790
how many people rate this draft please

2319
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:22,850
raise your hand okay how many people

2320
01:59:19,790 --> 01:59:28,519
think this can be adopted as information

2321
01:59:22,850 --> 01:59:29,900
our RFC I have a quick question like

2322
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,820
because I read your slides right into

2323
01:59:29,900 --> 01:59:34,940
said VB our setup face and shapers

2324
01:59:31,820 --> 01:59:37,309
patient sharing this is something you

2325
01:59:34,940 --> 01:59:39,199
want to still add to the draft no so

2326
01:59:37,310 --> 01:59:40,850
this strap strands on the Tron it's just

2327
01:59:39,199 --> 01:59:42,440
future experiments we'd like to block if

2328
01:59:40,850 --> 01:59:47,300
we get results on that that would be a

2329
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:51,379
separate presentation maybe nice ecog hi

2330
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:53,869
aya these results the generally believe

2331
01:59:51,380 --> 01:59:56,480
they will apply to quick as well they

2332
01:59:53,869 --> 01:59:59,449
should so I think they will apply pretty

2333
01:59:56,480 --> 02:00:00,830
much to any slow start any transport

2334
01:59:59,449 --> 02:00:02,960
that's doing slow start so that's a

2335
02:00:00,830 --> 02:00:06,199
question for maybe the chairs and the

2336
02:00:02,960 --> 02:00:10,670
CDs is this sort of document belong here

2337
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:13,280
or an ICC Arjun because intended status

2338
02:00:10,670 --> 02:00:16,310
information this is no describe what

2339
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:18,830
Microsoft - then I think informational

2340
02:00:16,310 --> 02:00:21,320
should be fine as TCP I'm working group

2341
02:00:18,830 --> 02:00:23,869
item from my point of view no it should

2342
02:00:21,320 --> 02:00:25,190
be fine but my question is if if so let

2343
02:00:23,869 --> 02:00:26,630
me put it differently I are you

2344
02:00:25,190 --> 02:00:28,400
considering expanding the scope of the

2345
02:00:26,630 --> 02:00:30,040
document to include quick as well or are

2346
02:00:28,400 --> 02:00:32,059
you planning to limit it to TCP

2347
02:00:30,040 --> 02:00:34,429
currently not currently is describing

2348
02:00:32,060 --> 02:00:36,380
what's done in TCP but it does apply to

2349
02:00:34,429 --> 02:00:38,449
quick so that might be a separate draft

2350
02:00:36,380 --> 02:00:41,199
or it might be an extension to the quick

2351
02:00:38,449 --> 02:00:43,769
RFC to suggest that high start may be a

2352
02:00:41,199 --> 02:00:47,700
way to do slow start

2353
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:50,190
both are to Buddha's are options sure

2354
02:00:47,700 --> 02:00:53,400
it's your preference it's a call I think

2355
02:00:50,190 --> 02:00:56,849
it's totally fine to adopt this draft

2356
02:00:53,400 --> 02:00:58,740
has information on DC PM if you want to

2357
02:00:56,850 --> 02:01:00,570
modify and then do something then you

2358
02:00:58,740 --> 02:01:02,460
can go as she charged if you want

2359
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:03,840
I think for now we would like to just

2360
02:01:02,460 --> 02:01:09,810
document this for TCP because it's

2361
02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:15,930
currently already deployed our next

2362
02:01:09,810 --> 02:01:18,690
steps what data point is not good maybe

2363
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:20,340
we can discontinue this you can if you

2364
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:23,250
have something you can update the draft

2365
02:01:20,340 --> 02:01:25,440
well you can continue you can stimulate

2366
02:01:23,250 --> 02:01:27,060
discuss on the image X all right to get

2367
02:01:25,440 --> 02:01:28,710
multiple yeah my request would beautiful

2368
02:01:27,060 --> 02:01:30,450
people to read this and get feedback

2369
02:01:28,710 --> 02:01:35,250
because I think this is quite important

2370
02:01:30,450 --> 02:01:37,740
for us to publish yeah I I will commit

2371
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:40,310
to reviewing this thank you and also I

2372
02:01:37,740 --> 02:01:45,300
just wanted to point out I did a little

2373
02:01:40,310 --> 02:01:46,980
survey of the main implementations and

2374
02:01:45,300 --> 02:01:49,520
how they were being used and with high

2375
02:01:46,980 --> 02:01:52,110
start before high start plus plus and

2376
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:54,810
everyone was turning it off so if you're

2377
02:01:52,110 --> 02:01:57,480
willing to turn it on then it says

2378
02:01:54,810 --> 02:01:59,280
something so Linux I believe has it on I

2379
02:01:57,480 --> 02:02:00,719
think they are also deploying that delay

2380
02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,840
increase algorithm but I believe they

2381
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:05,730
don't have the limited slow start Linux

2382
02:02:03,840 --> 02:02:07,320
has it own body for but I mean the

2383
02:02:05,730 --> 02:02:08,040
people who actually operationally use it

2384
02:02:07,320 --> 02:02:11,190
turn it off

2385
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:17,880
I start no hi Star Plus plans I don't

2386
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:21,210
know I don't think so that's not true so

2387
02:02:17,880 --> 02:02:23,010
they typically turn off the the what's

2388
02:02:21,210 --> 02:02:24,660
that inter packet arrival and yeah the

2389
02:02:23,010 --> 02:02:26,390
inter packet arrival bit not the whole

2390
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:28,320
algorithm this draft actually

2391
02:02:26,390 --> 02:02:31,550
specifically states you have to do the

2392
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:40,259
deal increase not the interpret right

2393
02:02:31,550 --> 02:02:44,090
thank you for being if we want we can

2394
02:02:40,260 --> 02:02:44,090
have a young presentation

2395
02:02:51,120 --> 02:03:06,610
octo if you can make it one minute

2396
02:02:54,430 --> 02:03:10,420
that's fine I'm very sorry for that okay

2397
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:12,370
hello everyone so let's jump quickly we

2398
02:03:10,420 --> 02:03:14,830
in this document we want to be able to

2399
02:03:12,370 --> 02:03:17,470
suppress delayed acts in some cases

2400
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:19,450
where it and the performs so basically

2401
02:03:17,470 --> 02:03:22,230
we want to do that through using one of

2402
02:03:19,450 --> 02:03:24,610
the reserved beads in the TCP header and

2403
02:03:22,230 --> 02:03:26,410
well this idea deeds in the last

2404
02:03:24,610 --> 02:03:28,570
revision of the document physically

2405
02:03:26,410 --> 02:03:32,860
taking into account feedback from the

2406
02:03:28,570 --> 02:03:34,780
room in Montreal and well in in the

2407
02:03:32,860 --> 02:03:36,960
annex of the document we have tried to

2408
02:03:34,780 --> 02:03:39,940
summarize some alternative approaches

2409
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:42,580
that might be useful to do what we want

2410
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:46,960
to do to some extent and well here are

2411
02:03:42,580 --> 02:03:49,840
some of them acts EC would weather the

2412
02:03:46,960 --> 02:03:52,360
sender tells the receiver di Grigio to

2413
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:54,640
be used and this entails however some

2414
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:57,280
overhead due to the options that are

2415
02:03:54,640 --> 02:03:59,140
supported there also Talos probe was

2416
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:01,509
suggested however this entails sending

2417
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:03,430
additional probe segments so perhaps it

2418
02:04:01,510 --> 02:04:05,440
that some overhead we might prefer to

2419
02:04:03,430 --> 02:04:07,780
avoid there also workarounds such as

2420
02:04:05,440 --> 02:04:11,230
sending an old bite however this is

2421
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:12,759
perhaps not so clean and also it may

2422
02:04:11,230 --> 02:04:14,589
enter sending a whole new packet if

2423
02:04:12,760 --> 02:04:16,690
there's no new data available for

2424
02:04:14,590 --> 02:04:19,810
transmission or something like the split

2425
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:21,669
hack supported in the contiki OS which

2426
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:24,730
is based on splitting a message into two

2427
02:04:21,670 --> 02:04:27,100
segments there was a lot of great

2428
02:04:24,730 --> 02:04:28,719
feedback by risk on the mailing list so

2429
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:30,730
thank you very much for that there are

2430
02:04:28,720 --> 02:04:34,180
additional motivating scenarios for why

2431
02:04:30,730 --> 02:04:36,099
one may want to suppress delayed acts so

2432
02:04:34,180 --> 02:04:38,200
one reason is getting up to speed fast

2433
02:04:36,100 --> 02:04:41,710
without in DC image queue during slow

2434
02:04:38,200 --> 02:04:44,230
start that had been actually supported

2435
02:04:41,710 --> 02:04:47,860
for a while in an old version of the

2436
02:04:44,230 --> 02:04:49,780
actually TC n draft and also there had

2437
02:04:47,860 --> 02:04:52,620
been discussions in the context of quick

2438
02:04:49,780 --> 02:04:55,630
for a more general support of

2439
02:04:52,620 --> 02:04:56,800
communicating the ik ratio and there are

2440
02:04:55,630 --> 02:05:00,850
other

2441
02:04:56,800 --> 02:05:03,520
well other use cases for getting treat

2442
02:05:00,850 --> 02:05:05,370
triggering quick acts so well there have

2443
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:07,450
been other comments such as

2444
02:05:05,370 --> 02:05:09,460
considerations on middle box traversal

2445
02:05:07,450 --> 02:05:12,700
of bits four to six perhaps not so good

2446
02:05:09,460 --> 02:05:15,390
and what also suggested using the urgent

2447
02:05:12,700 --> 02:05:17,889
pointer in an innovative way such as

2448
02:05:15,390 --> 02:05:20,760
reserving three bits of that to define

2449
02:05:17,890 --> 02:05:23,950
an accuracy exponent that might be used

2450
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:27,190
for several communication communicating

2451
02:05:23,950 --> 02:05:29,110
several akrasia such as the one which

2452
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:33,099
would suppress delayed acts but also

2453
02:05:29,110 --> 02:05:35,139
perhaps other a gracious and this would

2454
02:05:33,100 --> 02:05:37,090
be interesting because it adds no

2455
02:05:35,140 --> 02:05:38,620
overhead perhaps there's the problem of

2456
02:05:37,090 --> 02:05:43,210
what happens when the urgent flag is

2457
02:05:38,620 --> 02:05:46,330
actually set so well that's basically a

2458
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:50,080
quick presentation so I don't know if

2459
02:05:46,330 --> 02:05:52,210
there are comments questions the one

2460
02:05:50,080 --> 02:05:58,059
question I have is how does this differ

2461
02:05:52,210 --> 02:06:01,330
from the push flag well there was some

2462
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:04,360
discussion previous to Montreal and it

2463
02:06:01,330 --> 02:06:06,420
seemed like setting the push flag

2464
02:06:04,360 --> 02:06:08,950
doesn't mean you get an immediate ACK

2465
02:06:06,420 --> 02:06:12,190
there was some discussion on the mailing

2466
02:06:08,950 --> 02:06:14,679
list several these cases described and

2467
02:06:12,190 --> 02:06:17,589
it seemed that someone brought this

2468
02:06:14,680 --> 02:06:20,800
point but the response from the working

2469
02:06:17,590 --> 02:06:23,580
group was more than actually you cannot

2470
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:27,880
assume that push the push flag means

2471
02:06:23,580 --> 02:06:32,559
suppressing delay tax all right this

2472
02:06:27,880 --> 02:06:34,720
looks potentially useful I think I need

2473
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:44,050
to read it in more detail thank you so

2474
02:06:34,720 --> 02:06:46,210
much any more comments okay yeah sucks

2475
02:06:44,050 --> 02:06:48,420
for lots of discussion okay see you in

2476
02:06:46,210 --> 02:06:48,420
Vancouver

2477
02:06:52,510 --> 02:07:12,520
thank you howdy into a world where it's

2478
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:21,790
easier to publisher stator than

2479
02:07:12,520 --> 02:07:23,230
experiment or the we think about the

2480
02:07:21,790 --> 02:07:26,790
registry isn't like it just add stuff

2481
02:07:23,230 --> 02:07:26,790
your accuracy if it experiments
