1
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:09,139
my con can I be heard I was told it was

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:10,780
on remotely but I don't know if it's on

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:16,880
in the room

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:20,779
fantastic so all the little approach of

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,450
it okay so that means all the

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:26,180
conversation we had not knowing the mic

7
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:28,849
was on the open mic conversation we had

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,390
was not heard in the room I suppose I

9
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:35,500
should be relieved um good morning um I

10
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:40,280
guess we should start we've got the

11
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:42,950
agenda yes the agenda is up so first I'm

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,140
going to start by asking is there anyone

13
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:46,790
that is willing to be a jabber scribe

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,530
and if you were listening to the

15
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:50,989
conversation you know that I wasn't able

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,060
to get jabber running on the iPad I'm

17
00:00:50,989 --> 00:00:55,459
not sure why okay thank you

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:06,680
is there anyone that's willing to take

19
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:10,969
the notes and V on the page anyone I see

20
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,560
no one Mullin tiering there must be

21
00:01:10,969 --> 00:01:20,089
someone that's willing to take a few

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:22,310
notes thank you okay so we have a

23
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:24,429
note-taker and we have a jabber scribe

24
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:29,229
and I'm really quite grateful to you um

25
00:01:24,429 --> 00:01:31,939
so this is our periodic meeting of the

26
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:35,539
human rights protocol considerations

27
00:01:31,939 --> 00:01:37,969
research group and we have the welcome

28
00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:40,219
and introductions which I'm in the midst

29
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:42,439
of at the moment then there's a talk by

30
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:46,990
Jed Crandall of Arizona State University

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:50,089
is Jed here oh there you are thank you

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:52,939
and then there's a talk by John Matson

33
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:56,539
of Erickson is John here yes you are

34
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:58,939
thank you and then we'll do updates on

35
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:01,700
research group drafts one on the

36
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:04,309
Association draft and one on the

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,990
political draft and the political draft

38
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:09,229
has been sort of a topic of conversation

39
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:12,170
on the list lately so we'll try to

40
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,390
continue from there then there's an

41
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:17,359
update on the guidelines draft and short

42
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,529
presentations from reviewers and then

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,650
finally there

44
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:24,380
a discussion on consensus building and

45
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:26,860
research group drafts and this is for

46
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:30,290
those of you that went to the IRT F open

47
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:34,400
this is a topic that's relatively

48
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:37,280
consistent with that in terms of looking

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,980
at what we do though the question had

50
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,200
come up on the list earlier of why do

51
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:44,329
you act like an IETF group when you

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,480
don't have to so a little bit of

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,540
conversation on that and just to catch

54
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,899
sort of the the opinions of those of you

55
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,590
in the room or remotely on that sort of

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,280
behavior

57
00:02:54,590 --> 00:03:02,600
so um any issues any questions about the

58
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:06,170
agenda before moving on there's the note

59
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,230
well on intellectual property and even

60
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:11,420
though we don't need to follow IETF

61
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,119
rules in terms of being a research group

62
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:16,640
we do in terms of privacy and code of

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,090
conduct hopefully you've all had a

64
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,940
chance to read it one of the things

65
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,630
that's important is also the goals of

66
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,760
the IRT F and we focus on longer term

67
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,609
research issues related to the Internet

68
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,920
while the parallel organization the IETF

69
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:36,489
focuses on shorter term issues of

70
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,429
engineering and standards making of

71
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:43,970
course the terms longer and shorter are

72
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,400
probably relatively relative the IRT F

73
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:48,470
conducts research it is not a standards

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,900
development organization and certainly

75
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,660
this group has no intention of creating

76
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,380
any standards nor does anything we do

77
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,209
approach a standard while the IRT F can

78
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:01,940
publish information or experimental

79
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:03,769
documents in the RFC series its primary

80
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,200
goal is to promote development of

81
00:04:03,769 --> 00:04:08,420
research collaboration and teamwork and

82
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,160
exploring research issues related to

83
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:12,619
internet protocols applications

84
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,440
architecture and technology which I

85
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:19,820
believe is what we are attempting to do

86
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:22,190
there is a primer okay so we were

87
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:25,190
chartered to research how protocols

88
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:31,360
strengthen and/or threaten human rights

89
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:31,360
as defined in the und H our

90
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:40,340
UDHR and yes and the ICCPR so basically

91
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:44,509
that's what we look at I'll go on with

92
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:46,400
that the objectives to expose the

93
00:04:44,509 --> 00:04:48,080
relationship between protocols and human

94
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,539
rights with a focus on the rights to

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,530
freedom of expression and freedom of

96
00:04:50,539 --> 00:04:58,389
assembly but early in our process we

97
00:04:54,530 --> 00:05:01,309
started looking at other rights that may

98
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:04,280
affect those and and given the notion

99
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,830
that all rights are intertwined and it

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:11,270
is impossible to separate any one from

101
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:13,190
another we have not strictly been saying

102
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,039
no we cannot talk about that because

103
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,780
it's not Association no we cannot talk

104
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:20,360
about that because it's expression

105
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,609
basically if they're related that we

106
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,590
have although the documents we have been

107
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:27,500
working on have largely related to those

108
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,210
two then two proposed guidelines to

109
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,909
protect the Internet as a human rights

110
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,948
enabling environment in future protocol

111
00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,380
development in a manner similar to the

112
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:41,479
work done for privacy considerations in

113
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:45,740
RFC 69 73 and we have a first attempt at

114
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:47,599
that that was with RFC 82 80 and an

115
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,090
ongoing work from that in the

116
00:05:47,599 --> 00:05:50,509
considerations document that we'll talk

117
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:54,560
about

118
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:56,240
towards the end of this session and then

119
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,280
finally to increase the awareness in

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,440
both human rights community and

121
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,960
technical community on the importance of

122
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,719
the technical workings of the internet

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,698
and its impact on human rights one of

124
00:06:05,719 --> 00:06:09,770
the things we need to look at a little

125
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:13,639
bit more as we've been coming here to

126
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,530
the technical community a lot we have

127
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:17,570
and I know this this this explanation

128
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,150
going through this was probably not

129
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:24,500
planned but I figured it was worth doing

130
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:28,250
while reading it I I think we need to

131
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,680
look at how to do more in the in the

132
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,599
human rights community they're starting

133
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,780
to know about the effort it gets

134
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,940
discussed sometimes it gets referenced

135
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:41,539
but we haven't had many meetings or

136
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,919
sessions held in the their venues so

137
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:45,169
it's something that we've been talking

138
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:50,180
about trying to find a way

139
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:53,270
to increase doing okay the outputs we

140
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:56,870
have internet drafts policy and academic

141
00:06:53,270 --> 00:07:00,318
papers love to see more academic papers

142
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:04,669
and policy papers there is a film there

143
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:06,830
have been textual interviews data

144
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:08,719
analysis and visualization there's been

145
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:11,719
a certain amount of work done and then

146
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:15,139
protocol analysis though that's one of

147
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:18,050
the items in which we have reach caution

148
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:21,169
that protocol analysis is all well and

149
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:25,219
good of existing protocols but we've

150
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:28,359
been advised I think that's the right

151
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:32,060
word advise to be more careful about

152
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,930
doing protocol analysis of ongoing work

153
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,129
so that we don't find ourselves

154
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:42,439
interfering in any way with the

155
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:46,699
engineering work today October 2014 to

156
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:50,270
15 we were a proposal our own research

157
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:56,180
group proposed and 15 there was the film

158
00:07:50,270 --> 00:08:00,799
net of Rights at IETF 94 in 2015 we were

159
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:05,990
chartered in 2017 RFC 80 to 80 was

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:08,659
release current work active internet

161
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,639
drafts of the research group freedom of

162
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:15,110
association which we will be talking

163
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,810
about today it is undergoing some rework

164
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,629
and we'll have a conversation on that

165
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,149
rework how it's going and where it needs

166
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:25,939
to go there's guidelines for Human

167
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:29,089
Rights protocol considerations which is

168
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:32,060
ongoing work that stems out of 80 to 80

169
00:08:29,089 --> 00:08:35,479
and tries to capture the experiences and

170
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:38,409
learnings of people who have used those

171
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:41,539
guidelines to do protocol analysis and

172
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:45,139
notes on network standards and politics

173
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:47,959
that's a draft that is basically being

174
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:52,670
considered whether it's ready for last

175
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,500
call our research group last call I will

176
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:56,990
be talking about some of the issues that

177
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,970
have come up in discussions over the

178
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:01,520
last months on the list

179
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:05,120
related to that while we continue that

180
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:08,360
discussion what's next

181
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:15,320
that's it so now we go to our first

182
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:19,100
agenda item which is the the talk by Jed

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:21,380
and please come up there's a red X

184
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,940
there's a clicker for you to change

185
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:28,550
slides and the blue sheets are passing

186
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:54,290
around so please make sure you find a

187
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:58,550
chance to put your name on one is this

188
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:02,089
microphone working okay thank you for

189
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,819
the introduction and thank you for

190
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:07,610
having me here today so there's a famous

191
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:11,540
quote from John Gilmore in Time magazine

192
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:15,770
in 1993 the the internet views

193
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:19,760
censorship damage and routes around it

194
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:23,300
and so today I want to tell you about

195
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:25,310
some research that we've done you know

196
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,599
looking at the lower layers of the

197
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:30,530
protocol so I'm talking about physical

198
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:33,080
layer link layer and routing layer so we

199
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:34,430
know that in terms of Internet

200
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:39,530
censorship there's definitely been a

201
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:44,329
trend of growth you know over the last

202
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:47,030
10 15 or more years but our question is

203
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,370
can you see that like in the a s graph

204
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:51,230
of the Internet if you look down at the

205
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:54,710
lowest layers of the Internet and how

206
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:56,240
the routing works do you see the effects

207
00:10:54,710 --> 00:11:01,640
of censorship and internet balkanization

208
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,830
down in those layers so most of my

209
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,689
co-authors and I started at UNM when

210
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,430
this work started and most of us have

211
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,850
migrated to Arizona State University

212
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,769
sense and same with me so I'll join

213
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:15,790
asu's Biodesign Center for bio

214
00:11:12,769 --> 00:11:18,619
tsch and security in society in June and

215
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:22,009
the last time I took a biology class was

216
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:24,019
in high school seemed I wonder what

217
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:26,059
business start having asu's bio Design

218
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:32,449
Center one of the things that we like to

219
00:11:26,059 --> 00:11:34,368
look at is evolution and if you if you

220
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:36,589
look at just the way the Internet

221
00:11:34,369 --> 00:11:38,600
censorship has changed since 2007 when I

222
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:41,509
started looking at you know internet

223
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,860
measurement in this area and 2007 on the

224
00:11:41,509 --> 00:11:46,189
Great Firewall of China was basically a

225
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:48,439
hack it was like looking for packets

226
00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:49,429
HTTP packets and then doing a simple

227
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:53,118
keyword search

228
00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:57,829
not even a gret just you know looking

229
00:11:53,119 --> 00:11:59,029
for a particular substring and then you

230
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:00,529
know not even a regular expression or

231
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:03,769
anything and then it would just reset

232
00:12:00,529 --> 00:12:06,049
both ends of the connection and only

233
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:08,839
about 3/4 of the paths into China were

234
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,189
covered and now almost every path into

235
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,110
China is covered and it's a very

236
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,929
sophisticated system has active probing

237
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:20,480
it can detect VPNs if it suspects

238
00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:22,459
something is like at or hidden servers a

239
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,470
it'll connect to it and then see if

240
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:26,209
it'll speak the Tor protocol and they

241
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,519
have a very sophisticated system set up

242
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,410
and just the way that things have

243
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:31,939
evolved over time so that's a big part

244
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:33,920
of the center's how things evolve over

245
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:37,699
time and that's one of the things we're

246
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,009
going to look at today and evolution of

247
00:12:37,699 --> 00:12:43,099
what so we're gonna define a major

248
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:45,559
called choke point potential and it's

249
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:47,569
going to be and then it's will use choke

250
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:49,069
point to potential to define national

251
00:12:47,569 --> 00:12:52,519
choke point potential which is a measure

252
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:54,860
of a nation and it's how easily they can

253
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:58,519
choke off the internet with a few

254
00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,499
autonomous systems and so on the Left we

255
00:12:58,519 --> 00:13:03,679
have an example of a nation with high

256
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:07,240
choke point potential the yellow nodes

257
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:09,769
are AAS nodes that are on the border and

258
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,540
they have connections to asses outside

259
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:15,649
the country the red nodes are internal

260
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:17,719
nodes and so I'll talk about how we

261
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,179
define it but just intuitively if you

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,949
have high choke point potential it's

263
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:25,630
easy to choke off the internet with just

264
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:27,699
a small number of autonomous systems you

265
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:30,370
can cover most of your border with just

266
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,980
a small number whereas on the right if

267
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,510
you have a low choke point potential

268
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:38,830
then you connect out to the Internet in

269
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,240
a less restricted way where it's hard

270
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:42,700
without getting a bunch of autonomous

271
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,770
systems involved to control the traffic

272
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:46,690
coming across the borders and there's a

273
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:48,220
lot of different internet controls we're

274
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:53,620
going to focus on internet controls that

275
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,820
happen at national borders and just some

276
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,320
examples of the kind of internet

277
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:58,590
controls that we're looking for because

278
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,700
like I said it's a very broad issue

279
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,380
we're specifically interested in things

280
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,910
that happen at borders so an example

281
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,370
would be the internet shutdown in

282
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:08,709
Cameroon where somebody told me

283
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:11,050
literally the army just cut a line with

284
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:12,600
a machete and then later after they

285
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,189
fixed that and then they worked with the

286
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,290
the major ISP in the country and they

287
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,790
were able to keep the internet off for

288
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:23,650
240 days in a couple of different

289
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:25,150
regions Iran prefers to throttle the

290
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,620
internet if they found that when you

291
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:28,060
turn off the internet people tend to

292
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:33,250
take to the streets but if you throttle

293
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,599
the internet they'll stay home and then

294
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,550
China has a lot of different

295
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,980
sophisticated mechanisms that are all

296
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:40,510
sitting probably in three bigan and

297
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,900
exchange points in Beijing Guangzhou and

298
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:51,640
Shanghai including the Great Firewall of

299
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:53,680
China and then there's things they

300
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,510
arguably may or may not have in a

301
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,339
national border so NSA has quantum

302
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:59,620
insert which is a lot like the China's

303
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:01,900
great cannon so China's Great Firewall

304
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,450
is doing deep packet inspection and then

305
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,280
trying to reset connections the great

306
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:11,380
cannon can actually inject things like

307
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:12,490
malicious JavaScript and so NSA has

308
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:16,150
something called quantum insert that

309
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,970
does the same thing and then there's

310
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:21,220
been reports in Turkey of something

311
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:23,560
similar that was used to serve spyware

312
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:29,230
in Turkey and then adware - Egyptians

313
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:30,189
and indirectly spyware also to Syria so

314
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,110
these are the kinds of things we're

315
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,460
looking at is if you can do a

316
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,140
man-in-the-middle attack what kinds of

317
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,050
things you can do and if you're trying

318
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,460
to do that at a national border then you

319
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:41,680
need a choke point

320
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,690
so we're looking at commanding heights

321
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,979
of the internet you know where do you

322
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:47,530
want to be sitting if you want to do

323
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:49,090
these kinds of things and this could be

324
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,350
a company or a physical point of

325
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:53,860
presence so a company would be like an

326
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,900
autonomous system so you know you could

327
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:58,510
call them on the phone and you could say

328
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:59,890
you know assuming that you're a regime

329
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,710
that wants to do this kind of thing and

330
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:04,000
the national government you call the

331
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:06,010
autonomous system on the phone you say

332
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,720
like I want you to install these boxes I

333
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,870
want you to block this IP address for me

334
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,890
and then a chokepoint it's a company

335
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,870
would be something you know somebody you

336
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,460
can call on the phone or it could be a

337
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,870
physical point of presence so you could

338
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:18,340
say all of our internet has to come

339
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,900
through this data center right here and

340
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,010
then you can do all the censorship or

341
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:24,280
whatever controls you want in the data

342
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:26,170
center a couple of things I want to

343
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,819
mention one is the IP layer censorship

344
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,449
is often a prerequisite for higher layer

345
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:33,310
censorship so you might have heard about

346
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,340
like in various countries there's social

347
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:39,579
media filtering and even you know delete

348
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,300
posts after they've been posted Facebook

349
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,950
and Twitter

350
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:43,209
do you know censorship according to

351
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,710
local laws in pretty much every country

352
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:49,540
around the world and then there's you

353
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,870
know applications that do censorship

354
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:54,730
internally application but you need if

355
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,770
you're going to really enforce this kind

356
00:16:54,730 --> 00:17:00,270
of thing you need IP layer censorship to

357
00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:02,650
control what alternative people can use

358
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:03,880
so I bring up China as an example a lot

359
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,730
just because that's been the subject a

360
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,440
lot of my research and in China they

361
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,390
used the Great Firewall of China mostly

362
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:12,760
to stop people from using Twitter or

363
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,800
Facebook or to use VPNs and tor to get

364
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,720
out to Twitter and Facebook so that when

365
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,550
people use the domestic alternatives

366
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,959
like we chat and Weibo then they can

367
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,040
implement the censorship in the software

368
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:25,959
and on the server so that's just a

369
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,940
long-winded way of saying like it's the

370
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,350
censorship and the IP layer is important

371
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,640
even though it's a small piece of the

372
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:35,110
big picture and then also the geography

373
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,370
and virtualization come into play so

374
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,350
we're going to talk about choke points

375
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:42,120
you imagine an island nation that has

376
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,590
only one cable out to the Internet

377
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:47,379
that's a choke point whether that island

378
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,230
nation is a repressive regime or not so

379
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,010
geography is definitely consideration

380
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:53,050
and then you can also imagine

381
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,179
virtualization so

382
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,190
you could have three different

383
00:17:54,179 --> 00:18:00,100
autonomous systems on that island that

384
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,440
use that cable to make connections in

385
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,780
the AAS graph and you can even go the

386
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,390
other way even just between two routers

387
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:10,620
it could be multiple actual physical

388
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:12,850
lines that one connection is going over

389
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,350
so that's why we wanted to work at a

390
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:17,169
higher level of abstraction and that's

391
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,428
why we're going to consider only BGP so

392
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,080
we're going to look at choke points just

393
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:23,020
in the BGP graph and the autonomous

394
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,428
system graph of the Internet and we

395
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,990
could have considered trace routes we

396
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:27,700
could have combined trace routes of BGP

397
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,240
there's a whole research area about how

398
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:32,980
to build graphs of the Internet and we

399
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,809
could have considered physical maps like

400
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,330
actual data centers and cabled landing

401
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,649
stations but we found that BGP was a

402
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,409
good level of abstraction capture the

403
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:43,900
salient trends so if it's like a

404
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:45,100
physical choke point like an island that

405
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,490
will be reflected in the autonomous

406
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:50,230
system graph because BGP is basically an

407
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,800
announcement to get to them go through

408
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:55,179
me and and you know somewhere like China

409
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:57,070
or they have the three big in exchange

410
00:18:55,179 --> 00:19:01,480
points and then lots of ice peas are

411
00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:03,550
forced to participate in that and then

412
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,950
one of those is peas is in charge and

413
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:08,159
actually coalesce as all of the BGP

414
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:12,910
advertisements so you end up seeing that

415
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,470
choke point in the BGP level too so and

416
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,940
it's not going to be true of every form

417
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,260
of choke point where you might do

418
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,880
censorship that you'll see in the BGP

419
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,929
graph but it's gonna be true of most and

420
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,320
that's why we chose that level of

421
00:19:19,929 --> 00:19:24,910
affection the so the research questions

422
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:29,320
were interested in is how our internet

423
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:30,610
borders evolving over time and so we're

424
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:32,370
going to look at the eighth graph and

425
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,530
then how that's changing over time and

426
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,919
is there a relationship between Internet

427
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:42,460
freedom and topology so we want to know

428
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:44,559
is there a correlation if your regime is

429
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:48,640
you know known to do internet controls

430
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:50,230
are you also likely to have internet

431
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,320
that has a choke point in it at the

432
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,940
National border so let's talk about

433
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,909
internet topology so we took the qaeda

434
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:59,910
AAS relationship data set you know we

435
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:03,370
built our graph in a pretty standard way

436
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:06,700
yeah this is a publicly available it's

437
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:08,979
inferred as topology per month

438
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,019
and then we use the team Kim ruh who is

439
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:12,820
serviced to determine the nation to node

440
00:20:11,019 --> 00:20:16,960
mapping so every note on a s graph we

441
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,908
want to assign a nation to it and so

442
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,590
just from this simple graph you can

443
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:22,739
already answer a simple question which

444
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:27,249
is are there borders getting stronger so

445
00:20:22,739 --> 00:20:28,960
you can look at the ratio the the y-axis

446
00:20:27,249 --> 00:20:30,309
is ratio of autonomous systems that are

447
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,590
border autonomous systems so they're

448
00:20:30,309 --> 00:20:35,350
sitting at an international border and

449
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:37,299
then the x axis is the date and you can

450
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,759
see over time it was almost a half and

451
00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,100
now it's less than a third so you can

452
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,470
see just in the simple graph the

453
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,879
internet is getting a little bit more

454
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:49,539
restrained as it crosses national

455
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:50,738
borders but we wanted to ask more

456
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:53,499
sophisticated questions about specific

457
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:55,330
countries so we wanted to you know dig a

458
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:57,850
little more into detail so we defined a

459
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,949
major called chokepoint potential and

460
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:02,320
i'm not going to explain the math

461
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,859
because it's actually pretty simple the

462
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,200
idea is the you're counting the number

463
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:10,119
of pads into the country and the choke

464
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,350
point potential chocolate potential is a

465
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:15,939
property of an autonomous system and

466
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,639
specifically a border autonomous system

467
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:21,100
and you're just counting the number of

468
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:22,389
pads into the country and the choke

469
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,789
point potential of an autonomous system

470
00:21:22,389 --> 00:21:28,658
is the fraction of paths into that

471
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:31,600
country from the outside internet they

472
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:33,249
go through that autonomous system so

473
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,988
here that's four paths into the country

474
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:37,419
F&E are outside the country d is an

475
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:40,869
internal node inside the country then a

476
00:21:37,419 --> 00:21:42,429
B and C are all border a s is C has two

477
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:43,928
of the four paths going through it so

478
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,139
it's truck point potential is zero point

479
00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:49,359
five where as a and B have just one path

480
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:51,039
each going through them into the country

481
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:54,100
so their choke point potential is only

482
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,330
0.25 so if you want to call if you can

483
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,039
only call one of these autonomous

484
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,428
systems and say we want you to block a

485
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,730
particular web site you would call C

486
00:22:00,429 --> 00:22:02,730
first

487
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,570
so from choke point potential you can

488
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,799
define national choke point potential

489
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:13,269
which is now going to be a property of a

490
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:16,059
country and so we define the choke point

491
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:18,429
potential of a country you have to pre

492
00:22:16,059 --> 00:22:19,960
define some fraction F and that's the

493
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:22,450
number of paths that you want

494
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:23,799
to be able to control so if you wanna do

495
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:25,119
information controls you want to block a

496
00:22:23,799 --> 00:22:28,080
website you want to be able to say well

497
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:32,369
I want 90% of the paths into my country

498
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,860
to be covered so you define F equals 0.9

499
00:22:32,369 --> 00:22:38,860
so given that predefined at the choke

500
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:40,928
point potential of a country C it's a

501
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,580
reciprocal so it's they're super cool

502
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,909
because we want higher truck point

503
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:48,490
potential to be you know what you would

504
00:22:45,909 --> 00:22:51,610
want if you want a few places to do the

505
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:53,379
information controls and that Psalm is

506
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:57,070
just a way of saying like you'll call

507
00:22:53,379 --> 00:22:59,529
the the the autonomous system of the

508
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:00,908
highest choke point potential first so

509
00:22:59,529 --> 00:23:02,950
if you have an autonomous system that

510
00:23:00,909 --> 00:23:05,169
covers two-thirds of the routes you know

511
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,419
the the path and sorry the BGP pads into

512
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:08,769
your country you'd they're the first

513
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:11,110
ones you're gonna call and then the

514
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:12,940
second most neck and so you're just

515
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:17,080
adding them up in descending order that

516
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:18,399
way and then you're trying to cover as

517
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,720
many paths as possible and the question

518
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,459
is how many autonomous systems do you

519
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,679
have to call what fraction of the border

520
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:26,049
account of systems do you have to get on

521
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:29,889
the phone with before you can cover that

522
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:31,240
F ratio of pads into your country so I'm

523
00:23:29,889 --> 00:23:33,699
going to give you some results but just

524
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:35,110
to put the results in context let's just

525
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,580
take a snapshot of the internet because

526
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,039
we can compare across time and then we

527
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:41,559
can compare across countries so let's

528
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:45,580
take a snapshot of China you know around

529
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:49,178
2008 ish this is a picture of Chinese

530
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:50,710
internet pronoun by CN Nick and again I

531
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,999
apologize for always picking on China

532
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:56,799
has just been a subject of my research

533
00:23:51,999 --> 00:24:00,399
in a personal interest and there's four

534
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:03,399
lines of nodes in this graph the top

535
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:04,989
line is other countries so those are the

536
00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,299
other countries that China connects to

537
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:09,820
you the second and fourth lines are the

538
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:12,639
same six ISP so each of the six major

539
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:13,658
ISPs appears twice just to show how they

540
00:24:12,639 --> 00:24:15,008
connect to each other and how they

541
00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,590
connect to those three and in exchange

542
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:18,940
points and then the third line are the

543
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:23,769
internet exchange points in Beijing

544
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:27,249
Guangzhou and Shanghai and so you can

545
00:24:23,769 --> 00:24:30,999
see there's a a choke point at the

546
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:32,740
internet exchange points so if most of

547
00:24:30,999 --> 00:24:34,240
the country gets to the Internet through

548
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,250
these six ISP

549
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,260
and then they're forced to talk to each

550
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:40,150
other through these three in exchange

551
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:45,660
points then you can imagine there's a

552
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:48,460
nice choke point there and then also in

553
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:52,930
2007 this was our first study majoring

554
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:54,400
internet censorship and in a we said

555
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,430
approximately twenty-eight point three

556
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,190
percent of the Chinese host that we

557
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:01,900
tried to reach with basically an HTTP

558
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:03,670
packet that said Falun Gong which was

559
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,830
one of the banned keywords twenty eight

560
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,530
point three percent of the time it went

561
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:11,260
along the path to the host without ever

562
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,850
you know being noticed by the Great

563
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,470
Firewall of China so the great for all

564
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,730
trans basically covering three-fourths

565
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:19,840
of the passing of the country at that

566
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:22,060
time compare that it's you I mean it's

567
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,429
comparing oranges to apples a little bit

568
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:27,070
but if you read the recent literature

569
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:31,660
about Chinese internet censorship in

570
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:34,149
various ways it's about one half to one

571
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:36,160
percent now of paths that aren't covered

572
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:38,010
so they're covering a lot more path now

573
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:42,340
so see if that bears out in our data

574
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:43,870
let's go to 2009 which is as far back as

575
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,639
the a/s graph data that we have goes

576
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:51,310
back and you can see just check the time

577
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,450
so here the x-axis is the number of

578
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:57,040
guesses that you have to control and you

579
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:59,490
know again assuming that you call the

580
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:02,409
one that covers the most paths first and

581
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,750
then the fraction of pads that you're

582
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:06,190
able to intercept is the y-axis and so

583
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,550
of course as you call more autonomous

584
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,890
systems you can cover more pads and then

585
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:13,870
you can see so there's about six ISPs

586
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:17,260
that were part of this Chuck point and

587
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:21,520
you know 2008 ish all of this 2007 2008

588
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:24,070
2009 I'm calling a 2008 ish then so if

589
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,310
you look at six on x-axis and you go up

590
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:30,870
it's about 0.8 paths that you're you

591
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:33,639
know 80% of the paths are able to cover

592
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:35,320
and again it's oranges to apples because

593
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,300
not all links carry the same amount of

594
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:41,320
traffic and you know a path is not the

595
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:42,940
same as a route but you know roughly we

596
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,980
can see that there's a significant chunk

597
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,850
of paths that aren't covered and so

598
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:51,100
let's compare that to China and 2018

599
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,719
you know getting closer to today you can

600
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,699
see it's moved up and to the left which

601
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,540
means with just a few autonomous systems

602
00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:02,350
China can cover well over 90% of the

603
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,909
paths into the country so you can

604
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:08,889
actually see that evolution in the

605
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:10,480
routing and so you can compare across

606
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:12,160
years you can also compare across

607
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,640
countries so let's take a look at Russia

608
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:17,610
in 2018 I can show you Russia in 2009

609
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:20,679
it's not that much different and

610
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:22,090
basically you can see in Russia they

611
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:23,850
don't have a very high choke point

612
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,928
potential like China so it's very hard

613
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,250
you know they can call a few dozen

614
00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:29,590
autonomous systems they're still not

615
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:33,850
covering 80% of the paths into the

616
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:38,080
country so the graph is a lot more down

617
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:42,100
into the right and so we can look at the

618
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:43,809
evolution over time the United States

619
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,219
you know consistently has has pretty low

620
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,420
choke point potential it doesn't mean

621
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:49,540
that they don't do horrible things on

622
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:52,510
the internet but in terms of the kind of

623
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,370
controls that we're looking at it would

624
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:57,100
be very hard to do in a country of low

625
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:59,580
choke point potential you can see India

626
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:02,350
and Egypt are up there a little bit but

627
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:05,139
you can see China for a long time was

628
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,330
right around 0.1 0.2 you and then shot

629
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,429
up just like we saw in the data so

630
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:12,850
they've actually taken steps through

631
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:16,360
additional internet exchange points to

632
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:20,830
make their internet B have a stronger

633
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:22,780
choke point and you can see Russia has

634
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:27,340
consistently had a pretty low choke

635
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:30,840
point potential and so as an application

636
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,790
we looked at the correlation between

637
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,500
Internet freedom and national choke

638
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:39,790
point potential so on the graph on the

639
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:41,740
top the that's national choke point

640
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:44,409
potential so the countries that are

641
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:45,910
white or light green are the lower choke

642
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:47,620
point potential so they have a harder

643
00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:48,910
time with a few autonomous systems

644
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,219
patrolling all the paths into the

645
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:52,510
country whereas the darker green are the

646
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:55,210
countries with the higher choke point

647
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,710
potential and then on the bottom so we

648
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:59,290
use freedom on the net scores from

649
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,510
freedom house yeah it's very subjective

650
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,129
they have free partly free and not free

651
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:07,780
it's actually a score between zero and a

652
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:09,070
hundred and so you can argue you know as

653
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,750
a country free if they really do

654
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,129
surveillance or whatever but in terms of

655
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,140
the kinds of controls that we're looking

656
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:16,560
at which is specifically censorship and

657
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,930
internet shutoffs and that kind of thing

658
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:21,280
it's a pretty relevant score to national

659
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:22,600
choke point potential so we wanted to

660
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:25,090
look at the correlation you can see

661
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,740
visually that there's some correlation

662
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,750
and then if you're innocent of the

663
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,730
details we have statistics in the paper

664
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,420
to actually show that's statistically

665
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:33,820
significant there is a correlation

666
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,490
between the major that we define the

667
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,360
national choke point potential and the

668
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:42,070
freedom on the net scores well you might

669
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,090
notice a huge outlier does anybody

670
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,870
notice the huge outlier where there's

671
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:53,080
not so much correlation a huge in a

672
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:56,139
physical sense to you so you might

673
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:57,939
notice that Russia is why it has a very

674
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:59,620
low choke point potential but it's red

675
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:02,800
it's considered not free in terms of

676
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:05,649
freedom on the net scores so that's an

677
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,169
interesting case study and ironically

678
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,240
one of my former graduate students Roy

679
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,700
and Sophie she's now on the faculty at

680
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,380
University of Michigan and she has put

681
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,700
out a paper last week saying that choke

682
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,320
points aren't as relevant as they used

683
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:19,540
to be because Russia is doing a great

684
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:22,899
job at censorship and they don't have

685
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,040
choke points my own personal opinion I

686
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,990
don't think that they're gonna reach the

687
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:29,080
level of sophistication the a country

688
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:31,330
like China has or Iran they do you know

689
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:32,679
some very sophisticated things that we

690
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,470
can talk about offline my reasons for

691
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,150
thinking this but I don't think they I

692
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:39,010
think that choke points are still

693
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:40,870
relevant because anybody can just go to

694
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,550
a bunch of ISPs and say I'm you know all

695
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,560
of the dozens of Eyes peas that our

696
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,440
border ISPs in our country just have

697
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:53,200
them throw this HTTP filtering box in

698
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:54,190
path but that you know it's a lot harder

699
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,290
when you try to do the more

700
00:30:54,190 --> 00:31:00,430
sophisticated things in my opinion so

701
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,990
that's one thing I want to tell you

702
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,180
about is just the research that we did

703
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:05,170
but we also have some data and tools I

704
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,540
want to tell you about because I'm

705
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:08,920
hoping they you know you have your own

706
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,690
questions and your own thoughts about

707
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,570
what might be reflected in the ass graph

708
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:16,340
and you can use our data and tools

709
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:18,889
so in terms of our data techniques so we

710
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:21,080
took the qaeda data and then the a s

711
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:22,668
relationship data set and then we used a

712
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,059
breadth first search algorithm and the

713
00:31:22,669 --> 00:31:28,850
GAO Rexford Rowdy model to identify

714
00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:30,649
paths between a s pairs and then the

715
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:32,059
part that requires a supercomputer is

716
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,729
generating the routing trees for each

717
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:36,168
destination autonomous system so so that

718
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,669
way you can reason about the routing

719
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:39,169
from one autonomous system to another

720
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:42,860
for any pair of autonomous systems in

721
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:44,389
the world and we saved those routing

722
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,799
trees so if you want to use our tools

723
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:47,539
you don't need a supercomputer just

724
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:50,029
download the routing trees from ask and

725
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:51,679
then we calculate a chokepoint potential

726
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:53,480
for each border autonomous system but

727
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,009
once you have that graph you could

728
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,850
answer any question or make up any major

729
00:31:55,009 --> 00:32:01,279
that you think would be interesting and

730
00:31:57,850 --> 00:32:02,658
so we have all of our tools or open

731
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,639
source and they're bundled up in this

732
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:07,340
thing called bgp simulation analysis and

733
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:08,330
storage and then we have the routing

734
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,949
data so if you don't have a

735
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:11,779
supercomputer handy you can just

736
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:15,940
download this it's 200 gigs compressed

737
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:15,940
and then compresses to about 2 terabytes

738
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:20,210
so I'm sure you'll be able to find my

739
00:32:18,409 --> 00:32:21,919
slides on IAT effort is Google my name

740
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:23,419
and then that way you don't have to

741
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,179
write down these other key links so the

742
00:32:23,419 --> 00:32:27,799
the second link the middle link is what

743
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:29,799
I just talked about the routing trees

744
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:32,799
and all of our software and everything

745
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:35,860
as of yesterday it was under maintenance

746
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,908
so hopefully it'll be back up soon I'll

747
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,928
email the student that's running that

748
00:32:37,909 --> 00:32:43,279
and there's also the internet world map

749
00:32:41,929 --> 00:32:50,659
which is a tool you can play with them

750
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:52,070
about to show you so just for fun I went

751
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:53,330
to the internet world map this is

752
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:56,750
something that Kurtis the first author

753
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:58,699
of the paper did where you can actually

754
00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,320
draw the autonomous system graph for

755
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,029
each country and then it does border

756
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,639
nodes as yellow and then internal is

757
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:06,889
green and foreign is orange and you can

758
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:12,309
see how Singapore's changed from 2015 to

759
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:14,750
2018 it might not be on this slide is

760
00:33:12,309 --> 00:33:16,700
big enough to see there's a yellow

761
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:19,809
there's a you know very substantial

762
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,809
border autonomous system in 2015 and

763
00:33:19,809 --> 00:33:26,539
then fast forward to 2018 and it's more

764
00:33:23,809 --> 00:33:28,039
spread out there's a lot more border

765
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,929
autonomous systems connecting out

766
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:32,629
the country now so we would expect

767
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:34,460
Singapore's national truck point

768
00:33:32,629 --> 00:33:36,408
potential to have gone down between 2015

769
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:40,429
and 2018 that's exactly what we see the

770
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:44,210
yellow line that kind of goes up after

771
00:33:40,429 --> 00:33:46,999
2013 and then back down after 2016 is

772
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:48,320
Singapore and you can actually see their

773
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:50,090
national choke point potential went out

774
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,129
for a while and then came back down and

775
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:54,168
a lot of times these things happen

776
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:56,330
because of you know in exchange points

777
00:33:54,169 --> 00:33:58,309
and you know different changes that get

778
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,720
made and then I just took some of the

779
00:33:58,309 --> 00:34:01,489
countries in the region so you can play

780
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,009
with it go to that website you can put

781
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:06,049
in your own countries to play around

782
00:34:04,009 --> 00:34:10,099
with I put China for context you can see

783
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:11,750
China going up and you can I just

784
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:13,909
selected a bunch of African countries

785
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:15,409
and you can see they there's kind of a

786
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,940
downward trend so as they get more

787
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:18,609
connected to the internet they have

788
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:21,589
lower choke point potential the one

789
00:34:18,609 --> 00:34:23,210
exception is Ethiopia up there at the

790
00:34:21,589 --> 00:34:26,389
top there's just a line that's one point

791
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:29,059
all the way along and that's to be

792
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:30,889
expected so if you take a look at the

793
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:32,299
Internet of Ethiopia it's one autonomous

794
00:34:30,889 --> 00:34:33,559
system which is a border autonomous

795
00:34:32,299 --> 00:34:35,089
system and then it connects to three

796
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,369
autonomous systems outside the country

797
00:34:35,089 --> 00:34:41,000
that's why they're there in their choke

798
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:42,559
point potential is one so in terms of

799
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,699
takeaway messages so hopefully I've

800
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:44,990
convinced you the national choke point

801
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:47,020
potential is a useful measure and

802
00:34:44,989 --> 00:34:49,158
something that's useful to think about

803
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:50,899
but I also wanted to tell you we have

804
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,429
code and data so if you want you have

805
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:54,379
your own questions your own majors your

806
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:57,380
own you know things that you want to do

807
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:58,848
with it I please get in touch with us if

808
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,369
you have any problems with our tools or

809
00:34:58,849 --> 00:35:02,869
data or anything and in terms of future

810
00:35:01,369 --> 00:35:05,420
work so Stephanie and Curtis are

811
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:07,210
interested in missing links of a they're

812
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:10,430
working with a graph theory expert and

813
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,990
trying to identify the the links in our

814
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,000
graph that might be missing using

815
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,709
statistics I'm more interested in

816
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
physical infrastructure so if there's

817
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:18,589
blackouts you know how do you measure

818
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,230
the internet from inside a blackout see

819
00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:23,869
what's going on and then tcp/ip oddity

820
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,950
so if you're interested in like you know

821
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,660
details I'll just give you a little

822
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,980
previous initial sequence numbers we

823
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:29,960
looked at TCP initial sequence numbers

824
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,520
it's something like 13% of the internet

825
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,309
generates initial sequence numbers in a

826
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,680
way and this isn't sync cookies ignore

827
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:38,180
sync cookies it's still 13% of the

828
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,790
internet generates initial sequence

829
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:41,868
numbers in a way that lowers the entropy

830
00:35:40,790 --> 00:35:45,440
and makes it easy to

831
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,640
connections IP ID a similar problem

832
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,430
there's a third of the internet has

833
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,930
generated an IP IDs in a way that is

834
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:52,368
vulnerable so if you're interested in

835
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:55,879
that kind of low-level tcp/ip stuff

836
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:57,319
please talk to me offline and with that

837
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,549
I'll just acknowledge my author so you

838
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,630
have their contact information when you

839
00:35:58,549 --> 00:36:02,150
find the slides and I'll take any

840
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:03,650
questions thank you that was really

841
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:06,559
quite fascinating and one of the things

842
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:09,049
you mentioned it and anybody I'll ask my

843
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:11,690
question while lining up you mentioned

844
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:14,660
Iran once at the moment we've got you

845
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,720
know it basically in a shutdown where

846
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:20,118
the news reports that only 5% of traffic

847
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,939
is getting out now I don't know how they

848
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,759
figured out that kind of measure but if

849
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:28,190
you guys looked at all at those kinds of

850
00:36:25,759 --> 00:36:31,519
measures and see how they relate to your

851
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:32,900
your choke point research and D and have

852
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,519
you actually you didn't have any

853
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,200
pictures of Iran which would have been

854
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:40,819
very topical but I was wondering if

855
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:43,009
you've done that analysis too so we we

856
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:46,160
we did a lot of different things with

857
00:36:43,009 --> 00:36:48,680
the statistics and then just because of

858
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,670
the the vagaries of academia a lot of it

859
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,440
got cut from the paper now the

860
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:54,920
statistics section is like 1/2 of a

861
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,630
column but mostly we compared things

862
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,279
like freedom on the net scores and

863
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,529
there's another one like freedom of the

864
00:36:58,279 --> 00:37:03,499
press and different indices and then we

865
00:37:00,529 --> 00:37:07,099
compared them to different ways of doing

866
00:37:03,499 --> 00:37:08,569
our major and then in terms of

867
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:09,680
statistics if you look at lots of

868
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:11,150
different things then you have to

869
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,470
account for that when you say something

870
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,759
is statistically significant because you

871
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,919
don't want to look at 20 things and say

872
00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:17,239
oh look it's statistically significant

873
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,009
when you look at 20 things it's not

874
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:21,499
statistically significant or so we

875
00:37:19,009 --> 00:37:22,819
accounted for all of that I'm not the

876
00:37:21,499 --> 00:37:27,049
statistician the statistician has

877
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:29,180
actually been on the paper but we did a

878
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:30,680
lot of controls and things so we tried

879
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:33,109
to control for a lot of things in the

880
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,149
CIA world factbook that might explain

881
00:37:33,109 --> 00:37:36,619
the correlation to make sure that we're

882
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,359
not just saying well poor countries are

883
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:40,880
poor in rich countries to reach rich and

884
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:42,259
so the statistics stood up to all of

885
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,470
that but all of that had to get cut out

886
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:46,940
of the paper but we we did not and this

887
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:48,769
would be interesting to do is you know

888
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,700
look at some of the data that tor has or

889
00:37:48,769 --> 00:37:51,229
Unni

890
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,538
or you know whoever is able to come up

891
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:55,720
with these numbers like 5 percent of the

892
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:57,250
traffic

893
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,500
and try to correlate to that so there'll

894
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:03,849
be something interesting if we don't

895
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:04,390
have time to do hopefully somebody okay

896
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,520
thank you

897
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:08,020
there's three of you at the mics now and

898
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,700
since we're already running a little

899
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,640
late I'll go with it but I think you

900
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:15,549
were first no she was first

901
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,339
whoever was first please go first Nalini

902
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:21,030
Elkins there's a country that I'm pretty

903
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:25,240
familiar with that's had internet both

904
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:27,580
internet shutdowns too in the last few

905
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:30,790
months and also it's an interesting

906
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:33,098
thing I'm pretty sure what they did was

907
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,290
just call the ISPs and tell them to shut

908
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:37,230
off a particular region they're a lot

909
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,420
more concerned about particularly

910
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:43,090
pinpointed targeting of certain regions

911
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,040
rather than then you know things coming

912
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:48,430
across the border I think it'd be an

913
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,230
interesting thing to know is peak

914
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,598
coverage because if there's like one isp

915
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:54,010
serving a particular region versus like

916
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:56,650
i know there's a lot of projects like

917
00:38:54,010 --> 00:39:01,030
you know the Google loon and various

918
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:04,270
other kinds of things that might in in

919
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:06,640
the future give us a different you know

920
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:08,530
that the inability to do anything like

921
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,210
this governments to do that but but who

922
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,609
knows what I mean I'm just it's just a

923
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:14,859
cure yet I'd be interested to know

924
00:39:12,609 --> 00:39:16,960
something like that the the you know

925
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,540
whether you have distribution also the

926
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:21,790
that particular country I know to again

927
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:24,490
from word on the street they're very

928
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:30,310
they have a very sophisticated fake news

929
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:33,669
ability what's it a which country yeah

930
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:35,349
I'm not wanting to say that yeah yeah

931
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,540
but I mean as I say that's a that's just

932
00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:38,710
it's just something mine you know I mean

933
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,930
we're done I don't want to say it

934
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:43,180
because I don't have actual hard cold

935
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:45,759
facts to know that's true I'm just

936
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:47,379
saying word on the street yeah so I'm

937
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,150
just curious as to your thoughts on some

938
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:52,270
of them yeah I mean there's only a lot

939
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:53,349
of issues and you know depending on

940
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:55,359
whether you want to look at Western

941
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:56,770
countries or other countries what kinds

942
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,230
of issues you might look at would vary

943
00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:01,960
and so we looked at these national choke

944
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:05,160
points but it's becoming more and more

945
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,089
relevant the regional issues so

946
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,069
especially in India there's Internet

947
00:40:07,089 --> 00:40:12,009
shutdowns just constantly an Indian

948
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:16,600
specific regions and then there's

949
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:19,030
countries like Brazil and Germany their

950
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,410
concern is more like if we're routing

951
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:22,180
data within our country and we don't

952
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:23,529
want the NSA spying on us how can we

953
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,910
make sure that our data doesn't cross

954
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:29,170
international border and then come back

955
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:31,509
in and so there those are two you know

956
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,610
separate questions that you might look

957
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:34,990
at in the AES graph but those are not

958
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,220
the question we chose to look at but

959
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:40,209
they're definitely interesting questions

960
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,450
that we should look at John Brewer

961
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:46,930
independent there's been a proliferation

962
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:49,330
of IX extension services where internet

963
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,000
exchanges will allow you to connect to

964
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:55,390
the i-x remotely so for example you

965
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:57,730
could be within a quite restrictive

966
00:40:55,390 --> 00:40:59,980
country you could have a circuit from

967
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:03,700
the very restrictive license national

968
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:06,730
carrier and you could just run a tunnel

969
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:10,029
over it and appear to be peering at say

970
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:13,530
B bi X in Japan or Hong Kong internet

971
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:16,930
exchange this creates a lot of

972
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:19,480
adjacencies that really are still going

973
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:21,069
through one choke point that you haven't

974
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,600
mapped I don't think you've mapped in

975
00:41:21,070 --> 00:41:25,240
this have you thought about this problem

976
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,640
and how extensive it is so it creates an

977
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,759
adjacency because of the internet

978
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:32,980
exchange point so it allows an ASN

979
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,590
inside of a restrictive country to

980
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,040
tunnel out and create a lot of

981
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:40,720
adjacencies that make it look like an

982
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:44,770
isp inside of a restrictive country is

983
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,689
actually paired with 200 guesses in

984
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:49,000
another country however they're still

985
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,890
going through the choke point of their

986
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,820
national carrier which can shut them off

987
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:57,580
like that yeah yeah that's interesting

988
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:59,440
because it would that would shift the

989
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:02,680
choke point to the in exchange point in

990
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,120
terms of our data like we would see the

991
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:05,350
the choke point as the internet exchange

992
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:08,290
point and not as the physical

993
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:11,200
infrastructure so yeah I think we chose

994
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:12,430
that level of abstraction of BGP just to

995
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,339
kind of get a handle on the problem be

996
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:16,870
able to look at trends over time and

997
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,610
it's pretty hard to get physical data so

998
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:21,660
that definitely physical things matter

999
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:22,770
and the physical infrastructure matters

1000
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:23,940
it

1001
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,880
harder to get data and it's especially

1002
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,920
hard to get data over time so if anybody

1003
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,090
has recommendations like how we could

1004
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,030
find that data that would be really

1005
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:35,430
interesting to us and we also like just

1006
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:37,410
in terms of physical infrastructure you

1007
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:40,290
get ma this speaks to the first question

1008
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:42,779
to is you get regions like you know

1009
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:45,570
Tibet where they'll be very local

1010
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,070
shutdowns and then they'll get very

1011
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,690
conflicting information about where the

1012
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:50,700
internet shut down or whatever and so

1013
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:53,190
they would like a map of their local

1014
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:55,770
little internet like you know what goes

1015
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:57,120
on you know down here and we haven't

1016
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,470
really mapped that you know kind of

1017
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,890
physical infrastructure like if you turn

1018
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:04,919
off this cell phone tower who actually

1019
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:10,920
gets cut off we've only looked at the a

1020
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:13,560
s graph so far so thanks it's a very

1021
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:14,580
interesting work you have a node on one

1022
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:18,230
of the slides there about thinking about

1023
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:20,370
VPNs and I that might affect traffic I

1024
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:22,320
can you speak to what your thoughts are

1025
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:23,730
as to what kind of you know if you

1026
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:26,640
imagine a world where much more traffic

1027
00:43:23,730 --> 00:43:28,920
is encrypted maybe using encrypted SMI

1028
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,690
so you can't kind of block that way how

1029
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:33,450
would that impact on what statistics you

1030
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,950
might use instead of the ones you have

1031
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,330
our how would you evolve your current

1032
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:44,279
statistics and that's not kind of

1033
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:47,460
context yeah I think in terms of

1034
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,620
encryption I mean it's it's hard because

1035
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:51,690
if you look at the way the internet

1036
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,890
censorship gets applied you know

1037
00:43:51,690 --> 00:43:54,540
especially in the countries that are

1038
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,270
good at it it's a very graduated

1039
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,020
response so as long as they can tell

1040
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,759
that you're using a VPN you know they

1041
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,440
can be very successful just watching

1042
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:07,860
VPNs and then shutting them down when

1043
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,230
they really need to and not exerting a

1044
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,970
lot of pressure for there to be you know

1045
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,490
a lot more office keishon at it or

1046
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,919
anything like that and you know it'd be

1047
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,660
great if there was you know obfuscation

1048
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,660
encryption that would convincingly could

1049
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:24,779
stop these kinds of internet controls

1050
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:26,970
but I think the reality is like VPNs are

1051
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:28,740
a good example a lot of times you know

1052
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:30,060
there will be VPNs that work inside a

1053
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,279
country and the only reason they work is

1054
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:33,900
because the VPN company you're

1055
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,640
connecting to you is sharing the data

1056
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:37,640
with that that country's governments of

1057
00:44:37,819 --> 00:44:42,390
alright Joe Hall this is wonderful work

1058
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:45,689
thank you for doing it

1059
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:48,150
choke points is obviously a rough metric

1060
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,589
I mean I'm not trying to criticize you

1061
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,970
it's great stuff

1062
00:44:49,589 --> 00:44:53,940
I'm wondering you know there's so many

1063
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:56,839
other things that powerful sensors do

1064
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:59,160
have you thought about extending this to

1065
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:00,839
measuring not just choke points but some

1066
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:04,290
notion of instrumentation like for

1067
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:05,880
example the great cannon which may not

1068
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,410
be as interesting as it was when we

1069
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,950
first saw it come in which you know

1070
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:13,500
injects into HTTP flows JavaScript DDoS

1071
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:16,799
other sites right it might be

1072
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,900
interesting to sort of be able to look

1073
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,089
at some of these things like the graphs

1074
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,650
and stuff with not just the ability to

1075
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:26,430
sort of shut stuff off but the ability

1076
00:45:22,650 --> 00:45:29,329
to tinker with with flows in ways that

1077
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:32,578
might not be shutting down but you know

1078
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:35,309
bandwidth restrictions or the

1079
00:45:32,579 --> 00:45:36,930
probability of getting a TCP reset or

1080
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:39,089
something like that that may be too hard

1081
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:40,440
to analyze like this but I'm just

1082
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:42,029
wondering if you thought about extending

1083
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:45,839
it to stuff that's not just jokey but

1084
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:47,520
things that are kind of tinkering I yeah

1085
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,160
I mean that would definitely be

1086
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,049
interesting and I didn't really have our

1087
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,460
later works slide but there there have

1088
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:58,740
been other studies and we cited in the

1089
00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:00,270
paper that look yeah we were interested

1090
00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,669
in the a s graph but there's been other

1091
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:05,280
studies that have looked at you know who

1092
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:06,630
controls all the paths for DNS and you

1093
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,160
know just assuming they actually had

1094
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,450
usage statistics for everybody over the

1095
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,348
world are they using Google or they

1096
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,240
using Facebook or they're using

1097
00:46:10,349 --> 00:46:14,430
something else and they actually

1098
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,979
considered all of those paths and where

1099
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:18,210
your DNS is going in everything and they

1100
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,280
they got some pretty interesting results

1101
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:22,020
that are a complimentary drive so I out

1102
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,609
encourage that's another paper from my

1103
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,349
former student rune Sophia to encourage

1104
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:31,470
you to check out all her work read all

1105
00:46:25,349 --> 00:46:34,069
her papers thank you very much I think

1106
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:37,680
it was great but thank you okay I'll

1107
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:39,390
call up John Matson I want to explain

1108
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:41,490
that we're running a little late but

1109
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:44,578
this is really worthwhile and I'm not

1110
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,770
gonna try and cut you at all but we'll

1111
00:46:44,579 --> 00:46:49,570
have to hurry on some of the stuff later

1112
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:52,870
so please go ahead thank you

1113
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:55,180
thank you so this is about five-year

1114
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:57,670
security and in particular how party

1115
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,190
security affects privacy and

1116
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:03,100
surveillance so five years getting

1117
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:05,500
deployed now and we are noticed that

1118
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:08,170
there is a lot of interest both from

1119
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:10,330
government organization and also from

1120
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:14,890
privacy democracy and human rights

1121
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:23,410
groups how 5g will affect privacy and

1122
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:25,900
surveillance so 5g is it's faster more

1123
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:30,370
flexible more efficient and it's also

1124
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:33,280
more secure so this was Erickson's goals

1125
00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:35,799
for party cannot talk for other

1126
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:40,180
companies goes perfect I'm quite a lot

1127
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:43,200
of alignment there's new stronger

1128
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:45,790
authentication there's a zero trust

1129
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,339
architecture inside the networks and

1130
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:51,720
between them talk more about that and

1131
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:55,150
authentication there's more separation

1132
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:57,669
different signaling is encryption and

1133
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:01,240
integrity protection of basically

1134
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:03,370
everything at least that was the goal in

1135
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,009
many cases the integrity protection was

1136
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:09,430
a bigger problem than lack of encryption

1137
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:14,050
you could inject traffic and get data

1138
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:16,270
out and a main goal that has been mainly

1139
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:19,950
driving by Ericsson is to prevent

1140
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:23,440
tracking and identification of users and

1141
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:27,970
the main station organization for 5g is

1142
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:32,830
3pp but this is also done in a lot of

1143
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:36,189
other issues particularly Heidi uses IDF

1144
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:38,650
standards the large attempt and trying

1145
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:44,050
to go through three things which i think

1146
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:47,290
is mostly interesting for HR pc now very

1147
00:48:44,050 --> 00:48:53,250
much hope that you have questions happy

1148
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:55,810
to explain so one security weakness in

1149
00:48:53,250 --> 00:49:00,850
cellular system had traditionally been

1150
00:48:55,810 --> 00:49:03,750
the interconnect systems between

1151
00:49:00,850 --> 00:49:03,750
operators

1152
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:18,070
[Music]

1153
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:20,680
good so here is different media coverage

1154
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:23,830
of attacks on the interconnect systems

1155
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,740
so the protocol used traditional for the

1156
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:31,840
interconnects system is called ss7

1157
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:34,629
it was designed in 1975 it's a product

1158
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:41,350
of the time it uses no cryptography at

1159
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:45,010
all and there has been a lot of attacks

1160
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:48,610
using that lack of cryptography there's

1161
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:52,420
also been examples of as a 7 interface

1162
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:55,840
being accessible from the internet in 4G

1163
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:57,550
this was replaced by diameter this

1164
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,730
evolutional radius

1165
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:03,880
it has cryptography but there's a tax on

1166
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:07,690
diameter where you can downgrade it to

1167
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:11,580
as a 7 I don't think yes as long buzz is

1168
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:15,640
correct but there are vulnerabilities

1169
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:20,319
yeah so 5g completely redesigns there

1170
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:24,660
interconnect interface so this picture

1171
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:27,900
shows the interconnect here called m32

1172
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:31,450
technical name between the 2 different

1173
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,340
operators and connection between 2

1174
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:37,270
different operators can be you make a

1175
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:40,930
call from the u.s. to Europe or you go

1176
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:42,640
on vacation somewhere and the visited

1177
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:46,750
operators has to talk to you whom

1178
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:53,379
operator and this new interconnect

1179
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:56,080
system is it's using a TLS tunnel to set

1180
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,690
up a shared key and then that shared key

1181
00:50:56,080 --> 00:51:02,380
is used to encrypt an integrity protect

1182
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:05,080
as much information as possible

1183
00:51:02,380 --> 00:51:08,910
previously in between here there can be

1184
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:12,250
one or many interconnect providers and

1185
00:51:08,910 --> 00:51:14,529
inside G they are given information on a

1186
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:16,750
need-to-know basis so as little as

1187
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:20,350
possible and any modification

1188
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:26,110
chance by them or logged and sign so you

1189
00:51:20,350 --> 00:51:32,140
can see who changed and this system uses

1190
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:37,690
Hosey and old and TLS poetry inside

1191
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:43,960
networks there's mandatory requirement

1192
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:48,250
to support Els 103 by all notes and when

1193
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:50,410
turned on all the control signal inside

1194
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:54,160
the network would be protected so in

1195
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:57,250
case of some attacks or breach it's much

1196
00:51:54,160 --> 00:52:09,370
harder to get information or to escalate

1197
00:51:57,250 --> 00:52:12,610
any attacks main focus on five year is

1198
00:52:09,370 --> 00:52:15,640
to completely eliminate all false base

1199
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:18,370
stations and emcee catchers this is also

1200
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:24,730
something that has raised a lot of

1201
00:52:18,370 --> 00:52:27,640
interest so what is in thicket rosa

1202
00:52:24,730 --> 00:52:31,840
falls but base station there's quite

1203
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:38,109
many forms here are some examples there

1204
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:42,880
that got into media 2013 there was MC

1205
00:52:38,110 --> 00:52:46,060
catchers in trash cans in London so

1206
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,690
basically these integers they catch the

1207
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:53,500
permanent identifiers of all the of your

1208
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:58,710
phone and then they used use that to

1209
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:58,710
track you and to sell advertisement

1210
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:09,430
another example is more full base

1211
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:12,280
stations in 2014 was media reporting on

1212
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:15,640
a lot of false based in and placed out

1213
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:20,340
across the USA near military areas for

1214
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:24,520
example I have not seen any follow up

1215
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:26,770
what happens to this but so these are

1216
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:29,410
typically more capable base stations

1217
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:30,250
being able to make you connect to them

1218
00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:33,100
and record

1219
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:36,160
everything and after this I had a call

1220
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:39,370
with the FCC that was very worried and I

1221
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:43,180
wanted to understand what could be done

1222
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:45,520
to mitigate this in the future and a

1223
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,319
very recent example from just a few

1224
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,170
months ago there was media reports that

1225
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:55,270
was a lot of false base stations in the

1226
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:56,980
White House and I think long in London

1227
00:53:55,270 --> 00:54:00,430
is clear who put this out in the other

1228
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:04,540
cases of course there's nobody is taking

1229
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:06,549
responsibility for this entropy you get

1230
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:12,700
this media reporting them you don't know

1231
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:15,480
so much else so implicit two-faced

1232
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,819
patients they go under a lot of

1233
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:21,340
different names in the u.s. they

1234
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:28,480
typically on the name stingray and this

1235
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:31,930
is a brand name from some company as far

1236
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:34,960
as I knew none of the companies actually

1237
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:37,569
making mobile equipment makes this type

1238
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:42,300
of equipment so these are different

1239
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:46,600
companies having nothing to do with 3pp

1240
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:48,550
and there is in general there's you can

1241
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:51,100
say that there's two different kinds of

1242
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:53,320
base stations there are fake base

1243
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:55,600
station that can completely mimic all

1244
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:59,200
the function of a cellular system and

1245
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:03,250
these only work in 2g is the oldest

1246
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:09,009
system that was starting to get drawn in

1247
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:13,090
1990s it was mitigated with 3d that

1248
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:18,120
introduced network authentication but

1249
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:21,700
the problem is that two-g is still here

1250
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:24,130
in large part of the verge some part of

1251
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:26,980
the world has completely shut down to G

1252
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:29,560
but you still have the problem that for

1253
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:33,250
example US has completely shut down to D

1254
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:38,560
bit us phones will still happily connect

1255
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:41,440
to false to be base station that says it

1256
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:43,660
comes from France or Vietnam or China or

1257
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:47,049
any other country then

1258
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:50,259
mobile thinks it it's roomy

1259
00:55:47,049 --> 00:55:52,030
then there are more lightweight force

1260
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:52,660
base stations like the one in the trash

1261
00:55:52,030 --> 00:55:55,960
cans

1262
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:58,720
the simplest way would be to just

1263
00:55:55,960 --> 00:56:01,960
passively listen to the permanent

1264
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:05,020
identifiers on the radio but it is quite

1265
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:08,470
inefficient so typically these also they

1266
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:11,079
were these four MC catchers are active

1267
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:14,379
so they tell the you way to tell me your

1268
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:19,930
permanent identifiers pretending to be

1269
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:22,510
the network and the network answers and

1270
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:26,020
to play these false base stations they

1271
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:28,960
use a lot of techniques to get films the

1272
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:34,259
connection can be to use a very strong

1273
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:40,270
signal strength then they actively send

1274
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:43,630
different messages what you sing things

1275
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:46,900
in the standard but also hacks on

1276
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:50,020
different models or undocumented thing

1277
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:52,210
in different for models and we tried to

1278
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,130
get you the phones to connect to them

1279
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:58,950
and then they typically try to get the

1280
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:58,950
phones to stay there as long as possible

1281
00:57:02,250 --> 00:57:09,940
5g has really set as a goal to

1282
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:12,819
completely eliminate false base station

1283
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:18,660
and the Phi D standard incorporates a

1284
00:57:12,819 --> 00:57:22,359
lot of different techniques to do so the

1285
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:28,480
permanent identifiers which often is an

1286
00:57:22,359 --> 00:57:31,299
MC is encrypted then there is a strict

1287
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:34,869
refreshment of the temporary identities

1288
00:57:31,299 --> 00:57:35,319
tree DPP system has a temporary identity

1289
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:38,589
since

1290
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:40,930
2g but there's no strict rules on

1291
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:43,839
refreshment or how they were generated

1292
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:46,419
in 5g they are forced to be random

1293
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:50,650
looking and there's strict rules on

1294
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:53,829
refreshment then the permanent ID is not

1295
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:56,650
used in paging anymore when the base

1296
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:57,430
station in ASCII as trying to figure out

1297
00:57:56,650 --> 00:58:02,410
whether you

1298
00:57:57,430 --> 00:58:06,399
is there is integrated protection of use

1299
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:11,529
plane traffic or some attack being use

1300
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:13,930
their radio direction are now secure

1301
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:17,559
so typically falls base station if

1302
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:20,500
you're connected to 4G the fault space

1303
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:23,410
station will pretend to be a 4G network

1304
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:25,900
and tell you you should connect to this

1305
00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:27,730
student network is that that will be

1306
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,700
better for you and that was not

1307
00:58:27,730 --> 00:58:33,730
protected and 5g it is protected so if

1308
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:38,230
you connected to 5g a force patient will

1309
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:40,930
not get you to reconnect easily of

1310
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:44,980
course it can jam the 5g frequences

1311
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:47,500
altogether it's very little to do but

1312
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:51,430
that and then there is full Space

1313
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:55,540
Station detection using both URIs and

1314
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:58,240
networks in collaboration and typically

1315
00:58:55,540 --> 00:59:02,920
using the the data available in the

1316
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:06,520
network it's very easy to to see that

1317
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:10,150
there is that there has been for Space

1318
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:13,150
Station people you cannot shut them down

1319
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:18,510
down remotely but you can send someone

1320
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:21,130
out or report to the police the most

1321
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:25,319
important technical advancement is the

1322
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:29,680
encryption of permanent identities and

1323
00:59:25,319 --> 00:59:32,140
when this is enabled the permanent

1324
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:36,669
identifiers typically called MCS

1325
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:40,299
never sent in the air encryption is done

1326
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:43,000
here is the whole network so the public

1327
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:44,579
key of the home network is stored on the

1328
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:50,079
SIM card

1329
00:59:44,579 --> 00:59:57,339
then it's encrypted using the c4g curve

1330
00:59:50,079 --> 01:00:00,160
curve du fafa 1-9 and so in foggy day

1331
00:59:57,339 --> 01:00:03,490
permanent identifier is called su p it

1332
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,970
is often a MC encrypted soup is called a

1333
01:00:03,490 --> 01:00:05,970
Susi

1334
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:16,160
and if this is enabled the permanent

1335
01:00:12,230 --> 01:00:19,610
identifier will never ever be seen and

1336
01:00:16,160 --> 01:00:25,100
if you know how encrypted SN s and I

1337
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:30,560
work it is works exactly the same or

1338
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:33,620
very similar and both of these ports I

1339
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:37,910
talked about is already since several

1340
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:42,400
years ago already standardized in 5g in

1341
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:45,500
the Padilla standard the first another

1342
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:47,600
surveillance related topic that is not

1343
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:51,200
in the foggy standard yet but we hope to

1344
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:57,319
get in the next release is to limit the

1345
01:00:51,200 --> 01:01:04,279
impact of compromised long term keys and

1346
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:07,270
this was in the Snowden revelations it

1347
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:07,270
was reported that

1348
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:15,920
gemalto SIM card manufacturer had been

1349
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:24,049
hacked and that the hackers had stolen a

1350
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:26,210
large amount of long term keys there has

1351
01:01:24,050 --> 01:01:30,890
after that the Malta has acknowledged

1352
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:33,710
that they were hacked but they have not

1353
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,750
been very open about how many so we

1354
01:01:33,710 --> 01:01:39,290
don't really know how many keys were

1355
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:42,350
stolen and how it happened or some so on

1356
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:44,360
but we can assume that whoever stole

1357
01:01:42,350 --> 01:01:46,310
this key intended to use them but we

1358
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,920
don't know if it was for specific

1359
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:55,100
attacks or if it was for more mass

1360
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:58,280
surveillance and they compromised long

1361
01:01:55,100 --> 01:02:01,940
term key is not specific to soon after

1362
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:06,140
keys for example heartbleed couple years

1363
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:10,220
ago that extracted public private keys

1364
01:02:06,140 --> 01:02:14,509
in from a cell symmetric and for

1365
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:19,980
fortunately aiders good method to try to

1366
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:23,049
stop this so in cellular networks

1367
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:27,299
the authentication is based on the

1368
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:32,500
symmetric key one part is stored on the

1369
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:35,740
SIM card securely very hard to extract

1370
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:38,319
the other is securely installed in the

1371
01:02:35,740 --> 01:02:42,220
home network also very hard to extract

1372
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:46,089
but what these hackers apparently

1373
01:02:42,220 --> 01:02:49,000
rumored Lee did was to get hold of the

1374
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:52,900
key before it was delivered to the home

1375
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:55,450
network and so what can you do if you

1376
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:58,630
get this key you can do active attacks

1377
01:02:55,450 --> 01:03:01,689
so you can authenticate as the network

1378
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:04,359
to the UE or you can attend to gate sau

1379
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:08,309
we to the network or you can do both at

1380
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:08,308
the same time being a man-in-the-middle

1381
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:17,109
that's hard to do at home at a large

1382
01:03:13,569 --> 01:03:23,170
scale it's relatively expensive and you

1383
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:26,609
can get you can be detected you can also

1384
01:03:23,170 --> 01:03:29,380
do passive attacks where yes the

1385
01:03:26,609 --> 01:03:33,400
eavesdrop on information sent over the

1386
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:36,390
air and then you can decrypt everything

1387
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:40,270
this is much easier to do at large scale

1388
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:45,759
it's relatively inexpensive and the risk

1389
01:03:40,270 --> 01:03:49,029
of being detected is very low and with

1390
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,730
this as the system is designed in 14

1391
01:03:49,029 --> 01:03:53,980
earlier you can also do this if you

1392
01:03:51,730 --> 01:03:57,369
recorded information in the past and

1393
01:03:53,980 --> 01:04:01,119
then just get compromised get the long

1394
01:03:57,369 --> 01:04:06,819
term keys you can decrypt the past

1395
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:10,839
information so how do we stop this this

1396
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:13,930
is quite straight forward known

1397
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:17,349
techniques you do a DPL ephemeral

1398
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:19,660
diffie-hellman send you to the X e to

1399
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:24,309
the bye and then you calculate it would

1400
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:29,140
X Y and this we are now working to

1401
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:32,950
introduce in in the EAP

1402
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:36,578
k so 5g previous five we use their own

1403
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:39,390
mechanism for authentication in 5g it

1404
01:04:36,579 --> 01:04:43,059
was introduced that you can always used

1405
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:46,660
EAP so for access to the mobile network

1406
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:49,420
you can use EAP aka which is the SIM

1407
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:51,879
card based authentication method for

1408
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:56,559
private network like industries and so

1409
01:04:51,880 --> 01:05:02,609
on you can use any IP method and the EAP

1410
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:04,359
is IDF standard for example EAP TLS and

1411
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:08,980
we are now worked

1412
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:11,799
ap TLS it already has different monkey

1413
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:14,460
exchanged with perfect formal secrecy we

1414
01:05:11,799 --> 01:05:17,950
are now working actively to introduce

1415
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:21,519
that into the sim card authentication

1416
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:24,279
and this is a hessian working group

1417
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:26,288
adopted here in the IDF in the emu

1418
01:05:24,279 --> 01:05:31,089
working group and there is a study in

1419
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:32,829
3gpp to what if this should be

1420
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:36,130
introduced in 3d PP and what other

1421
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:39,519
enhancement should be done but if this

1422
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:42,309
is done then the attacker is forced to

1423
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:44,589
do active attacks

1424
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:47,430
you cannot decrypt information in the

1425
01:05:44,589 --> 01:05:56,670
past and you cannot attack future

1426
01:05:47,430 --> 01:05:56,669
communication if your passive questions

1427
01:05:58,589 --> 01:06:12,130
please any questions at the microphones

1428
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:15,430
I do not see any ok I'll ask one this is

1429
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:18,400
burning volts in one of the slides you

1430
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:23,769
said that the suppiy s UPI was shared

1431
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:25,839
with the roaming network is that a good

1432
01:06:23,769 --> 01:06:28,209
idea I mean I understand it's probably

1433
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:31,150
the least sort of you know potential

1434
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,220
exploit but it opens the opportunity

1435
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:34,869
that if somebody you know if you roam

1436
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:38,680
somewhere somebody breaks into that

1437
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:42,270
remote network that operators thing they

1438
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:45,240
can get your something yeah I think

1439
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:51,509
oh nothing is perfect so yeah roaming

1440
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:54,660
Network will have your in soapy but and

1441
01:06:51,510 --> 01:06:58,430
I think it has to have it for technical

1442
01:06:54,660 --> 01:07:02,339
reasons at least for now it changed from

1443
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:04,770
40 to Friday is that the roaming network

1444
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:08,130
only gets disappear if the noble

1445
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:11,009
actually is is there there was a tax on

1446
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:13,800
40 where you the rooming a rogue roaming

1447
01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:15,960
network could get this get

1448
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:18,750
authentication vector even if them all

1449
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:20,910
at home was not there five divorces the

1450
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:23,360
mobile phone to be there at least you

1451
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:26,879
need to be physically there in that

1452
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:30,570
network I agree it's the you know it's

1453
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,430
probably the lowest issue because you

1454
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:34,050
know protecting it further out on the

1455
01:07:32,430 --> 01:07:35,910
network is more important but it's just

1456
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:38,450
kind of curious as to why they didn't

1457
01:07:35,910 --> 01:07:41,730
also protect that thank you

1458
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:44,100
next place hi

1459
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:46,470
so I have a question about this inter

1460
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:49,830
interconnect security you did mention

1461
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:53,640
that now it's using TLS and certificates

1462
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:56,730
which is a big improvement from ss7 and

1463
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:59,819
and diameter but I still wonder like do

1464
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:02,640
you just trust any anyone that has has a

1465
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:04,350
certificate or do you still have to

1466
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,470
manually configure that I trust

1467
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:09,118
certificates with these domains in the

1468
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:12,629
SN yeah

1469
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:16,109
currently certificate distribution is

1470
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:17,609
not specified in out of scope it's up to

1471
01:08:16,109 --> 01:08:23,009
day to day

1472
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:26,450
operator so but there is ongoing its

1473
01:08:23,009 --> 01:08:30,569
ongoing studies how to make this more

1474
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:33,528
automatic but how it will look like I

1475
01:08:30,569 --> 01:08:40,410
don't know it will not be the Internet

1476
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:42,870
PGI with Elliott here John thanks for

1477
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:45,240
your presentation as always a really

1478
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:47,220
good job on that last point obviously

1479
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:50,028
we've been doing a lot of work on on how

1480
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:54,029
we address here at the ITF about how we

1481
01:08:50,029 --> 01:08:55,980
actually do a certificate trust

1482
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:59,580
establishment its

1483
01:08:55,979 --> 01:09:02,879
parties that are not necessarily known

1484
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:05,760
to each other and so some of the animal

1485
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:09,540
work is probably worth looking at my

1486
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:16,319
question though is you were talking a

1487
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:22,700
lot about how to how do a 5 g works to

1488
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:27,000
avoid the problem of false base stations

1489
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:30,149
false cells right so pulling this back

1490
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:33,210
to HR PC in terms of sort of the focus

1491
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:37,620
on government one of the questions might

1492
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:39,779
be how how this would interact in terms

1493
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:41,818
of from a pervasive surveillance

1494
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:43,950
standpoint what the government's would

1495
01:09:41,819 --> 01:09:46,980
need to do because those are the ones

1496
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:50,010
who employ some of the the technologies

1497
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:53,219
so it might be worth maybe follow-up

1498
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:55,830
work I'd to talk about what what 5g

1499
01:09:53,220 --> 01:09:59,070
means in terms of how they'll be using

1500
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:02,059
the or what they'll need to change and

1501
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:04,139
how that might be looked at from the

1502
01:10:02,060 --> 01:10:07,530
perspective of somebody who doesn't want

1503
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:09,210
to see that practice continued thank you

1504
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:11,400
I want to make one point about people

1505
01:10:09,210 --> 01:10:13,830
talking at the mic you keep trailing off

1506
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:15,750
because I think you're too far from it

1507
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:18,320
did you manage to hear all of this

1508
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,320
question

1509
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:27,260
no to HR PC to follow this up I think

1510
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:29,270
unless you have a comment on it yourself

1511
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,550
hmm

1512
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:35,130
don't know there's different I think

1513
01:10:32,550 --> 01:10:37,680
there's different actors here there's

1514
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:40,070
private companies using these type of

1515
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:45,240
things to sell advertisement

1516
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:49,099
then there's nation-states using false

1517
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:52,139
pay stations in other states I think

1518
01:10:49,100 --> 01:10:55,560
that the attack states won't definitely

1519
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:58,800
want to stop that FCC is for example

1520
01:10:55,560 --> 01:11:04,790
worried about this then there is report

1521
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,790
about police using MC catchers

1522
01:11:05,610 --> 01:11:12,040
but normally the 3gpp this system was

1523
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:16,890
not designed to allow any of these so

1524
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:21,340
all of these will be prohibit will be

1525
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:24,130
mitigated right so I think some of this

1526
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:26,620
has to do with the trust model from the

1527
01:11:24,130 --> 01:11:29,370
from the base station to device some of

1528
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:31,690
it has to do with who is an authorized

1529
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:35,290
base station if you will within a

1530
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:36,580
provider network and and what sort and

1531
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:38,680
how the government's might influence

1532
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:41,860
that so I think there's probably some

1533
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:45,660
thought that could be given there yeah I

1534
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:50,530
think there might be there might be new

1535
01:11:45,660 --> 01:11:53,800
allies solution introduced in the future

1536
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:56,559
when this path is cut off but then it

1537
01:11:53,800 --> 01:12:03,850
will be hopefully authorized by a court

1538
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:06,220
and will be logged mr. abhart all open

1539
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:07,600
exchange now and since I this is a

1540
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:10,630
discussion that's coming up in other

1541
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:13,510
environments I'm curious how do you do

1542
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:15,760
the legal intersection party since this

1543
01:12:13,510 --> 01:12:18,250
is still a requirement in most counties

1544
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,410
so I mean this is an - an encryption

1545
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:22,540
only on the radio path I'd say or maybe

1546
01:12:20,410 --> 01:12:24,130
up to the home network but then there is

1547
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:26,350
a point in which the communication is

1548
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:29,350
anyway decrypted and so it can be also

1549
01:12:26,350 --> 01:12:32,430
shared with third parties or so I am I

1550
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:36,450
getting this right yeah if you ask about

1551
01:12:32,430 --> 01:12:42,040
legal intercepts I think fergie will not

1552
01:12:36,450 --> 01:12:46,599
change that very much you can do a lie

1553
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:50,680
at both in the visiting Network and whom

1554
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:56,760
network it's should be authorized should

1555
01:12:50,680 --> 01:13:00,790
be logged if it always is hot

1556
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:03,550
transferring all all countries Ericsson

1557
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:07,480
song has a policy to not participate in

1558
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:09,490
any mass surveillance it should be it

1559
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:12,480
should be authorized hopefully by a

1560
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:12,480
court order yeah

1561
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:20,409
guseva grow Center for Internet and

1562
01:13:16,630 --> 01:13:27,130
Society just I think following up from

1563
01:13:20,409 --> 01:13:29,438
Elliot's comments it and okay the first

1564
01:13:27,130 --> 01:13:32,170
a question about the encryption of the

1565
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:36,550
permanent identifiers I I noticed you

1566
01:13:32,170 --> 01:13:39,699
mentioned if it is enabled and this is a

1567
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:42,820
problem like I personally faced while

1568
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:44,259
reading 5d specifications which is what

1569
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:47,768
options are actually left to the

1570
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:49,420
operator and what are parts of the

1571
01:13:47,769 --> 01:13:52,389
standard itself which have to be

1572
01:13:49,420 --> 01:13:55,860
monetarily followed is is this part an

1573
01:13:52,389 --> 01:13:58,510
option left to the operator or yes so

1574
01:13:55,860 --> 01:14:02,139
encryption of the so pay is it's

1575
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:05,320
mandatory to support by all equipment so

1576
01:14:02,139 --> 01:14:09,729
support will there be there it needs to

1577
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:14,558
be enabled by the operator the tree the

1578
01:14:09,729 --> 01:14:17,499
operator as organization yes ma has said

1579
01:14:14,559 --> 01:14:21,939
that this is highly recommended for the

1580
01:14:17,499 --> 01:14:24,909
operators to turn on so I would believe

1581
01:14:21,939 --> 01:14:28,840
I would believe that in the Western

1582
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:32,110
world this will be turn on I don't think

1583
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:36,420
it's turn on in the very first 5g

1584
01:14:32,110 --> 01:14:39,308
deployment that we are seeing that all

1585
01:14:36,420 --> 01:14:41,110
have been deployed now it's probably

1586
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:44,610
something that will start getting

1587
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:49,228
deployed next year but I don't have any

1588
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:55,869
data on that and it's this detectable by

1589
01:14:49,229 --> 01:14:58,989
by the user equipment as in whether the

1590
01:14:55,869 --> 01:15:01,808
permanent identifier is and you we of

1591
01:14:58,989 --> 01:15:05,289
course the ue knows if it's encrypted

1592
01:15:01,809 --> 01:15:10,300
the permanent identifier it's probably

1593
01:15:05,289 --> 01:15:13,599
not visible to the end-user but it's

1594
01:15:10,300 --> 01:15:15,610
it's very visible for the radio traffic

1595
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:19,269
so i think this is something that

1596
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:21,188
academia can it probably the operator

1597
01:15:19,269 --> 01:15:23,769
will tell you if they encrypt this or

1598
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:26,380
not but you can also quite easily

1599
01:15:23,769 --> 01:15:28,330
checked on the radio if it is encrypted

1600
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,190
if it's not encrypted you get

1601
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:33,430
same EMC all the time if it's encrypted

1602
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:35,410
you get some random string as in the

1603
01:15:33,430 --> 01:15:37,560
operator does have control at a

1604
01:15:35,410 --> 01:15:43,360
particular moment to enable or disable

1605
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:46,260
they need to enable it yes and a

1606
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:51,610
question about how the interconnection

1607
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:53,680
encryption would work so if there are if

1608
01:15:51,610 --> 01:15:56,019
I am going through another network to

1609
01:15:53,680 --> 01:15:59,470
reach the final destination network that

1610
01:15:56,020 --> 01:16:01,440
I need to connect to the so the actual

1611
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:05,920
encryption is just between the two and

1612
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:11,980
so a B C and I'm connecting through B to

1613
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:13,810
C B the III don't see the I mean larger

1614
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:17,919
point of such encryption because we can

1615
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:20,830
still decrypt it yes so the rooming if

1616
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:24,700
you are roaming to another country that

1617
01:16:20,830 --> 01:16:28,960
other network will see your permanent

1618
01:16:24,700 --> 01:16:31,929
identifier eventually the encryption of

1619
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,030
the permanent identifier is its end to

1620
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:37,360
end but then it goes back to the roaming

1621
01:16:34,030 --> 01:16:39,130
operator the main main reason to have

1622
01:16:37,360 --> 01:16:41,769
this encryption is not to hide it for

1623
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:45,100
the roaming operator it's to hide it

1624
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:49,630
over the ear yeah my question was about

1625
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:51,190
intermediate networks that essentially

1626
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:54,670
if there's a hop that you need to get

1627
01:16:51,190 --> 01:17:03,250
through to reach your destination

1628
01:16:54,670 --> 01:17:08,440
network in not not in this map I suppose

1629
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:10,690
but if there can be some transit

1630
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:15,339
networks in between here is that what

1631
01:17:10,690 --> 01:17:19,690
you question yeah they it will be they

1632
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:23,170
will they will not see it during this

1633
01:17:19,690 --> 01:17:28,150
handshake whether they have access later

1634
01:17:23,170 --> 01:17:30,640
I cannot answer if I don't know okay

1635
01:17:28,150 --> 01:17:35,730
yeah if it's visibly in any of that

1636
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:40,240
communication and lastly million elegans

1637
01:17:35,730 --> 01:17:42,159
so now I'm I'm thinking if that that I'm

1638
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:45,849
a very intrusive

1639
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:47,860
of government that wants to surveil you

1640
01:17:45,849 --> 01:17:50,229
know everybody and I want to have the

1641
01:17:47,860 --> 01:17:53,320
power so one thing I'm gonna probably

1642
01:17:50,229 --> 01:17:54,789
look for the weakest point and so if you

1643
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:56,679
make all this secure that I'm gonna

1644
01:17:54,789 --> 01:17:58,570
start attacking and I'm gonna you know

1645
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:00,969
go on to the client but the other thing

1646
01:17:58,570 --> 01:18:03,099
I know there's been a lot of talk and

1647
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:06,280
whether it's true or not I don't know

1648
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:08,679
about about you know if you can get the

1649
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:11,949
not false base station but this that's

1650
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:14,860
the device itself the real station and

1651
01:18:11,949 --> 01:18:18,728
then I as the bad guy of the surveilling

1652
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:21,518
government I a lot Gemalto I hack into

1653
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:24,130
it or I make that insecure so that on

1654
01:18:21,519 --> 01:18:27,429
the back end it's given me all the

1655
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:28,539
information that it needs so I I mean I

1656
01:18:27,429 --> 01:18:32,099
and I don't know what the answer is

1657
01:18:28,539 --> 01:18:35,949
whether like not like an independent

1658
01:18:32,099 --> 01:18:38,199
body which looks at all these things and

1659
01:18:35,949 --> 01:18:39,909
kind of says this this thing is doing

1660
01:18:38,199 --> 01:18:41,678
this kind of stuff this thing is not I

1661
01:18:39,909 --> 01:18:46,329
mean I don't know you know I'm Sam yeah

1662
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:50,380
there are certification programs for the

1663
01:18:46,329 --> 01:18:54,610
security of all these type of notes I

1664
01:18:50,380 --> 01:18:58,360
think the base stations are quite closed

1665
01:18:54,610 --> 01:19:04,209
I don't think it's easy to break into to

1666
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:07,719
base station but no all the day very

1667
01:19:04,209 --> 01:19:10,389
much data is of course available at the

1668
01:19:07,719 --> 01:19:16,349
operator basically the mobile network

1669
01:19:10,389 --> 01:19:16,349
needs to keep track of all the users

1670
01:19:16,380 --> 01:19:23,169
Erikson's equipment is not designed to

1671
01:19:19,469 --> 01:19:25,150
to extreme you're not suppose is try to

1672
01:19:23,169 --> 01:19:29,079
stop you from an extract large amount of

1673
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:33,219
data but it's probably still possible

1674
01:19:29,079 --> 01:19:37,659
yeah I had closed because we're ready 15

1675
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:40,289
minutes over okay alright okay it's

1676
01:19:37,659 --> 01:19:45,009
really really closed after him okay

1677
01:19:40,289 --> 01:19:46,809
sorry a moment so do you have transitive

1678
01:19:45,010 --> 01:19:49,749
roaming of treatment so if I'm roaming

1679
01:19:46,809 --> 01:19:52,030
in Singapore my will there be only like

1680
01:19:49,749 --> 01:19:54,280
roaming agreement with some operator in

1681
01:19:52,030 --> 01:19:55,429
Singapore and my home country or do you

1682
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:59,360
think there will be hot

1683
01:19:55,429 --> 01:20:03,320
in between they will very likely be

1684
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:05,509
hopes in between it depends on but it

1685
01:20:03,320 --> 01:20:07,849
probably depends on the actual operator

1686
01:20:05,510 --> 01:20:09,800
and if there might be a direct link

1687
01:20:07,849 --> 01:20:12,440
between the two operators but it might

1688
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:16,190
also be several transit operators in

1689
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:18,799
between typically they do different type

1690
01:20:16,190 --> 01:20:22,519
of processing yeah thank you very much

1691
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:25,909
and thanks to both of our speakers here

1692
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:27,679
and an innovation to others of you that

1693
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:29,539
are researching things especially things

1694
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,750
related to human rights protocol

1695
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:39,820
considerations please let us know for

1696
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:41,239
future meetings now I guess it's Joe

1697
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:45,380
hall

1698
01:20:41,239 --> 01:20:58,489
I guess Stephan is also on online but

1699
01:20:45,380 --> 01:21:00,710
please and the clicker is there all

1700
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:03,589
right hey everybody this is an update on

1701
01:21:00,710 --> 01:21:08,679
draught association that I and Stephan

1702
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:12,289
Couture took editorial rolls over to

1703
01:21:08,679 --> 01:21:13,849
ATF's ago I believe so give you some

1704
01:21:12,289 --> 01:21:16,489
quick background this is one of the

1705
01:21:13,849 --> 01:21:22,520
specific drill-down rights drafts after

1706
01:21:16,489 --> 01:21:24,320
80 to 80 we had aim to have a new

1707
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:27,349
version but both Stephane and I got new

1708
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:28,849
jobs and it got really complicated and

1709
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:31,039
we haven't done a whole lot other than

1710
01:21:28,849 --> 01:21:32,630
what you're about to see right here but

1711
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,329
what we started to realize over the past

1712
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:37,280
month working on this is that we really

1713
01:21:35,329 --> 01:21:39,590
need to have more discussions about this

1714
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:42,650
especially and I want to sort of note

1715
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:44,059
for Neal's and Gizella that the

1716
01:21:42,650 --> 01:21:47,119
proposals will make at the end of this

1717
01:21:44,059 --> 01:21:48,980
or sort of a refactoring of the entire

1718
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:50,598
draft and so that's a pretty substantial

1719
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:52,909
change and we don't want to do that

1720
01:21:50,599 --> 01:21:54,860
without some significant discussion of

1721
01:21:52,909 --> 01:21:56,960
the or the research group and with the

1722
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:59,750
original authors and will proposed a way

1723
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,520
forward so a summary of the draft is it

1724
01:21:59,750 --> 01:22:03,440
exists right now the research question

1725
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:06,139
is how does the architecture of the

1726
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:08,598
internet enable and/or inhibit the right

1727
01:22:06,139 --> 01:22:11,090
to freedom of assembly and Association

1728
01:22:08,599 --> 01:22:14,210
the methodology was to test the causal

1729
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:15,800
relationship of protocols in terms of

1730
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:17,719
their effects on Association and

1731
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:22,130
assembly through typical impaired

1732
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:23,630
dogmatic cases we have since then taken

1733
01:22:22,130 --> 01:22:27,050
the word cause a lot of all this because

1734
01:22:23,630 --> 01:22:29,840
we have a lot of academic critiques

1735
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:31,880
about causal relationships and there's

1736
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:33,349
seven protocol cases in the document and

1737
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:36,619
we sort of are wondering why these

1738
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:39,560
particular cases so three issues I'll

1739
01:22:36,619 --> 01:22:41,809
tee up for discussion right now what is

1740
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,770
the aim of the draft why these cases and

1741
01:22:41,810 --> 01:22:47,780
not others and we're going to talk about

1742
01:22:44,770 --> 01:22:49,130
protocol cases versus cases around

1743
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:51,469
specific things that happen in the real

1744
01:22:49,130 --> 01:22:52,699
world and how protocols affect those

1745
01:22:51,469 --> 01:22:55,159
things and then talk a little bit about

1746
01:22:52,699 --> 01:22:57,379
the literature review and how that may

1747
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:59,659
need some enhancement

1748
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:01,550
so first the aim of the document there's

1749
01:22:59,659 --> 01:23:03,739
sort of two stated goals in the document

1750
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:06,079
the first is that the document seeks to

1751
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:07,879
deepen the relationship between internet

1752
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:11,960
architecture protocols and standards

1753
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:13,909
without creating any new guidelines this

1754
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,579
is HR PC Human Rights protocols

1755
01:23:13,909 --> 01:23:18,290
considerations why is the goal not to do

1756
01:23:16,579 --> 01:23:20,750
something about why is Human Rights not

1757
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:22,099
in the goal right there and then why are

1758
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,690
we not creating new guidelines I've got

1759
01:23:22,099 --> 01:23:25,070
I have some ideas about why we're not

1760
01:23:23,690 --> 01:23:27,980
creating new guidelines given the

1761
01:23:25,070 --> 01:23:30,019
relationship between AI RTF and IETF and

1762
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:32,000
the second goal is to test the

1763
01:23:30,020 --> 01:23:34,849
relationship between protocols and

1764
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,590
associations but what does it mean to

1765
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:39,079
test the draft doesn't really talk about

1766
01:23:36,590 --> 01:23:41,570
that much and are we at all interested

1767
01:23:39,079 --> 01:23:44,449
in the relationship with Association or

1768
01:23:41,570 --> 01:23:47,000
the broader right there's sort of

1769
01:23:44,449 --> 01:23:48,589
treaties and other people recognize that

1770
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:51,139
this right as being as assembly an

1771
01:23:48,590 --> 01:23:54,590
association are those things different

1772
01:23:51,139 --> 01:23:56,960
they probably are and then importantly

1773
01:23:54,590 --> 01:23:59,090
how is this document going to be helpful

1774
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:00,650
for folks working in the IETF if they

1775
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:02,810
want to see this as research and put

1776
01:24:00,650 --> 01:24:05,150
into things they're doing you know how

1777
01:24:02,810 --> 01:24:07,010
does that work at all the second issue

1778
01:24:05,150 --> 01:24:10,089
is the cases so the cases that we have

1779
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:13,610
in the document right now are conversing

1780
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:15,230
peer to peer and then grouping together

1781
01:24:13,610 --> 01:24:17,000
getting into groups and so in the

1782
01:24:15,230 --> 01:24:19,638
conversing sense there's IRC there's

1783
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:22,250
mailing lists there's web RTC and if I'm

1784
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:25,580
talking too fast just raise your hand

1785
01:24:22,250 --> 01:24:26,989
and let me know and I'll slow down and

1786
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:28,730
peer-to-peer there's actual peer-to-peer

1787
01:24:26,989 --> 01:24:31,040
technologies and then there's version

1788
01:24:28,730 --> 01:24:32,239
control technologies and then in

1789
01:24:31,040 --> 01:24:34,610
grouping together there's things like

1790
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:38,000
the domain name system autonomous

1791
01:24:34,610 --> 01:24:40,880
systems but it's unclear us why these

1792
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,489
particular cases are chosen the document

1793
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:45,770
sort of says without explanation that

1794
01:24:43,489 --> 01:24:47,299
they're typical and paradigmatic but

1795
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:49,850
that's not really explained in the

1796
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:52,040
document but if we were gonna change

1797
01:24:49,850 --> 01:24:54,140
these cases or think about a more

1798
01:24:52,040 --> 01:24:57,890
coherent way of talking about cases at

1799
01:24:54,140 --> 01:25:00,230
all what will we do might we think about

1800
01:24:57,890 --> 01:25:01,670
events that happened sort of socially

1801
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:03,320
things that happened in the world and

1802
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:05,630
how protocols may have affected those

1803
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:07,250
kinds of events either specific ones or

1804
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:09,680
over periods of time like shutdowns

1805
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:14,030
which is sort of a genre of things that

1806
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:16,280
happen in the real world and then being

1807
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:17,929
former academics the literature review

1808
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,739
is something we think we really need to

1809
01:25:17,930 --> 01:25:22,969
beef up and spend some time digging into

1810
01:25:20,739 --> 01:25:26,419
we really think we need to be more

1811
01:25:22,969 --> 01:25:28,760
systematic and explicit about the

1812
01:25:26,420 --> 01:25:30,410
universe of definitions of the right to

1813
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:32,390
freedom of assembly and Association

1814
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:34,190
there's a lot of material out there what

1815
01:25:32,390 --> 01:25:35,719
are the boundaries of those rights you

1816
01:25:34,190 --> 01:25:38,599
know how do we actually think about

1817
01:25:35,719 --> 01:25:40,100
those you know how have people thought

1818
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:42,469
about the boundaries of these rights and

1819
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:45,770
then do we need a better distinguish

1820
01:25:42,469 --> 01:25:48,320
between enabling the cat the capacity to

1821
01:25:45,770 --> 01:25:51,199
associate and assemble the positive

1822
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:53,840
right and disabling it and then in the

1823
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:57,410
negative sense so to what extent can you

1824
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:59,719
exclude folks from particular types of

1825
01:25:57,410 --> 01:26:01,610
associations or assemblies that's also

1826
01:25:59,719 --> 01:26:02,870
part of the right it's important you

1827
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:04,429
know to have a group that you're

1828
01:26:02,870 --> 01:26:06,320
confident in that you can kick people

1829
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:09,590
out of the group that may be a little

1830
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:11,000
different for ietf but and the right to

1831
01:26:09,590 --> 01:26:12,739
exit there's a link in the document

1832
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,870
that's actually broken there's a percent

1833
01:26:12,739 --> 01:26:16,160
23 that should be a pound so if you

1834
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,230
click on that and you get an error just

1835
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:20,630
change it to PAMP I don't know how that

1836
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:22,459
happened it must be Google slides and

1837
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:25,250
then we're actually looking for other

1838
01:26:22,460 --> 01:26:27,080
examples of folks who have thought

1839
01:26:25,250 --> 01:26:29,210
deeply about the right to assembly and

1840
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,890
Association Association specific and

1841
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:32,989
digital technologies and there's a few

1842
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:34,219
things that that we think are out there

1843
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:35,929
know they're out there that we just need

1844
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:37,880
time to find

1845
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:40,280
this is something that we haven't shown

1846
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:42,170
before this is a potential refactoring

1847
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:43,639
of this document that we think might

1848
01:26:42,170 --> 01:26:45,470
make sense but we haven't done any of

1849
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:46,820
this because we really want to talk

1850
01:26:45,470 --> 01:26:48,020
through this and make sure that folks

1851
01:26:46,820 --> 01:26:50,299
like Niels and gazella

1852
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:52,670
think that this is this is not a bad way

1853
01:26:50,300 --> 01:26:54,890
to restructure this and you can see you

1854
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:58,250
know there's a pretty deep literature

1855
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:59,750
review in here that sort of sets up the

1856
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:03,020
boundaries of sort of what we think

1857
01:26:59,750 --> 01:27:05,420
about the right and then we actually go

1858
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:07,880
into maybe a different set of cases

1859
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,900
around events or socially things that

1860
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:10,550
happen in the real world and how

1861
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:12,920
protocols might affect that rather than

1862
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:16,070
looking at the protocols is these these

1863
01:27:12,920 --> 01:27:18,860
sort of clinical things themselves now

1864
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:22,519
to do this we need help obviously we

1865
01:27:18,860 --> 01:27:24,679
need help we really want to make this

1866
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,910
draft we want to make the draft in a

1867
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,900
collaborative fashion we want to

1868
01:27:25,910 --> 01:27:28,730
actually write it in a collaborative

1869
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:32,599
fashion so we're thinking of having

1870
01:27:28,730 --> 01:27:34,040
three short seminars to like working

1871
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:36,290
seminars I guess you could call it an

1872
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,480
interim I heard someone say that the

1873
01:27:36,290 --> 01:27:40,730
other day I won't say who but we could

1874
01:27:38,480 --> 01:27:43,099
think about these is short interim

1875
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:44,990
meetings for HR PC between now and the

1876
01:27:43,100 --> 01:27:47,810
March Vancouver meeting that will allow

1877
01:27:44,990 --> 01:27:50,740
us to work in a group on these kinds of

1878
01:27:47,810 --> 01:27:52,700
things and get a more clear idea of

1879
01:27:50,740 --> 01:27:54,260
folks who want to participate in

1880
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:56,389
contribute to this of where it should go

1881
01:27:54,260 --> 01:27:57,920
before you know publishing a new version

1882
01:27:56,390 --> 01:28:00,350
of the draft and sending it back to the

1883
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:02,450
group there may be a few versions along

1884
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:04,820
the way and as a matter of fact anyway

1885
01:28:02,450 --> 01:28:07,309
that's it I spoke very very fast but I'm

1886
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:10,070
wondering what people think are you in

1887
01:28:07,310 --> 01:28:12,430
do you think this is crap thank you one

1888
01:28:10,070 --> 01:28:15,139
of the things I want to say is an

1889
01:28:12,430 --> 01:28:19,910
interim or something by any other name

1890
01:28:15,140 --> 01:28:22,310
by mid-december may be challenging but I

1891
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:24,860
think the idea is great I'm just looking

1892
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:26,990
at mid-december and getting it set up

1893
01:28:24,860 --> 01:28:31,160
and announcing it knowing it happened

1894
01:28:26,990 --> 01:28:33,290
that's tough yeah I mean my Michael my

1895
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,150
point is that there are three so maybe

1896
01:28:33,290 --> 01:28:37,280
not everybody can make all three maybe

1897
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:38,690
they are a bit redundant but I'm sure

1898
01:28:37,280 --> 01:28:39,800
you can continue to nudge the needle

1899
01:28:38,690 --> 01:28:41,450
with three and I think it's a good

1900
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:45,950
proposal to do it that way actually and

1901
01:28:41,450 --> 01:28:49,099
now we have three comments at least hi

1902
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:51,050
it's Elliot again Jo I really like

1903
01:28:49,099 --> 01:28:53,449
your approach in terms of the rigor that

1904
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:58,609
you're introducing and I think that's

1905
01:28:53,449 --> 01:29:00,289
very useful to two points first on the

1906
01:28:58,609 --> 01:29:03,889
question that you asked about whether

1907
01:29:00,289 --> 01:29:05,749
the document should provide advice to

1908
01:29:03,889 --> 01:29:08,359
the ietf community

1909
01:29:05,749 --> 01:29:11,090
the IRT F is certainly not prescribed

1910
01:29:08,359 --> 01:29:12,949
from doing so and I think that's part of

1911
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:15,260
the charter of the IRT F is to provide

1912
01:29:12,949 --> 01:29:19,518
that assuming you can derive useful

1913
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:20,899
advice from the the experience of having

1914
01:29:19,519 --> 01:29:24,469
written put putting together the

1915
01:29:20,899 --> 01:29:26,030
document we will see yeah that's it's

1916
01:29:24,469 --> 01:29:31,099
surely an open question

1917
01:29:26,030 --> 01:29:33,800
the second point though is in terms of

1918
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:36,050
the examples so we have standards

1919
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:38,599
examples and certainly DNS as a

1920
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:41,780
rendezvous mechanism can be used to

1921
01:29:38,599 --> 01:29:46,010
impede freedom of association one can

1922
01:29:41,780 --> 01:29:48,050
can pretty easily envision that the

1923
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:49,519
thing that I was thinking about though

1924
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:51,739
is the societal discussion that we're

1925
01:29:49,519 --> 01:29:56,179
having about this is well outside the

1926
01:29:51,739 --> 01:29:58,848
protocol arena right now it's what sort

1927
01:29:56,179 --> 01:30:01,849
of impact can government's have on

1928
01:29:58,849 --> 01:30:04,519
social networks like Facebook and and

1929
01:30:01,849 --> 01:30:06,859
Twitter in this regard and so one of the

1930
01:30:04,519 --> 01:30:08,570
things I would like you to leave open

1931
01:30:06,859 --> 01:30:12,409
and I think this group should leave open

1932
01:30:08,570 --> 01:30:14,030
is the import of this work compared to

1933
01:30:12,409 --> 01:30:15,978
the you know what's going on elsewhere

1934
01:30:14,030 --> 01:30:17,780
if it's really minor import and it's

1935
01:30:15,979 --> 01:30:19,820
gonna be a really major effort to try

1936
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:21,739
and put this together let's let's be

1937
01:30:19,820 --> 01:30:23,268
honest with ourselves about that and I

1938
01:30:21,739 --> 01:30:24,888
leave it as an open question but I think

1939
01:30:23,269 --> 01:30:26,359
it should be a question so let me

1940
01:30:24,889 --> 01:30:30,559
restate just a little bit of that you're

1941
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:33,889
talking about a lot of the efforts to

1942
01:30:30,559 --> 01:30:37,010
control this stuff is aimed at platforms

1943
01:30:33,889 --> 01:30:39,739
not necessarily technical protocols cool

1944
01:30:37,010 --> 01:30:41,809
yes exactly okay and it could be that we

1945
01:30:39,739 --> 01:30:44,299
might want to refactor again towards

1946
01:30:41,809 --> 01:30:47,419
that it's a little less in the you know

1947
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:49,249
towards the IETF space perhaps but it's

1948
01:30:47,419 --> 01:30:51,559
still a very valid area and it could be

1949
01:30:49,249 --> 01:30:54,079
that maybe it's a valid area for others

1950
01:30:51,559 --> 01:30:56,090
to do but I leave that open as well but

1951
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:59,030
I think we should have that discussion

1952
01:30:56,090 --> 01:31:01,249
cool it looks like Stefan wants to

1953
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:02,840
comment so since he's one of the authors

1954
01:31:01,249 --> 01:31:04,550
I'm gonna give him a chance to

1955
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:10,040
respond before going to the rest of the

1956
01:31:04,550 --> 01:31:11,869
queue I love the red button I think

1957
01:31:10,040 --> 01:31:15,650
you're on you may have to click

1958
01:31:11,869 --> 01:31:21,679
something Stefan or you may be muted he

1959
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:24,369
says this is your speaking we hit the

1960
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:27,889
button we did and now we want to watch

1961
01:31:24,369 --> 01:31:31,309
how do we kick him out it's like

1962
01:31:27,889 --> 01:31:32,750
literally pac-man right okay please

1963
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:35,030
please go ahead while we're waiting

1964
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:36,560
first Stefan Stefan please put yourself

1965
01:31:35,030 --> 01:31:37,190
back in the queue and maybe we'll get it

1966
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,560
right this time

1967
01:31:37,190 --> 01:31:42,169
mr. Jessica so this is Jeffrey askin

1968
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:44,389
sorry if I just miss this in your slide

1969
01:31:42,170 --> 01:31:46,010
I'd appreciate seeing some discussion of

1970
01:31:44,389 --> 01:31:47,570
the interaction of parental and

1971
01:31:46,010 --> 01:31:53,560
enterprise filtering with the freedom of

1972
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:56,630
association cool okay what's in there

1973
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:58,250
yeah Melinda Shore I am really

1974
01:31:56,630 --> 01:32:01,880
enthusiastic about this it looks great

1975
01:31:58,250 --> 01:32:03,770
on I you know the caveat that I'm sort

1976
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:05,270
of yeah on the idea of providing

1977
01:32:03,770 --> 01:32:07,159
guidance to the IETF I think it can be

1978
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:09,469
implicit in the document and that would

1979
01:32:07,159 --> 01:32:12,230
be sufficient also I'm going to disagree

1980
01:32:09,469 --> 01:32:15,110
with with Elliot there there are many

1981
01:32:12,230 --> 01:32:16,968
examples of ITF protocols being used to

1982
01:32:15,110 --> 01:32:19,400
disassociate people from the internet

1983
01:32:16,969 --> 01:32:21,020
and from one another and I mean DNS is

1984
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:23,598
actually you know we can come back to

1985
01:32:21,020 --> 01:32:27,199
that circle around that but you know DNS

1986
01:32:23,599 --> 01:32:29,389
is a good example so so yes yay and very

1987
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:31,669
nice cool I do think that there's a way

1988
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:34,099
to to combine those two comments in the

1989
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:37,849
sense like Brazil platform blocking

1990
01:32:34,099 --> 01:32:39,469
whatsapp is also sort of meta protocol

1991
01:32:37,849 --> 01:32:41,330
block right in the sense that they have

1992
01:32:39,469 --> 01:32:42,380
to do a whole bunch of protocol level

1993
01:32:41,330 --> 01:32:43,790
stuff to do that then they start

1994
01:32:42,380 --> 01:32:45,560
throwing people in jail sorry if you're

1995
01:32:43,790 --> 01:32:47,150
from Brazil but okay hopefully Stefan

1996
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:51,050
you're on now so I'm going to let you go

1997
01:32:47,150 --> 01:32:53,659
ahead yeah we see you

1998
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:58,520
so perhaps we'll hear you you could do a

1999
01:32:53,659 --> 01:33:01,159
little interpretive dance Devon Stefan's

2000
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:06,380
speak you just went out of the field of

2001
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:07,848
view please come back nice book case we

2002
01:33:06,380 --> 01:33:11,630
see you Stefan and we're waiting for you

2003
01:33:07,849 --> 01:33:14,659
to say something he doesn't hear us I

2004
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:16,790
don't think he's doing all those

2005
01:33:14,659 --> 01:33:19,969
movements you do when you don't hear

2006
01:33:16,790 --> 01:33:21,560
we'll wait for the voice of God aka

2007
01:33:19,970 --> 01:33:23,870
Stephane but did you want to say

2008
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:26,960
something to me yeah it's just to say it

2009
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:29,330
III stated those points as questions so

2010
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:32,390
maybe Melinda you disagree with a

2011
01:33:29,330 --> 01:33:34,940
question but I also like your your

2012
01:33:32,390 --> 01:33:36,530
refactoring of my question Joe to talk

2013
01:33:34,940 --> 01:33:38,480
about the difference between platforms

2014
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:40,040
and protocols I think that's a very

2015
01:33:38,480 --> 01:33:41,750
useful way to put this cool I think we

2016
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:43,190
can do that ok Stefan I don't know

2017
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:45,380
whether you're able to hear us and

2018
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:46,940
whether you're able to speak some we do

2019
01:33:45,380 --> 01:33:52,340
see you so you should be able to say

2020
01:33:46,940 --> 01:33:56,210
something and we will hear it say some

2021
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:58,430
words yeah say some words we see your

2022
01:33:56,210 --> 01:34:02,450
mouth move hope I see I saw some words

2023
01:33:58,430 --> 01:34:04,100
but I didn't hear them can can you just

2024
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:06,380
type your question or your statement

2025
01:34:04,100 --> 01:34:08,960
into the jabber room and then somebody

2026
01:34:06,380 --> 01:34:24,410
can come to the mic ends and speak he is

2027
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:28,060
in Jefferson is a wonderful thing

2028
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:28,059
especially when it works

2029
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:46,889
so lewd besides relaying the Hunts

2030
01:34:42,810 --> 01:34:50,040
comments here he says I just wanted to

2031
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:54,090
say meeting for mid-december could be

2032
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:56,430
with ex author yeah yeah so sir have a

2033
01:34:54,090 --> 01:34:59,460
check in with us editors with the

2034
01:34:56,430 --> 01:35:01,200
author's other people will be welcome to

2035
01:34:59,460 --> 01:35:02,820
join but that could be sort of a way to

2036
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:04,790
do that fantastic

2037
01:35:02,820 --> 01:35:07,620
yeah don't pay any attention to my

2038
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:09,540
nervous no no I hear you man December is

2039
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:14,160
gonna be chock-full of fun stuff on my

2040
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:29,780
side too okay thank you thank you okay I

2041
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:29,780
guess I'm next people time to shorten

2042
01:35:35,220 --> 01:35:42,150
[Music]

2043
01:35:37,340 --> 01:35:44,190
okay so basically this hopefully Neil's

2044
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:46,799
is online and listening because

2045
01:35:44,190 --> 01:35:50,960
definitely he should intervene in

2046
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,960
anything I say but so too with the rest

2047
01:35:51,470 --> 01:35:57,510
we've had discussions on this and and on

2048
01:35:54,450 --> 01:36:00,210
the list I said that I would try to do

2049
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:02,730
sort of a quick look at where we're at

2050
01:36:00,210 --> 01:36:05,250
on this so that we could then look at

2051
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:07,980
going further so the current state is

2052
01:36:05,250 --> 01:36:09,660
the author and and and other people and

2053
01:36:07,980 --> 01:36:11,969
and it's more than a few many other

2054
01:36:09,660 --> 01:36:14,490
people have believed that the doc is

2055
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:17,340
ready for a research group last call

2056
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:19,559
there's also also been a number of

2057
01:36:17,340 --> 01:36:23,790
people that have questioned that and

2058
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:25,260
have said perhaps not a lot of people

2059
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:27,120
think it's a valuable piece of work that

2060
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:29,880
should continue should eventually be

2061
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:33,330
published there are a few people that

2062
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:35,490
have questioned that and and and a very

2063
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:37,470
few have actually seemed against taking

2064
01:36:35,490 --> 01:36:39,750
it forward but I'd say that the majority

2065
01:36:37,470 --> 01:36:42,090
of people that I've been listening to

2066
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:45,690
have said yes it's worth doing it's

2067
01:36:42,090 --> 01:36:48,870
worth taking forward I think that Neil's

2068
01:36:45,690 --> 01:36:49,098
has done an incredibly admirable job to

2069
01:36:48,870 --> 01:36:52,519
her

2070
01:36:49,099 --> 01:36:55,849
I think three or four versions in an

2071
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:58,699
attempt to to respond to all the

2072
01:36:55,849 --> 01:37:00,920
comments people are making it in

2073
01:36:58,699 --> 01:37:03,138
QuickTime and so I really wanted to

2074
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:05,239
thank them for that I also think that

2075
01:37:03,139 --> 01:37:08,510
the conversation that has gotten going

2076
01:37:05,239 --> 01:37:10,730
on the list by people trying to make

2077
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:13,250
their points and trying to make their

2078
01:37:10,730 --> 01:37:15,769
points understood has been really good

2079
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:18,889
it's kind of the thing I often look for

2080
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:20,139
in this group is not just someone puts

2081
01:37:18,889 --> 01:37:23,360
out a document

2082
01:37:20,139 --> 01:37:25,429
everybody nods hmm and then it gets

2083
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:27,829
published but but rather than some real

2084
01:37:25,429 --> 01:37:29,929
conversation on the depths of issues

2085
01:37:27,829 --> 01:37:32,599
happens so I really wanted to thank the

2086
01:37:29,929 --> 01:37:35,630
people who sometimes despite their busy

2087
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:38,320
lives and and whatever else have done

2088
01:37:35,630 --> 01:37:41,210
that so thanks and and and don't go away

2089
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:43,549
so some of the issues now these are the

2090
01:37:41,210 --> 01:37:47,230
issues that I've sort of picked up in in

2091
01:37:43,550 --> 01:37:50,750
a brief form obviously we've had

2092
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:53,299
well-spoken erudite writers writing

2093
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:57,560
paragraphs and paragraphs so I'm sure I

2094
01:37:53,300 --> 01:38:00,590
did not capture it we also in Neil's as

2095
01:37:57,560 --> 01:38:03,320
many versions perhaps some of these have

2096
01:38:00,590 --> 01:38:06,110
been fixed but I don't want to make the

2097
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:08,449
assumption until others have said so

2098
01:38:06,110 --> 01:38:10,579
there was a clarity on on the research

2099
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:12,169
question people were sort of saying what

2100
01:38:10,579 --> 01:38:14,480
is the research question that's being

2101
01:38:12,170 --> 01:38:16,820
asked here and can you make it clear in

2102
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:19,579
the document it has gotten clearer I'm

2103
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:22,610
not sure whether it's yet clear enough

2104
01:38:19,579 --> 01:38:24,739
for all there is a consistency between

2105
01:38:22,610 --> 01:38:27,049
sections of the document with questions

2106
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:29,178
being asked and here I'm quoting one of

2107
01:38:27,050 --> 01:38:31,099
the people that commented do networking

2108
01:38:29,179 --> 01:38:33,530
standards have political use and/or

2109
01:38:31,099 --> 01:38:35,420
impact is there politics and the

2110
01:38:33,530 --> 01:38:38,840
development of networking standards are

2111
01:38:35,420 --> 01:38:40,790
protocols political and and and those

2112
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:43,730
are statements that are all made there

2113
01:38:40,790 --> 01:38:47,420
connected is the logic between them

2114
01:38:43,730 --> 01:38:49,280
working within that framework our all

2115
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:51,500
the statements is sufficiently

2116
01:38:49,280 --> 01:38:54,619
substantiated with argument or

2117
01:38:51,500 --> 01:38:57,679
references many many are I believe

2118
01:38:54,619 --> 01:39:00,619
probably most are some may not be some

2119
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:02,780
may actually be but the explanation may

2120
01:39:00,619 --> 01:39:05,420
not be clear enough to everybody

2121
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:08,750
reading I'm not judging here I'm really

2122
01:39:05,420 --> 01:39:12,530
just trying to sort of capture the

2123
01:39:08,750 --> 01:39:14,420
things that that were expressed one of

2124
01:39:12,530 --> 01:39:16,309
the questions that came up that had been

2125
01:39:14,420 --> 01:39:19,039
in the draft was taken out of the draft

2126
01:39:16,309 --> 01:39:22,039
but others felt was still important was

2127
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:24,139
should access to IETF whether it's to

2128
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:26,869
the meetings to the documents to the

2129
01:39:24,139 --> 01:39:29,719
whatever be included in the discussion

2130
01:39:26,869 --> 01:39:32,329
of the political nature and there were

2131
01:39:29,719 --> 01:39:35,239
lots of discussions on that there was

2132
01:39:32,329 --> 01:39:38,509
definitely a split in the viewpoint of

2133
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:42,169
it being critically important to it not

2134
01:39:38,510 --> 01:39:44,480
being relevant at all or to it being a

2135
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:49,010
confusing issue to include there were

2136
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:51,289
issues with definitions the the the term

2137
01:39:49,010 --> 01:39:54,530
political there was a single definition

2138
01:39:51,289 --> 01:39:56,900
given for political and yet I think

2139
01:39:54,530 --> 01:40:00,079
almost as many definitions for political

2140
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:03,829
as we have in the room so was that that

2141
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:06,590
that large span of definitions of

2142
01:40:03,829 --> 01:40:08,679
political sufficiently covered is the

2143
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:12,559
definition of political that's in there

2144
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:15,559
adequate use of standard without a

2145
01:40:12,559 --> 01:40:17,960
definition in other words there was talk

2146
01:40:15,559 --> 01:40:21,050
of protocol considerations there was

2147
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:23,030
talk of standards considerations the

2148
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:25,960
comparison and the relationship between

2149
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:31,489
protocol and standard was not

2150
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:35,539
differentiated and and and such there

2151
01:40:31,489 --> 01:40:37,339
was questions of made of are we talking

2152
01:40:35,539 --> 01:40:40,730
de facto standards are we talking about

2153
01:40:37,340 --> 01:40:43,539
the jurist de jure standards if we could

2154
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:47,269
call an IETF standard a de jure

2155
01:40:43,539 --> 01:40:50,869
also discussions of normative versus

2156
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:54,020
voluntary nothing in the IETF is indeed

2157
01:40:50,869 --> 01:40:58,098
normative it's all voluntary and

2158
01:40:54,020 --> 01:41:00,920
recommended so how does that fit in to

2159
01:40:58,099 --> 01:41:02,510
this this political analysis there was

2160
01:41:00,920 --> 01:41:04,730
the difference between non standard

2161
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:07,010
protocols and standard tract protocols

2162
01:41:04,730 --> 01:41:08,629
does that make a difference in the

2163
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:11,809
political nature in the political

2164
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:13,730
analysis how does that work is it

2165
01:41:11,809 --> 01:41:16,369
sufficiently defined in the document

2166
01:41:13,730 --> 01:41:16,759
there were questions occasionally about

2167
01:41:16,369 --> 01:41:19,519
the

2168
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:23,420
of the document and some very very good

2169
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:24,950
bits of logic analysis that I'm not sure

2170
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:27,020
everyone necessarily agreed with

2171
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:29,750
biological and there's you say a you say

2172
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:32,300
B you conclude C but I don't see that

2173
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:35,810
that the connection between them so

2174
01:41:32,300 --> 01:41:38,960
basically a clarification seem to be

2175
01:41:35,810 --> 01:41:41,420
asked for some of it was made does it

2176
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:44,390
work for people in in the illogical

2177
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:46,210
analysis of the document again a similar

2178
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:48,860
question that came up for us in

2179
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:51,610
Association for whom is a document being

2180
01:41:48,860 --> 01:41:54,980
written and does it achieve that purpose

2181
01:41:51,610 --> 01:41:56,450
that is not clear is it for the IETF I

2182
01:41:54,980 --> 01:41:59,480
think personally that is probably

2183
01:41:56,450 --> 01:42:01,400
broader than that but but to whom and

2184
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:05,419
does it achieve the purpose there's a

2185
01:42:01,400 --> 01:42:07,910
second page ah these were issues that

2186
01:42:05,420 --> 01:42:09,950
sort of were issues that weren't

2187
01:42:07,910 --> 01:42:13,340
necessarily in those perhaps they were

2188
01:42:09,950 --> 01:42:14,989
mine the abstract speaks of general

2189
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:18,200
agreement as opposed to an open

2190
01:42:14,989 --> 01:42:21,080
discussion I know every time I run into

2191
01:42:18,200 --> 01:42:24,620
general agreement at the beginning of a

2192
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:27,260
document I I sort of freeze up a little

2193
01:42:24,620 --> 01:42:29,210
and I wonder how we substantiate that

2194
01:42:27,260 --> 01:42:32,120
notion of general agreement and I

2195
01:42:29,210 --> 01:42:34,940
certainly haven't seen us get there yet

2196
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:37,330
on this one there's an inconsistent

2197
01:42:34,940 --> 01:42:41,000
referencing sometimes it's superb and

2198
01:42:37,330 --> 01:42:43,040
sometimes it seems a little short to me

2199
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:45,590
and and some more reference some more

2200
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:47,060
depth could go but I also must admit

2201
01:42:45,590 --> 01:42:49,250
that there was at least one reviewer

2202
01:42:47,060 --> 01:42:49,670
that said there's too much referencing

2203
01:42:49,250 --> 01:42:51,739
here

2204
01:42:49,670 --> 01:42:54,710
there's too many documents that I might

2205
01:42:51,739 --> 01:42:57,919
need to go off and read so how we find

2206
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:59,960
that balance is something they met there

2207
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:03,020
was a I'm looking for a reference on the

2208
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:05,210
term of affordance I went and did some

2209
01:43:03,020 --> 01:43:07,730
research on it but I think since

2210
01:43:05,210 --> 01:43:09,800
affordance was a critical term in this

2211
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:13,280
document it would probably be good for

2212
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:15,620
it to have one of the things that I

2213
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:18,230
haven't had a chance to check on and so

2214
01:43:15,620 --> 01:43:20,809
I'm asking are the terms that are used

2215
01:43:18,230 --> 01:43:23,209
in this document consistent with the

2216
01:43:20,810 --> 01:43:26,719
definitions that we've gotten 80 to 80

2217
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:28,989
and consistent with the terms and the

2218
01:43:26,719 --> 01:43:30,560
way they're being used in association

2219
01:43:28,989 --> 01:43:33,410
looking at this

2220
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:35,840
from a from a Shepard point of view from

2221
01:43:33,410 --> 01:43:37,599
a co chair point of view I'm kind of

2222
01:43:35,840 --> 01:43:41,180
looking to make sure that we've got

2223
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:43,970
consistent language across the documents

2224
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:46,610
that when we use a word in one document

2225
01:43:43,970 --> 01:43:49,010
we don't have a different definition for

2226
01:43:46,610 --> 01:43:50,809
it unless we've been explicit about

2227
01:43:49,010 --> 01:43:55,820
saying hey we're going to change the

2228
01:43:50,810 --> 01:43:57,950
definition here because it looked to me

2229
01:43:55,820 --> 01:44:00,590
like the definition that section five

2230
01:43:57,950 --> 01:44:03,860
the discussion was a little one-sided

2231
01:44:00,590 --> 01:44:06,410
and and and really didn't represent the

2232
01:44:03,860 --> 01:44:09,440
opposing views seemed more of an

2233
01:44:06,410 --> 01:44:12,170
assertion than a discussion now I'm not

2234
01:44:09,440 --> 01:44:15,500
trying to say here in this analysis that

2235
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:18,710
it must be a consensus what I'm saying

2236
01:44:15,500 --> 01:44:21,440
is that it is fine for it to have an

2237
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:24,080
assertion of this is the point of view

2238
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:26,599
and we've proved it against the opposing

2239
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:28,940
views here are the opposing views and

2240
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:30,950
this is why they did not prevail that

2241
01:44:28,940 --> 01:44:32,929
that kind of discussion that shows the

2242
01:44:30,950 --> 01:44:35,960
back-and-forth that's gone on between

2243
01:44:32,930 --> 01:44:36,590
various things and then there's lots of

2244
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:40,910
typos

2245
01:44:36,590 --> 01:44:44,500
so my view on it is there still is work

2246
01:44:40,910 --> 01:44:46,670
to be done before it went to a last call

2247
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,170
partially because of the issues that all

2248
01:44:46,670 --> 01:44:50,470
the other people have opened up and

2249
01:44:48,170 --> 01:44:54,800
partially because of the issues that

2250
01:44:50,470 --> 01:44:56,900
that I've personally outlined so first

2251
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,630
of all as I said I've been acting as the

2252
01:44:56,900 --> 01:45:02,210
shepherd on this one not that we really

2253
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:04,760
had this notion but certainly once it

2254
01:45:02,210 --> 01:45:07,940
went to research group last call and

2255
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:11,780
went to the IR s G it needs to be

2256
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:13,969
shepherded by someone and I've sort of

2257
01:45:11,780 --> 01:45:16,759
been putting myself into the place of

2258
01:45:13,970 --> 01:45:18,530
that but if there's a strong aversion to

2259
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:21,500
me being the shepherd on it because I

2260
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:22,700
may be too prejudiced in my opinions or

2261
01:45:21,500 --> 01:45:24,890
or what have you

2262
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:27,620
certainly we can work that out but at

2263
01:45:24,890 --> 01:45:29,570
the moment and unless there's a so I

2264
01:45:27,620 --> 01:45:32,300
view the doc as needing to provide a

2265
01:45:29,570 --> 01:45:34,549
strong basis for ongoing discussion and

2266
01:45:32,300 --> 01:45:37,880
future research that's one of the things

2267
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:39,890
that's sort of there but not explicitly

2268
01:45:37,880 --> 01:45:42,650
you can implicitly find it in the

2269
01:45:39,890 --> 01:45:43,860
document but but there isn't a clear in

2270
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:45,839
the conclusion

2271
01:45:43,860 --> 01:45:47,910
and this is how we move forward and this

2272
01:45:45,840 --> 01:45:50,210
is how it's useful and this is the

2273
01:45:47,910 --> 01:45:52,980
further research that can be done and

2274
01:45:50,210 --> 01:45:54,960
and here I'm coming into the topic from

2275
01:45:52,980 --> 01:45:58,799
yesterday's meeting and it's a topic for

2276
01:45:54,960 --> 01:46:03,030
later the word consensus I'm looking for

2277
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:06,030
consensus as we had on 80 to 80 that the

2278
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:08,250
document is clear for publication that

2279
01:46:06,030 --> 01:46:10,170
people look at it and say yeah I

2280
01:46:08,250 --> 01:46:14,490
disagree with it but my point is covered

2281
01:46:10,170 --> 01:46:18,210
fairly yeah III had a point there it was

2282
01:46:14,490 --> 01:46:21,240
discussed it was covered and not looking

2283
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:23,850
for consensus on it having a single view

2284
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:26,040
that everyone agrees to because I don't

2285
01:46:23,850 --> 01:46:28,350
think that that's actually possible but

2286
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:30,630
I do think it is possible to achieve a

2287
01:46:28,350 --> 01:46:32,370
document where everybody can say yeah

2288
01:46:30,630 --> 01:46:35,280
that's fair my point of view is

2289
01:46:32,370 --> 01:46:39,510
expressed in there I see it I'm I

2290
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:41,400
basically and looking for it not to be

2291
01:46:39,510 --> 01:46:45,200
something that someone could confuse

2292
01:46:41,400 --> 01:46:47,580
with a work of polemics or work of of

2293
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:50,730
arguing a point of view without having

2294
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:53,370
covered all the other points of view we

2295
01:46:50,730 --> 01:46:56,339
talked about adding an editor no one's

2296
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:58,500
come through to as a volunteer to work

2297
01:46:56,340 --> 01:47:01,020
with Niels yet I'm hoping that at least

2298
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:03,660
one of the people that had a lot to say

2299
01:47:01,020 --> 01:47:06,660
and did almost as much writing in

2300
01:47:03,660 --> 01:47:10,680
commenting as they might end up doing as

2301
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:12,930
a co-editor will actually volunteer we

2302
01:47:10,680 --> 01:47:16,110
had talked about replacing the editor I

2303
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:19,260
have no ideas on that I don't think it's

2304
01:47:16,110 --> 01:47:22,530
necessary if we can find someone to work

2305
01:47:19,260 --> 01:47:24,480
as a co-editor and I'll stop that I

2306
01:47:22,530 --> 01:47:27,030
think that was the last thing yep that

2307
01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:28,950
was the last thing I had I'll stop to

2308
01:47:27,030 --> 01:47:31,679
take comments I don't know if Niels has

2309
01:47:28,950 --> 01:47:34,170
a comment and I can't go on too long

2310
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:36,210
because we've got to get Grusha vods

2311
01:47:34,170 --> 01:47:39,930
document and even if we don't get the

2312
01:47:36,210 --> 01:47:43,290
rest of the discussion so is there a

2313
01:47:39,930 --> 01:47:46,230
comment for me or we can continue it on

2314
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,269
the list but yes I see two comments

2315
01:47:46,230 --> 01:47:50,639
coming we'll hold it those and then

2316
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:54,300
we'll go to gursha pod and the list note

2317
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:57,219
one comment two comments okay please

2318
01:47:54,300 --> 01:47:58,599
Audrey thank you very much for that

2319
01:47:57,219 --> 01:48:00,940
I think you covered the ground really

2320
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:05,440
well this is Elliott again if you go

2321
01:48:00,940 --> 01:48:07,598
back to your first issue slide yeah so I

2322
01:48:05,440 --> 01:48:10,119
think a great many of these are just a

2323
01:48:07,599 --> 01:48:13,199
matter really it's a matter of clarity

2324
01:48:10,119 --> 01:48:17,199
of purpose and clarity of argument that

2325
01:48:13,199 --> 01:48:19,409
that that had to be addressed and and

2326
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:23,919
that has always been my particular issue

2327
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:24,339
the point about let me help a little bit

2328
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:26,590
here

2329
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:28,840
the point about should access to the ITF

2330
01:48:26,590 --> 01:48:30,760
be included in the discussion it's not a

2331
01:48:28,840 --> 01:48:33,789
mandatory we had that discussion and I

2332
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,199
think you know people just agreed to

2333
01:48:33,789 --> 01:48:38,050
disagree and it's at the end of the day

2334
01:48:35,199 --> 01:48:40,598
you know that whatever the editor did it

2335
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:42,429
you one can cover it one cannot cover it

2336
01:48:40,599 --> 01:48:44,650
and one doesn't have to cover every

2337
01:48:42,429 --> 01:48:46,119
issue in every document so as the person

2338
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:47,940
who raised the issue I'm certainly happy

2339
01:48:46,119 --> 01:48:52,739
to see it fall off if that's where

2340
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:55,659
people want to go the issue around

2341
01:48:52,739 --> 01:48:56,919
consensus is one that I think it's

2342
01:48:55,659 --> 01:48:58,780
probably worth just a little bit of

2343
01:48:56,920 --> 01:49:03,639
discussion a little bit of further

2344
01:48:58,780 --> 01:49:07,869
discussion in as much as we are clear as

2345
01:49:03,639 --> 01:49:10,659
to what you know how the room felt about

2346
01:49:07,869 --> 01:49:12,639
the document in terms of is this did

2347
01:49:10,659 --> 01:49:14,710
everybody agree with the thing that was

2348
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,420
that were the result and if we say well

2349
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:19,090
not everybody agreed with the result of

2350
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:20,979
this document however here is the here's

2351
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:22,599
what we're producing as long as we're

2352
01:49:20,979 --> 01:49:25,119
clear in the dock in the front of the

2353
01:49:22,599 --> 01:49:27,159
document as to the position I think that

2354
01:49:25,119 --> 01:49:30,728
that's a perfectly fine way to go

2355
01:49:27,159 --> 01:49:33,129
forward and but but that having been

2356
01:49:30,729 --> 01:49:35,440
said I I do think there is unfortunately

2357
01:49:33,130 --> 01:49:38,289
the need for quite a bit of editing in

2358
01:49:35,440 --> 01:49:40,570
the process that could help I think just

2359
01:49:38,289 --> 01:49:42,009
improve the result and I'm I wish I had

2360
01:49:40,570 --> 01:49:45,249
the time to do the Ted to help there

2361
01:49:42,010 --> 01:49:47,800
myself but I do not okay you beat me to

2362
01:49:45,249 --> 01:49:49,840
my last question which was G after all

2363
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:51,309
that are you volunteering and then you

2364
01:49:49,840 --> 01:49:54,510
and then you beat me to it

2365
01:49:51,309 --> 01:49:59,380
my my fear you know I wish I could but I

2366
01:49:54,510 --> 01:50:01,139
gotcha yeah yeah no I used that you beat

2367
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:04,389
me to the question please

2368
01:50:01,139 --> 01:50:08,530
Ludwick relaying comments from Jabbar

2369
01:50:04,389 --> 01:50:10,000
from nll said thanks a lot for this

2370
01:50:08,530 --> 01:50:12,700
every

2371
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:15,580
is very useful for me the author editor

2372
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:17,710
of the document it would be great to

2373
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:20,620
have guidance from the Shepherd what we

2374
01:50:17,710 --> 01:50:23,170
have agreement on either approaches and

2375
01:50:20,620 --> 01:50:25,510
or arguments and what needs improvement

2376
01:50:23,170 --> 01:50:27,640
because sometimes it feels like we're

2377
01:50:25,510 --> 01:50:31,330
going back and forth could we perhaps

2378
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:34,060
make a Shepherd issue list may be taken

2379
01:50:31,330 --> 01:50:36,700
from this presentation and seek to

2380
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,500
address the issues one by one else I am

2381
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:40,599
afraid we will continue having great

2382
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:44,890
discussions but maybe not end up with

2383
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:47,170
the great final documents and I haven't

2384
01:50:44,890 --> 01:50:48,790
seen any discussion on replacing the

2385
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:51,100
editor on the list could you please

2386
01:50:48,790 --> 01:50:52,840
elaborate on that yeah the the

2387
01:50:51,100 --> 01:50:54,760
replacement for the editor was something

2388
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,520
that came up before our last meeting and

2389
01:50:54,760 --> 01:50:59,620
as I just wanted to continue carry it

2390
01:50:57,520 --> 01:51:01,960
for completeness to make it wasn't

2391
01:50:59,620 --> 01:51:03,880
discussed on the list I don't think that

2392
01:51:01,960 --> 01:51:06,850
we have the issue though I really would

2393
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:08,200
find like to find a co-editor and as

2394
01:51:06,850 --> 01:51:10,480
someone who's playing the role of

2395
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:12,970
Shepherd I don't want to become the

2396
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:15,669
co-editor because then the roles are are

2397
01:51:12,970 --> 01:51:18,280
confused and and so hopefully we can

2398
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:20,620
find one taking this and expanding the

2399
01:51:18,280 --> 01:51:22,809
list and perhaps pointing to some of the

2400
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:24,280
places in the email where these points

2401
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:27,070
are discussed sounds like a really good

2402
01:51:24,280 --> 01:51:30,429
idea and and I'll certainly undertake to

2403
01:51:27,070 --> 01:51:33,639
do that while I wave that while I'm

2404
01:51:30,430 --> 01:51:36,760
talking and and certainly undertake to

2405
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:39,250
do that so thank you and you know we'll

2406
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:41,110
keep working on it I don't want to

2407
01:51:39,250 --> 01:51:46,000
continue the back-and-forth I do want to

2408
01:51:41,110 --> 01:51:48,099
find a goal Thanks last person hi Colin

2409
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:51,340
Perkins thank you this I think this was

2410
01:51:48,100 --> 01:51:55,480
a nice summary of some of the issues on

2411
01:51:51,340 --> 01:51:56,980
your last slide you say you're you're

2412
01:51:55,480 --> 01:51:59,169
looking for consensus that the document

2413
01:51:56,980 --> 01:52:00,669
is a balanced expression of views even

2414
01:51:59,170 --> 01:52:03,730
if it continued to review that it's not

2415
01:52:00,670 --> 01:52:06,010
consensus I think a balanced expression

2416
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:09,959
of uses is a very good good thing to

2417
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:12,400
have in there I think a document which

2418
01:52:09,960 --> 01:52:14,740
concludes with a view there there is not

2419
01:52:12,400 --> 01:52:17,230
consensus on is perfectly reasonable

2420
01:52:14,740 --> 01:52:19,750
thing to do provided it is clear whose

2421
01:52:17,230 --> 01:52:21,459
view it is

2422
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:24,340
could you repeat the line have a

2423
01:52:21,460 --> 01:52:26,590
horrible time hearing on the acoustics

2424
01:52:24,340 --> 01:52:28,480
are terrible in these rooms I think a

2425
01:52:26,590 --> 01:52:30,490
document that concludes review on which

2426
01:52:28,480 --> 01:52:32,469
there is not consensus is a perfectly

2427
01:52:30,490 --> 01:52:35,800
reasonable thing provided it is clear

2428
01:52:32,470 --> 01:52:38,590
whose view it is making right and my

2429
01:52:35,800 --> 01:52:41,920
only point on that and it's a good time

2430
01:52:38,590 --> 01:52:45,430
that's all is that the group should see

2431
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:47,170
that statement and say yes we are fine

2432
01:52:45,430 --> 01:52:49,480
with that pub with publishing it and

2433
01:52:47,170 --> 01:52:52,810
that's what I mean by consensus to

2434
01:52:49,480 --> 01:52:54,669
publish without needing consensus on

2435
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:56,380
content yes and that's really the

2436
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:59,920
differentiation that I'm trying to make

2437
01:52:56,380 --> 01:53:01,930
yes and I absolutely agree with that I'm

2438
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,300
just saying you if it is not a consensus

2439
01:53:01,930 --> 01:53:08,020
product of the of the research group be

2440
01:53:04,300 --> 01:53:09,390
clear whose view it is expressing thank

2441
01:53:08,020 --> 01:53:12,280
you

2442
01:53:09,390 --> 01:53:16,570
that's good guidance I like guidance

2443
01:53:12,280 --> 01:53:18,340
okay so that's it on this one and we're

2444
01:53:16,570 --> 01:53:20,139
really running late I'd but but I don't

2445
01:53:18,340 --> 01:53:21,430
think there's anyone in here right after

2446
01:53:20,140 --> 01:53:25,000
us we're just messing with people's

2447
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:26,740
lunch so please to the next yep so crush

2448

upon it's up and also just a reminder if

2449
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:30,219
you've not yet signed the blue sheets

2450
01:53:28,300 --> 01:53:31,930
you still have time to do that and if

2451
01:53:30,220 --> 01:53:34,210

2452
01:53:31,930 --> 01:53:37,120
you just raise them up so others can

2453
01:53:34,210 --> 01:53:39,760
there's one and there's one yes so

2454
01:53:37,120 --> 01:53:43,440
please go sign this Thanks go ahead

2455
01:53:39,760 --> 01:53:43,440
Chris man you're in the same situation

2456
01:53:46,740 --> 01:53:57,040
hello yes so Neil's and I editing the

2457
01:53:52,330 --> 01:53:58,269
guylines document which is basically an

2458
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:03,970
update to the guidelines that were

2459
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:06,160
already there in RFC 82 80 and last time

2460
01:54:03,970 --> 01:54:08,250
we just discussed the changes that were

2461
01:54:06,160 --> 01:54:10,450
made from version two to three and

2462
01:54:08,250 --> 01:54:13,660
thanks to Joe and happy for reviews

2463
01:54:10,450 --> 01:54:16,980
which we've already addressed and there

2464
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:18,880
were some other updates there

2465
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:21,250
unfortunately we didn't find the time to

2466
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:23,020
update it before this meeting but a

2467
01:54:21,250 --> 01:54:27,970
significant update is in the work

2468
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:30,580
incoming which includes basically a

2469
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:33,500
rework of almost all the language in the

2470
01:54:30,580 --> 01:54:35,360
draft to be applicable to

2471
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:39,520
networking solutions generally and not

2472
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:42,860
just protocols in the classic sense and

2473
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:44,540
there are some places in the document

2474
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:47,030
where there is no explanation appended

2475
01:54:44,540 --> 01:54:52,820
to guidelines which we're working on now

2476
01:54:47,030 --> 01:54:55,639
and since the last meeting that has been

2477
01:54:52,820 --> 01:54:58,009
I I think one point of feedback - two

2478
01:54:55,640 --> 01:55:02,720
points of feedback - the draft one was

2479
01:54:58,010 --> 01:55:06,920
by Karen who said that the intended

2480
01:55:02,720 --> 01:55:11,240
document status which is on let's say

2481
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:13,990
ITF documents it it has an impact on how

2482
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:16,969
much adoption the draft has or how much

2483
01:55:13,990 --> 01:55:20,690
impact it would make and this was for

2484
01:55:16,970 --> 01:55:21,470
learning from DNS operations draft that

2485
01:55:20,690 --> 01:55:25,070
current child

2486
01:55:21,470 --> 01:55:29,240
so these three changes are coming up in

2487
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:30,889
the next version and this one question

2488
01:55:29,240 --> 01:55:32,540
perhaps which we can discuss today

2489
01:55:30,890 --> 01:55:36,740
quickly which was brought up by John

2490
01:55:32,540 --> 01:55:40,090
Curran in the list that the right to

2491
01:55:36,740 --> 01:55:42,410
legal remedy is also a human right and

2492
01:55:40,090 --> 01:55:47,960
what we haven't discussed in the draft

2493
01:55:42,410 --> 01:55:50,660
and now is attribution and therefore how

2494
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:53,030
protocols can enable attribution and so

2495
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:56,900
individuals who have grievances can seek

2496
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:59,090
legal remedy and get and I mean

2497
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:02,990
attribution would basically help you law

2498
01:55:59,090 --> 01:56:05,720
enforcement track who created a certain

2499
01:56:02,990 --> 01:56:08,690
piece of content I assume and obviously

2500
01:56:05,720 --> 01:56:11,030
this has a conflict with anonymity and

2501
01:56:08,690 --> 01:56:14,389
privacy which is already discussed

2502
01:56:11,030 --> 01:56:16,910
extensively in the draft i I didn't

2503
01:56:14,390 --> 01:56:22,520
sense consensus on the inclusion of this

2504
01:56:16,910 --> 01:56:24,830
in at least on the mailing list there

2505
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:26,930
was some discussion about negative

2506
01:56:24,830 --> 01:56:29,870
rights and positive rights that the the

2507
01:56:26,930 --> 01:56:31,790
state not only has an obligation to not

2508
01:56:29,870 --> 01:56:34,180
infringe on rights like privacy and

2509
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:37,490
freedom of expression but it also has a

2510
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:40,790
positive obligation to enable that the

2511
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:43,460
right to legal remedy is enable and that

2512
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:46,630
is somewhat in favor of including

2513
01:56:43,460 --> 01:56:49,719
a statement on attribution

2514
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:52,270
and like my personal thoughts on this

2515
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:55,739
are that if you look at the MLS group

2516
01:56:52,270 --> 01:56:59,290
for example or the OTR protocol where

2517
01:56:55,739 --> 01:57:02,080
deniability which is the diametrically

2518
01:56:59,290 --> 01:57:04,449
opposite to attribution is a legitimate

2519
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:09,100
goal that is pursued for anonymity and

2520
01:57:04,449 --> 01:57:11,169
privacy so if you have any thoughts on

2521
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,929
this topic on how to address this in the

2522
01:57:11,170 --> 01:57:14,920
draft and how to include it happy to

2523
01:57:13,929 --> 01:57:19,960
listen to that

2524
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:23,469
otherwise I will let bring the topic up

2525
01:57:19,960 --> 01:57:25,750
back in the list and yes if you have any

2526
01:57:23,469 --> 01:57:27,699
other suggestions to the draft as always

2527
01:57:25,750 --> 01:57:30,340
and if you're using the guidelines to

2528
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:32,019
review documents very happy to

2529
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:33,030
incorporate your feedback into this

2530
01:57:32,020 --> 01:57:35,530
draft

2531
01:57:33,030 --> 01:57:38,099
thank you grocery bot I just want to

2532
01:57:35,530 --> 01:57:41,650
support teasing out some of those

2533
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:43,540
tensions because that is how that is

2534
01:57:41,650 --> 01:57:45,489
really accurate in the in the framework

2535
01:57:43,540 --> 01:57:47,800
of human rights is that sometimes there

2536
01:57:45,489 --> 01:57:49,750
are conflicts and there are nuanced and

2537
01:57:47,800 --> 01:57:51,750
that's the whole point so I think the

2538
01:57:49,750 --> 01:57:53,949
document can only be made stronger by

2539
01:57:51,750 --> 01:57:55,929
identifying where those tensions exist

2540
01:57:53,949 --> 01:57:58,839
and actually trying to learn a bit more

2541
01:57:55,929 --> 01:58:02,050
about them in the context of protocol

2542
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:03,699
and standards development but I do think

2543
01:58:02,050 --> 01:58:05,469
the best way forward is just to bring

2544
01:58:03,699 --> 01:58:07,989
this up in the list and point people to

2545
01:58:05,469 --> 01:58:11,260
the exact places where you might find

2546
01:58:07,989 --> 01:58:14,620
some additional tensions yes I would say

2547
01:58:11,260 --> 01:58:16,929
the problem in but not exactly a problem

2548
01:58:14,620 --> 01:58:22,059
the way the document is structured is in

2549
01:58:16,929 --> 01:58:24,639
terms of questions right and while while

2550
01:58:22,060 --> 01:58:26,260
there is a lot of theory on how human

2551
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,730
rights would interact and are in

2552
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:29,860
conflict with each other in in a

2553
01:58:27,730 --> 01:58:32,440
questionnaire sort of format it seems

2554
01:58:29,860 --> 01:58:37,599
like oh if I take this then this is a

2555
01:58:32,440 --> 01:58:40,570
cross and perhaps we can then include a

2556
01:58:37,600 --> 01:58:42,880
statement that you know this is just use

2557
01:58:40,570 --> 01:58:45,159
it as an indication of what you want to

2558
01:58:42,880 --> 01:58:47,320
achieve rather then yeah well I just

2559
01:58:45,159 --> 01:58:51,190
think because it's guidelines right like

2560
01:58:47,320 --> 01:58:53,739
if you're doing a similar thing for in a

2561
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:55,509
legal policy space you really want to

2562
01:58:53,739 --> 01:58:57,190
focus on those in a lot of ways because

2563
01:58:55,510 --> 01:58:58,960
that's where you can influence people

2564
01:58:57,190 --> 01:59:00,339
making difficult decisions when it

2565
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:01,960
matters so maybe

2566
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:03,460
if we have enough of these maybe it's

2567
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,800
not just this case but there are a

2568
01:59:03,460 --> 01:59:07,330
couple of other tensions we can maybe

2569
01:59:05,800 --> 01:59:10,060
start to collect them in a separate

2570
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:12,430
section that is like you know sticky

2571
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:14,260
issues or particularly interesting

2572
01:59:12,430 --> 01:59:17,380
things to pay attention to I actually

2573
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:25,270
love to see a draft on this I mean I I

2574
01:59:17,380 --> 01:59:29,770
am I think it's a not that we have any

2575
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:33,730
time but anyone have a oh you have open

2576
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:37,120
questions and okay so yeah so please you

2577
01:59:33,730 --> 01:59:40,059
know review that draft and especially if

2578
01:59:37,120 --> 01:59:42,970
you are using it somewhere please please

2579
01:59:40,060 --> 01:59:44,590
contribute the last topic we're not

2580
01:59:42,970 --> 01:59:47,110
gonna get to I'll take it back to the

2581
01:59:44,590 --> 01:59:50,140
list it was why do we insist on acting

2582
01:59:47,110 --> 01:59:53,500
like an IETF group when we don't have to

2583
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:55,150
and and and all I could say is that was

2584
01:59:53,500 --> 01:59:57,670
the method we decided to use at the

2585
01:59:55,150 --> 01:59:59,110
beginning it was a notion of gee let's

2586
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:01,480
use a method that we're all comfortable

2587
01:59:59,110 --> 02:00:05,200
with and and and let's see it the same

2588
02:00:01,480 --> 02:00:08,169
dog food as everyone else around us but

2589
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:11,470
more than willing to change if we have a

2590
02:00:08,170 --> 02:00:14,650
good reason to change I know we don't

2591
02:00:11,470 --> 02:00:16,450
have to operate like an IETF working

2592
02:00:14,650 --> 02:00:20,879
group but that doesn't mean that we

2593
02:00:16,450 --> 02:00:24,970
can't and and and so I'll stop there

2594
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:26,920
because it's time and they don't see

2595
02:00:24,970 --> 02:00:29,680
anybody running frantically for the

2596
02:00:26,920 --> 02:00:34,900
microphone but I do want to keep

2597
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:36,250
carrying it on on the on the list I mean

2598
02:00:34,900 --> 02:00:37,750
I just had one comment on that while we

2599
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:40,000
were talking today is I don't think all

2600
02:00:37,750 --> 02:00:42,130
of our drafts are necessarily the same I

2601
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:43,660
think that based on our Charter we have

2602
02:00:42,130 --> 02:00:46,420
some really specific ones that we're

2603
02:00:43,660 --> 02:00:48,700
trying super super hard to like a draft

2604
02:00:46,420 --> 02:00:50,740
Association you can imagine one on

2605
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:52,150
freedom of expression because those are

2606
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:54,099
specifically mentioned in our charter

2607
02:00:52,150 --> 02:00:57,009
where as political I feel like isn't

2608
02:00:54,100 --> 02:00:59,740
necessarily like a core one as an

2609
02:00:57,010 --> 02:01:01,960
example right and maybe is even more

2610
02:00:59,740 --> 02:01:03,400
like the the way that what the draft is

2611
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:04,750
trying to achieve is even better suited

2612
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:06,940
for it being an opinion because

2613
02:01:04,750 --> 02:01:08,200
otherwise it's it's everyone's an

2614
02:01:06,940 --> 02:01:10,210
opinion and then of it therefore says

2615
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:11,950
nothing but so just to think about the

2616
02:01:10,210 --> 02:01:13,170
nuance of that it's a case-by-case basis

2617
02:01:11,950 --> 02:01:16,769
as well no

2618
02:01:13,170 --> 02:01:19,890
in fact as I said if anybody ever wants

2619
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:23,670
to write an article for a journal that

2620
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:25,260
is not in the RFC status then we could

2621
02:01:23,670 --> 02:01:28,320
find a completely different method of

2622
02:01:25,260 --> 02:01:30,600
working it so anyhow I still see nobody

2623
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:32,490
running frantically we are over time

2624
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:34,920
thank you very much

2625
02:01:32,490 --> 02:01:39,139
please be active on the list thank you

2626
02:01:34,920 --> 02:01:50,600
to Jabbar thank you to note-taker and um

2627
02:01:39,140 --> 02:01:53,659
talk to you I see one

2628
02:01:50,600 --> 02:01:53,659
