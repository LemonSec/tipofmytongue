1
00:00:52,360 --> 00:01:00,449
welcome to one of the two routing area

2
00:00:56,170 --> 00:01:03,610
working group sessions here in Singapore

3
00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:06,479
we'll get started in a moment when

4
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:09,220
everyone kind of sits down and people

5
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,460
come on in

6
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:18,940
so I'm Chris Bowers this is Jeff tonzura

7
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:22,179
and jingxian is down there

8
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,130
she's our secretary and she'll be one of

9
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:26,590
the note takers and she's also been

10
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:31,679
doing a great job keeping a lot of the

11
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:36,850
logistics running for the working group

12
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:40,869
so probably you've seen the note well by

13
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:43,149
this point things that you say while

14
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:45,700
participating the working group have

15
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:48,399
certain consequences so please pay

16
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:53,310
attention to to be note well and read it

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:57,069
well if you haven't already so there's a

18
00:01:53,310 --> 00:02:00,250
sort of generic IETF policy about our IP

19
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:02,319
our disclosure the routing area working

20
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,099
group interpretation of that that

21
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:08,800
process so that we you know we got all

22
00:02:06,099 --> 00:02:11,620
of our eyes and cross our T's is to

23
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,510
require that document authors and

24
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,090
contributors state whether or not

25
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:19,599
they're aware of any IP are relevant to

26
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,750
the document in question that you know

27
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,980
it also others should generally do it as

28
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,739
well if you're participating in the

29
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:29,200
working group in any in any fashion and

30
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:32,349
we do it at two stages in the working

31
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,429
group document process both when

32
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:40,660
adopting individual dress and then

33
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,770
before working group last call so we

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,290
have

35
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:48,200
engine doing the note-taking do we have

36
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,519
a jabber scribe okay you're on jabber so

37
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,769
that's good the blue sheets are already

38
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:58,580
circulating that's good

39
00:02:54,770 --> 00:03:09,770
I'm gonna switch over to the agenda this

40
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:12,740
one so it's traditional for people to

41
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:15,320
have an opportunity to get feedback on

42
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:18,800
the agenda this is the agenda that we

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:23,120
have published for today we also have

44
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,520
another session on Friday that we can

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,370
you know if there any issues with this

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:35,480
agenda we can generally catch up on the

47
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:41,510
second session so moving back go on to

48
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:44,780
the whoops yes I'm gonna go through a

49
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,000
review of the working group document

50
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:53,200
status

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,200
we had no RFC's published since IETF 105

52
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,990
documents that have already been

53
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,030
submitted to the iesg for publication

54
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:03,200
have changed state a little bit but

55
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:08,990
they're sort of winding their way

56
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:13,310
through the process this document has

57
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,780
been on you know in this state for quite

58
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:18,380
a long time so I think Jeff is going to

59
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:22,310
comment on this so we've decided to

60
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:24,320
change the Shepherd and engine thank you

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:27,310
agree to the Shepherd's of you and

62
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,310
little progress has dropped

63
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:40,820
we recently adopted the Q s model draft

64
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,760
as a working group document there are

65
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:46,610
several this is a list of all the

66
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:49,210
existing working group documents several

67
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,810
of them the ones listed at the top the

68
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:56,390
draft that's published has expired it

69
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,970
would be a good idea to we have an

70
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:01,130
update from the first I think the editor

71
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,230
of the first draft the tlf a draft would

72
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:06,409
you like to address this yeah

73
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:10,100
so defendant of ski speaking for a draft

74
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,810
I'm currently working on it I just need

75
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:14,510
more time to work on V data pen

76
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:16,850
procedures which requires a lot of text

77
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:19,039
review but some changes are already done

78
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,640
but is that a print part is our will

79
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,780
take more time sorry for that okay well

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,780
thank you thank you

81
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:34,670
the ATN bgp draft is expired it would be

82
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,310
good to just keep it current even if

83
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:39,590
there aren't substantive changes just to

84
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,090
keep it top of mind the the data tracker

85
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:47,989
now is a way to show expired drafts as

86
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:52,669
well so I'm showing these but it would

87
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:57,740
be good to you know not require that so

88
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:59,750
the VRP PFD point-to-point draft I sent

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,330
out an email to the authors of that and

90
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,730
requesting that they at a minimum do

91
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:08,690
just a bear update with some sort of

92
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,630
administrative changes on that you know

93
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:16,100
it would be good to get an understanding

94
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:19,070
with respect to that draft about if

95
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,960
anyone's implementing it and that kind

96
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:22,849
of you know when we look at it and see

97
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,400
it's expired what does that mean exactly

98
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:27,290
does it mean that it's stable and no one

99
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,030
you know or does it mean that no one's

100
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,090
implementing it so it would be good to

101
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:36,919
in terms of figuring out how we proceed

102
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:39,320
to get that feedback but first off

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:41,030
please just update

104
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:45,469
the draft so that the administrative

105
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:50,950
issue can be dealt with the desk source

106
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:54,230
routing draft is also showing expired I

107
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,860
guess David had asked about adopting

108
00:06:54,230 --> 00:07:01,550
that we should probably start a

109
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:02,780
discussion about adopting or rather not

110
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,880
adopting but doing working good last

111
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:10,070
call for that draft it's been in its

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:14,480
current state for probably a year and a

113
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:16,400
half or so so the other drafts here I

114
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:22,250
think the first two we're going to hear

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:25,039
about and I don't think we have

116
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:30,050
presentations on the other ones okay

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:33,580
okay so our family require - changes and

118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:37,250
we plan to last college after this ATF

119
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:41,120
policy model I assume the same engine

120
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,850
the main author that we discussed it we

121
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:52,390
plan to La Scala between this and next

122
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:59,900
state here speaking for post the

123
00:07:52,390 --> 00:08:03,200
extension model Andy for both the RHIB

124
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,620
extension model and policy model besides

125
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:08,960
they've over 180 more than my IETF I

126
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:21,449
think we are gonna last car after this

127
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:40,110
idea okay so I think

128
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:47,250
first up is Linda well so maybe they're

129
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:58,500
gonna adjust it once someone's there am

130
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:59,389
i good afternoon can you hear me okay

131
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:03,209
good

132
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:07,079
okay give an update and this is my third

133
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:09,750
time doing this update I hope I won't

134
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,540
fall into those well those expired draft

135
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:14,510
and give up but anyway thank you for the

136
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:18,300
comment and I made changes to this

137
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:22,290
presentation so so I'll give the update

138
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:26,149
on since I get 105 on the network -

139
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:29,969
cloud problem statement and gap analysis

140
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,250
so the purpose of the document I got

141
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:34,019
quite a few comments while reach out to

142
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,240
people hey can you give some comments on

143
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,149
this draft I got some comments people

144
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,540
say why describe lots of problems and

145
00:09:39,149 --> 00:09:46,620
what are theirs for it's not really for

146
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:50,189
educational purposes right so I want to

147
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:52,490
make clear to people that there are lots

148
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,579
and lots of problems associated with

149
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:59,670
cloud interconnection and some of the

150
00:09:56,579 --> 00:10:03,870
problems not something I think we think

151
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:06,209
IETF can do so this draft in particular

152
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:08,579
is really to identify some of the

153
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:11,790
problems on the network problems or

154
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:16,469
network in cloud interconnection and to

155
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:20,519
see that if there's anything our idea

156
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:22,310
can do or maybe I can already have so

157
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:30,750
that was the purpose of this

158
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:34,890
documentation make it clear so since

159
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:38,100
IETF 105 it was pointed to us that

160
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:44,520
we need to include a scenario of inter

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:46,920
cloud connection so okay ultimately this

162
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,920
is a benefit I think that it's bigger

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:55,530
now so there's a temporary setback but

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:59,150
okay so the oh the cloud public cloud

165
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:02,850
data center today is primarily between

166
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:05,090
client to the cloud okay you can have

167
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:11,400
different ways to access the cloud and

168
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:15,180
however if you have some workload in AWS

169
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:18,180
if you want to connect you as your you

170
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,880
pretty much have to helping back to your

171
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,930
customer gateway to interconnect them

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:28,370
together so the scope of this document

173
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:31,949
we call network to cloud is really to

174
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:36,150
address the net network perspective to

175
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:42,330
interconnect them how do we manage like

176
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:45,959
be PC from one cloud to v-net in another

177
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:49,440
cloud and maybe like Oracle may have a

178
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:52,350
different way to identify their the the

179
00:11:49,440 --> 00:12:02,840
private network and how they use

180
00:11:52,350 --> 00:12:06,980
different net ok so here's just a brief

181
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,480
summary of what's added we added

182
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:11,820
interconnect hybrid cloud the problems

183
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,960
associate with them we also add a

184
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,870
section to talk about some

185
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:21,480
characteristics of application hosting

186
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:25,100
the cloud the connecting to them well

187
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,630
the thing is like we know the network

188
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:29,910
augmentation it's not just one that were

189
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:32,189
connecting to the cloud and lots of

190
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:34,110
times multiple ways and you may have

191
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,260
networks stitched together

192
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,850
or you may have network magic multiplex

193
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:41,160
together

194
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,970
another thing is application based

195
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:48,120
policy those policies can change based

196
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,260
on where the application is so it's

197
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,360
basic

198
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,000
away from the traditional we have a

199
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,240
firewall with defying our access list or

200
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,340
our security policies on the specific

201
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:05,340
appliances and when you have application

202
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:07,290
in the cloud the the policies actually

203
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,410
move with the application you have to

204
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:13,170
have a way to specify those policies are

205
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:15,540
specifically for those applications when

206
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:17,790
application moved from this location to

207
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,370
another location the policy has to

208
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,959
follow them basically that's another

209
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:25,770
difference from the traditional

210
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:28,620
networking and third part is application

211
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:32,160
based forwarding instead of destination

212
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,650
based forwarding in the network for so

213
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,890
many decades has been always using

214
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:40,380
destination as the way to forward but

215
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:43,699
many of the application today is really

216
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:46,350
using application ID to forward and

217
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:50,280
different application many different

218
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,770
topologies so that's one some of the key

219
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:55,130
characteristics of connecting to cloud

220
00:13:52,770 --> 00:14:02,970
which is different from traditional

221
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:06,180
networking at a slide this is actually

222
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:11,610
primarily from earlier suggestion the

223
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:14,209
key requirement so for accessing the

224
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:17,400
cloud while the key thing is

225
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:20,640
authentication authorization right so

226
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,699
you could have a particular application

227
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:25,860
in the cloud and then depending on who's

228
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:28,860
accessing it you have different policy

229
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:32,490
right or you can have policies on this

230
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,810
cloud application saying hey if the

231
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:38,970
traffic requests from the prams

232
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:43,290
headquarter data center coming the

233
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:46,890
request you can grant the communication

234
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:50,000
or processing but if the request traffic

235
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:52,770
coming from a sure data center then you

236
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,670
don't have any communication you drop it

237
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:58,680
all you may report or maybe the policy

238
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,420
is changing like for example from a

239
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,400
certain time to a certain time you have

240
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:06,240
different authentication method

241
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,910
and then when you have our to cloud data

242
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,070
center when one application need to

243
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,930
connect to another cap application how

244
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:15,240
do you do the authentication how do you

245
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:19,160
do the authorization so that's a big

246
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:25,160
thing about intercloud communication

247
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:30,000
second part is in the cloud access one

248
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:30,480
Enterprise can create multiple B pcs

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,180
right

250
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,910
like for example a big corporation you

251
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:38,099
may have a PPC for your testing

252
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,560
environment you may have a VP C for your

253
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,390
production environment and you could

254
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,359
have the same application running in

255
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:48,449
different B pcs but when the traffic

256
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,010
actually coming from this data center or

257
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:55,830
cloud data's in a to your campus network

258
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:58,140
lots of time you can now tell which VP

259
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:00,720
see it's coming from you have an address

260
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:04,910
it doesn't attach with the PPC number

261
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,730
and similarly you have ensures v-net

262
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:11,010
similar thing the v-net and vp c how do

263
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,700
I make sure that they actually belong to

264
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:17,390
the same client or same domain so you

265
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:20,490
may have a subnet like we call subnet

266
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:22,290
belong to one particular group but when

267
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:25,080
you assign something put something into

268
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,060
the EWS they have a VP see you put

269
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:30,210
something else in to the assure you have

270
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:32,280
v-net how do we combine them as well and

271
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,780
entity to show they can actually

272
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,620
communicate with each other

273
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:40,860
so thus something has to be addressed

274
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:44,370
and that's another thing is about API

275
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,530
right but this API actually I'm not sure

276
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:49,350
if I can do anything about it

277
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:51,480
it's basically different cloud

278
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:55,620
datacenter have different api's to

279
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:58,880
create their workload to to do assign

280
00:16:55,620 --> 00:17:04,109
that to do all kinds of functions and

281
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:08,160
many many of the enterprises today they

282
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,859
all want need consistent API so they can

283
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,209
move from one place to another place

284
00:17:09,859 --> 00:17:14,069
still where you have questions so maybe

285
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:15,300
I don't understand what you're proposing

286
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:17,490
Linda but

287
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:20,339
we keep talking about preparers

288
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,260
proprietary cloud designs which are of

289
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:24,419
course entirely within the scope of the

290
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,160
provider to define and modify the api's

291
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:31,440
as they want we don't normally sort of

292
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,250
do interfaces between proprietary

293
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,840
systems we only really ever design

294
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:39,240
standard solutions so you could have a

295
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,149
sort of a shim layer that we define that

296
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,310
they have to map to but I don't think we

297
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:47,070
should be talking about mapping between

298
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:48,990
proprietary systems I'm not proposing

299
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:52,770
that I'm just saying this some of the

300
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:55,440
problems appearing and this may be out

301
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,540
of the scope of IETF I just put it there

302
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,760
this is one of the problems facing by

303
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:01,470
many enterprises when they access

304
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,840
multiple clouds that's all I'm doing

305
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:05,790
here I don't think that's something we

306
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,000
need to address that's my personal deal

307
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:12,389
okay that wasn't coming out coming it

308
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,060
wasn't very clear okay okay and another

309
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,890
problem requirement is the neck how do

310
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:19,530
they do the net different cloud provider

311
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,570
has different methods and how does the

312
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:27,120
network handling different net methods

313
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:29,970
and DNS and also that is any way to like

314
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,610
discover how many cloud data centers

315
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:35,160
this particular application is connected

316
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:41,280
to right those are some of the key

317
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:45,060
requirements for the multi cloud for the

318
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,879
key problems that's the focus of this

319
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:51,510
particular document is really to address

320
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:56,910
some of the problems Enterprise facing

321
00:18:51,510 --> 00:19:00,840
to connect to the multiple cloud so so

322
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:03,270
the with different cloud is basically

323
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:09,530
like we have different access methods

324
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:14,270
right so I I'm repeating myself so that

325
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:16,980
today you have to here ping back to the

326
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:20,570
campus network before you can reach to

327
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:27,480
another cloud make it very difficult

328
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:31,530
second thing is as a application self

329
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,110
hiding inside the cloud it's because the

330
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:35,790
cloud allowed different ways of access

331
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,479
right you can access through public

332
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,330
Internet

333
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,550
you can access from IP sack you can

334
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:44,520
access from the direct gateway they were

335
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:47,340
connect and as application themselves

336
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,910
residing inside the cloud they can now

337
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:53,429
tell which which entrance which gateway

338
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,210
comes in that's how it today's design

339
00:19:53,430 --> 00:20:01,350
and with that it's difficult to make a

340
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:04,800
consistent like performance measurement

341
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:07,679
or maybe applying different policy

342
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:10,290
depending on which entrance you coming

343
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:13,680
if you comes in from IP said maybe I

344
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:15,780
should have one way one set of security

345
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,180
functions if you come from direct

346
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:20,940
connect maybe I should have another set

347
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,520
of security functions if you come from

348
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:26,340
the internet maybe I should add more of

349
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:34,470
DDoS attack right there could be many

350
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:40,020
DDoS attack coming and another thing is

351
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:43,560
the the IP set itself right so Abby set

352
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,680
itself IP set is point-to-point right so

353
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,450
point-to-point works well when you get

354
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,730
just have two points when you do the

355
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:54,330
configuration you configure who are you

356
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:57,810
who is your remote end and but the

357
00:20:54,330 --> 00:21:00,990
problem is when you have multiple sites

358
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:03,179
when you have ten twenty sites and this

359
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:05,850
configuration becomes very difficult and

360
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:08,850
especially you we have two different

361
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:15,719
cloud data centers using a preset

362
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:17,669
becomes not not easily to manageable so

363
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,800
even though the ensure today allow you

364
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,700
to I think it appears at a recent

365
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,950
announcement to support Ikey v2 so that

366
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,490
allow them to be automatically exchange

367
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:34,680
the key is to allow automatic creation

368
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:37,830
of the IPSec so another problem with

369
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,530
them I'm POS like many enterprises today

370
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,879
use npos and

371
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:47,460
but MPLS network is fixed and it's not

372
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,100
easily to be extended reading into the

373
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:52,770
card so for whatever access you have

374
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,110
today to access your workload in the

375
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:57,660
cloud you have to do some kind of

376
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:59,929
stitching so that bring up another issue

377
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:03,300
of how do you do the end-to-end

378
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:05,460
performance measurement and what kind of

379
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:07,680
measurement you need to attach what kind

380
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:11,730
of metadata you need to attach for

381
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:16,170
example if your enterprise here residing

382
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,940
inside your on-prem data center when you

383
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:20,460
have traffic coming in from different

384
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:23,760
cloud what kind of metadata you can

385
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:26,550
carry within your packet so that when

386
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,310
you arrive into your unprimed data that

387
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:32,370
you can tell immediately which location

388
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,290
come from which VPC it comes from which

389
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,870
v-net it comes from with those

390
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:40,170
information coming attached in the

391
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:43,739
metadata you will be able to do

392
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:45,510
appropriate actions and not advocating

393
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,440
particular solution or anything but

394
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:52,980
there's just some examples or ITTF work

395
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:56,030
like metadata in SFC can be applied to

396
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,030
this kind of situation

397
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:09,090
well the gabilan analysis I just added

398
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,060
this in the past we've been talking

399
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:15,419
about using tunneling cap to carry the

400
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:19,350
IPSec information to carry the net

401
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:22,880
information that is in ID are they

402
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:26,010
already there already a document

403
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:29,190
proposal on how to do that and in the

404
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:33,000
best we have a informational draft

405
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:37,320
showing how do we use PGP to be able to

406
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,330
distribute the IPSec information to

407
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:41,330
establish those tunnels

408
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:48,479
but one thing hasn't been addressed is

409
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,020
this application base boarding in this

410
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,390
example is showing that I have those

411
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,060
nodes like for example

412
00:23:54,390 --> 00:24:00,630
a payment system they can only talk to

413
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:04,409
the payment gateway in a particular

414
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:07,610
location in their headquarter and then

415
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:09,630
other applications can communicate

416
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:14,040
point-to-point is a multi-point

417
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:17,880
connection and if those applications

418
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,889
have different address then this can be

419
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:24,180
achieved very easily with the routing

420
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:28,290
protocols we have developed it could

421
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:32,400
happen that the application ID like this

422
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:35,820
read application payment system and some

423
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:38,550
other application from the same user may

424
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,590
have the same address and this can

425
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:43,230
create some problems how do we

426
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:46,290
distribute that information because the

427
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:48,480
application read has to only follow the

428
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:51,420
point-to-point topology the tree

429
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,580
topology to the payment gateway they

430
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,670
don't allow the read application to talk

431
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:58,830
among each other the purple one is

432
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:02,490
another type of application which is

433
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,889
allowed to be multi-point so one address

434
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:07,530
has to be put on into two different

435
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,020
topologies I think that's something I'm

436
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,940
not sure if ITF has anything or not I'm

437
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,900
putting here on the table and then we

438
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:18,360
have lots of experts in this room and

439
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:21,210
solicited an input if you have any good

440
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:23,399
suggestions hey this is something I have

441
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:26,660
already done that'd be great and would

442
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:35,490
love to document that into that into

443
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:40,770
this document another thing is the IPSec

444
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:43,500
today is among the client traffic you

445
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:47,720
create a client traffic and you create

446
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:51,600
IPSec tunnel among those clients that is

447
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:55,080
well between if you just have two nodes

448
00:25:51,600 --> 00:26:00,480
but if you have multiple nodes and it

449
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:02,610
can be difficult so so that it would be

450
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:05,430
good to be able to create some kind of

451
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:08,179
port days IPSec tunnel so treating the

452
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:10,540
IPSec tunnel as a transport PI

453
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:14,180
so that different traffic can be

454
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,700
multiplexed together or be forwarded all

455
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:20,300
those notes along along the way less CPU

456
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:24,560
one on CPU can be the one as a forwarder

457
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,980
I almost like creating a vif over this

458
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:36,379
untrusted Network so that's something

459
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:40,670
it's not yet there yet so next step so

460
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:43,610
one more review I promise chair that I

461
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,380
know that people are very tight on time

462
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,399
you don't have many times much time to

463
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,740
do

464
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,290
everybody has lots of work I promise

465
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,840
I'll write a very simple document just

466
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:56,389
along the line I present today maybe one

467
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,510
page two page take you maybe five

468
00:26:56,390 --> 00:27:04,240
minutes to review it to see if those

469
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:09,560
problems have been properly identified

470
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:12,350
yes women Rick's Enochian I know that I

471
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,970
have to start but in my view your this

472
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,070
document is all over the place in my

473
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:18,050
view right because your started with

474
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:19,730
saying I problem statement for net to

475
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,800
cloud but you're mixing as the one

476
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,200
problem statement with net to cloud

477
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:27,590
problem statement and I think you have

478
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,320
to contain to a specific space you want

479
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:33,139
to address and either it's cloud or it's

480
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,879
as the one and but right now you're

481
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:37,250
mixing it all over the place and as a

482
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,020
result I think you're putting too many

483
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:41,240
things into it and as a result it

484
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,590
becomes unreadable and people probably

485
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,500
get lost with it right that's my

486
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:47,419
personal view so my my question is

487
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:50,270
should you focus on cloud

488
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:52,700
interconnection and I think then that's

489
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:55,250
one option or you should focus on as the

490
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,170
one problem statements into working with

491
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:59,510
clout or something but right now from

492
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:01,640
reading the document personally I don't

493
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:04,340
see where you want to go here alright

494
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,680
that's a very good suggestions we're

495
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,350
going to focus on the net to cloud for

496
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:11,750
the cloud interconnection so I'll take

497
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:14,600
out all the sd1 mentioning we're

498
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,940
focusing on primarily we use network to

499
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:19,669
connect to different cloud or multiple

500
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,860
clouds what are the problems we have

501
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:24,260
today what are the possible

502
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,449
solution there could be IT have already

503
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,730
had because I think then I if that's the

504
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:30,260
states then I would say focus on to

505
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,260
requirement because you have internet

506
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,420
facing use cases which are like sauce

507
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:38,600
internet focused and there is private

508
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:41,570
VPN use cases ok I think my suggestion

509
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,030
would be to focus on these two areas ok

510
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:45,678
and and and contain it like that because

511
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:47,780
otherwise we are you're mixing things

512
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,330
all over the place and as a result it

513
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,730
becomes much more clear what what is

514
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:53,659
there and what needs to be done for

515
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:56,030
those type of things

516
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,610
thank you very much so the note taker

517
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,168
please write that no sir that's very

518
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:07,790
helpful suggestions

519
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:09,320
definitely any other comments ok so if

520
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:11,418
you feel that this demand work is

521
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,520
valuable but lower growth he could spin

522
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:17,630
out another draft and just postpone the

523
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,280
work till the first one is resolved if

524
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,230
put quite some effort into it would be

525
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,149
too bad just to delete it okay so you're

526
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:25,370
saying like separate the work like it's

527
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:27,740
up to you to your work ok so what I

528
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:30,290
would do is create a very short draft

529
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,169
just to describe the problems with

530
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:35,149
network to cloud and then associate

531
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,120
problems I want people to give input

532
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:41,540
just for that specific domain not not

533
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:44,178
worrying about sty oh and he was just

534
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,950
talking about that and if I find some of

535
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:48,710
the material in the document available

536
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:50,990
maybe I'll create another document ok

537
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:52,700
thank you thank you very much

538
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:55,179
thank you for your suggestion that's

539
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,179
very helpful

540
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:04,478
next up is shoe ping

541
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,909
hello everyone I'm shooting from Huawei

542
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,910
and

543
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:36,440
hello hi I'm shooting from Huawei

544
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:38,510
and on behalf of all the co-authors I'm

545
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:42,200
going to present you about the AP and

546
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:45,080
six that is a application-aware ipv6

547
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:48,350
networking and currently we have to

548
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,790
draft one needs a problem statement and

549
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:55,280
use cases the other is about the initial

550
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:57,680
framework proposal and we would like to

551
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:02,120
have your reviews and comments thank you

552
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:05,090
and the first about the motivations that

553
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:08,840
is why we want to propose the AP and six

554
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:10,820
as we know that the network operators

555
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:13,010
have been facing the challenges of

556
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,270
providing better services to their

557
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:21,200
customers and especially nowadays as the

558
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:23,810
5g and the industry verticals involves

559
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,960
and the more and more new applications

560
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:30,320
with diverse service requirements

561
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,140
accessing the network and so that will

562
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:35,590
be desirable for the network operators

563
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,900
to be able to provide that

564
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,419
differentiated fine granularity traffic

565
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:54,890
operations and to guarantee their SLA

566
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:58,820
and and okay sorry I thought it was and

567
00:31:54,890 --> 00:32:02,360
and also moreover and as the

568
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:05,240
technologies involved and the currently

569
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,790
there online gaming live reuse dreaming

570
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:11,480
and also the video conferencing those

571
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:14,290
applications are widely deployed and

572
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,510
used by the end users by the company's

573
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:19,399
enterprises and the dos applications

574
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:21,800
have even more demanding requirements

575
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:25,370
and they are the actual revenue

576
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:27,510
producing applications so the applet

577
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,659
that the network operators

578
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:34,440
would be good to provide the the

579
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:37,800
application level SRA guarantee fine

580
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:41,520
granularity and as Eric guarantee but

581
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:43,770
however the current network dodging

582
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:47,730
doesn't have such capability of

583
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:50,460
application awareness and the network

584
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:54,000
operator is not aware of watch

585
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:58,470
applications actually traversing the

586
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,110
network infrastructure and to support to

587
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,420
guarantee the SLA currently the

588
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:06,629
operators can only use the light load

589
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:09,720
and sometimes even 10% in network

590
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:12,930
utilization so the network operators

591
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,960
just to keep investing in their network

592
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:18,900
structure but they haven't counted the

593
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:21,420
corresponding revenue increases and the

594
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:23,460
actual actually they are losing the

595
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:26,940
opportunities and to have the new

596
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:30,000
revenue so fundamentally for us the

597
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:32,760
motivation is to bring the application

598
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,580
information into the network and to make

599
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:39,000
the network aware of the applications

600
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,899
and as well as their requirements so and

601
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,350
here and we also we would like to take

602
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,500
advantage of the big chant for now that

603
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:53,580
is the ipv6 and as our v6 are being

604
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:57,390
widely deployed and and and the

605
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:00,300
programmability provided by ipv6 that is

606
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:03,450
our basics that is the programmable

607
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:06,629
space in there encapsulations can be

608
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:09,770
utilized to convey some information from

609
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:14,940
the application side into the network

610
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:17,639
but of course and other protocols where

611
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,280
certain extensions could also serve the

612
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,629
same purpose but we cannot ignore the

613
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:29,460
ipv6 and as our v6 other big trend for

614
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:32,489
the for now and for future so basically

615
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:35,250
a paean 6 wants to achieve the

616
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:38,158
application awareness and to have the

617
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:41,340
application visibility in the network to

618
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,260
empower the network of operators to

619
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:48,540
support to provide those fine granular

620
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,600
granularity traffic operations and to

621
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,800
have corresponding revenue increases and

622
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,799
to allow the requirements of the

623
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:00,780
applications to be specified to the

624
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,820
network and the regarding the

625
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:05,730
application informations that could

626
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,130
include the application identification

627
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:10,800
and the SRA requirements of service

628
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:12,930
requirements and with those application

629
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,420
information carried in the package and

630
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:23,580
the network could provide and the up the

631
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:25,590
corresponding network services and we

632
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:28,860
have identified the three key elements

633
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:31,050
for AP and six the first one is the

634
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,600
application information conveying and

635
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,840
that it could be the application itself

636
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,980
or the edge devices to add those

637
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,080
application information and ways the

638
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,200
augmentation of the existing

639
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,279
encapsulations

640
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,589
and just to be noted and that is not a

641
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,290
enforcement that is optional as up to

642
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:56,370
the applications to decide whether to I

643
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:58,500
did or not if they don't add the DOS

644
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:01,140
information and their packets will be

645
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:03,390
traded in the with the traditional way

646
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:05,759
of course they couldn't get the benefit

647
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:08,790
of the provided by 18:6

648
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,040
and the second element is a matching

649
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:15,810
between the application information and

650
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,690
the network so that is like the network

651
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:20,730
provide its capability towards the

652
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:23,430
application and according to those

653
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:27,000
application information and the network

654
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:30,569
could provide corresponding services

655
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,170
like the network slicing deterministic

656
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:36,840
latency guarantee OSF see if Center and

657
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:41,130
the third one is the natural measurement

658
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:44,430
and that is to achieve the pattern or

659
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:47,430
accurate matching for the second element

660
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:51,000
so the net because the network

661
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:53,220
capability is changing over time and in

662
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,840
order to have the accurate matching and

663
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,290
the natural is to

664
00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,770
keep monitoring its performance and and

665
00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:07,470
then provided is the better matching

666
00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:09,990
here and here is the framework and as I

667
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:12,390
said as I said before the application

668
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:16,200
and the edge devices could add those

669
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:20,339
application information and then in the

670
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,980
head end of the network and according to

671
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:26,880
those application information and the

672
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,060
network could for example to steer those

673
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,640
application flows into corresponding as

674
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,990
our v6 tunnel with certain as our a

675
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:39,660
guarantees and along the path and in the

676
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:42,569
meadow point and according to those

677
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:44,640
application information and the some we

678
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:47,220
could also do some manipulations to

679
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,080
those packets to guarantee it here as

680
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:54,990
our a and the here another highlight is

681
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:57,990
that this flow driven method could

682
00:37:54,990 --> 00:38:02,520
enable this faster service for reasoning

683
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:05,339
and we have done a lot of communications

684
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,270
with our customers and with verticals

685
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:11,970
and the industry here so we have

686
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:15,120
identified some use cases that could

687
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:18,180
directly benefit from the AP and six and

688
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,580
here we have categorized into the

689
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,100
following five the first one is the

690
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:26,150
fundament fundamental one that is a

691
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:30,950
application aware I saw a guarantee that

692
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:34,920
is to enable the network operators to

693
00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:37,080
provide differentiated service treatment

694
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:41,460
and the fine granularity traffic

695
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:44,160
operations capability and and then the

696
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:47,190
second is the application aware network

697
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:49,680
slicing this is for some applications

698
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:54,000
that they have the specific requirements

699
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,379
and in order to guarantee their to

700
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,960
satisfy their requirements and some

701
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,510
levels of isolation problem problem

702
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,180
probably in terms of the service

703
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:08,340
isolation our resources isolation to

704
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,810
guarantee their requirements so for

705
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:11,090
those

706
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:14,720
locations they could be steered into

707
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:17,210
certain networks lies and to guarantee

708
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,879
their requirements there and for the

709
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:22,910
multiple different applications and they

710
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:25,520
have errors that requirements they could

711
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:29,899
be steered into different networks

712
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:32,120
slices and and those applications could

713
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:35,510
be served at the same time and in

714
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:38,240
parallel and again and the third one is

715
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:42,380
the application aware deterministic

716
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:45,259
networking for some applications and the

717
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:48,680
day will require at the deterministic

718
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:50,720
under the latency guarantee and for such

719
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:53,779
application flow they could be

720
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:58,700
identified first and steer into the

721
00:39:53,780 --> 00:40:01,460
certain deterministic path and and then

722
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:05,210
is the application of our service

723
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:09,290
function chaining so here is again and

724
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:13,340
the application flow is identified but

725
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:16,490
without the help of dpi so it could be

726
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:20,930
identified and then steered into certain

727
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:23,950
SFC and in the sequence steering you can

728
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:27,440
just use the information information

729
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:30,740
carried in the package and to manipulate

730
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,300
the packets and then for the finally for

731
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:36,220
the application of our network

732
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:41,300
measurement and that could empower us to

733
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,850
monitor the application level the

734
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:47,330
performance and to locate the failure

735
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:52,220
the past the potential failure that

736
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:54,560
could arise and here just briefly to

737
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:59,089
update with you and what happened in the

738
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:01,670
last time and we host AP and six-eyed

739
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:07,550
meeting in 105 when this is the meeting

740
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:10,630
room and we have about 50 attendees and

741
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:14,240
we have very good discussions there and

742
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:16,550
we roughly achieve the rough consensus

743
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:19,729
about the value of the work that's why

744
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:22,430
we decided to continue and this time we

745
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:27,079
have two new drafts and together result

746
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:30,109
collaborators and and so we want to push

747
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:33,020
forward and for the Knights tab and we

748
00:41:30,109 --> 00:41:36,078
would like to have a meeting list for us

749
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:40,250
to continue our discussion and now we

750
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:44,450
can only have the separate discussions

751
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:46,940
and and also we are also planning to we

752
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:51,078
are thinking to have above for the next

753
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:54,380
meeting and here and this time we are

754
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:58,190
presenting in the RT GWT and we are

755
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:02,599
really sincerely looking for suggestions

756
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:05,119
related to the chairs here and how are

757
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:12,010
we going to move forward on this work so

758
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:12,010
that's all thank you any questions

759
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:20,619
women Rick's Nokia a quick question or

760
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:23,629
why do you contain it to ipv6

761
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:26,839
wai-wai-wait can be why do you contain

762
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:30,380
it to ipv6 because you can also do this

763
00:42:26,839 --> 00:42:32,299
with v4 in my view yes I agree as I

764
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,109
mentioned before it doesn't have to be

765
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:39,740
at ipv6 and it could be our other

766
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:42,980
protocols but for example v4 NPR's but

767
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:46,419
we have the mate they have limited the

768
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:49,480
programmable space we have to do it with

769
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:52,220
extensions to segment rather you have I

770
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,400
whether it's with umbrellas or with v6

771
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,959
it's you have as many parts as you have

772
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,040
available so it shouldn't be contained

773
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,720
in my view to only v6 for that I can use

774
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,910
as FC as a tagging there is already

775
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,980
application definition inside so it can

776
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:09,259
take information so you could use that

777
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:13,400
work which is available to achieve this

778
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:15,680
objective yes and we acknowledge this

779
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,290
and we have done analysis on all the

780
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,848
fuse and to figure out the possibilities

781
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:27,799
but and here we would like to carry not

782
00:43:22,849 --> 00:43:30,230
only the very simple ID and the Azeri

783
00:43:27,799 --> 00:43:32,630
requirements actually we could take the

784
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,760
metadata related with that location

785
00:43:32,630 --> 00:43:36,510
whatever you can email which you can do

786
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,210
as I see her

787
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:44,340
that capability you can put metadata in

788
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:46,920
the packet okay we went a pseudo beam

789
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:49,800
from hobby the first one I think that's

790
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:53,400
the the first one I won't say it as the

791
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:57,000
why we discuss in rqwg I think the data

792
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,480
plane I use a true now you saw open

793
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,640
because at the beginning we see the ipv6

794
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,530
advantage you because this the

795
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,140
applications about the ipv6 and now this

796
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,660
a network aside also the SRA six can be

797
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,850
combined through ipv6 a similar

798
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,069
seamlessly that's at the point but I

799
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:17,160
think that usually truly can be open to

800
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:20,520
the I'm chars or we axel I'm based here

801
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,399
it possible the second one I won't say

802
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,560
that the SFC I true it's a higher some

803
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,660
days of the application information but

804
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,580
from our point of view I think I use

805
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:31,770
nothing enough on the other hand

806
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,110
therefore the metadata I think I use it

807
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:39,330
because the metadata is another standard

808
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:41,220
is the whale that's a pond my only

809
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:43,590
comment was it's perceived as it's

810
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:46,080
contained to ipv6 and I think we if we

811
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:49,460
go down this part which is to be decided

812
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,020
I think we should make it open right

813
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:53,850
although I believe ipv6 is the future

814
00:44:52,020 --> 00:45:01,110
that doesn't mean that we have to

815
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:04,830
contain it only that yes there coin a

816
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:06,540
couple of thoughts one for a technical

817
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:08,580
body I don't find revenue based

818
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:10,170
arguments very interesting I would

819
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:14,400
suggest maybe remove those from the

820
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:16,230
documents also broadly speaking this

821
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,660
work has some serious network neutrality

822
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:22,470
implications application where edge

823
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,879
devices are one thing but in the I guess

824
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:27,419
in the framework document you talk about

825
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,280
an application of end nodes sending this

826
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:32,730
metadata and then have some serious

827
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,360
privacy applications and market dynamics

828
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:38,100
being what they are you know RFC 21 19

829
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:41,310
may vs. must it's a very short step from

830
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:42,630
may to must for some networks and you

831
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:45,240
could end up in a situation where you're

832
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:49,920
forcing devices on say a large network

833
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:53,040
in a country to to basically self DP

834
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,510
their traffic and I think I don't and I

835
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,550
know in one of these documents discuss

836
00:45:54,510 --> 00:46:00,800
any of these issues that I could see and

837
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:03,390
I think it's a huge problem yes we

838
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,850
acknowledge the security and the privacy

839
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:09,779
issue that is also noted in the draft

840
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:13,650
and actually post draft and we know we

841
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:16,260
are we are aware of those mechanisms are

842
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:19,710
needed and for example so some

843
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:23,130
automation access control and I also the

844
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:25,770
authentication of those IDs application

845
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:28,350
information son needed and here that

846
00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:31,290
would be one topic for us to explore

847
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:33,960
there right ID the potential for abuse

848
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:35,400
isn't it's not discussed really right

849
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,900
and that that's the real concern here I

850
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:42,240
think so I would like to add to that and

851
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,410
looking at six men Suraj discussions

852
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,939
they are very much focused on single

853
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:52,290
domain you're proposing internet right

854
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:54,960
we single domain first and well as we

855
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:58,290
discussed with us operators now they own

856
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,690
their the network and as well as

857
00:46:58,290 --> 00:47:04,529
application the cloud so they could do

858
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:07,140
it within one domain my point privacy

859
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,540
should be central point of your work if

860
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:11,609
you cannot provide proper privacy

861
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:14,640
technology used it's not really

862
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:16,850
beautiful yes the privacy to my

863
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,310
understanding is related ways

864
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:23,220
information exposed by the applications

865
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:28,040
but that information could be encrypt in

866
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:31,169
some way so and also those information

867
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:34,830
once the application registered itself

868
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:37,170
it needs to be authenticated so I would

869
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,390
like to encourage you to point this

870
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:41,070
issue centrally in your work and work on

871
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:45,569
it so you have clear explenation how

872
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:48,930
you're going to do it okay my

873
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:52,050
measurement from title I think this

874
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:55,230
approach useful for the application

875
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:57,510
where readability because you know we we

876
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:01,380
often said they want to make sure the

877
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:03,340
applications confidence avoid end-to-end

878
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:08,500
but for the

879
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:13,690
applicator are there sa SLA insurance I

880
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:16,180
think it might be maybe this is some

881
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:20,290
difficulty for the department here

882
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:22,390
Network because you know the application

883
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,940
there are many many application

884
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:27,609
application so if you included the

885
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:31,390
application ID in the network letter

886
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:34,180
I think the rotor cannot keep so many

887
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:39,609
state for the selection of the different

888
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:45,250
posture I do not know how you consider

889
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:48,070
is the accessibility yes and that is the

890
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:50,830
so first of all and that is depends on

891
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:54,000
the device capability and from the

892
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:58,180
camera the scalability provided by the

893
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:01,000
large number of applications and first

894
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:04,660
of all it's not all the applications for

895
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,140
you preserve in this way that is only

896
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:10,720
for the like the demanding applications

897
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:15,069
they have specific needs to be satisfied

898
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:21,790
in the network they could utilize in

899
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:26,650
this way and you I think the unfortunate

900
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:29,800
is no IP network for the SLR assumes to

901
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:34,260
be often classified the traffic into the

902
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:38,380
several category so I think for the

903
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:42,370
number the adult category the network

904
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:45,430
can easily deployed the different parts

905
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:48,009
but for the numerous applications

906
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:52,919
requirement I think it is not possible

907
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:56,970
to deploy these different cuts the line

908
00:49:52,920 --> 00:50:01,720
yeah sure that I think that is about the

909
00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:04,000
application ID the how to design is ID

910
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,700
currently we have the segment different

911
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,550
part and that could somehow to

912
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:14,259
categorize as you said into the traffic

913
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:16,480
into groups so just a time check on this

914
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,810
discussion we had only allocated 10

915
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,170
minute

916
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:21,820
so let's we'll hear the questions or

917
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:25,270
responses from the two people that are

918
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:33,160
currently up but we should wind it up in

919
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:34,810
the next two or three minutes okay I dug

920
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:36,460
Montgomery I apologize I haven't read

921
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:38,470
the drafts but I had two simple

922
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,200
questions you you said that you clearly

923
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:44,609
say in the drafts why you can't achieve

924
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:50,109
what you want to achieve with existing

925
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:53,320
virtual path and cost technologies you

926
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:55,240
you you do that gap analysis of why you

927
00:50:53,320 --> 00:51:02,920
can't achieve this with the existing

928
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:07,450
mechanisms versified the problem

929
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:09,730
statement Holly are you in the document

930
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:11,589
oh we have these to the analysis of the

931
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:14,980
youth Network yeah you're the first

932
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:19,240
draft statement requirement and my my

933
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:22,660
second question is of equal ignorant

934
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,779
about this it are your IDs something

935
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:33,430
that have global significance and global

936
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:37,300
uniqueness that is depends and for the

937
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:39,970
certain domain and we are thinking it

938
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:45,280
first of all it will be valid within

939
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:47,470
this is operational domains it's it

940
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,840
doesn't have to be global for the first

941
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:51,879
stage and for sure I think the mati

942
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:54,430
doming we also acknowledge the in the

943
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:57,640
tract and that needs to be considered

944
00:51:54,430 --> 00:52:05,740
because the IDE needs to be delivered at

945
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:10,029
corresponding Linda Dahmer from future

946
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:13,689
way of this course I haven't read this

947
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:16,180
track before today's meeting but just

948
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:19,740
glancing through the draft I find is

949
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:23,649
very useful even though people bring up

950
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:25,799
security concerns if we can have a

951
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:30,339
mechanism to hide the user information

952
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:33,039
do some kind of mapping that bring the

953
00:52:30,339 --> 00:52:35,529
application information into the network

954
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:38,199
and that will bring tremendous value

955
00:52:35,529 --> 00:52:40,779
this bring up to the discussion which

956
00:52:38,199 --> 00:52:43,719
happening other as deals in a math in

957
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:46,869
the cloud architecture discussion

958
00:52:43,719 --> 00:52:49,989
customers wanting application based

959
00:52:46,869 --> 00:52:53,170
forwarding is not based on IP address

960
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:55,689
but based on an application ID different

961
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:59,049
application require different topology I

962
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:02,249
think this will be very very useful not

963
00:52:59,049 --> 00:53:02,249
just my comment thank you

964
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:37,059
next up is why no Chen hello everyone

965
00:53:34,029 --> 00:53:40,989
I'm a quatrain from a future way today

966
00:53:37,059 --> 00:53:47,589
I'm going to talk about sf-86 past

967
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:52,769
increased equals protection so first we

968
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:57,449
have a overview right now we have SR

969
00:53:52,769 --> 00:54:03,939
pass fast protection for transit note

970
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:07,959
here we propose essa fast protection for

971
00:54:03,939 --> 00:54:13,899
equation node so for example we have

972
00:54:07,959 --> 00:54:19,178
here we have a as a pass from p1 ingress

973
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:23,819
and then to p3 as a egress so this pass

974
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:27,759
is a pass carries the

975
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:33,069
VPN traffic so in order to provide

976
00:54:27,759 --> 00:54:37,949
protection for p3 which is is the egress

977
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:43,299
of all this as pass this as a pass so we

978
00:54:37,949 --> 00:54:48,849
have we will have a PI cap equals node

979
00:54:43,299 --> 00:54:54,759
here is pp4 so in order to provide

980
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:58,630
protection we first we configure on p4

981
00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:00,399
which is a biker believers so the

982
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:04,739
concrete configuration that which has a

983
00:55:00,399 --> 00:55:08,109
configure bureau ID which is to protect

984
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:12,099
ps3 and with this kind of configuration

985
00:55:08,109 --> 00:55:15,279
and then there's some actions going on

986
00:55:12,099 --> 00:55:17,259
so one action is that the information

987
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:19,140
about this protection will be

988
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:23,679
distributed in the in the network and

989
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:26,879
then at the same time and PE for which

990
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:32,079
is egos note a backup accuser node so

991
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:38,769
pg4 will generate a map a map in so this

992
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:44,049
mapping will map that traffic for for a

993
00:55:38,769 --> 00:55:46,058
VPN traffic from when the traffic when

994
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:48,849
the traffic coke received from backup

995
00:55:46,059 --> 00:55:51,849
has total traffic volume through data

996
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:57,609
mapping map into the destination which

997
00:55:51,849 --> 00:56:00,819
is c2 so after configuration so on the

998
00:55:57,609 --> 00:56:04,078
previous hope of a equals node for

999
00:56:00,819 --> 00:56:08,499
example here is p1 and that the p1 will

1000
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:14,880
create forward entries for protect the

1001
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:18,999
ps3 here for example on PE 1 when 1 P 1

1002
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:23,979
which is previous hope of equation P P

1003
00:56:18,999 --> 00:56:26,738
is 3 when P is really fails P 1 P 1 will

1004
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:32,138
detect the failure so P 1 we all seen

1005
00:56:26,739 --> 00:56:34,959
the traffic which is a packet to PE 3 to

1006
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:39,039
the bike hub equals note which is PV for

1007
00:56:34,959 --> 00:56:41,408
through bike a pass so before sending

1008
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:45,609
those traffic to the backup path to the

1009
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:48,789
bike a believer's node so p1 well just

1010
00:56:45,609 --> 00:56:53,288
to modify party a little bit just add

1011
00:56:48,789 --> 00:56:56,099
that mirror ID for the package so when

1012
00:56:53,289 --> 00:56:58,829
this modified package

1013
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:02,309
deliver to a PE for which he is back

1014
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:06,900
Kappa equals note so PE for where I'll

1015
00:57:02,309 --> 00:57:09,449
use that my pin to map this because we

1016
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:12,719
have a map Bureau IDE in that package

1017
00:57:09,449 --> 00:57:15,900
and then we have a my pin entry in the

1018
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:19,880
PE for sopia for where my buddy's

1019
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:22,890
package using that my entry to the local

1020
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:26,670
raping ID and then that local wavy had

1021
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:29,930
idea where awesome because well you in

1022
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:33,979
the same VPN so that package well

1023
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:38,209
finally deliver to the c2 so we provided

1024
00:57:33,979 --> 00:57:44,129
protections for failure of us note ps3

1025
00:57:38,209 --> 00:57:46,948
in faster way so regarding to the

1026
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:49,380
updates to the previous version so we

1027
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:51,299
just the ad the two sections

1028
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:54,420
why is the security considerations and

1029
00:57:51,299 --> 00:57:57,989
that's why is a ionic institutions and

1030
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:04,559
then we updated the reference and the

1031
00:57:57,989 --> 00:58:12,329
third why the some editorial changes so

1032
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:14,219
any other comments and suggestions just

1033
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:17,880
a question have you considered whether

1034
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:24,299
this will work with SRM six this is our

1035
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:26,549
physics you may m6 oh you mean the yeah

1036
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:28,079
I think that's a cool topic and that one

1037
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:30,660
moves forward and then we can upgrade

1038
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:34,769
this one to also provide solutions to

1039
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:39,420
that a conqueror esta or use that one

1040
00:58:34,769 --> 00:58:40,379
yeah okay good okay we change from

1041
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:42,930
channel move out

1042
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:46,190
at first I think this solution is a

1043
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:52,828
really useful I think because of during

1044
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:55,079
4G China Mobile deployed a lot of a dual

1045
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:59,910
homing protection function so I think

1046
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:03,299
this function can be used in the future

1047
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:08,279
and that I have a question about the

1048
00:59:03,299 --> 00:59:09,910
mayor note so here you just released the

1049
00:59:08,279 --> 00:59:13,869
one major note is

1050
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:19,390
other possible configure more than one

1051
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:22,480
mirror note right now I hear we have

1052
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:27,339
only one backup plus a backpack have a

1053
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:32,410
eCourse note so you mean we are want so

1054
00:59:27,339 --> 00:59:36,730
here for the mural to one load or two

1055
00:59:32,410 --> 00:59:41,348
dolls I think in the in this document so

1056
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:44,260
we can provide protections to multiple

1057
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:46,660
locators so if you use single data

1058
00:59:44,260 --> 00:59:49,150
that's a marrow to Mudville and the

1059
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:57,308
marrow tomato I don't know whether you

1060
00:59:49,150 --> 01:00:01,780
mean that so my meaning that currently

1061
00:59:57,309 --> 01:00:07,710
you have a ps3 as a working node right

1062
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:11,920
yes a p4 maybe it's a protection note

1063
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:17,859
accomplice yeah the bad cop one is that

1064
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:22,420
possible we have a such as a p5 well you

1065
01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:24,930
mean so we need a DC is a one just one

1066
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:29,529
redundancy we want maybe M redundancy

1067
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:31,210
yes my poor redundancy yeah I know yeah

1068
01:00:29,529 --> 01:00:33,549
that's a that's a I think that's a good

1069
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:35,109
topic I think I think we so in these are

1070
01:00:33,549 --> 01:00:37,900
job that we're gonna provide a solution

1071
01:00:35,109 --> 01:00:39,730
for that one I think maybe in you know

1072
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:43,359
draft like we can consider that one we

1073
01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:50,380
can provide a anyway protection

1074
01:00:43,359 --> 01:00:52,808
something like that okay thank you I do

1075
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:57,549
I'm from Tottenham a long question first

1076
01:00:52,809 --> 01:01:02,309
yeah Cara Mady Cara met him activity be

1077
01:00:57,549 --> 01:01:09,369
finished automatically under the backup

1078
01:01:02,309 --> 01:01:11,789
router such as people come into the met

1079
01:01:09,369 --> 01:01:17,950
here my PSA dollar allocation

1080
01:01:11,789 --> 01:01:20,220
automatically you mean country you said

1081
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:24,049
the median say the either

1082
01:01:20,220 --> 01:01:26,970
configured on the backup or your

1083
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:29,099
so right now it's a one-way this or

1084
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:32,459
configuration so another way maybe a

1085
01:01:29,099 --> 01:01:33,990
source so this right now because we have

1086
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:35,880
a central controller you will have a in

1087
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:37,950
the controller environment so those

1088
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:41,490
those kind of configuration can be

1089
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:45,118
automatic through the controllers so the

1090
01:01:41,490 --> 01:01:47,240
controller can do can select which one

1091
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:49,589
protocol which one and then which ID

1092
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:53,729
provide which locator and then those can

1093
01:01:49,589 --> 01:01:58,279
automatic mean that way yeah I think

1094
01:01:53,730 --> 01:02:00,930
this is in Canada should be a remand

1095
01:01:58,279 --> 01:02:04,170
automatically in network so you know in

1096
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:06,930
Korea we cannot know which node or which

1097
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:11,910
link will be broken down in network so

1098
01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:14,220
you know we I think if in such a such

1099
01:02:11,910 --> 01:02:16,500
mechanism become deployment

1100
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:17,819
automatically to India network we are

1101
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:22,380
either

1102
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:25,589
management of the VPN protects them yeah

1103
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:29,099
yeah all right I think these draft is

1104
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:32,130
just for a proposal based solution and

1105
01:02:29,099 --> 01:02:35,460
then based on this basic solution we can

1106
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:39,059
have a very comprehensive or automatic

1107
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:41,430
and that solutions because with some

1108
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:44,190
notes or server controllers have a high

1109
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:46,799
level view and then he know which node

1110
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:48,660
can provide for some kind of protection

1111
01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:51,509
for which node and then whether we have

1112
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:59,368
another resource and link to support

1113
01:02:51,509 --> 01:03:02,549
this protection okay with juniper so you

1114
01:02:59,369 --> 01:03:05,130
could use in any caste locators to

1115
01:03:02,549 --> 01:03:06,869
achieve the same thing right so I was

1116
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:12,990
just wondering why that that doesn't

1117
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:14,490
work here any caste locators and okay

1118
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:16,859
turist yeah these are located as a

1119
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:19,950
profile some can there Association for

1120
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:23,759
the note for the he was a note so for

1121
01:03:19,950 --> 01:03:27,180
example here we configure PE for to

1122
01:03:23,759 --> 01:03:29,400
provide a locator some number and then

1123
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:34,819
this is just the same locator on p3 p4

1124
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:37,329
and same customer would get same SIDS

1125
01:03:34,819 --> 01:03:41,230
it's

1126
01:03:37,329 --> 01:03:44,049
same-same VPN seed say mrs. hatten

1127
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:46,890
wanted to you mean exactly same as ease

1128
01:03:44,049 --> 01:03:49,538
or same indicator or different location

1129
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:54,549
locator is any car so it is same locator

1130
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:57,130
on p3 p4 VPN CID can also be same

1131
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:57,690
because it's just another 128-bit

1132
01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:00,480
address

1133
01:03:57,690 --> 01:04:04,690
yeah you mean that sense I is ok

1134
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,109
associated with okay yes you think it

1135
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:09,130
works

1136
01:04:05,109 --> 01:04:10,509
yes so if he's an okay there so she has

1137
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:14,230
it that a note and then that low to fail

1138
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:16,569
and then we have for the traffic light

1139
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:19,059
would it be correct to understand that

1140
01:04:16,569 --> 01:04:21,970
mature proposal is backup solution so

1141
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:24,309
unless primary is down secondary will

1142
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:33,910
not take cover while with any caste

1143
01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:37,869
you just used Lotus not semantics in

1144
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:40,240
this context so if you could address on

1145
01:04:37,869 --> 01:04:41,980
mailing list so again I assume that what

1146
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,970
you're talking about this backup while

1147
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:50,680
what Chad was proposing is any class

1148
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:53,288
there's some difference in Seema Louis

1149
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:55,950
Chan juniper one question is that appear

1150
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:59,230
out on p1 if we want to protect the VPN

1151
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,730
are we need to we need to look into the

1152
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:03,099
more packets

1153
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:04,930
I mean dipped into the lipos so that to

1154
01:05:03,099 --> 01:05:06,910
locate whether where there is a

1155
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,980
protector or no protector I mean if you

1156
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:11,279
want how many labels you need to mean

1157
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:16,059
I'm a release X labeled in to inspect oh

1158
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:18,759
you mean the okay so I regarding to the

1159
01:05:16,059 --> 01:05:23,319
VPN so we for example here we use a VPN

1160
01:05:18,759 --> 01:05:25,750
SSID so because VPN we also get more

1161
01:05:23,319 --> 01:05:27,339
information so those are key value

1162
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:30,910
information nice and easy in the trough

1163
01:05:27,339 --> 01:05:33,640
so here we we turned in this picture we

1164
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:36,788
come give details about this total

1165
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:41,500
information I think basically for VPN

1166
01:05:36,789 --> 01:05:43,720
for example of he be honest so so these

1167
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:45,789
are VAP here and for one prefix those

1168
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,430
Vivian can be associated by those kind

1169
01:05:45,789 --> 01:05:49,950
of or same a VPN and the same way of a

1170
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:52,078
VM for example on the

1171
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:56,819
history where I would have Libya ID for

1172
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:59,190
the backup girls we have another VPN as

1173
01:05:56,820 --> 01:06:02,250
ID so because the way I was

1174
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:05,040
we know this on the same VPN and then

1175
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:07,730
those we can associated those one so

1176
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:12,900
that's the my opinion come from so for

1177
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:18,450
for the VPN ID on ps3 that's different

1178
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:20,040
on ps4 v and E as another one so when P

1179
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:22,919
is three files

1180
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:25,950
p1 we detect a failure and in p1 we

1181
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:28,560
modified the package just a add a mirror

1182
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:32,609
IB through the package and then the

1183
01:06:28,560 --> 01:06:34,710
Viviani on on the ps3 not changed so

1184
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:38,098
when this package is delivered to the p4

1185
01:06:34,710 --> 01:06:43,109
and then because we have maro we use

1186
01:06:38,099 --> 01:06:46,589
melody mode at a VPN ID on the ps3 to

1187
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:50,670
the local VP ID which is on a PG 4 and

1188
01:06:46,589 --> 01:06:54,810
then because of those even so will have

1189
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:57,180
different V Vivian IDs but those two

1190
01:06:54,810 --> 01:07:00,299
different one of for same Vivian so we

1191
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:03,868
can deliver to the same destination

1192
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:06,780
which is synchronizing we even your even

1193
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:10,500
into your second presentation would you

1194
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:17,880
be okay to present it on Friday because

1195
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:31,670
we are running out of time so what do

1196
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:31,670
you okay okay can I please be quick so

1197
01:07:33,079 --> 01:07:43,260
ask my question or not do so me also

1198
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:47,339
because okay also can we ask for this

1199
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:48,690
one more well before you ask for

1200
01:07:47,339 --> 01:07:50,578
adoption I think there's a few technical

1201
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,650
problems you need to solve not the least

1202
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:54,660
of which was whether the anycast

1203
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:58,440
solution is a better solution or not and

1204
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:59,790
also exactly we are whether you're

1205
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:02,040
actually conforming to various

1206
01:07:59,790 --> 01:08:04,520
architectures in the design so I think

1207
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:09,090
we're a little way from calling for a

1208
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:11,850
so I really ask you to your sleeves to

1209
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:15,540
discuss all the options provide all the

1210
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:17,609
comments and we'll see after that but

1211
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:19,920
you understand you need to resolve all

1212
01:08:17,609 --> 01:08:23,519
the comments before we can you need to

1213
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:28,859
resolve all the comments go to the next

1214
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:31,680
presentation so this wise about

1215
01:08:28,859 --> 01:08:36,330
architecture for youth basically as a

1216
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:38,190
central controller so basically PGP is

1217
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,850
already you the controller is somewhere

1218
01:08:38,189 --> 01:08:42,120
in somehow

1219
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:46,740
for example we ratify the SR policy and

1220
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:49,309
then direct traffic and then we have

1221
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:51,420
some advantages we use PGP as

1222
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:54,720
controllers we list the number of

1223
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:57,960
advantages here so basically these are

1224
01:08:54,720 --> 01:09:01,710
draft we propose us as three reference

1225
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,470
architectures for PGE as a central

1226
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:06,870
controller so why is a single controller

1227
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:09,600
and then that's why is a controller

1228
01:09:06,870 --> 01:09:11,970
cluster so which is the middle middle

1229
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:14,820
one so we have here we have a two

1230
01:09:11,970 --> 01:09:18,150
controllers which is forms a cluster

1231
01:09:14,819 --> 01:09:20,880
women in January's and controllers which

1232
01:09:18,149 --> 01:09:22,740
forms one cluster and then the server

1233
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:29,190
reference architecture is a hierarchical

1234
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:31,760
structure so this is the these documents

1235
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:35,939
provided some kind of informational

1236
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:37,860
architecture reference so we presented a

1237
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:46,649
couple times I wonder do we have any

1238
01:09:37,859 --> 01:09:56,190
questions for this one so can we ask for

1239
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:59,480
this one John okay

1240
01:09:56,190 --> 01:10:02,339
John who is probably asking CGI chair

1241
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:07,620
John scatter I am NOT up here with any

1242
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:09,600
chair hats on I I guess my question is

1243
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:11,220
and I think this has been asked if I

1244
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,620
remember right in previous meetings and

1245
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:15,930
I don't really know if it's been

1246
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:17,540
answered or if I if it wasn't I forgot

1247
01:10:15,930 --> 01:10:20,010
I'm sorry

1248
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:23,340
why do we need to work on this in the

1249
01:10:20,010 --> 01:10:26,430
IETF and and I'll give my own answer

1250
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:29,010
which is so far I don't think we do it's

1251
01:10:26,430 --> 01:10:32,700
something that people already have been

1252
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:34,830
doing for some years now seemed like we

1253
01:10:32,700 --> 01:10:38,429
could do it just fine without any RFC

1254
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:40,740
and so I would discourage the working

1255
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:42,900
group to take on this extra work but if

1256
01:10:40,740 --> 01:10:48,750
you have a convincing reason for me why

1257
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:50,879
we do need an RFC please go ahead you

1258
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:53,400
see I know we have already used this

1259
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,310
kind of idea whatever so I think maybe

1260
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,629
we have some document so just that

1261
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:59,940
document is some kind of reference

1262
01:10:57,630 --> 01:11:04,520
architectures just as a reference as a

1263
01:10:59,940 --> 01:11:04,519
informational maybe I think it's however

1264
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:10,770
stiffening of key

1265
01:11:07,530 --> 01:11:13,530
I don't like that you talk about bgp as

1266
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:16,170
a controller bgp is just protocols so it

1267
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:18,870
can be a self interface of a controller

1268
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:21,510
but it's not a controller at all so you

1269
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:23,790
can define a controller architecture but

1270
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:26,280
it has nothing to deal with bgp bgp is

1271
01:11:23,790 --> 01:11:28,470
just an interface that the controller

1272
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:30,960
could use to program a path but we

1273
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:36,230
already have the extensions defined to

1274
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:39,930
do so so I don't really see yeah Sooni

1275
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:44,370
idea that we we can generalize so these

1276
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:52,890
are PGP as are already some framework of

1277
01:11:44,370 --> 01:12:01,360
controller architecture in IETF we are

1278
01:11:52,890 --> 01:12:04,090
going to cut here in Europe neck

1279
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,339
then we're gonna go to the next

1280
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:10,680
presentation since we've already cut it

1281
01:12:06,340 --> 01:12:10,680
down to 20 minutes thank you

1282
01:12:42,809 --> 01:12:51,539
hi my name is Dan Bogdanovich and I want

1283
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:53,340
to do some thought experiments and here

1284
01:12:51,539 --> 01:12:53,880
are some of you know the food for

1285
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:56,459
thoughts

1286
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:58,469
anyway it's also continuation from the

1287
01:12:56,459 --> 01:13:00,929
last presentation and to figure out how

1288
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:05,280
we can evolve the network automation and

1289
01:13:00,929 --> 01:13:07,679
the network program ability we have to

1290
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,169
ask ourself a little bit more and how do

1291
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:15,800
we want to continue getting you know to

1292
01:13:10,169 --> 01:13:18,840
the goals in order to enable better

1293
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:22,769
operational productivity for the network

1294
01:13:18,840 --> 01:13:26,059
operators the is there a value of

1295
01:13:22,769 --> 01:13:28,169
splitting things up into multiple layers

1296
01:13:26,059 --> 01:13:31,019
splitting the decision making where

1297
01:13:28,169 --> 01:13:32,849
should we make some decisions should we

1298
01:13:31,019 --> 01:13:34,949
focus on continuing everything on the

1299
01:13:32,849 --> 01:13:37,320
network hardware should we try to think

1300
01:13:34,949 --> 01:13:38,728
more of that and see what should be

1301
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:42,570
running there what should not be running

1302
01:13:38,729 --> 01:13:47,219
there and what benefits can we get out

1303
01:13:42,570 --> 01:13:50,159
of that what are the useful feature for

1304
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:53,939
us that you know we are looking you know

1305
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:56,909
to do what is important to the operators

1306
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:58,469
something like hey can I inject retrieve

1307
01:13:56,909 --> 01:14:02,159
information that I can change some

1308
01:13:58,469 --> 01:14:04,349
routing policies do we want to be able

1309
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:07,619
to do that fast presumably in the real

1310
01:14:04,349 --> 01:14:09,419
time or do we want to inject it and say

1311
01:14:07,619 --> 01:14:11,839
oh it'll happen at one form at a time

1312
01:14:09,419 --> 01:14:16,530
which is pretty in indeterministic

1313
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:19,260
and do we want to offer them different

1314
01:14:16,530 --> 01:14:24,090
traffic engineering optimization in the

1315
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:25,849
points that that can be done how can we

1316
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:28,229
you know again this comes down to

1317
01:14:25,849 --> 01:14:31,349
real-time actions if there is something

1318
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:34,079
happening that we can react in there

1319
01:14:31,349 --> 01:14:36,449
that we can enable an application that

1320
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:38,728
detects that to put the fast reaction

1321
01:14:36,449 --> 01:14:41,938
without waiting for the human network

1322
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:44,130
operator to execute on the action so

1323
01:14:41,939 --> 01:14:47,579
there are you know are any of those

1324
01:14:44,130 --> 01:14:50,220
features useful and the reason I'm

1325
01:14:47,579 --> 01:14:53,200
asking that is that traditional

1326
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:56,170
traditional vendors in the past I'm not

1327
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:58,389
sure if this still is the presence but

1328
01:14:56,170 --> 01:15:00,250
in the past day you know they were

1329
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:03,550
giving you some lackluster support for

1330
01:15:00,250 --> 01:15:05,110
that you know they were I mentioned here

1331
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:08,530
too that I was part of it you know I

1332
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:10,210
know about it but like another one but

1333
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:11,740
it was proprietary interfaces

1334
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:13,780
it wasn't the friendliest you know

1335
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:17,860
environment to develop to the third

1336
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:19,960
parties you have to adopt many vendor

1337
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:23,200
development policies in order to be able

1338
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:24,730
to do that and they were never too happy

1339
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,260
to do it or to expand it if you were

1340
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:28,240
asking me I want this I want that Bob

1341
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:30,190
you cannot have this any kind of that

1342
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:32,170
but maybe you can get this and that but

1343
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:35,320
in general many operators found it

1344
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,760
useful because it enabled them to react

1345
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:38,940
faster and automate some of the

1346
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:43,180
reactions you know on to their network

1347
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,889
and many years ago you know we looked

1348
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:46,960
what is considering the network element

1349
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:49,150
and we said okay we have a network OS we

1350
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,340
have a network hardware we have

1351
01:15:49,150 --> 01:15:54,099
essentially set of demons that are

1352
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:56,290
running inside that you know everything

1353
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,730
nicely packaged up and what we did at

1354
01:15:56,290 --> 01:16:00,550
the ITF at you know some other

1355
01:15:57,730 --> 01:16:02,379
organizations we decided we will be just

1356
01:16:00,550 --> 01:16:05,770
bolting on more and more things onto

1357
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:07,570
that and we did that we were saying oh

1358
01:16:05,770 --> 01:16:10,330
we need more and more things to execute

1359
01:16:07,570 --> 01:16:12,580
on the network and at the same time we

1360
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:15,820
were running into a problem with the CPU

1361
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:17,620
and you know in the memory and we were

1362
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:19,599
trying to build bigger systems but there

1363
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:21,490
was more more software and more shared

1364
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:24,220
infrastructure they had to run on top of

1365
01:16:21,490 --> 01:16:27,120
that and then some people said hey you

1366
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:29,380
know what I Torres it can help us solve

1367
01:16:27,120 --> 01:16:31,930
some of the problems that we are seeing

1368
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,000
we know with the growing network

1369
01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:36,760
operating system and not having enough

1370
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:39,130
resources on the box it is we can also

1371
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:42,790
take in there like PC and PC you know I

1372
01:16:39,130 --> 01:16:45,100
just chose I Torres because it is pretty

1373
01:16:42,790 --> 01:16:47,830
interesting to me and the things here

1374
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:51,480
that bugs me the most is our controller

1375
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:54,490
agent architecture that we are somehow

1376
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:57,639
continuing to pushing on and I'm saying

1377
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:59,769
guys it's so complicated in my opinion

1378
01:16:57,640 --> 01:17:02,679
we should really abandon the controller

1379
01:16:59,770 --> 01:17:05,440
agent architecture because

1380
01:17:02,679 --> 01:17:06,670
it it is ending up being a mess and then

1381
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:10,389
you have controllers on the controller

1382
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:14,100
hierarchical controllers you are you

1383
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:16,480
know getting in a way lost in different

1384
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:19,060
controllers what each one is doing and

1385
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:21,459
you are hiding too much Network

1386
01:17:19,060 --> 01:17:23,949
information behind multiple agents and

1387
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:28,060
controllers one of the thing which I

1388
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:29,830
really liked about the Aitu RS it was

1389
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:32,170
the initial services focused on the

1390
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:33,010
services they included and they said hey

1391
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:35,830
you know what we would like to

1392
01:17:33,010 --> 01:17:38,770
manipulate these services this

1393
01:17:35,830 --> 01:17:42,969
application as well you know as the rib

1394
01:17:38,770 --> 01:17:45,400
in this focus on this you know

1395
01:17:42,969 --> 01:17:49,000
applications is something that I find

1396
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:54,639
attractive and that we are touching upon

1397
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:57,040
in different areas of the ITF but at

1398
01:17:54,640 --> 01:18:02,080
least to me it looks you know a little

1399
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:04,540
bit of unstructured and I would like to

1400
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:06,969
see more proper layers because if you

1401
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:08,500
look at any network element we can say

1402
01:18:06,969 --> 01:18:10,239
we have the forwarding and hardware

1403
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:12,790
abstractions we have the shared

1404
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:15,540
infrastructure in the data and then we

1405
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:19,810
have the applications on top of that now

1406
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:21,100
if we look what is where and saying hey

1407
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:23,110
look what is the forwarding and the

1408
01:18:21,100 --> 01:18:24,820
hardware abstractions we have people who

1409
01:18:23,110 --> 01:18:26,380
know packet by plants we have people

1410
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:29,080
here in the ITF community who are

1411
01:18:26,380 --> 01:18:32,219
building and working with them to

1412
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:34,540
provide us a you know what here are the

1413
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:36,730
here are the models here's what we can

1414
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:40,210
support visiting what we can provide as

1415
01:18:36,730 --> 01:18:42,309
a high-level model and decide what to

1416
01:18:40,210 --> 01:18:43,630
I'm not saying what should be the

1417
01:18:42,310 --> 01:18:46,239
transport for that I'm just saying

1418
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:51,219
here's the model what that hard work can

1419
01:18:46,239 --> 01:18:54,699
do it can be vendor specific but as long

1420
01:18:51,219 --> 01:18:58,900
we can agree on the common semantics and

1421
01:18:54,699 --> 01:19:01,690
the common syntax we can make a big you

1422
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:03,759
know step forward in having some you

1423
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:07,259
know common model that everybody will

1424
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:10,030
understand I love to go back to the ACL

1425
01:19:07,260 --> 01:19:12,340
example you have ACL and you have

1426
01:19:10,030 --> 01:19:14,909
filters why can't we have one common

1427
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:16,690
name whichever one it is to enable

1428
01:19:14,909 --> 01:19:19,740
filtering

1429
01:19:16,690 --> 01:19:21,700
on a box if we can achieve on some

1430
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:25,389
functionalities to have common names

1431
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:27,490
it's easier to build forward so with

1432
01:19:25,390 --> 01:19:30,010
that if we can decide for each one of

1433
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:32,380
those layers to have a common naming

1434
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:34,960
convention with the common models with

1435
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:38,050
the minimum functionality we can either

1436
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,750
move forward and say look if we decide

1437
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:44,440
that we can layer that in you know such

1438
01:19:40,750 --> 01:19:47,500
examples where we would be X for each

1439
01:19:44,440 --> 01:19:50,049
application for each in a shared

1440
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:53,500
infrastructure a framework that we will

1441
01:19:50,050 --> 01:19:55,810
be saying here are the models here are

1442
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:59,380
the frameworks that we would you know

1443
01:19:55,810 --> 01:20:01,060
like to work on and support we can make

1444
01:19:59,380 --> 01:20:03,490
again I will say we can make lot of

1445
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:06,220
progress and there are things like that

1446
01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:10,870
already out there because if you look at

1447
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:12,640
the G RPC oh you want a G rib does it

1448
01:20:10,870 --> 01:20:14,590
work for everyone no it worked for

1449
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,660
someone but it's already out there you

1450
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:19,390
can manipulate it giving you the API GT

1451
01:20:16,660 --> 01:20:23,290
you can get the photo buffs you can you

1452
01:20:19,390 --> 01:20:26,320
know change it model it but do we want

1453
01:20:23,290 --> 01:20:28,360
to adopt that or do we want to see and

1454
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:30,670
make sure that it can work for a much

1455
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:32,349
wider community and for much why the use

1456
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:34,780
cases then for just a certain type of

1457
01:20:32,350 --> 01:20:40,600
use cases that that has been the

1458
01:20:34,780 --> 01:20:43,599
proposed and done and I would say you

1459
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:47,830
know with all of this is rip 2i Torres

1460
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:51,040
it should rest in peace it was a useful

1461
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:52,840
exercise but the outcome of that wasn't

1462
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:53,170
very useful the architecture wasn't

1463
01:20:52,840 --> 01:20:56,170
there

1464
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:58,330
I liked ok here are the services that we

1465
01:20:56,170 --> 01:21:00,820
should focus on this is what you would

1466
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:03,190
like to be able to manipulate let's find

1467
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:06,690
what would be the right way to get them

1468
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:09,900
you know at each correct layer the

1469
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:13,690
actions that we will provide to the

1470
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:16,960
users in different ways because I don't

1471
01:21:13,690 --> 01:21:19,179
want to address a protocol through a

1472
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:22,030
controller I don't want to add another

1473
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:23,620
layer of abstractions between it I would

1474
01:21:22,030 --> 01:21:25,719
like to be able to talk directly to the

1475
01:21:23,620 --> 01:21:28,120
protocol daemon you know get the actual

1476
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:30,070
state from the protocol daemon compared

1477
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:31,870
to the state on the

1478
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:33,880
on the wire and no what is this

1479
01:21:31,870 --> 01:21:35,769
situation between and on my intended and

1480
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:38,410
Maxwell's day if I going through

1481
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:40,150
anything in between that I'm you know I

1482
01:21:38,410 --> 01:21:42,250
don't know how much information they

1483
01:21:40,150 --> 01:21:44,080
sent them from me what you know what I

1484
01:21:42,250 --> 01:21:47,460
can really actually what I can change

1485
01:21:44,080 --> 01:21:52,960
what I cannot change and simplifying

1486
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:57,310
such actions would move us forward in

1487
01:21:52,960 --> 01:22:00,340
again achieving better program ability

1488
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:03,100
of the overall network now do you want

1489
01:22:00,340 --> 01:22:05,670
to do some work like that I'm not sure

1490
01:22:03,100 --> 01:22:07,990
because we have some of our own you know

1491
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:11,170
employer restrictions we have you know

1492
01:22:07,990 --> 01:22:13,000
some of our own ideas but I said it's a

1493
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:14,710
thought experiments that each one of us

1494
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:17,200
can do and I just want you to give you

1495
01:22:14,710 --> 01:22:19,030
some food for thought and say maybe we

1496
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:21,630
can you know propose something else and

1497
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:33,610
see if it can be useful or not

1498
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:36,190
thank you Jeff as former ITRs chair so

1499
01:22:33,610 --> 01:22:38,200
rest in peace would be wonderful except

1500
01:22:36,190 --> 01:22:42,000
for this is not resting in peace this is

1501
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:45,040
the undead coming back to haunt you I

1502
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:48,100
don't want to you know like resurface

1503
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:50,170
azam be that's fine so the the

1504
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:53,470
presentation has a lot of excellent

1505
01:22:50,170 --> 01:22:55,990
points I Taurus in all no objective

1506
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:58,660
criteria for what was supposed to have

1507
01:22:55,990 --> 01:23:02,380
accomplished failed we ended up with

1508
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:04,420
models we ended up with no the vestiges

1509
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:07,690
of a mechanism that supposedly used that

1510
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:09,910
comp to actually do that work and people

1511
01:23:07,690 --> 01:23:12,490
are not deploying it so from that could

1512
01:23:09,910 --> 01:23:15,250
stand point it is a failure but over the

1513
01:23:12,490 --> 01:23:17,349
time that the working group existed and

1514
01:23:15,250 --> 01:23:20,080
that the models got worked on you know

1515
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:22,450
we helped the net modern epitaph groups

1516
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,950
changed the protocol changed their

1517
01:23:22,450 --> 01:23:25,840
mechanisms you know the current data

1518
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:29,590
store model is largely influenced by the

1519
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:31,540
ITRs work a lot of the Dynamis adeno

1520
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:33,790
that we had in terms of things in

1521
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,790
Metcalfe was pushed partially by hrs

1522
01:23:33,790 --> 01:23:38,410
back in the day a lot of the components

1523
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:41,650
that we actually talked to the RHIB

1524
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:43,510
model that we have an IETF got a big

1525
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,960
upgrade because the hrs people were

1526
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,160
looking at

1527
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,560
you know the contents of things with

1528
01:23:45,160 --> 01:23:49,930
great scrutiny so there's a lot of

1529
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:53,100
inputs that this failed experiment had

1530
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:57,460
in terms of pushing on the rest the ietf

1531
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:59,380
ecosystem to develop good stuff and to a

1532
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:02,290
large extent about your components no

1533
01:23:59,380 --> 01:24:03,580
we're we're looking at to some extent

1534
01:24:02,290 --> 01:24:05,260
the result of the failure that was

1535
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:08,230
projected which is if we don't actually

1536
01:24:05,260 --> 01:24:10,990
solve the problem in IETF we're going to

1537
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:12,969
see is that vendors are going to you

1538
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:15,099
know fork off and do their own things

1539
01:24:12,970 --> 01:24:17,050
and you know the most successful of

1540
01:24:15,100 --> 01:24:20,830
those obviously is the work from Google

1541
01:24:17,050 --> 01:24:22,900
for doji ribbing company and are the

1542
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:24,330
problem is the work is not done here we

1543
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:27,730
don't get a lot of no say in the matter

1544
01:24:24,330 --> 01:24:29,620
it's you know walking dead of SNMP

1545
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:32,709
returned in many respects so we get all

1546
01:24:29,620 --> 01:24:34,690
the sins from that but people are

1547
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:36,130
solving exactly the problem spaces we

1548
01:24:34,690 --> 01:24:37,870
knew were need to get to be solved and I

1549
01:24:36,130 --> 01:24:39,850
dress people are doing rip programming

1550
01:24:37,870 --> 01:24:41,290
some people are doing fib programming

1551
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:43,030
with different models we're getting

1552
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:45,490
telemetry via very various streaming

1553
01:24:43,030 --> 01:24:47,050
things and lots of different faces the

1554
01:24:45,490 --> 01:24:48,580
one success that we got out of a lot of

1555
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:50,470
that is regardless of the transport

1556
01:24:48,580 --> 01:24:51,970
whether it's you know thrift whether

1557
01:24:50,470 --> 01:24:54,340
it's protobufs whether it's something

1558
01:24:51,970 --> 01:24:55,390
else a lot of people have actually gone

1559
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:57,490
down the road that we sort of pushed

1560
01:24:55,390 --> 01:24:59,050
them to which is gang is the high level

1561
01:24:57,490 --> 01:25:01,389
modeling language this stuff gets done

1562
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:05,200
in so that at the very least the models

1563
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:07,570
can you interchange so with most of your

1564
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:09,490
comments you know I agree I put back

1565
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:11,230
this slide on because this is what they

1566
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:14,469
see what was the value coming out of the

1567
01:25:11,230 --> 01:25:17,469
ITRs I still see there's you know a lot

1568
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:19,840
of controller agent coming forward and I

1569
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:22,600
would like to say let's try to remove

1570
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:23,920
that put in proper software layering in

1571
01:25:22,600 --> 01:25:26,140
between it and decide whichever

1572
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,270
framework we want to support on or

1573
01:25:26,140 --> 01:25:30,310
whichever one will be the juror at that

1574
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:34,060
moment that can be easily you know

1575
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:35,860
plugged on top of that so I tend to

1576
01:25:34,060 --> 01:25:39,280
agree I think those things are necessary

1577
01:25:35,860 --> 01:25:42,070
and I will leave the final comment with

1578
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:45,730
prediction as long as we force this work

1579
01:25:42,070 --> 01:25:47,920
to touch net cough it shall fail the

1580
01:25:45,730 --> 01:25:49,540
groups and that the people that

1581
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:52,740
participating that group do not have an

1582
01:25:49,540 --> 01:25:52,740
agenda that aligns with us

1583
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:58,938
Robinson Cisco actually going back on

1584
01:25:56,840 --> 01:26:02,809
Jeff's point I think in terms of where

1585
01:25:58,939 --> 01:26:05,119
we got in net mod with Andy and MDA

1586
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:07,070
architecture was we almost got to the

1587
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:09,259
point of defining what you'd need for

1588
01:26:07,070 --> 01:26:11,929
ITRs and then we didn't do this the

1589
01:26:09,260 --> 01:26:13,280
small bit at the very end and so the

1590
01:26:11,929 --> 01:26:14,629
architecture talks about how you would

1591
01:26:13,280 --> 01:26:16,429
do a dynamic datastore but doesn't

1592
01:26:14,629 --> 01:26:18,919
define us have but actually defining one

1593
01:26:16,429 --> 01:26:20,929
and ideally saying how does the data

1594
01:26:18,919 --> 01:26:22,369
merge in with the existing one so I

1595
01:26:20,929 --> 01:26:24,139
still think that actually there's a

1596
01:26:22,369 --> 01:26:26,119
small step from that point of view to

1597
01:26:24,139 --> 01:26:27,199
enabling this functionality because the

1598
01:26:26,119 --> 01:26:29,209
data models have already been written

1599
01:26:27,199 --> 01:26:34,759
and whether that's the right thing to do

1600
01:26:29,209 --> 01:26:36,829
is a very different question I will

1601
01:26:34,760 --> 01:26:47,300
resist my comment on being an MVA

1602
01:26:36,829 --> 01:26:49,570
architecture I almost took the bait Dean

1603
01:26:47,300 --> 01:26:50,949
what's your personal position this

1604
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:53,268
excuse me

1605
01:26:50,949 --> 01:26:55,280
you've kind of presented the facts

1606
01:26:53,269 --> 01:26:59,840
what's your position what do you think

1607
01:26:55,280 --> 01:27:02,959
well we have developed bunch of models

1608
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:05,229
that people will not implement it

1609
01:27:02,959 --> 01:27:07,579
because they are too complex and too big

1610
01:27:05,229 --> 01:27:11,899
there are parts of the models that are

1611
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:13,879
being implemented and are being used but

1612
01:27:11,899 --> 01:27:17,269
it's a very minor you know part of some

1613
01:27:13,879 --> 01:27:21,590
of the models that are being used and it

1614
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:24,619
is the idea to instead of trying to

1615
01:27:21,590 --> 01:27:26,899
model everything under the Sun trying to

1616
01:27:24,619 --> 01:27:32,688
see what are the you know to come to

1617
01:27:26,899 --> 01:27:36,320
your common semantics and syntax for the

1618
01:27:32,689 --> 01:27:39,079
key functions and services and say

1619
01:27:36,320 --> 01:27:43,459
here's the model what framework we will

1620
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:46,478
use for the you know to generate the API

1621
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:50,599
so will it be net confined or will it be

1622
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:52,849
G RPC or drift or anything coming down

1623
01:27:50,599 --> 01:27:55,610
the future we should be make sure that

1624
01:27:52,849 --> 01:27:59,139
what we built is flexible and open to

1625
01:27:55,610 --> 01:28:02,768
those new frameworks that it's easily

1626
01:27:59,139 --> 01:28:05,160
that is is that you can easily move it

1627
01:28:02,769 --> 01:28:06,660
one of the thing is that

1628
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:09,150
I'm saying why can't they have a fit

1629
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:10,889
model and the RHIB model understand how

1630
01:28:09,150 --> 01:28:12,960
the rib to fit translation has been done

1631
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:16,260
on those models and just compare them

1632
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:19,980
and know what is my actual state I you

1633
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:22,200
know so there I have to know too many

1634
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:24,059
rib too many rib models and then too

1635
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:26,760
many fit models from all the different

1636
01:28:24,060 --> 01:28:29,070
vendors and then I can you know and have

1637
01:28:26,760 --> 01:28:31,020
the access to all of that in order to be

1638
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:33,240
able to start doing things like that

1639
01:28:31,020 --> 01:28:35,220
which gives me a much better overview

1640
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:38,760
and much faster ory what is actually

1641
01:28:35,220 --> 01:28:40,920
really on the wire versus you know what

1642
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:46,290
some of the other groups are doing I'm

1643
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:48,210
also a little bit worried that we are so

1644
01:28:46,290 --> 01:28:50,790
pushing forward and that a 20 year old

1645
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:52,800
technology which was first proposed in

1646
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:55,680
November 2002 so we are now coming to

1647
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:58,290
the 70th anniversary of a saint Iran of

1648
01:28:55,680 --> 01:29:00,000
you know of a 10th year of technology is

1649
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:08,210
becoming the main network management

1650
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:08,210
technology and is it is not the

1651
01:29:08,780 --> 01:29:15,240
friendliest programming tool we have

1652
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:17,010
moved forward and I would like to see us

1653
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:18,870
being more flexible to those new tools

1654
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:21,600
and new frameworks I've been saying a

1655
01:29:18,870 --> 01:29:24,140
long time the couple that come from yak

1656
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:26,910
don't keep them connected

1657
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:28,560

1658
01:29:26,910 --> 01:29:30,300
