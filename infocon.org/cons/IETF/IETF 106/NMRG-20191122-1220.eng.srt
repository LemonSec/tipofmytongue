1
00:03:42,140 --> 00:05:14,719
we whisper naturally

2
00:05:35,690 --> 00:07:22,520
okay so here receive income on their

3
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,520
Wikipedia

4
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:23,540
energy and we are trans idea Rockland we

5
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:27,620
need people to work that and persuade

6
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:34,010
suspends know so many reasons so it's

7
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:35,360
good professional it's warm I think we

8
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:41,500
have a major network management

9
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:46,070
architecture issue as some change in

10
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:49,280
over 20 years and we are trying to use

11
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,020
the existing architecture for all the

12
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,640
new things and we are getting into

13
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,960
different bottlenecks at different

14
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:59,840
layers maybe rethinking some of them

15
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,560
basic tenets and architectures and I

16
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,450
mainly they are fighting against the

17
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,569
controller agent architecture and try to

18
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:11,000
see what other options you know could be

19
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:16,310
a very fulfilling seeing much of the

20
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:19,310
requirements and do those new start we

21
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:22,280
are seeing other new Papa but do those

22
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:25,550
who path can be done with existing ones

23
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:29,600
and I know from my own experience we are

24
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:33,969
running into many problems if you try to

25
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,970
do basic economic

26
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,210
with the existing medical management

27
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:42,530
architecture will be interesting to hear

28
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:44,000
from the academic community if some some

29
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,569
of them are moving into your data

30
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,090
management market letters and I will

31
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:51,950
load with this imported with them

32
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:54,470
reading some papers or exam proposals

33
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:56,540
that we understand fitted with the same

34
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,350
architecture that there is around for

35
00:09:56,540 --> 00:11:32,089
ages if I will just read them I think

36
00:10:00,350 --> 00:11:33,710
that the architecture is there perhaps

37
00:11:32,089 --> 00:11:35,360
the most energetic of the research

38
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:37,490
groups we have over the last few years

39
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,940
so I would encourage you to try to make

40
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:42,620
a focus on you know actually concluding

41
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,100
that and publishing some documents and

42
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,160
getting the work out

43
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:52,339
in terms of AI for network management

44
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,939
that's certainly a potentially you know

45
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:58,179
a plausible topic for the future I

46
00:11:54,939 --> 00:12:01,429
noticed looking at the agenda for today

47
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:03,019
we have one research presentation and

48
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,990
then a bunch of reports from other

49
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:10,399
organizations and you know challenges to

50
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:12,920
stimulate research I think stim you know

51
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,290
if you can stimulate research and if

52
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:17,179
we're starting to see AI for network

53
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:19,939
management research being brought here

54
00:12:17,179 --> 00:12:23,029
then you know that that would be a good

55
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:26,868
sign for the chattering for the reach a

56
00:12:23,029 --> 00:12:29,389
Turing if we're simply seeing continued

57
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:30,679
reports from other organizations but

58
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:33,139
that's less of a good sign

59
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:35,119
so you know if you can stimulate

60
00:12:33,139 --> 00:12:36,290
research in that topic and it should

61
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,879
show that there's a community and

62
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:40,969
interest then you have that's something

63
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:43,309
we should consider for the chattering as

64
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,139
a very small site issue I really would

65
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:46,879
prefer if you use the term other than

66
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:54,019
self driving given all the work on

67
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:56,059
self-driving cars okay hey this is Alex

68
00:12:54,019 --> 00:13:00,049
come just to comment a respond to

69
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:01,639
Colin's remarks just regarding I see

70
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,559
actually there's a lot of activity and

71
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,839
research interest for AI in network

72
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:07,759
management in other communities notably

73
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,029
I Triple E I Triple E communication

74
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:13,910
society and I think by having the

75
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:16,309
Charter here this is a lot of work going

76
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:18,439
on so one question is big how can we how

77
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:19,969
can we can be perhaps attract some of

78
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:23,779
those communities it's supposed to come

79
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:28,369
here and believe and true for anybody as

80
00:13:23,779 --> 00:13:31,069
a as a relevant venue for that and I

81
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:32,360
think having AI for an EM as part of the

82
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:33,799
Charter I think is something that can

83
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:41,209
help that I would actually support

84
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:43,790
having this year so Colin Perkins again

85
00:13:41,209 --> 00:13:45,439
as I say if if there is evidence that

86
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:47,929
there is a community being formed here

87
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:50,329
to do AI work then I would support you

88
00:13:47,929 --> 00:13:52,490
adding that to the chatter I don't think

89
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:54,319
it's appropriate ad work to the charter

90
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:56,089
with the goal of stimulating people to

91
00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:58,259
come here I want to see that there is

92
00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:10,420
interest before I do that

93
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:12,699
okay will from highway so actually I'd

94
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,949
have a offline discussion with turn me

95
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:20,319
about this work related to a network AI

96
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:22,899
perspective given that because we have

97
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:25,540
already have scheduled several

98
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:29,110
presentations today on the other

99
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,660
organizations activities so I always

100
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,019
think that it's better if we can find

101
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,810
some specific unique value for M RG to

102
00:14:35,019 --> 00:14:40,990
start this work as I mentioned yesterday

103
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,709
maybe because we are so close to IETF

104
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:47,949
and I have is generating about a

105
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:50,349
protocol specific specification so maybe

106
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:53,050
one of the unique value is that we can

107
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,449
generate AI based protocol specification

108
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:57,849
or a I assisted protocol specification

109
00:14:55,449 --> 00:15:01,540
that will be our I'm a unique value

110
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:05,529
instead of working again following the

111
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,769
work from other activities that's my

112
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,769
point

113
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:15,819
manish oza moppets here no chair hat

114
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,219
just me um actually I'd like to maybe as

115
00:15:15,819 --> 00:15:20,529
raising our research interest maybe we

116
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,250
want also to look not at what just a I

117
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:26,889
can bring well what not that how we can

118
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:30,339
put AI in network management but also

119
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:32,949
how a I can help network management work

120
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,959
in the network there's a lot of network

121
00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,359
management that requires a lot of data

122
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:41,258
you move need to move that data

123
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,930
somewhere how come then the network help

124
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:46,899
the network management and not just and

125
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:48,969
the AI in terms of a reduction of data

126
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:50,500
and everything and not just add some

127
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:51,970
kind of rule based into network

128
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,639
management we lose a lot of the stuff

129
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:56,769
I've see but saying okay so knowing that

130
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,880
we're gathering all that data everywhere

131
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:03,910
how can and those are needed for the AI

132
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,439
to work and for the AI in those network

133
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:07,689
management things to work well how can

134
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:10,260
the network help that so looking at it

135
00:16:07,689 --> 00:16:10,260
the other way around

136
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,300
a comment yeah thank you for your

137
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,470
comment regarding marriages

138
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,589
specificities a failure in the

139
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:22,500
relationship with a network management I

140
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:24,850
think we will at the end we'll have this

141
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:27,520
kind of wrapper for the side meeting the

142
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,580
ovens are some related IDs to Melrose

143
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,020
they are just expressed now I think

144
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,140
we'll have more time to discuss a bit

145
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:36,490
more in the on that aspect I think we

146
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:47,710
have to move on to the next to the

147
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:58,300
presenter unrest will be a limit on me

148
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:58,720
take oh yeah hello undress the floor is

149
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,199
yours

150
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,880
yeah you hear me just a question you

151
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:05,500
need to own it at least somewhere

152
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:13,180
because we're speaking which we cannot

153
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:15,010
hear you okay so I got from Lorenzo

154
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,850
thanks for the support I got the address

155
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:22,290
okay another acknowledgement Lorenzo

156
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:22,290
tells me did you hear me

157
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:32,990
address can you check if you are a mute

158
00:17:28,990 --> 00:18:08,000
on me tackle on your browser and on your

159
00:17:32,990 --> 00:18:09,770
laptop so undress we the issue is not on

160
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,690
your side it's on the the room side

161
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,240
there is seems to be a problem from the

162
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:17,049
mythical audio stream in the room so

163
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,049
please be patient

164
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,270
can you try again undress please

165
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:44,670
yeah do you hear me yeah very good

166
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:48,059
okay thank you so I would say that now

167
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:51,480
he's starting directly first again

168
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,110
thanks to Shalom norm for inviting me

169
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:57,450
and to have the opportunity to present

170
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,070
parts of our work here and I was also

171
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:01,380
following know that the introduction a

172
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:03,629
discussion about like terminologies and

173
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:07,170
so on so I will also use the safe

174
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:08,580
thriving part so oh so don't be so much

175
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,380
upset I think there are a lot of terms

176
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:13,169
about what is AI and so on and

177
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:17,040
networking and we should really get to

178
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,809
the core and discuss about that so what

179
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,129
I'm descending is a kind of joint work I

180
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:22,290
did together with some people here from

181
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:25,410
human egg but also from Vienna and also

182
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:28,760
from Hungary and so let's start directly

183
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:31,920
so can you go to the next slide so

184
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,990
that's all what we know about networks

185
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,910
and steering networks today so the human

186
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,220
is in the loop and what the human is of

187
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,320
course always doing is like monitoring

188
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,179
the network identifying there by

189
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,280
networking problems and then when we

190
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:45,929
have identified problems of course what

191
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,120
we are doing as humans like we trying to

192
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:51,840
solve these problems so we optimizing

193
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,489
networks to to get some solutions and

194
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,209
what is also they are before we put

195
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:59,070
anything into into in fact is that we

196
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,320
are designing like the performance

197
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,939
evasion as well so we we think about

198
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,550
okay this is our protocol this over

199
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,990
everything this all architecture and it

200
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:08,850
should work like this it should run like

201
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,740
this so we are also doing the testing

202
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:12,990
the problem here is that of course

203
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,910
networks that's what we know are getting

204
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:21,660
more complex so there is a clear need

205
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:23,130
for this automation so next like this is

206
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,240
a picture what I think what people

207
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:28,530
always or how people always see

208
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,750
artificial intelligence and machine

209
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:33,240
learning so there's this this this ugly

210
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:36,720
machines bad machine trying to replace

211
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:41,550
the human but what we believe is that I

212
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,710
should more like on the next slide

213
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:45,210
so it should be your your your friend

214
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,830
and your helper it should augment your

215
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,390
research it should help you to develop

216
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,270
the protocol should help you to develop

217
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:55,800
the algorithms and then on the next

218
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:59,400
slide so next slide please

219
00:20:55,800 --> 00:21:01,470
we see that with AI or machine learning

220
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,420
the ideas to have safe monitoring

221
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:05,730
networks so that the network itself can

222
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:09,090
trigger the actions to identify problems

223
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:11,160
then after that that the network is

224
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:13,620
actually equipped with opportunities

225
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,590
with actions to also self optimize to go

226
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:18,360
towards the solution and what I'm

227
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,010
focusing on in this talk is the third

228
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,629
part which is about a self benchmarking

229
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:23,790
so the network should also have some

230
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,070
ways before putting solutions into into

231
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,139
reality when to in fact that it can sum

232
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:30,450
up self benchmark and see how the

233
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:33,860
solution it thinks is the best for the

234
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:37,020
network should look like so next slide

235
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,280
and what is the traditional way actually

236
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,290
here I mean that's what we have in

237
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,320
research we have for instance the traces

238
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,940
we have sometimes we have the models if

239
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,139
we don't have to trace it so abstract

240
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:48,060
from the trace if you have the models

241
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,470
from the network traffic and then if we

242
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:51,360
want to try or test solutions actually

243
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:53,640
we are doing some kind of best guesses

244
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,590
so humans also in the loop and it's just

245
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:58,050
like trying to select some points and

246
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:01,620
configurations for instance for traffic

247
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:03,930
measurements based on his idea or what

248
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:06,149
what it should be and what we have in

249
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:08,810
mind is not a data driven approach so

250
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:11,490
next slide please

251
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:13,020
the problem with the traces is like they

252
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,780
might not always be available so this is

253
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,550
a big problem for us to the follow for

254
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,410
the research community like Google

255
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,550
Facebook they have the traces but we

256
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:21,960
don't see them we don't have them

257
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,879
available so we cannot test with them

258
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,950
but of course if you don't look in their

259
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,840
papers what we see there is like they

260
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,150
have models the problem with model as

261
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,830
always it might not generalize well and

262
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,840
it's also not covering what can happen

263
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,360
in the future was also maybe not

264
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,399
covering the extreme cases and the third

265
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,290
part is even that sometimes what we have

266
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,180
was in research is people are proposing

267
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:47,820
algorithms and maybe they are just

268
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:51,210
taking some points that are let look the

269
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,100
items like shiny so they designed a

270
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,450
performance innovation way that that

271
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,509
it's good for their solution

272
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:58,909
so what we thought is like putting also

273
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,029
a using machine learning the different

274
00:22:58,909 --> 00:23:01,619
perspective

275
00:23:00,029 --> 00:23:02,940
so taking the data driven approach and

276
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:04,439
this is also again what this talk is

277
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,259
about so we want to use machine learning

278
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:13,649
or artificial intelligence to to

279
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:15,059
benchmark networks so next slide this is

280
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:16,859
a kind of the traditional chain I mean

281
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:19,049
we have the the benchmark instance

282
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:21,049
generator for instance for protocols for

283
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:23,580
algorithms for routing algorithms you're

284
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:25,889
generating problems like routing from A

285
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,269
to B so we have the problem instances

286
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:29,428
this will be then feed into our

287
00:23:27,269 --> 00:23:31,739
solutions like like network algorithms

288
00:23:29,429 --> 00:23:33,720
and function again and then the

289
00:23:31,739 --> 00:23:35,700
algorithms or the functions they are

290
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,049
behaving in a way that we get the

291
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:41,580
problem solutions so this is the

292
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:43,230
traditional way so next slide what we

293
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,658
have already done over the last three

294
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:47,220
years is to think about where to

295
00:23:45,659 --> 00:23:48,749
integrate or how to integrate machine

296
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,850
learning artificial intelligence there

297
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:53,009
in particular what we what we are doing

298
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:54,719
or what we were doing is like we want to

299
00:23:53,009 --> 00:23:56,070
learn first from the problem instances

300
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,019
so this is like when you're doing this

301
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,749
classical traffic analysis and try to

302
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:02,429
identify how the traffic looks like or

303
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:04,080
how the problem instance actually looked

304
00:24:02,429 --> 00:24:06,389
like so where do we have our routing

305
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,070
request how does our demand matrix looks

306
00:24:06,389 --> 00:24:09,840
like and then of course when we are

307
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,609
continuously solving problems we can

308
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,619
somehow get some information from there

309
00:24:11,609 --> 00:24:16,799
so so we can also see like the problem

310
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:18,959
solutions and combining both the ideas

311
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,908
that we can have existing systems

312
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,249
Network algorithms also here to identify

313
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,359
problems and so on this is somehow and

314
00:24:23,249 --> 00:24:26,429
work we have already done over the last

315
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:28,559
three years and published on some

316
00:24:26,429 --> 00:24:32,519
workshops at seek home and in some

317
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:36,600
chunks now all way different to that is

318
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:38,580
on the next slide and this is what we

319
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,799
think now where we can also plug in

320
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:42,299
machine learning so the idea is that we

321
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,129
have on the left side where you are

322
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,658
generating the benchmark instance where

323
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:47,070
we are generating like the traffic we

324
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:49,259
are generating the problem instances

325
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,850
that we can also plug in machine

326
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:53,940
learning artificial intelligence because

327
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:56,248
we can also again take the problem

328
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,470
solutions into account and then thereby

329
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:00,269
what we would like to have is we would

330
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:02,609
like to generate out of several problem

331
00:25:00,269 --> 00:25:04,320
instances so we want to have problem

332
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:06,820
instances that are challenging our

333
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,129
network algorithms or functions that

334
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:11,309
us as engineers and researchers to

335
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,880
identify really again weak spots and

336
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:18,610
thereby also to then know where to look

337
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,850
for let's say a beach buzzin and develop

338
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:22,830
the solutions there was also one one

339
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:25,658
point

340
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,070
mentioned like about the data because

341
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:28,960
the data is not always available this

342
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,759
approach should also have to overcome

343
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,940
this a little bit in the sense that we

344
00:25:30,759 --> 00:25:36,639
should find ways to generate data that

345
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:39,399
helps us really to benchmark our systems

346
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:42,639
so we see a lot of potential here that

347
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:46,149
this is another part of the of the of

348
00:25:42,639 --> 00:25:48,820
the let's say AI or ml chain what we

349
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:50,258
need to put here and the overall ideas

350
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,879
then when that we have maybe in the end

351
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,740
machine learning AI versus machine

352
00:25:51,879 --> 00:25:55,600
learning III but you can also say maybe

353
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,950
machine learning eyewear sis to human as

354
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,418
a developers so when you're doing your

355
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:01,149
testing when you're doing your your

356
00:25:58,419 --> 00:26:03,460
integration tasks when you're like not

357
00:26:01,149 --> 00:26:04,928
you're not testing and just versus like

358
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,370
unit tests for software but you're also

359
00:26:04,929 --> 00:26:07,899
testing against a machine that is

360
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:14,258
generating input for your programs

361
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:16,268
automatically okay so next slide and

362
00:26:14,259 --> 00:26:18,789
this is an example that we used in our

363
00:26:16,269 --> 00:26:21,580
paper we use the open V switch because

364
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:23,019
it's still a very prominent software

365
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,730
it's in the products of remember of

366
00:26:23,019 --> 00:26:26,649
course not like the open source software

367
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:28,840
and then we had a set-up with three

368
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:30,489
hosts and in this simple setup really we

369
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:32,860
just had a horse that was generating a

370
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,450
network trophy on the left side and for

371
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:36,340
the generation we had the configurations

372
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:38,320
and we had the host on the right side we

373
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,879
were sending the traffic to and in the

374
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,470
middle of this where we were running the

375
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:43,029
open V switch we were just monitoring

376
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:44,649
for instance the CP utilization of this

377
00:26:43,029 --> 00:26:46,830
open we switch but we're also monitoring

378
00:26:44,649 --> 00:26:49,689
the latency so we we took these two

379
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,240
matrix into a cart in order to benchmark

380
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:53,860
our system and the transcript the open

381
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,409
we switch in this case was just simple

382
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,789
there's just one rule for forwarding the

383
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:59,950
packets and the rest is about drawing

384
00:26:57,789 --> 00:27:01,299
and you have all these this kind of

385
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:03,100
setting everywhere I mean if you have

386
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:05,168
firewalls if you have simple forwarding

387
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,789
rules on hyper biases we're open V

388
00:27:05,169 --> 00:27:09,039
switch is mainly running this is

389
00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:11,169
something you can see there and the goal

390
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:13,090
was done to find a network traffic

391
00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:15,700
configuration that actually maximizes

392
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:18,418
the CPU latency in this case so on the

393
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,419
next slide please

394
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,049
the point is that of course this is all

395
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:25,600
what we know that it's not so easy

396
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:28,210
actually to generate network traffic

397
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,399
because the the configuration space is

398
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,629
huge in complex it's coming simply from

399
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,539
the number of packets you are sending

400
00:27:31,629 --> 00:27:36,610
over time so you can just decide to send

401
00:27:34,539 --> 00:27:38,559
between 1,000 to 5,000 packets and see

402
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:39,908
what does it mean also how do you send

403
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,460
the packets over time so what are the

404
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:44,470
batch sizes so should you send one

405
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,960
packet per time we should send multiples

406
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,519
or two to emulate bursts and also what

407
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,989
should be there like that the packet

408
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:52,029
inter arrival time so should it be one

409
00:27:49,989 --> 00:27:53,980
millisecond should be 30 milliseconds so

410
00:27:52,029 --> 00:27:55,960
on and then when you go to the protocols

411
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:58,149
you can say which protocol should use

412
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:00,580
should you do a VLAN tagging so you use

413
00:27:58,149 --> 00:28:02,049
it and the point here because if you're

414
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,759
trusting about the poor header you could

415
00:28:02,049 --> 00:28:06,190
say that you have opportunities like

416
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,499
options through to the number of many

417
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,509
bits so here's still the human is

418
00:28:08,499 --> 00:28:12,159
somehow involved

419
00:28:09,509 --> 00:28:13,929
so we also believe that the human cannot

420
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,859
replace completely we still need to

421
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,559
start somewhere

422
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:19,658
and without like the human also being in

423
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:21,039
this loop would be might or might be

424
00:28:19,659 --> 00:28:23,409
quite hard for the machine to find

425
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,210
anything so the human still needs to set

426
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:27,269
lists and these are also the parameters

427
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:31,239
we then used in our relation this

428
00:28:27,269 --> 00:28:36,369
scenario here so next slide you have two

429
00:28:31,239 --> 00:28:39,159
minutes to conclude okay so what we

430
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:40,480
appear is the measurement loop so we

431
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,759
have the traffic generator we have the

432
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,980
beasts which we have done these

433
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,480
measurement points and they will be

434
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:48,820
automatically learning actually the

435
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,590
performance model and this is the whole

436
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:55,899
measurement so next slide in the end

437
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,369
what you want to have is the black box

438
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:59,289
is the open a switch and we want to know

439
00:28:57,369 --> 00:29:00,549
how the performance model works after

440
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:02,529
the measurements over time so this is

441
00:29:00,549 --> 00:29:06,759
what we're doing continuously so next

442
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:08,320
light what is then happening as as you

443
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,059
see here there is a belief in the

444
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,428
performance model in the first iteration

445
00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:15,279
it looks like that there's no decision

446
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:17,980
or any traffic confirmation but when we

447
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,759
have multiple iterations we see how we

448
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:23,590
can learn this to be um behavior of our

449
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:26,019
open be switch this is what you see

450
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:28,809
after like hydration 25 and you see also

451
00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:29,080
there that for some configurations if

452
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:35,379
you

453
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:37,928
the station is quite so next like and in

454
00:29:35,379 --> 00:29:40,090
the end it's actually not fabulous

455
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:43,539
though what we got from a grid search is

456
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:46,168
that setting specific Network

457
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:48,730
configurations you have really drastic

458
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:50,769
difference in the CPU performance models

459
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:55,059
so when you look at the two crosses on

460
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:56,980
the next slide what is interesting here

461
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:58,899
that for instance when you send 5,000

462
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:00,940
packets with an interval time of one

463
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:02,379
millisecond the civilization is quite

464
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:05,649
hot when you're sending four thousand

465
00:30:02,379 --> 00:30:06,730
packets that civilization is quite low

466
00:30:05,649 --> 00:30:09,070
so when you're sending four thousand

467
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:11,470
Pegasus it's much higher and it just

468
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,989
depends on the inter arrival time of the

469
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:15,399
packets here and we're surprised now

470
00:30:13,989 --> 00:30:18,009
here's that sending actually less

471
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,889
network packets over time leads to much

472
00:30:18,009 --> 00:30:23,950
higher utilization difference of more

473
00:30:20,889 --> 00:30:26,939
than 20% and why is it this happening

474
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:29,289
this is what we see on the next slide

475
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:31,450
the point about the openness which is

476
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:34,509
that whenever you are sending a rule

477
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,129
that for in it's inserting a rule for

478
00:30:34,509 --> 00:30:38,019
this packet track and when you're

479
00:30:36,129 --> 00:30:40,119
sending packets from multiple for

480
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:42,009
instance IP subdomains then it's

481
00:30:40,119 --> 00:30:44,678
inserting rules for all these subdomains

482
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:47,109
and there's a timer for these rules

483
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,299
because the space of the rules is not

484
00:30:47,109 --> 00:30:51,460
endless that is always refreshed and

485
00:30:49,299 --> 00:30:56,499
this time an obvious descent to set to

486
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:57,850
10 seconds so next slide so what is

487
00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:00,220
happening if you are now sending the

488
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:03,039
packets just after this timer is that

489
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:05,830
before the time I am actually the timer

490
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,269
triggers that we remove the rule so the

491
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,549
open we switch is going through the data

492
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:11,710
structures removing a rule actually in

493
00:31:09,549 --> 00:31:13,600
this case going through n like entries

494
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,249
and then slightly is ascending Network

495
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,049
received slightly after these 10 seconds

496
00:31:15,249 --> 00:31:19,059
again then it has to insert these rules

497
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:20,649
again so thereby we are always

498
00:31:19,059 --> 00:31:22,389
triggering for instance with 5,000

499
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:24,699
packets every 2 milliseconds this

500
00:31:22,389 --> 00:31:26,469
operation and this operation is a very

501
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,700
costly operation in a Linux kernel of

502
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:29,980
course in the setting with a mean of

503
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,749
location a before we switch which is

504
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:34,899
leading them to the high CPU utilization

505
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:39,340
as what we have seen before

506
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:41,739
so next slide so what we can finally see

507
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:42,110
here is net bore in action versus for

508
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,760
instance

509
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:46,070
random search and interesting part is

510
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,790
that a random search is still somehow

511
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:51,980
the state of the ants Network is for one

512
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:53,809
to four network configuration no traffic

513
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:55,730
configuration used here always farsta

514
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:58,580
and always better and more interestingly

515
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:59,870
after even like 50 I duration so when

516
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,879
you are continuously measuring for

517
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,889
instance over Oakland we switch we have

518
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,440
already a 24 percent higher civilization

519
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:08,179
and we thereby could somehow discover

520
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:13,730
this week's code in our implementation

521
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:15,020
of the open V switch so next slide this

522
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:17,120
is actually now where I can already

523
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,280
conclude so what we what we have the

524
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,320
idea is that we want to generate or that

525
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,330
we want to have in adversary inputs to

526
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,730
find weak spots or security holes and

527
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,189
this should help us to make our systems

528
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,049
more ballot proof and ideas we need to

529
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,910
use concepts like network to receive

530
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:35,389
continuous feedback about solutions and

531
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:37,640
implementations the use case is here so

532
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,770
we use the Bayesian optimization based

533
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:42,110
data-driven approach to generate these

534
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:43,549
network traffic configurations and what

535
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:45,770
we saw is like we can find these

536
00:32:43,549 --> 00:32:48,500
challenging traffic configurations very

537
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,660
efficiently and we can use it to either

538
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:53,390
maximize but also to minimize like CPU

539
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,340
latency the open questions we still see

540
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,110
is that of course the speeding actually

541
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,780
the machine means in general that it

542
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:01,040
generalizes also does it scale or what

543
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:02,809
are the alternatives because for

544
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:04,750
instance patient optimization itself so

545
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:06,740
machine running itself has also

546
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,169
configuration parameters which you need

547
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:13,640
to tune in order to make it efficient so

548
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:17,780
next slide these are the references on

549
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:19,669
next slide I just would like to thank

550
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,730
you and would be happy to answer your

551
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,730
questions

552
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:32,290
thank you undress so any question so one

553
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,290
question

554
00:33:34,269 --> 00:33:39,239
of damage this is really interesting

555
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:42,999
work and I saw a draft from Comcast

556
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:44,379
that was reading some of the questions

557
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,899
and requirements that you're answering

558
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:50,498
in your work I was just trying to find

559
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:53,228
out what is what is the draft to point

560
00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:55,989
you to that and you might you know then

561
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:57,989
work on this together in the ITF thank

562
00:33:55,989 --> 00:34:01,320
you I'm on the list

563
00:33:57,989 --> 00:34:01,320
thank you okay

564
00:34:02,229 --> 00:34:08,918
so thank you in dress we have to move to

565
00:34:05,589 --> 00:34:12,819
the next presentation so thank you again

566
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:19,679
for joining yeah earlier this morning in

567
00:34:12,819 --> 00:34:19,679
your home will can you come in front

568
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:33,668
hello everyone this is really from Poway

569
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:40,179
so today I'm glad to present you about

570
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:48,569
the progress and status of SC icd-9 so

571
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:52,839
this is a group activity active in se so

572
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:55,149
next so basically given the time is so

573
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:56,799
limited I only have five minutes for

574
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:59,259
transitions so please ask a question

575
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:01,270
after the presentation I mean I have

576
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,789
three minutes to answer your question so

577
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,460
I will go through by first about value

578
00:35:03,789 --> 00:35:09,069
and division second about the status and

579
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,200
progress and also introduces something

580
00:35:09,069 --> 00:35:15,339
active other activities we have already

581
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,589
done so basically uh I guess given that

582
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:20,470
I am NOT the first time to present this

583
00:35:17,589 --> 00:35:24,069
actually I presented this about the

584
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:27,279
progress and status one year earlier so

585
00:35:24,069 --> 00:35:29,529
the I I think now everybody are almost

586
00:35:27,279 --> 00:35:32,650
agreed about the business value of

587
00:35:29,529 --> 00:35:35,680
network intelligence or network AI given

588
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:38,799
that the network becoming complex in

589
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,259
terms of protocol and management so we

590
00:35:38,799 --> 00:35:43,660
really needed the AI to assist the human

591
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:48,100
beings to do the configuration operation

592
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:50,410
and management so we figure out

593
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:52,930
that we can achieve better and network

594
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:56,080
experience for both the operators as

595
00:35:52,930 --> 00:36:01,089
well as enterprises and also for the 5g

596
00:35:56,080 --> 00:36:05,819
IOT perspective q @q s or QE perspective

597
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:08,980
this is all helpful so I've listed the

598
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:14,170
actually this this is the Charter

599
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:18,880
similar try idea RDF group that we did

600
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:22,090
this ice G was founded in 2017 February

601
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,640
and ever be beginning a the focus a

602
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,850
study the use cases about how do we

603
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:31,029
utilize AI to network operation and

604
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:34,270
management and we propose that we can we

605
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:37,660
may add in closed loop AI mechanism and

606
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:43,090
based on the Countess of where metadata

607
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:47,129
driven policies and also in besides use

608
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:50,530
cases study we also have generated AI

609
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:54,670
abstracted abstracted architecture as

610
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:58,750
well as we have some parks ongoing and I

611
00:36:54,670 --> 00:37:01,540
will explain that later to you and uh to

612
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:04,480
be mentioned that in early this year so

613
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,360
the ice tree extend is lifetime to

614
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,640
another two years and we will continue

615
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,520
about the park the reference pond and

616
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,240
some other activities I will expand on

617
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,240
you two later

618
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:20,200
so this is a one page in a nutshell

619
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,720
about the summary so only figure you can

620
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,750
see that we already have more than 50

621
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:30,100
companies joined us including 14

622
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:32,280
operators and the we have official teams

623
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:34,420
and the parks review teams from

624
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,390
operators and vendors and Research

625
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:40,900
Institute we already studied the 21 use

626
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:43,569
cases in five big categories for example

627
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:47,770
we have an instructor management network

628
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:52,540
or network operator and network security

629
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:54,400
related so I'm sure that if you if you

630
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:55,890
want to look at the use cases and this

631
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,360
is the right place that you can find

632
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,660
enough use cases that might be useful

633
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:02,100
for your network and also based on these

634
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,520
views

635
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:09,060
and the requirement to relate to that

636
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:13,140
you know I already started six parks

637
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:15,660
so each boxes are supported by one big

638
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:16,710
operators and including vendors and

639
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,200
Research Institute

640
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:22,860
they are already three are completed and

641
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,980
I always explain one in later slides and

642
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:28,500
beside those ones I've listed all the

643
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:31,920
ongoing and the finished work items

644
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,660
meaning like a drafting F so we have use

645
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,810
cases the requirement and the

646
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:39,390
terminology framework and recently we

647
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:43,620
have categorizations and the data

648
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:48,960
mechanisms work so already published the

649
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:51,720
six work items and one white papers and

650
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,480
this is because I already imagine the

651
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,480
use cases so this page gives you a very

652
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,950
quick lens up to the requirement and the

653
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,750
architecture given that I have so

654
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:03,899
limited time so if you want to know the

655
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:07,440
details are having a almost a 100 page

656
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,550
of slices to explain you in detail so

657
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,320
for the requirement that we basically we

658
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:17,370
categorize the requirement into three

659
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:19,110
different categories so this is service

660
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:21,359
network requirements functional and

661
00:39:19,110 --> 00:39:22,950
non-functional requirements and for the

662
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,560
architecture what I showed you this

663
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:27,950
screen is a very abstract 'iv high level

664
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:30,720
architecture and we also have a detailed

665
00:39:27,950 --> 00:39:34,080
with reference point architecture in the

666
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,140
document and also we have three actually

667
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:40,620
the its two mode and its three ways of

668
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,339
the using the applying architecture to

669
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:48,720
the existing network system including

670
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:51,510
and F we are and other architectures to

671
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,910
get aligned with and this is another

672
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:57,930
work that we just published in this

673
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:59,819
month is about today okay so the the

674
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,490
categorizations we learned a little bit

675
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,540
about from the vehicle I mean Auto

676
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:09,720
driving autumn of the normal driving

677
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:11,640
levels designed it by SJ from America

678
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,120
and this is the way that we can

679
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,140
categorize the level of the AI applied

680
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,308
to the net

681
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,078
based on different parameters and this

682
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:24,599
is the park number one is called

683
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,130
intelligence network slicing lifecycle

684
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,380
management basically we do the

685
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:30,709
prediction based on the traffic pattern

686
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,479
and we adjusted the network slice

687
00:40:30,709 --> 00:40:38,459
according to the result and we already

688
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:41,459
demo this in different events including

689
00:40:38,459 --> 00:40:44,879
the latest one is in haggis in Deer

690
00:40:41,459 --> 00:40:46,709
congra World Congress and these are

691
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,589
those are some other activities that we

692
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:51,089
have workshops and the forum and some

693
00:40:49,589 --> 00:40:54,680
drawing the conference's with other

694
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:57,509
activities such as Europe project or

695
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:01,440
some research against did some research

696
00:40:57,509 --> 00:41:04,289
activities and the next meeting will be

697
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:07,529
next month in France they had caught her

698
00:41:04,289 --> 00:41:10,410
se and the yoga come to trial and the

699
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:12,269
year now I already send a liaison last

700
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:14,549
year and we will probably send the

701
00:41:12,269 --> 00:41:17,788
ladies in this year - Emma Archana we

702
00:41:14,549 --> 00:41:20,519
hope that we can jointly I mean work

703
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:23,069
together and to create more and useful

704
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:31,979
and practical valuable deliverables

705
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:34,109
together thank you and any questions ok

706
00:41:31,979 --> 00:41:36,660
if you have any question you may contact

707
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:39,420
me offline my email is out here thank

708
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:53,819
you thank you thank you will so next

709
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:56,969
week here is I'll present a bit the the

710
00:41:53,819 --> 00:41:58,499
link between it ccsm activity and the

711
00:41:56,969 --> 00:42:02,009
work that could be done in energy on

712
00:41:58,499 --> 00:42:04,410
artificial intelligence at GSM is not a

713
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:06,209
standardization group doing per se

714
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:08,549
artificial intelligence for networks but

715
00:42:06,209 --> 00:42:10,529
it's more around self managing and zero

716
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:12,779
touch network management Network

717
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:14,309
automation and in that space we are

718
00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:17,400
using some attitude intelligence

719
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:19,769
techniques for the sake of time I will

720
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,969
not read very rapidly over this slice

721
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:23,308
but if you want you have some

722
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:25,660
information about the IHG that is

723
00:42:23,309 --> 00:42:27,549
currently running this

724
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,089
the same architecture so it's a

725
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,740
management architecture service based

726
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:36,220
service-oriented management architecture

727
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:38,979
and you have a set of different set of

728
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,129
services management functions especially

729
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:45,250
for the registration for controlling

730
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:47,680
resources for history Asian and I will

731
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,049
make a focus on specific set of services

732
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,799
that are we think relevant to AI in

733
00:42:50,049 --> 00:42:55,599
network so in the currently defined set

734
00:42:53,799 --> 00:42:59,319
of services in the architecture what I

735
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,440
try to highlight in red the set of

736
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:06,089
services typically of interest for doing

737
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:08,530
AI networks so we have data collection

738
00:43:06,089 --> 00:43:10,119
analytics and intelligence this is the

739
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:12,520
terminology we are using in the SM so

740
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,000
you have it per domain or end-to-end and

741
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:17,680
you have also at the bottom right in the

742
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,750
dashed line that our services which are

743
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,348
typically the infrastructure for

744
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:25,240
monitoring and telemetry so going into

745
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:28,329
just a few details about those those

746
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,939
groups so domain analytics this is where

747
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:33,549
you can get together all the services

748
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,619
that will realize processing over some

749
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:37,930
data so the domain analytics provides

750
00:43:35,619 --> 00:43:39,640
domain-specific insights and generate

751
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,440
domain-specific predictions based on

752
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,470
data collected by the domain collection

753
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,630
and also data that can be from from

754
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:48,220
other sources this is in support of

755
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:50,710
different types of analytics so you

756
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:52,209
cannot generate some insight understand

757
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,549
what's happened in the past and why it

758
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:58,480
happened insights and for sites also to

759
00:43:54,549 --> 00:44:00,369
be able to predict future future events

760
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,319
for the network so this is also known if

761
00:44:00,369 --> 00:44:05,020
you see the other terminology for

762
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:07,420
analytics descriptive diagnostics and

763
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,920
predictive analytics the prescriptive

764
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,650
part of analytics it will be more

765
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,480
handled by the intelligence but just to

766
00:44:11,650 --> 00:44:15,460
summarize in analytics we have a set of

767
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:18,670
services you take data input and you try

768
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:21,970
to generate some some insights India in

769
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:23,770
the output domain intelligence this is

770
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:26,529
where you have services responsible for

771
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:29,170
driving the closed loop automation so

772
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:30,760
this is in support I mean by supporting

773
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,430
variable degrees of automated

774
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:35,750
decision-making and human oversight and

775
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:38,240
we came for fully autonomous

776
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:40,310
economic networking so this is Twilight

777
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,868
a bit what we'll was mentioning with the

778
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:45,109
different levels of autonomy networks

779
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:46,880
you have typical category of types of

780
00:44:45,109 --> 00:44:49,520
what the intelligence services can

781
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,319
output or can be used so for decisions

782
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,730
report for decision-making or for action

783
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:55,849
planning this is try to highlight a bit

784
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:57,980
you have different forms of AI either to

785
00:44:55,849 --> 00:45:00,579
learn on data but also to reason on data

786
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:03,020
to make plans and decisions and also to

787
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:06,170
to handle the aspect of knowledge

788
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:07,880
management and knowledge religion so the

789
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:09,740
decision support services enable

790
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,720
decision-making via technology such as

791
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:13,279
such as artificial intelligence machine

792
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:14,899
learning and knowledge management so

793
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,640
this is where we see with the Manila

794
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:18,920
analytics and domain intelligence where

795
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,618
we will have use of specific AI

796
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,119
techniques again in the SME we not

797
00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:26,540
designed such techniques but we will

798
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:29,390
provide kind of agents of services where

799
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,400
you can plug the different intelligence

800
00:45:29,390 --> 00:45:33,560
mechanism and make them use in a more

801
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:37,310
general self management and architecture

802
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:39,740
and finally data services this is a kind

803
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:42,380
of common layers a common layer where we

804
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:44,240
have data services provide means of data

805
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:46,609
persistence and enable data sharing

806
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,259
between the different consumer of data

807
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:49,670
so essentially domain analytics and

808
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:50,990
domain intelligence across the

809
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,930
management domain so this is a kind of

810
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,299
reusable mechanism that any subscriber

811
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:58,220
to the data service system can have to

812
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:01,359
collect the right set of data we think

813
00:45:58,220 --> 00:46:04,189
this is a key enabler also for fueling

814
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,630
data analytics and intelligence because

815
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:09,020
as we have seen in the previous

816
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:10,609
presentation access to the data to the

817
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:12,829
right type of data at the right place

818
00:46:10,609 --> 00:46:15,170
also extending with metadata this is

819
00:46:12,829 --> 00:46:19,210
essential to be able to perform useful

820
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:22,579
machine learning and AI algorithm

821
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:25,400
another area where we see the

822
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:28,099
application of AI in network management

823
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:30,560
this is another part of the there is

824
00:46:28,099 --> 00:46:33,020
some activities on closed loop so in the

825
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,960
lesson we are working on designing and

826
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,390
providing to provide interoperable

827
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,710
closed-loop components so not the closed

828
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:41,259
loop as a whole but at least the

829
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,150
different parts you see like a

830
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:47,440
observation orientation decision and

831
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:49,140
action to provide this as standard

832
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:50,820
component on

833
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,710
interfaces outside of the standard

834
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:54,630
components and so where they can use

835
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:57,090
also some parts of intelligence so you

836
00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:59,040
can see that for instance the analytics

837
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:01,500
and intelligence services will be reused

838
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,240
as part of the decision process to close

839
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:07,650
the loop in such a social representation

840
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,160
so that's all for this short

841
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:12,300
presentation if you want to look at the

842
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,160
architecture this is a published and

843
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:16,500
public document and we are also working

844
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,410
on the so-called closed-loop documents

845
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:30,750
where we will have more embedded use of

846
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:33,450
AI so this is now question actually

847
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,970
edition point is that you know and the

848
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:38,609
CSM will have a co-locating meeting

849
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:46,890
together in December so if you're

850
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:48,960
interested you can join us thank you yes

851
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:55,410
so we continue xanex presentation and

852
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:57,540
it's still low yeah pause the reason I'm

853
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,810
participating is that SM Roop this is

854
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:04,080
another group not a thermalization group

855
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:06,630
it's called it's an emerging technology

856
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:08,610
initiative in I Triple E Comstock called

857
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,520
metric intelligence I'm here

858
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:14,670
representing this this technology

859
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:16,140
initiative on behalf of the the chairs

860
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,490
the officers because they could not make

861
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:22,290
it especially due to the time difference

862
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:26,939
for remote presentation so ETA e ni it's

863
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:30,210
a kind of place order or community where

864
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:33,240
you to encourage research on metric

865
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:35,310
intelligence to happen from the I Triple

866
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:37,379
E point of view so it's a new community

867
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:39,390
rather new community initiative focused

868
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:42,630
on network intelligence it was approved

869
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,720
by concept December two years ago and it

870
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,730
has been renewed again

871
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,319
so it generates from and produced a

872
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:51,320
technical committee in I Triple E and

873
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,660
having some reshuffling that were

874
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:56,910
targeting autonomic communication so we

875
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:59,040
build on top of that and we had also a

876
00:48:56,910 --> 00:49:01,049
new a new view a new vision of what

877
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,250
network intelligence could be or for

878
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:06,490
networking

879
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:08,710
so quickly on the mission so this kind

880
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:10,868
of technical committee in I Triple E are

881
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:13,480
here not to actually do the research but

882
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:15,670
to foster the research to happen so it's

883
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,799
in support and 2nded and those research

884
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,660
towards embedding artificial

885
00:49:17,799 --> 00:49:22,450
intelligence in future software define

886
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:26,109
and programmable foreign in planes so

887
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:28,660
the aim is to support and endorse and

888
00:49:26,109 --> 00:49:30,880
enable faster deployment dynamic

889
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:34,269
provisioning and to an orchestration i

890
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,579
resiliency availability so you have a an

891
00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:38,410
idea of where we can see this AI

892
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:43,569
technology to be used and to make

893
00:49:38,410 --> 00:49:47,230
benefits in the kind of description of

894
00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:49,269
the topics of the ETI set of topics that

895
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:52,150
are it's not limited to but we wanted to

896
00:49:49,269 --> 00:49:54,669
highlight key areas of interest for this

897
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:56,890
group so related to for instance

898
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:59,740
internalized networking which can also

899
00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,538
home energy use of different learning

900
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:03,459
techniques and how different learning

901
00:50:01,539 --> 00:50:05,170
techniques are useful or needs to be

902
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:07,950
used or could be used in a tracking

903
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:10,269
environment resource allocation

904
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:13,240
relationship to self management and

905
00:50:10,269 --> 00:50:15,430
autonomic types of networks learning and

906
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:19,359
reasoning techniques so you have a set

907
00:50:15,430 --> 00:50:22,480
of different topics and it's a can be

908
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:25,720
continuously evolved this is a just - I

909
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,509
like the responsible of this eti so this

910
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:32,740
is just a role to organize the group not

911
00:50:28,509 --> 00:50:34,269
to to steal the group in fact so if you

912
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,279
have a questions you can contact any one

913
00:50:34,269 --> 00:50:38,740
of those officers to join a group or to

914
00:50:36,279 --> 00:50:41,680
propose activities in the scope of this

915
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:44,950
ETI the participation is open to

916
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,328
everyone it's not very costly there is a

917
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,519
website and mailing list so you can

918
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:50,319
subscribe to the mailing list and on the

919
00:50:48,519 --> 00:50:51,519
website you have all relevant

920
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,650
information we try to keep it very

921
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,430
up-to-date with the different events

922
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:59,589
workshops special issues datasets that

923
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,930
are being brought by the community so

924
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:05,799
that it's still always relevant in terms

925
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:08,169
of timing a quick view on some ongoing

926
00:51:05,799 --> 00:51:08,950
activity so since it's already two years

927
00:51:08,170 --> 00:51:10,750
old

928
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,669
ETI we have already in the past done

929
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,130
some some workshop special issues but to

930
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:15,850
show it the current activity there will

931
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:17,200
be the third

932
00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:18,610
international workshop on network

933
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:21,310
intelligence which will be co-located

934
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:23,440
with actually infocomm reference

935
00:51:21,310 --> 00:51:25,060
conference next year this is the second

936
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,120
time we co-locate with infocomm last

937
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:31,779
year was very successful workshop and it

938
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:34,330
was also a nigga with a special issue in

939
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:36,130
a journal so we still have time to

940
00:51:34,330 --> 00:51:37,990
provide your contribution to this to

941
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,660
this workshop there will be also

942
00:51:37,990 --> 00:51:42,549
deferred AI net conference which is

943
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:44,770
co-located with the mpls World Congress

944
00:51:42,550 --> 00:51:48,460
in Paris this will be a first quarter

945
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:49,930
next during Paris you can see provide

946
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:54,250
some abstract if you like but the

947
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:55,960
program is nearly closed now so it is

948
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:58,210
also supporting the organization of this

949
00:51:55,960 --> 00:52:00,580
conference there will be also the third

950
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:03,940
applied machine learning days which is a

951
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:07,150
very broad machine learning type of

952
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:09,250
conference in Rosanne and we have there

953
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:10,930
a dedicated track on Aon networks that

954
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,290
week organized with some of the officers

955
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:15,910
and other members of the DTI this will

956
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,880
be end of January in Lausanne it's a

957
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:20,259
great event if you want to to know and

958
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,760
to connect with people working in

959
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:24,300
machine learning but it is not Network

960
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:28,180
specific you have a eye for multiple

961
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:30,580
domains application we also active in

962
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,100
some standardization activity especially

963
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:34,960
what we do here in IETF and also in

964
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:37,299
connection with energy but as you have

965
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,810
seen our so people in HC in different

966
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:42,760
groups and in I Triple E we are also

967
00:52:40,810 --> 00:52:44,500
working on a set of different future

968
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,390
special issues so you can have the

969
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:51,550
information on the website of the of the

970
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:53,740
ETI then to conclude a very important

971
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:55,930
aspect that I mean we have learned

972
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:57,850
through working in this eg I also with

973
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,500
the members and different studies that

974
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,810
have been reported it's on the so called

975
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,930
Network data a key activity area for

976
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:08,020
this ETI network data is characterized

977
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:09,970
by a high dimensional space we have

978
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:13,170
hundreds of thousands of dimensions to

979
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:16,540
consider when we run the models numerous

980
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:18,730
set of KPIs or measurements and contrast

981
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:24,130
to track so this is not like in other

982
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:28,120
fields a very simple area it's very a

983
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:30,240
multitude of different data to track the

984
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:32,799
data also network is very

985
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,200
in the different segments you can go

986
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,330
into very different types of data for

987
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,220
the same thing in different access in

988
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:41,920
different segments like the access the

989
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:44,348
core data center also proto ecology

990
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,030
related to these different segments the

991
00:53:44,349 --> 00:53:47,589
shape of the data is organized quite

992
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:51,190
differently so it's also a challenge

993
00:53:47,589 --> 00:53:53,589
when you want to organize your data the

994
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:56,680
variety of the types and formats of data

995
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:59,650
is also huge you have logs different

996
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:02,500
types of logs metrics alarms trouble

997
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:05,500
tickets KPIs configuration files so the

998
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:09,070
variety of what data is also very huge

999
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:12,190
compared to other fields and so to have

1000
00:54:09,070 --> 00:54:13,990
an organization of those data to be able

1001
00:54:12,190 --> 00:54:16,000
to be exploited automatically by a

1002
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:19,149
traditional intelligence technique is a

1003
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,849
huge huge preparation effort just before

1004
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:24,130
you enter into the real problem of

1005
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:27,130
solving something with which AI so I

1006
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,540
think this is I will don't say that you

1007
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:30,460
know the field is not this way but I

1008
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:34,660
think in network it's very very

1009
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:38,500
important dimension and this is a very

1010
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:41,250
big challenge in I mean today a very

1011
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:44,380
large adoption of AI and having more

1012
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:47,440
powerful results also so the track

1013
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:49,990
intelligence each eye tries to make this

1014
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,099
aware in this community and so that

1015
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:54,279
everyone in the community can work

1016
00:54:51,099 --> 00:54:56,950
towards this literal data challenge to

1017
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:59,890
exchange practices and knowledge and so

1018
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:02,080
to bring together these data sets and

1019
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:04,200
strategies from the track data I think

1020
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:08,259
that's the last slide

1021
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:11,379
thank you Laura comment questions so I

1022
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:13,420
want for myself as an individual so yes

1023
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:18,040
I agree on the last slide with a network

1024
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,839
that challenge multi faceted problems so

1025
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,270
what is actually is easy role of the

1026
00:55:19,839 --> 00:55:25,119
what you would be the the action of each

1027
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:28,359
guy in this field in this key activity

1028
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:31,570
are we as you mentioned so so far it's

1029
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:33,430
not organized we don't have clear path

1030
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:37,020
or roadmap how to end all this key

1031
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:38,740
activity but I mean at least

1032
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:41,230
understanding that this is a key

1033
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,939
challenge was the first step it was

1034
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:43,540
reported for a set of activities by

1035
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,730
different

1036
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,859
members active in the group what they

1037
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:50,410
have done in a data with operational

1038
00:55:47,859 --> 00:55:52,119
networks say they really had work for a

1039
00:55:50,410 --> 00:55:54,700
couple of years to collect different use

1040
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,580
cases and try to not only work on the

1041
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,540
use cases but take a step back and say

1042
00:55:56,580 --> 00:56:00,160
what have we learned what was the

1043
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:01,750
challenge is when we have worked on this

1044
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:05,859
use case is not to solve the use cases

1045
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:07,600
but to get the data created data so

1046
00:56:05,859 --> 00:56:09,549
everything that this was preparation

1047
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:11,109
work for before actually solving the

1048
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:12,460
case and this was just like knowledge

1049
00:56:11,109 --> 00:56:14,759
and we want to share this first

1050
00:56:12,460 --> 00:56:17,560
understanding of what the challenges is

1051
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:20,619
what however you organize that in the

1052
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:28,180
each is still up as an export and the

1053
00:56:20,619 --> 00:56:29,980
next step demographic so when you say

1054
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:33,759
labeling Network data is a huge effort

1055
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:35,320
I believe that v2 they have basic sets

1056
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,300
that are people already following

1057
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:42,010
instead and using that as a starting

1058
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:44,410
point and try to create a classification

1059
00:56:42,010 --> 00:56:46,660
of that that could be helpful would be a

1060
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:48,368
good starting point because in my

1061
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:49,990
conversations with network operators

1062
00:56:48,369 --> 00:56:52,300
especially the network operation center

1063
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:55,000
people they are saying these are

1064
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:57,730
important things to us you know for this

1065
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:02,560
areas of the network and at least it

1066
00:56:57,730 --> 00:57:04,990
gives you some starting point when you

1067
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:06,940
know I was my whole life a vendor trying

1068
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:10,089
to get everything and guessing what is

1069
00:57:06,940 --> 00:57:14,590
really needed what is useful it's a you

1070
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:17,260
know it's like a bingo and trying to

1071
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:20,170
take that and use this as front starting

1072
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:23,740
points for further evaluation might be a

1073
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:27,040
good idea it would help you know focus

1074
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:28,629
the the research area Thank You Dianna I

1075
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:31,029
fully agree with what you say that

1076
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:33,220
categorization on the operation side is

1077
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:35,290
essential and it's a multi-level effort

1078
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,270
because this is kind of one hand of the

1079
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:40,090
problem but also understanding the

1080
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:42,790
diversity of what is being collected and

1081
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:45,160
you understand I getting data I don't

1082
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:48,310
know what's the data his or the how can

1083
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:50,920
use it to reach to the operation using

1084
00:57:48,310 --> 00:57:54,100
the operation so this is a quite

1085
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:55,960
challenging activity ego developers I

1086
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:57,839
work for an operator but I have no idea

1087
00:57:55,960 --> 00:58:04,350
for my operation

1088
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:06,300
do so I'm not going no no no but there's

1089
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:08,940
a problem they don't talk to me not

1090
00:58:06,300 --> 00:58:11,220
seriously the no the point is that I

1091
00:58:08,940 --> 00:58:13,710
think that is for these and we have sat

1092
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:18,899
Somali for that I hope we will be able

1093
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:20,760
to report in Vancouver or very likely

1094
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:23,730
Madrid because the people working there

1095
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:28,740
will be working on these will be closer

1096
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:31,740
it's precisely about data source the

1097
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:34,410
description framework so what you can is

1098
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:37,790
you can use some metadata formats to

1099
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:40,410
tell what you are expecting to collect

1100
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:43,040
from my particular data source or what

1101
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:46,618
that that data source can provide I

1102
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,140
think I don't know I'm not aware I'm

1103
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:52,080
coming here is did you know the ETA is

1104
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:55,379
considering to initiate such an effort

1105
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:57,810
or this just note um I don't know yet I

1106
00:58:55,380 --> 00:59:00,720
mean this essentially this network data

1107
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:02,880
is reflecting some activity that for

1108
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:06,868
instance a man is doing in Iraq sorry I

1109
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:09,180
just only take the one question more

1110
00:59:06,869 --> 00:59:11,070
after but then you we can discuss after

1111
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:18,899
that J go if you want to know what could

1112
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:22,410
be the next step for that I know any

1113
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:26,760
organs one thing that I've done for

1114
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:30,259
quite a while is work with operations

1115
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:33,590
people at large brick and mortar

1116
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,240
enterprises and and one of the things

1117
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:39,600
there's two movements that I see that

1118
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:42,209
are very much at cross-purposes I think

1119
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,759
trying to collect network data and have

1120
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:48,210
network intelligence I totally support

1121
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,540
that but with all the encrypted

1122
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:54,930
protocols that we have and the push

1123
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:58,740
towards only being able to see of course

1124
00:59:54,930 --> 01:00:03,690
packet level data but but also metadata

1125
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:06,618
only at the endpoints it's a network

1126
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:09,150
based intelligence becomes quite

1127
01:00:06,619 --> 01:00:10,460
challenging so do you have thoughts

1128
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:13,200
around that

1129
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:17,520
okay so me personally not because this

1130
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,720
is not an area I'm looking into one part

1131
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,540
of the answer I can provide from my

1132
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:24,328
experience is a at least part of what we

1133
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:27,990
are doing here is not always use on user

1134
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:29,970
data or data traffic it's also mainly on

1135
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:33,930
management types of data so even if it's

1136
01:00:29,970 --> 01:00:36,270
encrypted or using authenticated

1137
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:37,859
communications we have access to some of

1138
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:40,079
the time in the logs for instance the

1139
01:00:37,859 --> 01:00:41,940
configuration files these are not in the

1140
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,270
user plain it's more from the operator

1141
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:47,250
use of data so this is more a I for

1142
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:49,829
network management I know there's a

1143
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:51,660
iPhone network in general but to answer

1144
01:00:49,829 --> 01:00:53,040
your question I know maybe Jean has more

1145
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:54,598
insights on that but this is not really

1146
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,359
not my field of expertise I cannot

1147
01:00:54,599 --> 01:01:07,500
really comment properly on that sure

1148
01:00:57,359 --> 01:01:22,619
yeah okay to move to the I think Vishnu

1149
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:29,040
is next come on can you hear me yes okay

1150
01:01:22,619 --> 01:01:31,290
great thank you so much my name is

1151
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:34,170
Vishnu I am here to give an update on

1152
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:36,720
i.t use work on machine learning for 5g

1153
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:39,000
you see my email ad there in case you

1154
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:42,000
have feedback questions you can write to

1155
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,210
me and this is the website below is the

1156
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,190
focus group website for machine learning

1157
01:01:45,210 --> 01:01:49,190
5g in ITU next slide please

1158
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:56,490
this is man agenda I will give a quick

1159
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:59,910
background there is an update of work

1160
01:01:56,490 --> 01:02:02,790
items in ITU this some some of it

1161
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:05,190
finished some of it ongoing and there is

1162
01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:07,259
also I will talk about networking a

1163
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:09,690
challenge that I to use planning to do

1164
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:13,290
and there is an update on students

1165
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:19,220
projects one of the initiatives that ITU

1166
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:19,220
is currently launched next like lists

1167
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:27,380
this is an update on current status of

1168
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:30,210
ideas work on machine learning for 5g

1169
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:33,480
the work items which are finished are

1170
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:36,540
here there is machine learning in future

1171
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:41,070
networks including IMT 2020 use cases

1172
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:45,240
this is approved this has been derived

1173
01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:50,250
from a large set of contributions to the

1174
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:55,770
ITU we have collated it may be tuned it

1175
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:59,040
and polished it and now it is approved

1176
01:02:55,770 --> 01:03:00,990
as a supplement 55 - wide or three one

1177
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:02,850
seven zero series it is currently in

1178
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:06,390
editing process and it will be published

1179
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:09,990
in a few weeks it will be available for

1180
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:13,589
public access you can access it by a

1181
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:16,439
guest account even non-members of ITT

1182
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:18,540
can access it in fact if once it is

1183
01:03:16,440 --> 01:03:21,650
published you can access it through

1184
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:24,810
Internet Google the next one is a

1185
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:26,280
architecture framework for integration

1186
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:29,400
of machine learning in future networks

1187
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:31,530
so this is published already as wide or

1188
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:34,680
three one seven two it is available free

1189
01:03:31,530 --> 01:03:38,369
of cost so you can download it from our

1190
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:41,879
website the framework for data handling

1191
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:44,850
to enable machine learning this is now

1192
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,890
currently in ITU approval process

1193
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:50,220
wideout three one seven four is the

1194
01:03:46,890 --> 01:03:52,890
number you need an ITU account to access

1195
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,509
it right now but if you once it is

1196
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:56,819
through the approval process it will be

1197
01:03:54,510 --> 01:04:01,619
published and it would be available

1198
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:04,260
again freely perfectly we also did some

1199
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:06,330
work on evaluating intelligence level of

1200
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:09,030
future networks this is a ninety

1201
01:04:06,330 --> 01:04:11,580
approval process it is y dot three one

1202
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:17,369
seven three next slide please

1203
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:21,509
I just wanted to give you a quick update

1204
01:04:17,369 --> 01:04:23,910
on the architecture framework don't go

1205
01:04:21,510 --> 01:04:26,280
into a lot of details but I want to call

1206
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:28,950
out some important parts of the

1207
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,680
architecture you see it is published

1208
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:34,290
already as I told you why dot 372 is

1209
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:36,020
available already I go from bottom to

1210
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:39,540
the top

1211
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:42,270
under Lee Network concept which on which

1212
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:44,940
we run the machine running pipelines you

1213
01:04:42,270 --> 01:04:47,430
can run multiple of these in the

1214
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:50,700
underlie networks for example 3gpp could

1215
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:52,950
be a Rundle a network for us I am T 2020

1216
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:55,740
architectures any of those could be an

1217
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:57,660
underlay Network for us ml pipeline

1218
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:59,879
gives us an abstraction for machine

1219
01:04:57,660 --> 01:05:05,430
learning how do you run different types

1220
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:07,500
of collection data sources and applying

1221
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:10,259
machine learning in the networks what

1222
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:12,510
are the input and output and models this

1223
01:05:10,260 --> 01:05:16,080
is abstracted by this machine learning

1224
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:19,290
and we heard from Andrea's earlier about

1225
01:05:16,080 --> 01:05:21,990
testing strategies sandbox gives us an

1226
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:24,930
environment to test and verify machine

1227
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:27,089
running it hosts a simulated ml underlay

1228
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:29,310
networks you can read the details in

1229
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,560
three one seven two on on the left side

1230
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:32,759
we have function Orchestrator which

1231
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,710
manages the machine learning

1232
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,230
functionality in the network these are

1233
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:41,180
the main concepts that we have in the

1234
01:05:37,230 --> 01:05:41,180
architecture framework next slide please

1235
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:48,569
this gives us the work items in progress

1236
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:50,370
ongoing optimization and deployment

1237
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:54,740
framework for machine learning models in

1238
01:05:50,370 --> 01:05:58,259
future networks this is ongoing as ml 5g

1239
01:05:54,740 --> 01:06:01,890
171 document it is freely available you

1240
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:03,810
need a guest account from the ITU you

1241
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:07,049
can create it in five minutes

1242
01:06:03,810 --> 01:06:10,560
ml marketplace integration in future

1243
01:06:07,050 --> 01:06:13,950
networks this is to address the need for

1244
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:15,720
some of our operator members who can who

1245
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:19,339
wants to host a machine learning

1246
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:21,890
marketplace integrated with the existing

1247
01:06:19,340 --> 01:06:24,810
marketplaces as internal or external

1248
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:27,180
marketplaces once again this is one

1249
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:29,880
sixty seven document and you can

1250

Vishnu r1

1256
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:47,220
thank you these are the lesson on

1257
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,079
collaborations we collaborate with ISO I

1258
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,930
see

1259
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,670
see on MPEG linux foundation we have

1260
01:06:50,930 --> 01:06:56,509
some projects running on model

1261
01:06:52,670 --> 01:07:00,190
optimization you heard from HC and i

1262
01:06:56,509 --> 01:07:03,319
earlier we have official as well as

1263
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:07,249
collaboration going on it with HC ni and

1264
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:10,130
the CSM we also collaborate with Oren on

1265
01:07:07,249 --> 01:07:13,459
machine learning metadata and as we

1266
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:17,299
speak sa 5tg PPS fi presentations are

1267
01:07:13,459 --> 01:07:19,549
going on similar to this we have next

1268
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:22,609
meeting coming up in March weekly

1269
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:26,450
conference calls are open and you don't

1270
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:29,749
need to be a member to join this you can

1271
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:31,868
contact me or use the website next slide

1272
01:07:29,749 --> 01:07:31,868
please

1273
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:38,359
about the AI challenge ITU is planning

1274
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:41,959
to run a AI challenge and we are looking

1275
01:07:38,359 --> 01:07:43,880
for partners there is a set of open data

1276
01:07:41,959 --> 01:07:46,519
which is published to us which is here

1277
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,390
and also details are worked out we can

1278
01:07:46,519 --> 01:07:53,118
discuss off sign next slide please

1279
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:55,430
I this is a unique initiative I to use

1280
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:58,549
offering guidance to university students

1281
01:07:55,430 --> 01:08:02,328
there is a web document which handles it

1282
01:07:58,549 --> 01:08:04,729
I coordinate the project in case you are

1283
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:07,359
interested please contact me we have

1284
01:08:04,729 --> 01:08:09,919
about 4 to 5 countries right now

1285
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:13,180
collaborating with a bit us to run these

1286
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:15,949
products next slide please

1287
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:18,380
these are the references as I told you

1288
01:08:15,949 --> 01:08:21,770
some of which require a member account

1289
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:24,230
but I have given you corresponding free

1290
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:26,409
documents as well you see here in

1291
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:32,750
brackets you can use either of these

1292
01:08:26,408 --> 01:08:35,448
that's it thank you so much thank you

1293
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:36,979
Vishnu I think we have to continue with

1294
01:08:35,448 --> 01:08:39,710
our in the next presentation because we

1295
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:42,290
are running out of time so thank you

1296
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:44,658
again and also to provide all these link

1297
01:08:42,290 --> 01:08:46,460
to documents and so that people can

1298
01:08:44,658 --> 01:08:49,818
access and can read it and then can

1299
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:55,118
continue to talk with you for email and

1300
01:08:49,819 --> 01:08:55,119
so on so thank you again thank you

1301
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:13,580
so next occur is a is me I will talk a

1302
01:09:10,609 --> 01:09:14,810
bit about the network AI challenge REI

1303
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:19,818
network challenge we don't have a name

1304
01:09:14,810 --> 01:09:21,650
but anyway so as you may have read on

1305
01:09:19,819 --> 01:09:23,210
the mailing list we are talking and we

1306
01:09:21,649 --> 01:09:23,479
are starting talking about what could be

1307
01:09:23,210 --> 01:09:26,359
a

1308
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:28,309
dkt challenge a challenge for networking

1309
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:30,500
so that some Institute's that we have

1310
01:09:28,310 --> 01:09:32,839
seen before that you see after in the

1311
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:35,210
next talk so we are maintaining kind of

1312
01:09:32,839 --> 01:09:37,339
pad to have where we could follow the

1313
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:39,049
different discussion we have basically

1314
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,759
we have some more free work items

1315
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:42,738
related to what could be the use case to

1316
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:45,830
having this challenges to be to be a

1317
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:47,540
exploited then if you know you schedule

1318
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:49,130
time if I owe you will run the challenge

1319
01:09:47,540 --> 01:09:50,988
in this case we need data you need a

1320
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:52,940
platform a B and so on and of course

1321
01:09:50,988 --> 01:09:55,809
then there is all the issues or let's

1322
01:09:52,939 --> 01:10:00,410
say a question all you please challenge

1323
01:09:55,810 --> 01:10:02,210
when it will be and so and so on I will

1324
01:10:00,410 --> 01:10:03,800
I will go faster sources the first item

1325
01:10:02,210 --> 01:10:05,510
was about the different use cases so we

1326
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,719
are different discussing different use

1327
01:10:05,510 --> 01:10:11,420
cases it's we don't have yet one or two

1328
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,610
use cases that we will doing the

1329
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:15,260
challenge that you will support so this

1330
01:10:13,610 --> 01:10:18,049
is more open this question so here is

1331
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:20,120
one use cases of reaching that I will

1332
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:22,550
really detail a bit afterwards well

1333
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:23,929
which is more 8200 to IBM and when those

1334
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,670
are rich in more classical with traffic

1335
01:10:23,929 --> 01:10:28,280
prediction and so on of course it's open

1336
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,510
to any discussion so if you want to

1337
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:32,050
bring some things that you think it can

1338
01:10:29,510 --> 01:10:35,420
be very interesting we are very open I

1339
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:36,830
will rapidly go through this let's say

1340
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,199
routing of forwarding and traffic

1341
01:10:36,830 --> 01:10:41,290
engineering use case so why we wanted to

1342
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:44,178
introduce this one this is a very a very

1343
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:46,850
well-known use a kind of use case so

1344
01:10:44,179 --> 01:10:48,650
there is no let's say a big fancy

1345
01:10:46,850 --> 01:10:50,420
application that will comes out from the

1346
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:52,910
challenge by the idea that you can be

1347
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,860
very understandable by anybody almost I

1348
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:56,900
mean so we can have people from other

1349
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:58,400
communities from AI communities I don't

1350
01:10:56,900 --> 01:11:00,410
need to need to be to be networks that

1351
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,739
pass I don't need for example to know

1352
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:05,780
what is the recent advances in network V

1353
01:11:03,739 --> 01:11:08,239
so goli just to basically forward

1354
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:10,550
packets into a graph or into a network

1355
01:11:08,239 --> 01:11:13,099
there is a retreat literature and these

1356
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:15,770
in this area and we already discussed

1357
01:11:13,100 --> 01:11:18,230
there but basically here's ideas that we

1358
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:20,300
would like to some hold thanks to the

1359
01:11:18,230 --> 01:11:21,830
artificial intelligence remove routing

1360
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:25,310
algorithm in a network of routing table

1361
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:28,100
and if you see what has been done for a

1362
01:11:25,310 --> 01:11:29,120
while in this area in its a lot of

1363
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:31,040
people have used for enforcement

1364
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:33,320
learning that you would packet over some

1365
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,000
interfaces or saw a path or link and

1366
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:37,639
then depending on every word you can

1367
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:42,590
adjust over time what will be the best

1368
01:11:37,640 --> 01:11:45,650
pass that is what is very often done as

1369
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:48,890
I hear such what could be a good good

1370
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:51,889
good new idea to try to exploit in this

1371
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:54,320
challenge is that even because if you

1372
01:11:51,890 --> 01:11:55,370
have some reinforcement clinic is deep

1373
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:57,290
reinforcement and let's say

1374
01:11:55,370 --> 01:11:58,670
reinforcement in general you need some

1375
01:11:57,290 --> 01:12:00,500
real summary right but sometimes you

1376
01:11:58,670 --> 01:12:02,360
cannot know what is this reward because

1377
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:05,960
you don't have access for it well once

1378
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:07,280
the packet arrives at user hand so of

1379
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:09,350
course you need at some point because if

1380
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,820
you have know at Leicester we were a new

1381
01:12:09,350 --> 01:12:12,320
insight about what could be the right

1382
01:12:10,820 --> 01:12:14,989
decision even mentioned on an exam

1383
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:16,910
cannot do but sometimes we could imagine

1384
01:12:14,989 --> 01:12:18,139
some alternating when you know what will

1385
01:12:16,910 --> 01:12:21,440
be zero rod and sometimes you don't know

1386
01:12:18,140 --> 01:12:23,239
what to find some strategy between the

1387
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:26,360
two or if you can known in advance in a

1388
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:29,150
kind of similarity platform and then

1389
01:12:26,360 --> 01:12:30,860
applying in more let's say we are we all

1390
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:34,070
operational and very not even it would

1391
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:35,809
be always an insemination so we will

1392
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:37,940
continue because it's a very easy the

1393
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:40,940
early stage we try to document this a

1394
01:12:37,940 --> 01:12:42,469
bit more so we are actively looking for

1395
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:48,559
volunteer to happen build is this use

1396
01:12:42,469 --> 01:12:50,180
case or also use case and yes we also a

1397
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,739
temperatures margin a well not only to

1398
01:12:50,180 --> 01:12:52,880
this use case or are still working on

1399
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:54,739
what could be the platform of cost

1400
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,090
dependence you use case we are also

1401
01:12:54,739 --> 01:13:00,200
looking to team up with other

1402
01:12:56,090 --> 01:13:03,050
communities for example obvious mff just

1403
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:06,110
in prison GD for all those or potential

1404
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:08,090
communities whose idea that was a good

1405
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:09,799
is not 12 let's say an enemy of G a a

1406
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:12,020
challenge it's to have a network a

1407
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:14,210
challenge that to quite to create a kind

1408
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:16,300
of labelled overall this kind of

1409
01:13:14,210 --> 01:13:19,739
challenge that are related to AI for

1410
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:21,780
buying network or whatever just that we

1411
01:13:19,739 --> 01:13:23,909
you can share the expertise share or

1412
01:13:21,780 --> 01:13:26,130
feedback altogether and also kind of

1413
01:13:23,909 --> 01:13:28,469
maybe a kind of public I would say a

1414
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:32,460
place that we can all advertise to each

1415
01:13:28,469 --> 01:13:33,869
other what you are doing and yeah the

1416
01:13:32,460 --> 01:13:36,630
that's it for me

1417
01:13:33,869 --> 01:13:46,558
so if you have any content on all of the

1418
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:48,599
time okay so any comment maybe to the

1419
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:51,679
child album from albums there for that

1420
01:13:48,599 --> 01:13:51,679
question I could have them there

1421
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:12,670
okay hello

1422
01:14:10,810 --> 01:14:15,700
so this is basically a proposal of a

1423
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:18,090
challenge that we are running right now

1424
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:20,530
[Music]

1425
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:22,090
first I would like to discuss a little

1426
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:25,080
bit what people do in computer vision

1427
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:28,630
because computer vision is a very

1428
01:14:25,080 --> 01:14:30,130
successful application of AI and then we

1429
01:14:28,630 --> 01:14:32,440
can try to learn what people in computer

1430
01:14:30,130 --> 01:14:34,990
vision do how do they challenge work and

1431
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:37,950
try to somehow learn something from them

1432
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:40,410
and apply it to network machine learning

1433
01:14:37,950 --> 01:14:42,760
so typically in in computer vision

1434
01:14:40,410 --> 01:14:44,559
that's very common for many challenges

1435
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:48,550
what they do is the organizers they

1436
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:50,350
provide a data set of with data the data

1437
01:14:48,550 --> 01:14:52,390
has labels meaning for instance this can

1438
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:54,160
be added a set of pictures where each

1439
01:14:52,390 --> 01:14:56,440
picture is labeled like okay this is a

1440
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:58,809
car that's a tree that's a chair that

1441
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:01,780
are pedestrian and then the participant

1442
01:14:58,810 --> 01:15:04,450
they take this data set and what they do

1443
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:06,040
is they should mineral networks meaning

1444
01:15:04,450 --> 01:15:07,990
that they build neural networks on their

1445
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:10,210
own and they try to build the neural

1446
01:15:07,990 --> 01:15:13,300
network that can better understand the

1447
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:14,860
data set and then the organizers they

1448
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:18,760
take all these neural networks and

1449
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:25,030
evaluate which one is able to model the

1450
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:26,950
data set with more accuracy and then

1451
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,990
they rank all these neural networks and

1452
01:15:26,950 --> 01:15:31,510
they decide who is the winner okay

1453
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:35,880
typically under on the third step what

1454
01:15:31,510 --> 01:15:39,610
you do is the organizers they have and

1455
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:41,320
they evaluate the the neural networks

1456
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:44,049
with a data set which which does not

1457
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,309
have labels for the participant so they

1458
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:50,260
don't see which are the labels and they

1459
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:52,770
cannot do like fitting too much to it

1460
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:56,200
and so on but this is the general

1461
01:15:52,770 --> 01:16:00,040
approach and this is like a set of lists

1462
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:01,870
of huge amount of challenges that they

1463
01:16:00,040 --> 01:16:03,250
are even adding computer vision and some

1464
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:05,590
of them they are quite prestigious

1465
01:16:03,250 --> 01:16:08,680
particular is the one organized from

1466
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:10,510
image net so the challenge that we are

1467
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:13,030
organizing we call it Network allenge

1468
01:16:10,510 --> 01:16:14,110
it's a very you have the URL where you

1469
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:16,179
have some more additional information

1470
01:16:14,110 --> 01:16:19,000
and the plan that we have is the

1471
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:20,270
following so it is true that it is very

1472
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,120
hard to obtain

1473
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:25,430
from RealNetworks as far as I know no

1474
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:26,690
one has been successful and then it's a

1475
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:28,940
chicken-and-egg problem then we cannot

1476
01:16:26,690 --> 01:16:30,950
organize the challenge and we cannot if

1477
01:16:28,940 --> 01:16:33,049
we don't have data we cannot start

1478
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:34,970
working on real machine learning because

1479
01:16:33,050 --> 01:16:37,010
it's impossible to build a neural

1480
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:40,730
network without data so what we have

1481
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:43,130
done is we have we are using a network

1482
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:46,040
simulator which is open it it's

1483
01:16:43,130 --> 01:16:48,110
event-driven it's per packet meaning

1484
01:16:46,040 --> 01:16:50,960
that each packet is simulated in a

1485
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:53,839
network and what we do is a quite simple

1486
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:55,820
label we take one topology one traffic

1487
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,490
matrix are realistic traffic matrix and

1488
01:16:55,820 --> 01:17:00,259
a network configuration we simulated and

1489
01:16:58,490 --> 01:17:02,090
we generate the labels which is the

1490
01:17:00,260 --> 01:17:03,800
label this okay for this topology this

1491
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:06,050
traffic matrix and is a configuration

1492
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:08,450
I'm seeing this performance of the flows

1493
01:17:06,050 --> 01:17:10,700
like this delay digital and this losses

1494
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:14,330
so it's very fundamental to computer

1495
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:16,099
networks it's like network 101 so this

1496
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:20,090
is the data set that we are producing so

1497
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:21,740
we have as I said each row is network

1498
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:24,440
topology network configuration traffic

1499
01:17:21,740 --> 01:17:27,110
matrix and the label is the performance

1500
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:32,719
of this traffic using this configuration

1501
01:17:27,110 --> 01:17:35,080
over this network okay so basically we

1502
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:37,910
are having we have like around 60

1503
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:40,580
gigabytes of data because we need to run

1504
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:43,220
many many topologies with tens of can't

1505
01:17:40,580 --> 01:17:45,350
with tens to hundreds of nodes then

1506
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:47,060
iterate over many random configurations

1507
01:17:45,350 --> 01:17:50,390
and many different traffic matrixes to

1508
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:52,100
generate all these labels and from a

1509
01:17:50,390 --> 01:17:53,810
previous paper that we have you can see

1510
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:55,970
the data set it's like around 60

1511
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:57,680
gigabytes and now we are generating a

1512
01:17:55,970 --> 01:17:59,780
new one for this challenge which is

1513
01:17:57,680 --> 01:18:01,580
being generated by now but in the URL

1514
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:03,740
below you can see the one that we had

1515
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:06,320
for the other paper and it's basically

1516
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:10,400
this we are also providing a a Python a

1517
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:12,650
p2 for participants to have faster

1518
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:15,230
access to data then what is the

1519
01:18:12,650 --> 01:18:16,820
challenge the challenges ok given this

1520
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:19,070
data set you have to build a neural

1521
01:18:16,820 --> 01:18:20,630
network that given an unseen network

1522
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:23,389
topology configuration and traffic

1523
01:18:20,630 --> 01:18:25,850
matrix is able to estimate the per flow

1524
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:27,410
delay jitter analysis so I will provide

1525
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:30,950
your training data I know what you have

1526
01:18:27,410 --> 01:18:33,260
to do is if I give you a topology which

1527
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:34,099
you have never seen with a configuration

1528
01:18:33,260 --> 01:18:35,480
that you have

1529
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:37,280
scene and a traffic metrics that you

1530
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:39,589
have never seen mean that it's not part

1531
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,630
of the training data you have to you you

1532
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:46,670
should be able to estimate which is the

1533
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:48,200
per flow delay analysis then something

1534
01:18:46,670 --> 01:18:51,350
which is also very very common in

1535
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:53,210
computer vision is that organizers or

1536
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:55,310
the community at large they provide a

1537
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:56,930
baseline meaning that there is some sort

1538
01:18:55,310 --> 01:18:59,720
of neural network that it is able to

1539
01:18:56,930 --> 01:19:02,360
provide answers to this challenge even

1540
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:04,310
if it's very inaccurate even if the

1541
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:07,130
class is not very good or even if it's

1542
01:19:04,310 --> 01:19:11,380
not very it's not working very well so

1543
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:14,090
what we have as baseline is rounded

1544
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:15,500
Ramnath is a graph neural network which

1545
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:16,730
is able to generalize to unseen

1546
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:20,210
topologies traffic matrices and

1547
01:19:16,730 --> 01:19:23,120
configurations and and you can see in

1548
01:19:20,210 --> 01:19:25,130
this paper the whole architecture it's a

1549
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,480
prince or so participants can take round

1550
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:29,660
it and that's very important and that

1551
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:31,099
they have a baseline to start working

1552
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:32,450
with it's they don't have to start from

1553
01:19:31,100 --> 01:19:34,340
scratch and you will see why this is

1554
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:36,530
important so if you take around a

1555
01:19:34,340 --> 01:19:38,120
vanilla vanilla round net and you don't

1556
01:19:36,530 --> 01:19:40,429
do anything and you just use it with a

1557
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:42,200
new data set what you obtain is a mean

1558
01:19:40,430 --> 01:19:44,450
square error of 46 percent which is

1559
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:46,550
quite quite low so typically you should

1560
01:19:44,450 --> 01:19:49,700
expect a mean square error of a close to

1561
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:54,740
zero right and why this is important

1562
01:19:49,700 --> 01:19:56,480
because suddenly that in the target

1563
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:59,300
audience you have typically two people

1564
01:19:56,480 --> 01:20:00,589
either people that are purely data

1565
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,570
scientists that they don't know anything

1566
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:05,240
about computers and maybe they don't

1567
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:07,160
care but what they want is to take this

1568
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:09,590
open source code this tensorflow code

1569
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:12,019
round it and try to do their own tricks

1570
01:20:09,590 --> 01:20:14,690
and try to increase the accuracy and the

1571
01:20:12,020 --> 01:20:16,520
precision of the of the model just by

1572
01:20:14,690 --> 01:20:18,139
using purely at the same district so

1573
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:21,110
that's why it's important to give them a

1574
01:20:18,140 --> 01:20:22,850
baseline okay and there are many people

1575
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:24,559
doing this kind of a stick of stuff

1576
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:27,080
maybe they do some hyper parameter

1577
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,940
optimization and so on so with this this

1578
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:31,040
way we can bring people from other

1579
01:20:28,940 --> 01:20:33,500
communities to networking the second

1580
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,420
type of target audience is us of course

1581
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:37,670
is people working on Peter networks and

1582
01:20:35,420 --> 01:20:39,440
network ID which they can take the data

1583
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,330
set they can understand they can

1584
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:43,070
understand what is a network they can

1585
01:20:41,330 --> 01:20:45,290
understand what is AG referral network

1586
01:20:43,070 --> 01:20:46,940
and then they can try to to do something

1587
01:20:45,290 --> 01:20:53,180
which is way better that

1588
01:20:46,940 --> 01:20:55,580
what's wrong with this today so then I'm

1589
01:20:53,180 --> 01:20:58,670
not produce but we are considering at

1590
01:20:55,580 --> 01:21:01,370
least but so far we are not going where

1591
01:20:58,670 --> 01:21:03,530
we have not decided to you to do some

1592
01:21:01,370 --> 01:21:05,900
use cases but for instance a use case

1593
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:07,429
could be fine which is the optimal

1594
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:09,650
network configuration given an and sim

1595
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:15,170
network topology and traffic matrix by

1596
01:21:09,650 --> 01:21:17,960
means of a neural network yeah sure so

1597
01:21:15,170 --> 01:21:20,090
the dates tentative dates is because it

1598
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:22,310
should be available in spring 2020 then

1599
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:24,950
participants they should submit in the

1600
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:26,570
summer of 2020 so typical is two months

1601
01:21:24,950 --> 01:21:28,370
from the data is available until they

1602
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:30,440
can submit the final solution and then

1603
01:21:28,370 --> 01:21:33,610
the award will get will be given in 2020

1604
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:37,190
we will use this kind of dissemination

1605
01:21:33,610 --> 01:21:38,780
channels this is a target audience that

1606
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:42,769
was discussing before the gaming paper

1607
01:21:38,780 --> 01:21:44,690
is that after the award we plan to write

1608
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:46,670
an academic paper this describing how

1609
01:21:44,690 --> 01:21:48,200
did the challenge went what did the

1610
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:50,540
participants do co-authoring with all

1611
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:53,150
the player with all the participants

1612
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:57,670
that's typically sort of a reward for

1613
01:21:53,150 --> 01:21:59,780
the first academic participant and

1614
01:21:57,670 --> 01:22:01,310
that's pretty much it this is a kind of

1615
01:21:59,780 --> 01:22:02,960
question that I have for the working

1616
01:22:01,310 --> 01:22:06,110
group for the research group I don't

1617
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:09,710
know if this use case is irrelevant any

1618
01:22:06,110 --> 01:22:13,540
other volunteers to organize this is the

1619
01:22:09,710 --> 01:22:13,540
research group interested and so on

1620
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:21,200
thank you very much Albert and for for

1621
01:22:17,930 --> 01:22:22,670
presenting this practical network a

1622
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:25,460
challenge we are looking for that of

1623
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:27,230
course I mean energy is really welcome

1624
01:22:25,460 --> 01:22:29,350
to to have this challenge to give you a

1625
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:31,759
space if you need for presentation for

1626
01:22:29,350 --> 01:22:33,800
advertisement or if you can work with us

1627
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:36,380
for that you're very welcome and you're

1628
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,940
part of the community anyway and also I

1629
01:22:36,380 --> 01:22:40,790
would like to raise more towards the the

1630
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:42,230
research group I mean how can the

1631
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,580
research group help you or if you need

1632
01:22:42,230 --> 01:22:45,259
to something you can maybe send an email

1633
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:47,180
to the minimis and if people in the room

1634
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:49,070
are really interesting to that please go

1635
01:22:47,180 --> 01:22:51,640
to Alvaro to us and we will make the

1636
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,639
connection okay

1637
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:04,120
okay so the the last presentation is

1638
01:23:02,380 --> 01:23:07,420
just to give you a kind of summary of

1639
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:11,110
the sizing things that we have done on

1640
01:23:07,420 --> 01:23:13,150
AI on I think it was on Tuesday so with

1641
01:23:11,110 --> 01:23:16,000
the people listed here so just not only

1642
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:19,269
my my view but it just kind of summary

1643
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,980
of what has been highlighted there so

1644
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,780
just because we don't have so much time

1645
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:25,450
so the key point that the objective of

1646
01:23:22,780 --> 01:23:27,969
this meeting was to identify the

1647
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:32,190
challenges of using AI in our domain in

1648
01:23:27,970 --> 01:23:34,810
general let's say network so what makes

1649
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:37,240
the use of AI differential now domain

1650
01:23:34,810 --> 01:23:39,550
model compared to other domain so just

1651
01:23:37,240 --> 01:23:41,139
to find the specificities so we go

1652
01:23:39,550 --> 01:23:45,490
through some discussion and it's what

1653
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:46,840
basically remain a service discussion so

1654
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:48,700
there is probably some challenges

1655
01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:50,980
regarding lightwei artificial

1656
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:52,660
intelligence so even if at the beginning

1657
01:23:50,980 --> 01:23:55,030
such really specific to network of

1658
01:23:52,660 --> 01:23:56,980
course you can think that you may have

1659
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:59,559
lightweight devices in network you want

1660
01:23:56,980 --> 01:24:01,120
to have more let's say AI in the network

1661
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,700
so of course this is also related to

1662
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:05,380
what happens in coin Konya G so this

1663
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:07,599
what has been mentioned in there and

1664
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:09,490
then it's also related to all the

1665
01:24:07,600 --> 01:24:11,440
distributed artificial intelligence

1666
01:24:09,490 --> 01:24:13,240
Farmington engine societies also here

1667
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:15,969
the network is not only user of the AI

1668
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,519
of course but also can help to support

1669
01:24:15,970 --> 01:24:20,230
my efficiently zai to synchronize

1670
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:23,560
between maybe the different agents and

1671
01:24:20,230 --> 01:24:26,139
so on those are channels very classic I

1672
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:30,490
think we told a bit already about the

1673
01:24:26,140 --> 01:24:32,590
data challenge I would say so

1674
01:24:30,490 --> 01:24:34,330
of course our different problem is the

1675
01:24:32,590 --> 01:24:36,850
data so you don't have access are not

1676
01:24:34,330 --> 01:24:38,769
representative so we have a technical

1677
01:24:36,850 --> 01:24:42,190
presentation today auto-generate an

1678
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:45,370
auditor to assess a system more globally

1679
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:47,230
so all the data problems that you cannot

1680
01:24:45,370 --> 01:24:49,809
access to the relevant data in

1681
01:24:47,230 --> 01:24:51,250
particular in when you compare it with

1682
01:24:49,810 --> 01:24:52,930
the learning environments or personal

1683
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:57,100
environment so it might not be possible

1684
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:58,720
to make a generalization easy posse so

1685
01:24:57,100 --> 01:25:01,750
there are different researchers our

1686
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:04,330
exams actually identify here one is to

1687
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:06,550
have more and I'd say concerns well

1688
01:25:04,330 --> 01:25:08,330
description of the difference that I we

1689
01:25:06,550 --> 01:25:10,850
use

1690
01:25:08,330 --> 01:25:12,530
maybe another run is also to use AI to

1691
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:16,370
generate the data associate nazar talk

1692
01:25:12,530 --> 01:25:17,780
or to maybe also a look at whether to

1693
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:20,210
transfer knowledge from one domain to

1694
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:21,889
another because you cannot access issue

1695
01:25:20,210 --> 01:25:24,020
data you have in the different I'd say

1696
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:25,430
environment from where you do this

1697
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:27,320
you're learning your non human and when

1698
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:29,060
you apply it because I'm not the same

1699
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:31,460
people working on that it may be good to

1700
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:34,130
know you can make some transfer because

1701
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:35,500
there are some of course work on that

1702
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:38,390
aspect as well

1703
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:41,180
and although the data is also not only

1704
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:42,590
thing as we said before as well not

1705
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:45,080
assume that she has the data but maybe

1706
01:25:42,590 --> 01:25:47,300
based on what you want to do identify

1707
01:25:45,080 --> 01:25:48,740
the data you want and check what could

1708
01:25:47,300 --> 01:25:51,130
be used or what is needed to access

1709
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:53,420
those data

1710
01:25:51,130 --> 01:25:55,460
another point is what we call the

1711
01:25:53,420 --> 01:25:57,830
problem challenge what I call maybe the

1712
01:25:55,460 --> 01:26:01,610
problem challenge is to find our maybe

1713
01:25:57,830 --> 01:26:05,240
to see what is the right topic for AI in

1714
01:26:01,610 --> 01:26:06,980
in our area kind of mapping between the

1715
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:10,599
problem you may have and the algorithm

1716
01:26:06,980 --> 01:26:12,919
we would like to use one possible

1717
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:14,300
duration is rather than having I want

1718
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:17,720
when a ping try to describe some

1719
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:19,960
attributes the problem is we have in

1720
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:22,310
network management or in network and

1721
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:24,980
with the same attribute to try to our

1722
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,880
different attributes the AI algorithm

1723
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:27,589
because you can have some

1724
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:31,070
characterization of the different

1725
01:26:27,590 --> 01:26:32,450
problems from one side and solution from

1726
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:34,309
the other side and then try to find a

1727
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:36,290
mapping so it's not a one-to-one mapping

1728
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:37,910
between one algorithm and one a use case

1729
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:39,500
it's more mappings that you will do over

1730
01:26:37,910 --> 01:26:43,670
the attributes so it might be more

1731
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:46,190
general of course there is always this

1732
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:50,570
problem of exploitability of the result

1733
01:26:46,190 --> 01:26:53,269
of AI because maybe the different expert

1734
01:26:50,570 --> 01:26:57,620
from network and AI are not the same so

1735
01:26:53,270 --> 01:27:00,550
I must not be complex to use you may

1736
01:26:57,620 --> 01:27:03,890
want to understand why yeah why you

1737
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:05,420
algorithm I decided to do that asana in

1738
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,000
your let's say configuration for example

1739
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:10,550
and he should not introduce some

1740
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:12,700
overhead because if AI is another tool

1741
01:27:10,550 --> 01:27:16,310
that is a will probably also let's say

1742
01:27:12,700 --> 01:27:19,869
data or - no dashboard it's not very

1743
01:27:16,310 --> 01:27:23,179
useful it just never in and we not work

1744
01:27:19,869 --> 01:27:26,509
the my depend is a turkey we know that

1745
01:27:23,179 --> 01:27:27,949
when a problem has complex network of a

1746
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:29,780
magnetic Reich implies were used

1747
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:33,428
distributed and so on and we know that a

1748
01:27:29,780 --> 01:27:37,790
unique in exertion cannot fit all right

1749
01:27:33,429 --> 01:27:39,349
so it's our different way to approach a

1750
01:27:37,790 --> 01:27:44,119
I let say a solution for a network

1751
01:27:39,349 --> 01:27:47,270
problem so the one is to think about

1752
01:27:44,119 --> 01:27:49,730
different level of AI fractions for AI

1753
01:27:47,270 --> 01:27:53,030
equal that will recommend or that will

1754
01:27:49,730 --> 01:27:55,299
guide you man people kind of assistant

1755
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:57,409
and then also you can think about

1756
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:59,570
related also to monitoring and although

1757
01:27:57,409 --> 01:28:02,000
you you will use the data try to see

1758
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:03,769
that just try to decompose as the

1759
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,150
problem is most small piece and just try

1760
01:28:03,770 --> 01:28:06,889
to orchestrate all see small piece or

1761
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:09,888
more on the level of the orchestration

1762
01:28:06,889 --> 01:28:11,420
you know we are not really think we

1763
01:28:09,889 --> 01:28:14,329
don't think that we have to target to

1764
01:28:11,420 --> 01:28:16,460
have specific Edgar algorithm of course

1765
01:28:14,329 --> 01:28:18,889
but more on G or we can use it and

1766
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:22,790
orchestrate all together although with a

1767
01:28:18,889 --> 01:28:26,090
telemetry for example as well so step to

1768
01:28:22,790 --> 01:28:27,679
progress society idea is good we have

1769
01:28:26,090 --> 01:28:30,829
always these meetings that we discuss a

1770
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:32,270
lot and we have an even not enough time

1771
01:28:30,829 --> 01:28:35,590
to this case so what we would like to

1772
01:28:32,270 --> 01:28:38,210
continue so that is that will do what

1773
01:28:35,590 --> 01:28:41,650
let say a public document but written

1774
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:44,270
documents report and document that will

1775
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:46,309
first I'll add what has a challenges as

1776
01:28:44,270 --> 01:28:47,659
we started before a bit but of course

1777
01:28:46,310 --> 01:28:50,270
this need to be refined to be more

1778
01:28:47,659 --> 01:28:53,480
discussed so that could be helped to

1779
01:28:50,270 --> 01:28:55,489
clarify also the position of artificial

1780
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:59,119
intelligence in an any other group if it

1781
01:28:55,489 --> 01:29:01,218
has to have a position here and so we

1782
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:03,409
need of course diverse input for that

1783
01:29:01,219 --> 01:29:05,449
and we need your help and you help is

1784
01:29:03,409 --> 01:29:08,119
just not only providing feedback so I

1785
01:29:05,449 --> 01:29:09,379
will send I will ask you now matters of

1786
01:29:08,119 --> 01:29:10,820
sign on the mailing list we need people

1787
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:15,530
really want you to contribute

1788
01:29:10,820 --> 01:29:17,869
write this report who is a kind cult of

1789
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:20,599
course team to work on that it should

1790
01:29:17,869 --> 01:29:25,579
not be on the one to person writing this

1791
01:29:20,599 --> 01:29:29,239
so and that's it for for me so yeah one

1792
01:29:25,579 --> 01:29:32,570
minute well done Jerome to catch up with

1793
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:33,289
time any quick feedback on the general

1794
01:29:32,570 --> 01:29:36,710
discussion

1795
01:29:33,289 --> 01:29:39,018
challenges or the approach for AI in

1796
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:41,420
network management okay Shane from

1797
01:29:39,019 --> 01:29:45,289
Holley just one comments about the

1798
01:29:41,420 --> 01:29:48,500
potential research topics just now long

1799
01:29:45,289 --> 01:29:50,929
I've mentioned about the labeling the

1800
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:53,150
labeling network data is I think it's

1801
01:29:50,929 --> 01:29:55,099
very important for us to have a

1802
01:29:53,150 --> 01:29:58,239
discussion or have a thought about

1803
01:29:55,099 --> 01:30:00,769
whether we can provide a universal or

1804
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:03,079
common data format for the machine

1805
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:06,110
learning especially for training such as

1806
01:30:03,079 --> 01:30:08,449
whether your training set can be used as

1807
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:12,860
my sample so that it is very important

1808
01:30:08,449 --> 01:30:16,400
for us it so unless we have a universal

1809
01:30:12,860 --> 01:30:20,690
data set didn't format what we can do is

1810
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:22,129
you do yours system and I to mine so our

1811
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:26,178
data cannot be shared

1812
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:30,820
so it's a very challenge for us to do

1813
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:32,380
that so thank you thank you thank you I

1814
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:35,449
commend to Peter

1815
01:30:32,380 --> 01:30:37,309
okay so I think reeling the data format

1816
01:30:35,449 --> 01:30:39,289
yes we may think about having some

1817
01:30:37,309 --> 01:30:42,289
Universal data fermented I think we

1818
01:30:39,289 --> 01:30:44,030
already have some but although that we

1819
01:30:42,289 --> 01:30:46,009
all know that at some point we will have

1820
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:47,300
to deal with different data sources and

1821
01:30:46,010 --> 01:30:49,820
so it would be hard to say that we will

1822
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:51,409
have always this data format so I think

1823
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:54,259
it's good to keep that in mind because

1824
01:30:51,409 --> 01:30:56,150
we should try to do may be to aim that

1825
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:57,710
but in some point that appear in the

1826
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:59,629
discussion was I just saying that we

1827
01:30:57,710 --> 01:31:01,880
will have universal data format at less

1828
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:04,670
at least three universe a kind of

1829
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:06,440
universal description a way that all of

1830
01:31:04,670 --> 01:31:07,670
us can understand if you pry the new

1831
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:09,980
that I said that you can understand your

1832
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:18,889
format with some to some extent but of

1833
01:31:09,980 --> 01:31:20,178
course yes and I think that's it at the

1834
01:31:18,889 --> 01:31:22,400
end of the session thank you very much

1835
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:23,989
for being here knowing it's Friday last

1836
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:26,179
session of the week it was a long week

1837
01:31:23,989 --> 01:31:28,940
thank you very much for being in the

1838
01:31:26,179 --> 01:31:32,210
research group please if you have inputs

1839
01:31:28,940 --> 01:31:34,129
on the meaning list or contact us we

1840
01:31:32,210 --> 01:31:35,420
need to understand what we would like to

1841
01:31:34,130 --> 01:31:37,039
do in the research group about this

1842
01:31:35,420 --> 01:31:39,409
topic we will also discuss with the Iron

1843
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:40,639
Chef sure to have a bit of guidance for

1844
01:31:39,409 --> 01:31:42,949
the next steps because we have been

1845
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:45,230
investigating is topic for a couple of

1846
01:31:42,949 --> 01:31:46,400
years now so we really have to make a

1847
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:48,049
decision how to

1848
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:49,670
continue so your inputs are very

1849
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:52,520
important to know if you have interests

1850
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:56,540
interests also to contribute and

1851
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:58,100
suggestions for that thank you I thank

1853
01:31:58,100 --> 01:32:04,220
quick quick quick question

1854
01:32:00,920 --> 01:32:06,530
cool who would like to help to write

1855
01:32:04,220 --> 01:32:11,050
this report and challenges for a network

1856
01:32:06,530 --> 01:32:16,630
can you raise your hand yes right now

1857
01:32:11,050 --> 01:32:17,810

good contribute to the contribute to the

1860
01:32:20,480 --> 01:32:26,750
challenge report I will say but there is

1861
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:31,090
different on developing Goldman so thank

1862
01:32:26,750 --> 01:32:31,090
you and have a safe trip back

1863
