00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:48,760
welcome to the drunk ops area and offset

4
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:50,649
average omitting the note well please

5
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:52,690
make sure you understand those important

6
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,850
illegal issues basically all your

7
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:58,660
contributions need to follow the ITF

8
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:01,629
rules and the first three are welcome to

9
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:04,179
the obsolete WG is chaired by Kenya and

10
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,370
the Joe and the blue shirts is

11
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:08,080
circulating please fill in your name so

12
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:11,290
that we can get room with right-size

13
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:16,030
next time and before we can really start

14
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:23,920
we need Java scriber yeah is there a new

15
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:35,229
volunteer I'm on but someone else Chris

16
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:39,189
jabber the notes taker we're not a we

17
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:49,658
can use that we do record order for the

18
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:51,880
minute so if the past two meetings I've

19
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:55,180
done transcription from the YouTube it's

20
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,229
worked but I do recommend anyone who can

21
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,020
join the etherpad

22
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,520
the links there it really helps if you

23
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,969
have something that you want to make

24
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,350
sure is captured in the minutes or that

25
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,390
you can clarify some things

26
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,220
please also when you're presenting or

27
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,380
when you come to the mic for comments

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,630
make sure to say your name so we can

29
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:15,760
record that but we would appreciate if

30
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:18,430
anyone can contribute to the etherpad

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,060
notes and anyone who can sign into

32
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,129
ever I'm on as well but we would thank

33
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,450
you very much

34
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:31,629
so we have now relays for Java Thanks

35
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:34,149
great and here's the working group

36
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:37,149
status right now we have six after

37
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:40,950
working Google document we newly adopted

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:44,920
the two drafted before this meeting and

39
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:47,679
there are the l3m and the young model

40
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,858
automation framework and later also

41
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,470
swell introduce both draft and all of

42
00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:57,090
the working group draft of our readable

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:01,840
and we welcome your review and comment

44
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:05,790
here is the agenda we can start from the

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:12,400
working group document is there any

46
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:25,888
question okay let's start from from the

47
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:28,449
first one is there a remote hi guys

48
00:03:25,889 --> 00:03:33,129
perfect hi good morning

49
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:36,459
can you hear me correctly we can okay

50
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:38,108
perfect so I'm getting used to the

51
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,739
remote presentation but I prefer to be

52
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:45,370
in person so okay so let's get started

53
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:49,290
so thank you very much so we are gonna

54
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:53,500
present today the layer 3 VPN network

55
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:56,769
model so now it's a working load

56
00:03:53,500 --> 00:04:02,189
document so please go to the next slide

57
00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:04,540
so just will quickly introduce the the

58
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:06,790
motivation just for for background

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:09,819
purposes and then we'll go into the meat

60
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:13,328
and what are the updates in this new

61
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:16,329
version a explain clearly what is the

62
00:04:13,329 --> 00:04:19,659
the hierarchy a what is the relation

63
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,690
between l3 enema and threesome and many

64
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:25,210
definitions were the tilde from the

65
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:28,770
working group is is welcomed on the next

66
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,909
step so please go on next slide

67
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,219
so first of all the motivational of the

68
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,349
war so what were the requirements so

69
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:42,690
basically the requirements was to be

70
00:04:37,349 --> 00:04:46,680
able to monitor three VPNs and in order

71
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:50,759
to help the automation we wanted a jam

72
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:53,400
module to be able to be used from a

73
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:58,229
network controller so it could interact

74
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,659
with piece doing the solution

75
00:04:58,229 --> 00:05:03,210
registration either be a human network

76
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,759
operator that interest with the client

77
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:09,448
or it is an automatic piece of soul

78
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,259
where the interest with a client so the

79
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:14,460
existing Wardell threesome works

80
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:17,460
perfectly fine to interact with the

81
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,940
customers let's say it takes all the

82
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,789
requirements from the customer but does

83
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:26,719
not speak the error they or does not

84
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:31,550
have notions of the internals of the

85
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,550
operation operator network so here is

86
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:38,520
the young module to monster l3 VPN

87
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:43,919
services in a service provider network

88
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:46,710
and includes information also of some of

89
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,359
the logical resources for sample options

90
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:54,508
of some polite artisan energies and here

91
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,300
we tried to remove all customer related

92
00:05:54,509 --> 00:06:01,020
information that that piece will remain

93
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:04,650
at the OSS or BSS a layer and we care

94
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:11,490
about the really the network layer so

95
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:15,060
please go on the next slide so the the

96
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:19,650
document is now working group document

97
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:22,310
so first new things in this in this

98
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:26,310
world we welcome new new contributors so

99
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,860
Mara and Stefan and join the work so

100
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,069
also they both bring a lot of

101
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:35,009
perspectives from l3 VPN management and

102
00:06:32,069 --> 00:06:37,500
from the war from atrium so they

103
00:06:35,009 --> 00:06:40,770
provided very very good inputs and help

104
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,380
to clarify the relation between the the

105
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,169
models and

106
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:49,170
helped in the refining and they got the

107
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:52,800
containers also the the first thing was

108
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:56,490
to polish all the deterioration so there

109
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:02,720
was a good review by Tom pet which we

110
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:06,720
try to fix all the editorial issues also

111
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:10,530
suggested by the working group chairs we

112
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
added the implementation status so here

113
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:16,289
you have the best imitation status

114
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:20,010
section with three known implementations

115
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:23,120
I there might be more out there but at

116
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:28,409
least three that I am aware that are

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:31,890
documented in this version of course the

118
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:35,660
young model is updated and the main

119
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:38,580
changes that we moved from the more

120
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,240
science centric view that was inherited

121
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:46,800
from chrome l3m to a pure Network

122
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:53,190
centric view okay so it is the solution

123
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:55,710
for the network so also we did in as we

124
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,890
started from maybe from the recording

125
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,010
from the Adele threesome we now did him

126
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:03,990
the prune and take out all the customer

127
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,420
related parameters that are not

128
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:10,500
necessary and all the unused containers

129
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:13,860
were stripped out and so here a lot of

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,630
thanks to Stefan little skill that he

131
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:21,540
helped us a lot to to work through this

132
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:25,080
to the young train model also we added

133
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:28,500
some sample section to help to

134
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:30,539
understand how the model can be used so

135
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:34,080
here in the just in this regression we

136
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:37,740
are started with a very simple widely

137
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:44,300
use example in service provider so it is

138
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:46,260
the shared l3 VPN for the 4G service

139
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,170
provisioning

140
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,540
for the baho for the mobile backhaul is

141
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,040
a very very simple use case so in the

142
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:57,319
future versions will include more

143
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:00,829
complete examples also we refined

144
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,140
clarify the terminology so in order to

145
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:05,610
avoid misunderstandings and to help the

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,910
readers of the document understand

147
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:11,580
quarterly what what we are referring to

148
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,400
in the document we revisited all the

149
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,100
terminology section also there were some

150
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,550
- had minor additions in the Rohtak on

151
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,370
the routing protocols part so in there

152
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:29,339
was the process ID in OSPF was missing

153
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:31,380
so we we added it also the big change in

154
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:36,110
the document is the description of the

155
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:40,110
jam model itself so here you have

156
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:43,020
extended all the description so people

157
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:46,650
can understand the the young model and

158
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:49,680
the implementers and users of the model

159
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:55,290
a can understand it and can and we can

160
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:57,120
avoid a an amputee's also we added a

161
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:01,640
section with the relation with all young

162
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:07,380
models so which are the the other young

163
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:12,210
model that relation to this one and we

164
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,580
have added the security section with the

165
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:16,170
potential threats

166
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:19,050
for example from malicious clients or

167
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,849
from unauthorized clients and the

168
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,540
reference app that didn't we organized

169
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:27,270
okay so please go on the next next slide

170
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,370
so I said the first and the third big

171
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:36,960
changes they just get away from the the

172
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:42,030
sides so here with on deck sides are the

173
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:45,840
custom side so here we are what we want

174
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:50,280
to deploy the services from the from the

175
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:52,950
P so that side information we no longer

176
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,540
need it that is already pin process and

177
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,240
decided to which points to enter the

178
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,910
network so here the main container are

179
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,830
this the VPN service

180
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:08,040
and the bpn profiles so the the VPN

181
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:11,820
service contains a VPS nodes we have

182
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:17,430
this option are the abstractions the

183
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:20,640
point that are like a common set of

184
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:23,430
policies that applied to a network node

185
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,140
and within the VPN node you have the VPN

186
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,959
network systems that are the points

187
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:30,330
where the traffic really comes into the

188
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,520
into the VPN and there we had the two

189
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:37,020
parameters IP information or forcible

190
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,340
days of the wire termination ratio

191
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:43,920
basically sees the new hierarchy so

192
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:50,670
please next slide so then relation with

193
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:55,650
the the l3 name scope is from the from

194
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:59,579
the piece from p2p and we'll it l3 and

195
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:03,360
ma scope will be from the sides and the

196
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:07,050
bitter so here you can see clearly what

197
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:14,420
will be the scope and view of both of

198
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:20,240
both models so please next slide so here

199
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:24,209
this is just an example for for gbpn

200
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:27,180
provisioning so here what we want three

201
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:30,030
VPN service that that connects the the

202
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:33,209
node B with the platforms so here what

203
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:36,900
we typically need to create is a set of

204
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,540
s a set of VPNs to confer example for

205
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:42,569
the security gateway so there are

206
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,699
several platforms that we need to

207
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:51,150
connect to the two debris and they are

208
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:53,520
all done by this by the three P so here

209
00:12:51,150 --> 00:13:00,900
basically the service in l3 name will be

210
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:02,880
modeled as a to VPN nodes with one VPN

211
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,860
network access in this one one between

212
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:10,280
networks is facing they not be and one

213
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:12,310
VPN no taxes facing the platform so he

214
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,709
here

215
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:17,768
in the index sample you would and you

216
00:13:14,709 --> 00:13:20,498
will see how a BBN note would be

217
00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:23,290
represented okay so don't bother the

218
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:27,370
details you have them in them in the

219
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:30,089
draft so we can move forward and next

220
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,499
slide please

221
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:35,800
so here

222
00:13:32,499 --> 00:13:39,899
continuing with the example here this is

223
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,579
how we would seal also the the VPN

224
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,579
network access information so this is

225
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:48,430
how we would model the other relevant

226
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:51,459
part of the gang so the VPN node and the

227
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,739
VPN and network access so here in this

228
00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:57,399
example as in a simple example the VPN

229
00:13:53,740 --> 00:14:02,290
node a maps clearly into a physical P

230
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:07,720
but as mentioned the VPN node is an

231
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:10,930
abstraction so here if you use if you

232
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,079
are using sample abstract topology you

233
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,508
could map a that abstract token that

234
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,219
astronaut couldn't be further expanded

235
00:14:16,509 --> 00:14:22,120
into multiple nodes so then the

236
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:26,230
controller will decide where to exactly

237
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,839
to place the DBS so it is not always I

238
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:31,149
want to one mapping between VPN no than

239
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,709
beer if okay so but in basic and sample

240
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,339
in simple example like this it will be

241
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:39,689
on Tanaka so please go go on

242
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,149
so here when the next slide please

243
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:45,939
okay so here a the open issue that is

244
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:48,250
what we want to get the defeat from the

245
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:50,589
working group is the one open issue is

246
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,569
the Delta assignment of the resources

247
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,689
here at the energy out assignment so

248
00:14:52,569 --> 00:14:58,449
here we have several several scenarios

249
00:14:55,689 --> 00:15:00,250
so one of them is okay you leave the

250
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:02,709
network controller two out assign this

251
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,319
logical resources okay you please fill

252
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,319
twos for me they are tea nerdy other is

253
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:09,998
for example for multi domain scenarios

254
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,490
or forever or for scenarios where you

255
00:15:09,999 --> 00:15:16,569
have these resources outside you want to

256
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:18,850
explicitly assign artisanal DS and also

257
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,759
there are other scenarios where the

258
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:24,330
network were within one know where the

259
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:30,750
energy to be assigned there are some

260
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:32,580
some cases some simple VPNs that we

261
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,780
don't want that assignment so here in

262
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,360
the what happens now in the current

263
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:38,459
version of the trap the they are Tianna

264
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,530
there are optional so the assumption is

265
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,540
that if you don't fill them they will be

266
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,850
assigned by the controller and you can't

267
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,589
return later so the question to the

268
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,840
working group is whether okay

269
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:53,700
do we need an out of sign in the flock

270
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:56,460
to indicate is yeah that this resources

271
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:59,220
these values must be filled or it is

272
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:02,460
redundant in junk it is on it is already

273
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:04,080
implied so can we assume that is an

274
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,720
optional parameter is not filled it must

275
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:08,790
be calculated by the server okay so this

276
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,420
is an open question so please go to the

277
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,740
next slide to work to continue with the

278
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:16,979
definitions so here there are some some

279
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:20,430
open issues that we need to clarify with

280
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,640
the rest of office on working group is

281
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:25,949
the the it extranet VPNs for the 3sm are

282
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,500
not needed in the 3nm they can just be

283
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:32,100
mapped into an import policies review

284
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:35,280
the VPN profile the containers of far we

285
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,430
have found the QoS profile useful the

286
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:40,050
rest of them not but as they are

287
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:43,099
available in a threesome we'll need to

288
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:46,349
check them though we need to review the

289
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:51,270
multicast now the requirements and

290
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:52,860
already mapped a couple of open issues

291
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:54,960
the relation with other models for

292
00:16:52,860 --> 00:17:00,840
example with the network topology so

293
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:03,930
currently the VPN node has the net the

294
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,850
NAD the network lemoned ad that is used

295
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:08,929
to identify the net were not in the in

296
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:12,209
which the VPN notice required so here

297
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:14,100
one possibility is to add a leaf ref in

298
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:18,329
a libyan node to a node in an ITF

299
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:22,339
network module so then it will be much

300
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:27,270
knighted but it will require the model

301
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:29,820
to use to wear with a an ITF network

302
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,389
model so question the warning display it

303
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,879
is worthwhile in this cross relations to

304
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,860
other doing mandatory or if it will be a

305
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:42,780
choice between okay blue provide

306
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:46,469
i D or is a leaf leaf man to to a

307
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:48,440
network topology and finally the port

308
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:55,950
identification in the VPN network says

309
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:59,429
that a here we might also need to add a

310
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:02,900
reference to a topology to the Uni

311
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:06,330
interface also to make this relation a

312
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:08,730
unambiguous the problem is that current

313
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,389
topology modules do not expose this unit

314
00:18:08,730 --> 00:18:18,360
inter fashion for that so I think with

315
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:20,160
this go to the slide and I think is we

316
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,290
just we finish with the next step so

317
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,140
compute the cotton s light please and we

318
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:26,760
finish so we want we want to ask you to

319
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,950
review the work in the current version

320
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,080
of the document a implementers from

321
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:36,510
feedback and work on definitions and we

322
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,520
understand this work also to to world to

323
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:40,530
be P ends and create a topology model

324
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,780
with yoona interfaces to attach the VPN

325
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:45,330
addresses which is a word that you cover

326
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:52,639
to review so thank you very much and if

327
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:52,639
you have any question comments for Oscar

328
00:19:00,049 --> 00:19:07,320
know me from Hawaii so kind of premier

329
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:13,049
slice for these open questions Pro where

330
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:16,799
slice okay so here I in fact from my

331
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:21,660
pond the wheel in fact we have implement

332
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:24,510
such a service model like this one from

333
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,309
Al Capone user from the user said that

334
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,040
they don't want it who you know it's too

335
00:19:26,309 --> 00:19:32,190
much unity tells us such as our key Rd

336
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:36,210
yeah so I think that the auto-assign

337
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:40,940
should have ent fought her measured but

338
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:43,890
to be honest some days because the

339
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:47,070
network operators that they are transit

340
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:50,669
Heda from this the traditional network

341
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:54,510
management way to the acid in based away

342
00:19:50,669 --> 00:19:58,710
so they do use some days of the concern

343
00:19:54,510 --> 00:20:01,620
about this the the our key Rd cannot be

344
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,350
explicit here it is a grenaded so for a

345
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:06,750
motto of my point of view I think I

346
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,300
think I use the auto assigned can be a

347
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:12,919
default Hawaiian and also there's the it

348
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:18,120
kind also provided the optional to

349
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:20,600
assign this the RT Rd explicitly yeah so

350
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:25,320
that's my personal opinion

351
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:30,480
Thank You donors speaking without an ad

352
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,159
headed as an operator in in most of the

353
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,820
deployments that I have seen artists

354
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,650
energies are strictly controlled and

355
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,379
that is coming from a source of truth

356
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:42,740
which is much more related to a lot of

357
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:46,169
other parameters and just networking

358
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:48,510
making it has a default photo assignment

359
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:51,000
will directly clash with a lot of

360
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:53,879
existing deployments yes that option is

361
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,710
needed but that definitely doesn't need

362
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,480
to be the default one so my main

363
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,260
question is how to make that out

364
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,990
assignment so if

365
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:10,370
if make other plug in the model to

366
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:14,570
explicitly say out assignment or just

367
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:19,040
leaving blank will mean you want it out

368
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:20,080
a sign that is the our main doubt of how

369
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,960
to do it

370
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:28,070
Thank You Molly

371
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:31,250
one of contributor 4 mm actually I have

372
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:35,480
no strong preference for either one

373
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:38,150
I think the agony with kind of default

374
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:41,000
behavior but a if it is a default

375
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:47,470
behavior it is the only tools specify

376
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,470
you know document clearly yeah thank you

377
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:55,629
thank you ask her to the working group

378
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:59,660
please read and comment on list to his

379
00:21:55,630 --> 00:22:00,890
to the authors open items again Oscar

380
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,140
thank you I think we've said it before

381
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:05,690
it's great to see operators come and

382
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,250
present this work here I have a comment

383
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,750
for you but I will send it to the

384
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,940
mailing list because we're running a few

385
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:14,240
minutes behind so thank you very much

386
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:22,160
even for your remote presentation thanks

387
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:40,490
to you guys and next up we have I

388
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:43,309
believe chin you're presenting good

389
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:47,240
morning I am mining machinery from hobby

390
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:50,690
I like to pretend it's young beta mode

391
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:55,130
of framework job so apologize actually

392
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:57,650
for one of the cars actually I you know

393
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:59,480
the name actually is correct but there's

394
00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:00,980
a perforation it's not a corrector so

395
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,220
sorry about that actually I will fix

396
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,890
this

397
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:09,740
actually we have bouncer of the author

398
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:12,169
and because the nematode that the also

399
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:14,510
number on the front page so we move some

400
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:17,010
also to the contributor so the Java

401
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:19,950
actually we changing the nickname

402
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:21,720
because we have something with chair

403
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:24,180
anomalies that because the traffic name

404
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:27,000
seems a little bit less a so we try to

405
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:30,690
figure this and so now we have this name

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,060
still very known so what is this job

407
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:40,410
about actually when we prepare this

408
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:44,129
chart we we were asked by many operator

409
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,830
service provider so you you have so many

410
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:49,770
young any model how you put this model

411
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:53,250
together to to provide end-to-end a

412
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:55,350
solution how do we deploy this kind of

413
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:58,500
model how to integrate this model so

414
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:02,219
this is motivated us to write this

415
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,350
document we really want to document the

416
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,720
yamoto architecture more from the

417
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,120
service provider perspective based on

418
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,620
service provider importer and try to

419
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,050
give the guidelines for operator to see

420
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:18,929
how to glue the model together how to

421
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,970
integrate a young data model in addition

422
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:23,940
for this can a creature actually is

423
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,100
service oriented oriented architecture

424
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,930
so women support various different

425
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,600
services layer three service there -

426
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:34,200
maybe tea service so different service

427
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:36,870
has given a functionality so we try to

428
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,580
do is identify the common common

429
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:45,120
functionality and a common concept so

430
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,340
one example actually for layer 3 service

431
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,989
or tea service you may support different

432
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,209
functionality may be preparing all the

433
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:52,680
tea but this kind of analogy can be

434
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:56,900
supported various different online

435
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:03,120
technology for example MPs gie and

436
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:05,730
pseudo wire in central actually so so

437
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,389
last we really want to give several

438
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:11,190
example to to show how this function

439
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:15,600
area can be used and in such kind of use

440
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:19,050
cases so this is the kernel stat of this

441
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:24,600
draft this Java has just been adopted

442
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:26,639
before this meeting and actually we make

443
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,300
it a lot of changes based on the last

444
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,780
medium discussion and try to address the

445
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,250
common

446
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,480
the reason in the last meeting my

447
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:39,270
important issues which I to document the

448
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:41,760
old iti model in the previous version

449
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:44,100
seems to give us a view for this kind of

450
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,629
a ETA Yamato standard input status that

451
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,120
we single is not appropriate so that's

452
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:52,380
why we move this can IDF Yamato

453
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:55,560
servitude appendix and another one is in

454
00:25:52,380 --> 00:26:00,030
the previous version we mix the how the

455
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:03,149
model is discovered from with how the

456
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:06,540
model is integrated so we try to clarify

457
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:14,430
this and separate these two

458
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:16,080
- since imaging actually the the the job

459
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,570
have tried to generate this kind of

460
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,270
architectural concept to cover the

461
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:23,189
common functionality and a concept why

462
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,860
another concept actually is a model

463
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:33,540
layer in the rivers in Beijing we will

464
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:37,050
discuss in a next slides so so what is

465
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:39,120
it important concept I think it is this

466
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:44,850
model layering and a model

467
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:48,750
representation so you may obstruct the

468
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:51,000
service requirement from the top you may

469
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:53,280
abstract the metal infrastructure

470
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,520
technology in on the line from the

471
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:59,040
bottom so yuri you will classify the

472
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,430
model into service layer and divides

473
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:05,490
ever but also in the middle you know you

474
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:08,960
need to schedule the resource to meet

475
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:14,520
the requirements to schedule results to

476
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:17,940
try to you know adapt to the network

477
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:23,670
changes so the Neto level is very

478
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:26,580
crucial important and you know tell you

479
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:28,050
where you can get these results how do

480
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,409
you are located these kind of results

481
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:36,389
one of the example is you may figure out

482
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:39,390
how to select a VPN attachment point may

483
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:42,690
be the P you may need to decide whether

484
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:44,790
I reuse existing vif or I need to create

485
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:50,400
a new way out whether I need to

486
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:53,879
get a new port so we hit clear give an

487
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,700
example actually in a service lever

488
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,930
actually from customer perspective they

489
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,790
don't care what technology you are using

490
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:05,970
what kind of results you located so

491
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:09,840
usually they will request a VPN service

492
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:12,180
to describe it like I want to have a 3

493
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,030
VPN side I wanted these ribbons are

494
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:17,250
interconnect which yes I want to require

495
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,350
the connectivity between the side with

496
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:22,950
some bandwidth requirements latency

497
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,840
requirements at the drill down to the

498
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:26,490
net will ever actually need to figure

499
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:28,590
out where you can get this result

500
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,920
how do a locator is its kind of results

501
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:36,120
so in a net will error controller need

502
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:39,870
to consider how to create a VPN instance

503
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,629
how to create a network access to hook

504
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:46,110
into the attachment point and also you

505
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:48,210
hook it into this VPN instance and and

506
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:50,459
it's in the device level you really need

507
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,850
to think imposes a net will ever

508
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:54,870
confirmation into device level

509
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:57,750
conversion for example you want to

510
00:28:54,870 --> 00:29:00,090
enable PGP or you have our mpos in the

511
00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,010
device you really want to activate a

512
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:06,090
some feature within a device so you can

513
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:09,210
read on device level model to do that so

514
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:13,830
that's the concept of module layer and

515
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:15,360
representation so this is architecture

516
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:18,649
overview for young Taylor motor

517
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,590
automation actually there are several

518
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:24,090
you know common functionality in within

519
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,970
this architecture these actual

520
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:32,429
architecture really classified the the

521
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:34,980
into the device level net whatever

522
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:36,750
service level the commonality between

523
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:41,030
the service level and a net will ever

524
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:44,130
you will support a service life cycle

525
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:48,170
form from for example service of

526
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:50,730
creating modification and a service

527
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:51,900
optimization when you gotta do the net

528
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:54,900
over set up or you really want to

529
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:57,870
optimize their service based on the Nano

530
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,870
at last that you really need to consider

531
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:04,489
how to you know break down its kind of

532
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:06,989
surveys so you will have this kind of

533
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,210
service lifecycle management in addition

534
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:12,410
actually you need to cover service and

535
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:15,270
maintenance one of the importance of is

536
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:17,250
when are important the feature in the

537
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:22,680
service maintenance is service assurance

538
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:25,920
and the service diagnostic and you need

539
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:27,450
you need to figure out how given a model

540
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:30,450
put together to provide the several

541
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:35,250
assurance or service diagnostic this is

542
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:38,670
something we actually have some economic

543
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:40,350
in the later slides and enriching you

544
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,690
want to support a close local metal

545
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,209
management or service network management

546
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:46,890
so the model you can leverage all the

547
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:51,240
maximum you can leverage a freedom for

548
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:54,000
motor-driven telemetry you have ITA to

549
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,190
find young push telemetry mechanism or

550
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,240
you may use its job is to GMI whatever

551
00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:03,180
and also you need you have motor driven

552
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,030
policy model actually there's some

553
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,390
technologies specific policy model like

554
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:11,120
a ACL routing policy use policy model

555
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:13,560
and you also can leverage you some

556
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,239
because the ECA model is kind of

557
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:21,000
imperative policy model with this is a

558
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,220
model or motor driven policy model and

559
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,780
model given an image model you can build

560
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:30,060
a close look never imagine management

561
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:33,210
another thing actually actually is

562
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:35,340
important is model layer and translation

563
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:38,340
actually you have a different layer

564
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,929
model you need to you know smoothly

565
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,879
translate it between each other

566
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,070
you may translate between given a layer

567
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,740
image translate in the same never mind

568
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:48,929
examples for translation between

569
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,710
different layers you translate a service

570
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:54,000
level into net we'll ever but the there

571
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:56,250
are some challenge

572
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,540
because during these translation you

573
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:00,290
need to figure out where you carry these

574
00:31:57,540 --> 00:32:03,030
resolve how to allocate resource also

575
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:05,850
similarly simply static translation is

576
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:07,510
not enough actually for device level

577
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:11,189
translation

578
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:14,680
actually you may consider translate a

579
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:20,170
standard model into the private mode or

580
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:22,510
native model here will show how young

581
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:26,410
teen model interact with each other how

582
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:28,840
young model in the inter interact with

583
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:35,610
some mechanism so several example the

584
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:38,020
first example is it's kind of

585
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,159
paramilitary model work together with

586
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:45,580
network walkaways device model actually

587
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:49,090
you can let you push it you subscribe

588
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:52,870
rotator and you can aggregate this

589
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:58,270
container and to the tunnel ever between

590
00:32:52,870 --> 00:33:03,790
ever and and and and then you can

591
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:08,350
actually so you can pet benefited from

592
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:11,350
this tenet men she opens the may amend

593
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:14,290
the model to try to keep track with the

594
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:16,540
network performance and so can provide a

595
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,840
better insurance before in some cases

596
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:23,710
and maybe performance services it's done

597
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,990
greater you can optimize the network so

598
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:29,830
second example is cross-layer

599
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:32,230
translating so in a high level you may

600
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,080
translate surface level model into net

601
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:38,950
whenever model as I mentioned in the

602
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:41,320
model representation in slide and you

603
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,330
know lower labor you may think decompose

604
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:48,760
the network level into a bunch of the

605
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:52,439
device model and this also may need to

606
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:55,330
relax some translation of functionality

607
00:33:52,440 --> 00:34:02,020
the third example where we are giving

608
00:33:55,330 --> 00:34:04,860
actually is policy-driven example

609
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:07,870
actually these actually allow you to

610
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:10,420
delegate the climate generate the policy

611
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:15,339
into the device level allow the device

612
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:17,260
several control so you say we have

613
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:19,210
several model actually to do this and as

614
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,160
it can support of where's different

615
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:22,780
action actually

616
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:25,149
one of our action is actually you can

617
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:28,810
trigger some Locker notification also

618
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:30,760
you can actually to reconfigure summer

619
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:34,420
with a dog city within the divine within

620
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:37,450
the device so another way actually maybe

621
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:40,150
you have bunch of young beta model you

622
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:44,109
need to put them together and a clue

623
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:48,910
them into super device model actually in

624
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:52,750
this way you actually can you know make

625
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:56,109
a better know that wheezing each model

626
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:58,600
has a unique X passes so you can provide

627
00:34:56,110 --> 00:35:00,670
a consistent reporting representation

628
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,779
and a configuration so this is something

629
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:06,490
very powerful put in a virgin so that

630
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:08,890
Mecca zone / the idea actually is a

631
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:13,689
scream moment we can leverage these to

632
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:17,100
do that so we provide several cases the

633
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:20,530
first case is VPN service delivery

634
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:23,080
actually the model we can using for

635
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:26,500
example eros or SM after the service

636
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:29,920
level we can use arrows or um that'll be

637
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:33,820
presented in a previous topic and we

638
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:37,300
will translate the to each other so so

639
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:40,690
now in the network level you really you

640
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,310
know try to solve is how where you can

641
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,410
resolve how do you allocate these kind

642
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:49,630
of results and also you can dip compose

643
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,450
arrow Sri and a model into BGP model

644
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:56,190
views model a sailor model and a cat

645
00:35:52,450 --> 00:36:01,169
Annette was set up in April the PGP

646
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:03,850
protocol or SAR feature in the device

647
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:07,060
another one we showed you actually use a

648
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:10,960
service assurance use cases in the case

649
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,670
actually we can leverage some loss Bunga

650
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,480
performance environment animation model

651
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:18,640
there's two typically some wine is T's V

652
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:21,420
antenna measurement that'd be developer

653
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,859
Yankees walking cool and another one is

654
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,050
radium opposed amendment any measurement

655
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,930
that you define in the best working go

656
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,740
we actually can leverage it is lost

657
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:33,769
bound performance a man model to mayor

658
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:38,819
the

659
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:41,788
no network performance so usually you

660
00:36:38,819 --> 00:36:43,649
will mayor pruning the nano performance

661
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,630
and I go late and say penny wait penny

662
00:36:43,649 --> 00:36:48,479
wait and then you can aggregate this

663
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:53,539
into the tunnel level we can never know

664
00:36:48,479 --> 00:36:57,928
from the customer perspective so the the

665
00:36:53,539 --> 00:37:00,539
the operator can use these kind of VPN

666
00:36:57,929 --> 00:37:03,479
lever policy metric to optimize the

667
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:06,569
network so in this way we can provide

668
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:09,468
better service assurance another one

669
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:13,229
actually we want to emphasize is easy

670
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:17,759
approach to use a closed loop network

671
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:19,799
optimization so easy actually the canary

672
00:37:17,759 --> 00:37:21,809
climbed the scraper we can push it down

673
00:37:19,799 --> 00:37:24,899
this kind of clan generate the scribbly

674
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:27,989
into the device so enable the device can

675
00:37:24,899 --> 00:37:32,249
server control server management so in

676
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:35,099
this way actually with them actually to

677
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:37,558
have to do the network real-time

678
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:39,269
managing or provide better service

679
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,179
assurance to do the troubleshooting

680
00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:46,198
there's many cases we can cover so

681
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:48,359
that's all right now I think I'll still

682
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:50,099
this job the need to improving

683
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:52,348
especially the Security section we

684
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:54,449
haven't finished we'll keep on posting

685
00:37:52,349 --> 00:38:02,179
this document we were solitary back up

686
00:37:54,449 --> 00:38:02,179
from the floor thank you comments

687
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:13,308
I think in one of the drag round your

688
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,530
prison interaction between the service

689
00:38:13,309 --> 00:38:17,660
level and network level from the service

690
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:19,789
lifecycle poor interview I think I find

691
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,899
it a bit misleading to have service

692
00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:26,660
level operation in the network level

693
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,579
because you don't decommission the

694
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,379
service in the network level you with

695
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:33,049
the Commission part of the service that

696
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,640
is at this network domain but the

697
00:38:33,049 --> 00:38:38,329
service decommissioning should be in the

698
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:40,368
life cycle of a service level yeah I

699
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:42,470
think that's good comments actually we

700
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,299
also get some offline comments from

701
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,308
telefónica they think we should consider

702
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:49,549
serious verification of service

703
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:53,539
validation during the maybe service

704
00:38:49,549 --> 00:38:53,930
Croatian stage and we will try to fix

705
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:56,180
this

706
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,848
yeah thank you and then second comment

707
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,359
which is more on the models interactions

708
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:05,770
having the next slide and this is good

709
00:39:02,359 --> 00:39:07,609
examples but maybe the another way to

710
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:10,130
categorize a bit this kind of

711
00:39:07,609 --> 00:39:12,799
interaction because here the creature

712
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:15,109
seems to be young models maybe if you go

713
00:39:12,799 --> 00:39:17,000
for kind of operations that you

714
00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,470
typically do between service and network

715
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,420
you will have a set of typical

716
00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:23,899
operations and then you can say which

717
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,910
models are involve for typical operation

718
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,819
because otherwise you can have end to

719
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:30,618
end like a mesh of interaction between

720
00:39:28,819 --> 00:39:32,750
models and it will be difficult to see

721
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:34,779
because I mean yeah that's a very good

722
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:37,400
suggestion of a charge I have

723
00:39:34,779 --> 00:39:44,680
characterized this kind of different

724
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:44,680
examples thank you yeah question

725
00:39:50,050 --> 00:40:17,150
okay next one hello everyone I'm here to

726
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:22,580
talk about the young data model for text

727
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:26,240
plus a young model and and right now

728
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:30,980
it's a working group dropped and the

729
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:34,720
Texas young model is is for supporting

730
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:39,340
the Texas plus a prodigal that

731
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:45,589
configuration from the neck comfy on

732
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:48,590
operation system and here is a based

733
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:52,070
brief background of this young data

734
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:54,230
model because existing ITF system model

735
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:58,400
just covers local and readers

736
00:40:54,230 --> 00:41:02,720
authentication but you can see that in

737
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:06,050
the working group they already doing the

738
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,049
text plus protocol also it's in

739
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:11,750
development so this data mode also

740
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:15,290
extends system user authentication

741
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:17,180
method to not only support these two but

742
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:21,020
also to add another text plus

743
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:26,000
authentication option so this is the

744
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:30,230
country model and since last meeting we

745
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,950
just added the the session note to

746
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:38,420
reflect the John Harris comments because

747
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:43,279
he suggests to add this session know to

748
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:45,500
reflect that in a one single single

749
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,420
connection there could be more sessions

750
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:55,100
involved and this here the changer since

751
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:58,460
last meeting the mainly the improvement

752
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:59,960
is that based on John has less common

753
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:03,110
skip work Oh

754
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:06,470
of the other texts including

755
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:12,190
introduction one and also the young

756
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:14,779
module and and is on part and we added

757
00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:21,680
Takas plus at the normative reference

758
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:26,480
and and we since urban areas propose us

759
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,120
to we need to to configure system

760
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,790
authentication to enable Takas plus

761
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:37,100
authentication so we added text plus

762
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:40,190
identity to innovate so there is a one

763
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:44,810
remaining issue that is from urban areas

764
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:49,820
that the current system authentic

765
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:54,529
application only allows local and radius

766
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:59,150
so we added the text plus authentication

767
00:42:54,530 --> 00:43:04,310
math method to it but the problem is

768
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:09,410
that current system defines a mask

769
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:14,810
constraint that it only allows to verify

770
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:20,299
the radius configuration so in that way

771
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:25,520
although we add we added the Takas plus

772
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:30,310
authentication in an identity but still

773
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:33,920
we cannot use a must to verify the other

774
00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:38,240
parameters of Takas plus like whether we

775
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:42,710
configure servers yet so this is only

776
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:49,069
problem so here i had discussion this

777
00:43:42,710 --> 00:43:52,100
happen he he thought that if I added the

778
00:43:49,070 --> 00:43:56,240
identity then it can be very like it's

779
00:43:52,100 --> 00:44:00,080
but it's valid so it can be used the

780
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:04,149
they are no problem is that this same

781
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:10,819
system gives a very restricted

782
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:13,690
definition so based on the young one dot

783
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:19,420
one definition the augmentation

784
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:22,619
a target note cannot be leaf list so in

785
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:27,930
that way we cannot use mast to element

786
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:32,170
this note so in that way mass cannot be

787
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:34,419
added so in that way we think this is a

788
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:38,349
remaining issue but way we don't know

789
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:41,109
how to solve it so the problem that the

790
00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:45,520
question to the working group is that we

791
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:49,538
just leave it as it and we we propose to

792
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:53,259
add a note to the appendix to see

793
00:44:49,539 --> 00:44:58,230
whether like in the next system release

794
00:44:53,260 --> 00:45:00,480
can like must could be removed or be

795
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:07,410
replaced with a new one

796
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:11,130
so that's a question for this have you

797
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:13,598
so so one one thought to fully

798
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:16,599
brainstorm this out talk to any of the

799
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:23,829
yang doctors and what might be another

800
00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:28,210
option forward here okay III can help

801
00:45:23,829 --> 00:45:30,369
okay okay thank you that okay something

802
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:32,109
else you since you added the the

803
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:35,140
normative reference to tack acts just

804
00:45:32,109 --> 00:45:37,720
for you and the working group so the

805
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:39,759
rebbe 16 of that draft was just posted

806
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,950
and the authors are now working to clear

807
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,369
all the remaining discusses so I talked

808
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:48,160
to Ignace we're hoping that we get that

809
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:50,890
through in the upcoming telecheck and

810
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:53,589
then it moves forward so just FYI on

811
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:56,109
that and i'll take the action to see if

812
00:45:53,589 --> 00:46:01,119
there's any alternate thing we can do

813
00:45:56,109 --> 00:46:04,930
here with the ITF system yes yes things

814
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:08,049
either the cross model issue so I think

815
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:11,980
that's a right way and here this is the

816
00:46:08,049 --> 00:46:16,000
only remaining issue so if like we

817
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:20,369
resolve this one so I think we can ready

818
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,369
for the working group last call a

819
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:25,569
question about the mast statement so

820
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,340
have you already discussed this outer

821
00:46:25,569 --> 00:46:29,410
sofa ITF system

822
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:32,590
about when the next version will be

823
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:35,589
released says that you could identify if

824
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:39,600
you could add this master appendix and

825
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:43,720
after to collaborate this idea of system

826
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:46,680
outers to include basically to combine

827
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:51,129
both documents can you state your name

828
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:53,980
Metro City from a safer Altis sorry I

829
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:56,740
think I can it's a good suggestion I

830
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:59,050
will send the email to the net mode to

831
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:03,279
check whether what there think about

832
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:28,470
this model and work their plans Thanks

833
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:31,090
okay okay next one good morning everyone

834
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:34,270
today I'm going to present Institute

835
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:36,700
flow information in telemetry this is

836
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:41,740
joint work with our future way and some

837
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:44,140
several other operators collaborators so

838
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:47,080
the message conveyed by this draft is a

839
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,240
very simple we are all are seeing the

840
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,029
emergence of a new type of data

841
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:53,439
pennington mg technologies we call them

842
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:59,200
on pass on data

843
00:47:53,440 --> 00:48:01,810
telemetry and the operators see are very

844
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,000
interesting in applying this kind of

845
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:06,730
technology not only in data center and

846
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:10,210
and price networks but also in operator

847
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:13,060
networks however to successfully deploy

848
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:15,130
this kind of the technology what kind of

849
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:18,630
pitfalls we want to avoid and what

850
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:21,790
challenges requirement we are facing and

851
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:24,700
also if we want to build a standard

852
00:48:21,790 --> 00:48:26,590
apace solution how what standard gaps

853
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:29,859
are there and what are missing what have

854
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:32,770
available so it's a good thing to

855
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:35,260
actually formally categorize this kind

856
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:39,820
of technology and classify eight then

857
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:41,160
I'll give provide all the information we

858
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:44,670
know so far about the

859
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:48,000
and the propose the possible innovative

860
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:51,119
solutions which which can address this

861
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:53,309
kind of challenges and also finally we

862
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,519
can point out what I will have available

863
00:48:53,309 --> 00:48:59,009
right now and what I'm missing but we

864
00:48:56,519 --> 00:49:01,279
also want to clearly states that we

865
00:48:59,009 --> 00:49:05,000
don't intend to provide any specific

866
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:07,670
implementation through you infer any

867
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,589
constraint to the truly implementation

868
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:14,190
for the components functions and also

869
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:16,740
the interface api's for them we want to

870
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:20,430
leave them for the real implement area

871
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:23,098
implementers and also we think that the

872
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:28,140
purpose here is only to inspire such a

873
00:49:23,099 --> 00:49:31,170
network so first we think we already

874
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:35,160
have the two type of a passive and

875
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:37,410
active type of OM technologies but here

876
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:41,308
we are clearly seeing there's assertive

877
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:43,649
we can call that hybrid type three or

878
00:49:41,309 --> 00:49:47,819
unpassed data plane telemetry techniques

879
00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:50,880
and we can also further partition this

880
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:53,849
into two different subclasses one we can

881
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:57,000
name it a password passport type which

882
00:49:53,849 --> 00:50:00,869
includes our iom trees mode i ôm e 3 E

883
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,599
and I FA happy to stab and enhanced

884
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:05,490
alternative marking so you can see the

885
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,029
common feature shared by this type of

886
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:11,339
techniques is that you need somehow

887
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:14,220
modify as a user packet along the path

888
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:17,490
or you just do them more monitoring or

889
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,769
measurement and the end of the path but

890
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:23,069
the second sub class is called postcard

891
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:26,279
mode well which means you are along the

892
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:29,339
packet forwarding path you don't modify

893
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:31,609
the user traffic anymore instead you

894
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:34,619
just read the instruction carried by the

895
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:38,220
packet then it generates the postcard

896
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:42,569
data export using independent export

897
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:46,049
package so clearly that the example for

898
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:53,730
that I am direct export mode and the

899
00:50:46,049 --> 00:50:54,930
pbteen marking based variation so how we

900
00:50:53,730 --> 00:50:59,039
will successfully

901
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:02,129
why's this kind of technologies so far

902
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,880
we may need specifies underlying

903
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:06,510
techniques

904
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:09,660
what's a packet format it looks like how

905
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:11,940
the nose will process it but we haven't

906
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:13,558
considered many other challenges so far

907
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:17,039
the first wines as the performance

908
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:19,140
implications this kind of processing may

909
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:21,180
are actually stress you're falling

910
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:23,730
playing you have to consider about the

911
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:26,460
performance and also that the data

912
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:30,210
generated by these technologies may be

913
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:32,789
to us and also they can overload the

914
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:37,109
other export the network anyways and

915
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:40,140
also the data connectors and also so far

916
00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:42,750
we only defined a fixed set of data as

917
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,879
we can that can be exposed by the data

918
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:47,789
plane there's a note enough of

919
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:51,839
flexibility and extensibility we want to

920
00:51:47,789 --> 00:51:54,420
also change that and also to to actually

921
00:51:51,839 --> 00:51:57,029
deployed we have to consider various

922
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:59,910
kind of data plane encapsulation

923
00:51:57,029 --> 00:52:02,069
protocols there are some proposals

924
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:04,970
available for example for IOM how to

925
00:52:02,069 --> 00:52:08,190
incoming capsule encapsulate it in

926
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:11,970
different type of transport protocols

927
00:52:08,190 --> 00:52:14,160
but first it's not a complete some some

928
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:18,270
important the protocols are left out and

929
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:21,029
also how we can expand this to support

930
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:23,009
other similar type type of technologies

931
00:52:21,029 --> 00:52:25,740
let's not consider we think we should

932
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:27,589
have a holistic view to support them

933
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:31,020
either and also there are different

934
00:52:27,589 --> 00:52:33,480
tunnels in Cairo Network and we have to

935
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,538
consider in different type of tano's how

936
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,690
we can successfully AB a properly handle

937
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:42,690
this kind of package and the last

938
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:45,299
challenges are surely about what kind of

939
00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:48,450
or primitives and models API is to

940
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:50,730
support this type of technology and this

941
00:52:48,450 --> 00:52:53,339
there's no tower in this job we just

942
00:52:50,730 --> 00:52:55,529
point out what's missing and it was a

943
00:52:53,339 --> 00:52:59,460
current status hopefully this can

944
00:52:55,529 --> 00:53:05,190
inspire a bunch of new job to detail

945
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:08,820
about this these kind of requirements so

946
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:10,740
to address as a shriek channel

947
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:14,550
mine's performance that the probability

948
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:16,979
and the flexibility we proposed several

949
00:53:14,550 --> 00:53:20,070
key components functional components we

950
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:22,860
can work on them to provide our own you

951
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:25,050
know innovative solutions then we can

952
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:27,720
address these different challenges the

953
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:30,920
force wise how we can correctly

954
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:33,540
configure the network to only pick the

955
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:35,760
flow and the data we want to really look

956
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:39,930
at so without stressing the network

957
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:42,330
resource and secondly how we can take

958
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:44,819
advantage of the in network processing

959
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:47,549
capability to reduce amount of data

960
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:50,310
actually exposed to the data collector

961
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:53,010
there are many ways to do that one of

962
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:55,350
them we can deploy some programmable

963
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:59,610
probes into the system to actually

964
00:53:55,350 --> 00:54:03,480
defines a good smart filter or some data

965
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:06,030
reduction techniques for example we can

966
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,340
deploy the events into the system then

967
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:10,530
only the triggered when the events

968
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:14,460
triggered we can start the data

969
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:17,790
exporting so the this a very effective

970
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:20,030
to save the bandwidth and also the

971
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:23,160
processing power and the server side and

972
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:26,130
we we think the encapsulation that

973
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:29,100
animals are very important to support we

974
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:33,630
need to provide standard ways to support

975
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:35,430
those and finally we offer resync in one

976
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:39,330
application maybe just using one

977
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:42,060
underlying technique is not enough many

978
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:44,549
times we want to integrate several

979
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:47,370
techniques together or we can telemetry

980
00:54:44,550 --> 00:54:50,220
choose one at one time and based on the

981
00:54:47,370 --> 00:54:52,650
changing of the network conditions we

982
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,990
can switch another one in in wrong time

983
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:57,330
so we call that an team and the

984
00:54:54,990 --> 00:55:01,290
technique integration there's also an

985
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:03,900
important components so here we show

986
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:06,240
that overall high level of this this

987
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,130
architectural framework actually it's a

988
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:09,479
should look very familiar to you it's

989
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:13,320
just like normal

990
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:15,570
Sdn architecture we basically the

991
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:19,010
controller will configure the entire all

992
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:21,930
the nodes in the U 1 F which domain and

993
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:24,089
then after that we'll get

994
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:26,190
I'm sure data from different knows

995
00:55:24,089 --> 00:55:29,130
through the character then collector

996
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:31,559
after analyzing this data it will feed

997
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:34,220
the information to the controller the

998
00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:37,859
controller can take into consider these

999
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:41,459
regions this feedback then adjust its

1000
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:43,619
configuration so you can see naturally

1001
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:48,200
we will form a closed-loop architecture

1002
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:51,510
to allow many I innovative applications

1003
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:54,118
telemetry applications for example the I

1004
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:57,140
feel application will choose the

1005
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:59,490
technique to integrate them dynamically

1006
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:03,868
understand the smart flow and a data

1007
00:55:59,490 --> 00:56:07,200
selection to the head node and all the

1008
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:09,510
head node and athlete nodes will be

1009
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:13,470
deployed with an empty net were probes

1010
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:15,839
to support the smart data filtering and

1011
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:18,750
the data processing and the data export

1012
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:21,900
and also we will give you configure use

1013
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:24,180
standard way to encapsulate the package

1014
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:27,809
and go through the different panels and

1015
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,109
this closed loop will support many

1016
00:56:27,809 --> 00:56:33,990
different kinds of very interesting

1017
00:56:30,109 --> 00:56:36,420
applications so I think I don't have

1018
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:38,899
time to talk about them one by one

1019
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:41,760
IUPUI interesting you can look at or

1020
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:43,290
trapped and in the draft that we

1021
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:46,109
describe several very interesting

1022
00:56:43,290 --> 00:56:50,250
interesting applications enabled by this

1023
00:56:46,109 --> 00:56:52,440
a closed loop architecture so let's have

1024
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:55,020
some discussion so in the email list I

1025
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:58,049
have already request the adoption of

1026
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,089
this disrupting in the working group and

1027
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:03,509
as its triggered a lot of discussions

1028
00:57:00,089 --> 00:57:05,759
the majority of them many from operators

1029
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:09,599
they are very interested in this kind of

1030
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:12,299
work and support it and also there are

1031
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,030
some feedbacks about ok we are not very

1032
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:17,609
clear about defining some terms in this

1033
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:20,670
draft and we deepen a very not very

1034
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:23,910
clearly defined scope of the disrupt so

1035
00:57:20,670 --> 00:57:26,609
in the newer revisions we fixed that we

1036
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:30,440
gave a formal definition all all terms

1037
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:33,299
used you stay in this draft and also we

1038
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:35,849
provide another independent section to

1039
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:38,759
talk about standard gap

1040
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:40,769
so basically released what I will

1041
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:43,529
available right now and what has they're

1042
00:57:40,769 --> 00:57:47,549
missing hopefully that can trigger more

1043
00:57:43,529 --> 00:57:51,329
works in the working group and so here

1044
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:54,029
we are soliciting and maybe suggestions

1045
00:57:51,329 --> 00:57:58,229
about new future work what you expect to

1046
00:57:54,029 --> 00:58:00,809
see to be added in in this draft and if

1047
00:57:58,229 --> 00:58:03,569
you can your interesting the in this

1048
00:58:00,809 --> 00:58:03,989
work and you want to contribute yeah

1049
00:58:03,569 --> 00:58:10,079
welcome

1050
00:58:03,989 --> 00:58:12,919
and also we again we request for formal

1051
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:16,319
working group group adoption of this

1052
00:58:12,919 --> 00:58:22,859
this work so any questions and the

1053
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:24,899
feedbacks develop a telephonic it's just

1054
00:58:22,859 --> 00:58:27,808
about like we were talking about this

1055
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:30,359
here in the happy hour is about the

1056
00:58:27,809 --> 00:58:34,710
terms using the term closed-loop here is

1057
00:58:30,359 --> 00:58:35,989
a little witness living and closed-loop

1058
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:39,059
[Music]

1059
00:58:35,989 --> 00:58:41,219
okay when you talk about me because

1060
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:44,579
normally closed loop has about something

1061
00:58:41,219 --> 00:58:47,849
or dry running is about the automatic

1062
00:58:44,579 --> 00:58:49,649
control poetry I already some people

1063
00:58:47,849 --> 00:58:52,679
other people risk this question before

1064
00:58:49,649 --> 00:58:54,679
and already classified clarified this in

1065
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:57,449
the draft there are two type of

1066
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:59,880
closed-loop why the in the automation

1067
00:58:57,449 --> 00:59:03,809
network has a closed control loop but

1068
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:06,659
here it's not that kind of okay this is

1069
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:09,239
simply that is that it should be here

1070
00:59:06,659 --> 00:59:12,539
and probably try to find some kind of

1071
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:14,579
other term is that yeah you know it's

1072
00:59:12,539 --> 00:59:16,649
like at the end is like that the term

1073
00:59:14,579 --> 00:59:19,969
controller or orchestration or whatever

1074
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:23,368
there are so many different millions

1075
00:59:19,969 --> 00:59:26,099
look good to to think about we believe

1076
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:28,529
the future telemetry applications will

1077
00:59:26,099 --> 00:59:30,929
be highly dynamic you cannot just a

1078
00:59:28,529 --> 00:59:32,669
fixed one you know I'm not talking about

1079
00:59:30,929 --> 00:59:35,099
that I'm arrogant about the use of the

1080
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:37,319
term closed loop only it's about trying

1081
00:59:35,099 --> 00:59:40,109
to find a way of describing that you're

1082
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:43,229
not talking to trying to control the

1083
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:44,939
network but to control how to deploy the

1084
00:59:43,229 --> 00:59:45,928
probes and to control the telemetry and

1085
00:59:44,939 --> 00:59:48,479
of the network

1086
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:49,619
closed-loop is normally more used to the

1087
00:59:48,479 --> 00:59:51,990
control of the network

1088
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:54,119
it's just in this domain you have a

1089
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:56,939
clearly defined domain to apply this

1090
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:59,730
this look you only all the controls only

1091
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:01,950
applied to the to the node in this

1092
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:04,769
domain why enable the by through

1093
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:08,279
supports that this athlete functions if

1094
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:15,990
it's not enable then you can no it's out

1095
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:18,619
of the the control at the main so that

1096
01:00:15,990 --> 01:00:22,859
answer your question or I know I mean

1097
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:25,140
I'm trying and just please understand me

1098
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:27,029
and not saying anything that if you say

1099
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:30,210
that you are applying a closed loop

1100
01:00:27,029 --> 01:00:31,799
using telemetry is loose it's like

1101
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:36,329
you're trying to control the network and

1102
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:39,930
it's something that I would ask you to

1103
01:00:36,329 --> 01:00:42,390
take another term simply that yeah if

1104
01:00:39,930 --> 01:00:45,419
you have a good other alternative

1105
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:47,308
suggestions we can use that but right

1106
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:51,390
now I think that's the most powerful

1107
01:00:47,309 --> 01:00:54,569
behavior actually happening in the this

1108
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:57,029
application indeed is you know is a

1109
01:00:54,569 --> 01:00:59,989
dynamic take the feedback from network

1110
01:00:57,029 --> 01:01:05,730
and apply the new policies to change a

1111
01:00:59,989 --> 01:01:10,440
previous configuration that I don't know

1112
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:13,529
if you know I like to ya okay I'm not

1113
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:20,910
talking about what you do is about how

1114
01:01:13,529 --> 01:01:23,039
you name it see ya yeah my phone came

1115
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:25,440
from China Mobile I don't you know right

1116
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:28,499
the mobile network our talk about a

1117
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:32,279
divided Baker for example there are more

1118
01:01:28,499 --> 01:01:36,538
than 13,000 notes in big yield it is

1119
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:39,779
difficult to localize with the Newseum

1120
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:43,619
oh yeah my cert but I did two important

1121
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:46,289
for us to localize to the specific for

1122
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:48,930
the note weakest in deserve the

1123
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:51,809
forwarding performance and how to reduce

1124
01:01:48,930 --> 01:01:52,788
that it the power to the to the

1125
01:01:51,809 --> 01:01:56,759
controller

1126
01:01:52,789 --> 01:02:00,029
we compared and chose to learn suitable

1127
01:01:56,759 --> 01:02:03,440
bit of line we also have different wine

1128
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:06,980
and fader dat applying either Network we

1129
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:10,130
the man winter's about our house it's an

1130
01:02:06,980 --> 01:02:12,530
hour to Tokyo a great to refer to only

1131
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:16,130
to the pond I didn't know a nice we hope

1132
01:02:12,530 --> 01:02:19,130
their Islamic to retain what countries

1133
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:22,040
anteclo the group now working in stroke

1134
01:02:19,130 --> 01:02:24,860
work working in solos from our past

1135
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:27,680
follow telemetry I think there's a

1136
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:34,040
prominent work also they trust in the

1137
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:37,520
word useful for us tell them about our

1138
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:40,910
new fiend and scope of this trust in the

1139
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:44,120
wider career now we hope they'll call

1140
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:48,680
the P working in group document so write

1141
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:49,940
the bad faker in a solution well could

1142
01:02:48,680 --> 01:02:52,250
be wrote out

1143
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:56,030
I saw a depart well so much for your

1144
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:58,730
comments your issues your ISA exactly

1145
01:02:56,030 --> 01:03:06,350
we won't cover in this job you know yeah

1146
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:08,210
thank you okay frontrunners so I think

1147
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:11,029
you're trying to do too much in one

1148
01:03:08,210 --> 01:03:16,070
document here if I read through this

1149
01:03:11,030 --> 01:03:19,220
there is a bit of a review of what is

1150
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:22,100
out there in the industry kind of an

1151
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:23,600
inventory of what we have of multiple

1152
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:27,259
vendor solutions including standards

1153
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:30,920
based solutions you have a set of

1154
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:33,260
requirements outlined that might be

1155
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:36,020
another document so second document and

1156
01:03:33,260 --> 01:03:37,940
then you're trying to go and start off

1157
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,940
doing something that looks like a

1158
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:42,460
specification and I think some of the

1159
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:45,020
earlier comments that you've seen around

1160
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:46,820
nomenclature not being clear I think

1161
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:48,980
this trickles all through the document

1162
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:51,410
you are defining things or you're

1163
01:03:48,980 --> 01:03:54,860
mentioning things that are not really

1164
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,720
specified at specification level ie I

1165
01:03:54,860 --> 01:03:58,880
can go and implement something based on

1166
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,950
that you say in a knife it note it's the

1167
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:02,570
start of a knife it domain what is a

1168
01:04:00,950 --> 01:04:04,730
knife if domain what is an iPad

1169
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:06,890
application what is a knife it end node

1170
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:09,080
so all the things these things need to

1171
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:10,430
be spelled out you want to be an

1172
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,580
application if you want to be a

1173
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:16,819
specification so as I said like you're

1174
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:17,460
doing three things in one document and

1175
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:19,680
all of

1176
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:22,170
areas are under specified so what I

1177
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:25,379
would suggest you doing is focus on one

1178
01:04:22,170 --> 01:04:27,960
thing at a time and then really focus on

1179
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:28,589
closing this particular item and then

1180
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:31,740
move on

1181
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:36,440
so actually we clearly states the scope

1182
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:40,828
of this is dropped and we don't give any

1183
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:42,930
specification we just provide a very

1184
01:04:40,829 --> 01:04:45,420
high-level framework but to defy this

1185
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:48,210
high-level prim work we need to spell

1186
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:50,190
out the terms we used so to help you

1187
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:53,460
understand what we are talking about so

1188
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:57,390
that's all and we don't actually have a

1189
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:59,040
very ambitious to cover everything to

1190
01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:01,650
even talk about detail the

1191
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,930
implementation there's no you don't need

1192
01:05:01,650 --> 01:05:07,920
anything that is called I fit note I

1193
01:05:03,930 --> 01:05:11,308
know know what we see is ok yeah I what

1194
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,470
I say is right now there are up of four

1195
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:15,710
similar technologies and none of them

1196
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:18,450
can address all the issues specify the

1197
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,880
operators that's why we need a high

1198
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:23,460
level framework to consolidate all them

1199
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,589
you want place so to allow the operator

1200
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:28,589
through ten them to choose one or

1201
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:30,390
another or integrate them together in

1202
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:32,940
their application we want to provide

1203
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:34,799
this kind of flexibility we don't want

1204
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:37,109
to stick to just one underlying

1205
01:05:34,799 --> 01:05:40,200
techniques let's note I don't think this

1206
01:05:37,109 --> 01:05:41,970
there will be the way to go we're gonna

1207
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,109
cut the mic after you two gentlemen but

1208
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:46,680
we're gonna go with Adrian and back

1209
01:05:43,109 --> 01:05:50,000
there hi Adrian Farrell relaying from

1210
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:53,640
jabber from Timothy Kerry he'd like some

1211
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:56,339
clarity on the relationship between this

1212
01:05:53,640 --> 01:05:58,129
document and the network telemetry

1213
01:05:56,339 --> 01:06:02,279
framework which has already been adopted

1214
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:05,040
okay so that why I'm free the even

1215
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,319
higher level ways Cour different planes

1216
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:09,660
even control plane a telemetry data

1217
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:11,759
plane telemetry and American plane but

1218
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:14,430
this wise that dedicated to the data

1219
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:16,859
plane also it's dedicated to a specific

1220
01:06:14,430 --> 01:06:19,259
class of a data plane telemetry

1221
01:06:16,859 --> 01:06:21,900
techniques we call that on pass or in

1222
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:25,440
situ whatever is a basically are

1223
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:29,270
different from the previous passive and

1224
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:29,270
active OAM techniques

1225
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:37,550
shaking all over China Telecom only has

1226
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:39,800
shot comments I think this work is very

1227
01:06:37,550 --> 01:06:42,410
important in variable so I hope this

1228
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:49,580
document come yet this document can be

1229
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:54,470
adopted all right thank you a 2 inch in

1230
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:57,799
from telecom in our network wait

1231
01:06:54,470 --> 01:07:01,700
need to know some service a week of flow

1232
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:03,470
or package precisely I think it's a good

1233
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:09,859
solution Ross thank you

1234
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:13,189
yes thank you so sping is as chair I've

1235
01:07:09,860 --> 01:07:15,080
heard and read many of the positive and

1236
01:07:13,190 --> 01:07:17,320
negative feedback on this I I think

1237
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:20,930
there is still some issues to resolve

1238
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:24,470
myself personally I now speaking

1239
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:26,450
individually I reread this and while you

1240
01:07:24,470 --> 01:07:28,609
say that you're doing you're setting

1241
01:07:26,450 --> 01:07:31,910
forth a problem description at the end

1242
01:07:28,610 --> 01:07:35,270
you say we solve some of these

1243
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:37,279
challenges and I I kind of sympathize

1244
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:39,320
with Frank in that the document does

1245
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:41,570
feel a little schizophrenic at times

1246
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:43,580
like you want the problem statement to

1247
01:07:41,570 --> 01:07:48,160
be defined but you also want to try and

1248
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:51,680
specify solutions to it and and I would

1249
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:54,410
now back as chair say that I think we

1250
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,839
have to in order to move this work

1251
01:07:54,410 --> 01:07:58,850
forward there has to be some very

1252
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:00,260
specific clarity and agreement and

1253
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:03,970
consensus from the working group that

1254
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:06,080
this document is well scoped and meets a

1255
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:08,870
well-defined set of requirements that

1256
01:08:06,080 --> 01:08:12,049
people tend to agree to or

1257
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:13,640
overwhelmingly agree to and I think what

1258
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:17,650
we've heard here is there's still some

1259
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:21,710
some challenges and finding that clarity

1260
01:08:17,649 --> 01:08:23,839
yes so I need to clarify that we don't

1261
01:08:21,710 --> 01:08:26,330
intend to provide solutions we don't

1262
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,790
either claim we can solve this problem

1263
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:31,069
you just provides potential

1264
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:33,970
opportunities I introduced several

1265
01:08:31,069 --> 01:08:37,160
useful components into the framework

1266
01:08:33,970 --> 01:08:39,890
based on our previous support work and

1267
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:42,260
we already show the great potential of

1268
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:44,359
all that and that's why we want to

1269
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:47,839
document the challenges and share

1270
01:08:44,359 --> 01:08:50,480
experience and also show from standard

1271
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:52,399
perspective was what's the gaps it's

1272
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,428
there so that's all our intention for

1273
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:58,099
this draft yeah so I you said you had

1274
01:08:55,429 --> 01:09:00,259
another version coming I would say to

1275
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:02,060
the gentleman from telefónica if you

1276
01:09:00,259 --> 01:09:05,330
could comment on list I'm going to make

1277
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:07,670
another comment on list Frank as well

1278
01:09:05,330 --> 01:09:08,839
let's see if we can't sort those things

1279
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:10,489
out if we're going to move this forward

1280
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:13,790
we need to address some of those points

1281
01:09:10,488 --> 01:09:15,678
I think they're critical and also what

1282
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:18,198
Tim was saying maybe it's not clear

1283
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,759
enough how this differs from in TF so I

1284
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:22,099
would say we need to address some of

1285
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:26,319
those before we can we can once again

1286
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:32,929
consider moving forward okay

1287
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:35,839
can we ask what the interest about I

1288
01:09:32,929 --> 01:09:40,609
want to know the consensus of the

1289
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:42,979
interest on this draft and how many of

1290
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:49,429
you have read this document please raise

1291
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:54,198
your hand then how many of you think

1292
01:09:49,429 --> 01:09:58,400
this is this is this work is useful and

1293
01:09:54,198 --> 01:10:00,530
would like to work on this would like

1294
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:03,849
the working group to work on this draft

1295
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:03,849
please raise your hand

1296
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:24,960
on 20 of Thanks around 20 and okay next

1297
01:10:22,540 --> 01:10:24,960
one

1298
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:03,939
[Music]

1299
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:17,910
my name is Metro City SF artists and

1300
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:23,640
today I would like to present the young

1301
01:11:17,910 --> 01:11:27,540
data model for the ECP management so

1302
01:11:23,640 --> 01:11:31,040
there is a classical approach that is

1303
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:34,410
followed by the ice is nowadays this is

1304
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:36,780
using multiple hardware appliances on

1305
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:38,519
the customer premises equipment that are

1306
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:44,670
interconnected between each other to

1307
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:46,650
provide the service but to perform the

1308
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:48,870
installation and configuration equipment

1309
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:50,700
you have to send I speak have to send a

1310
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:52,590
technician on the site to perform the

1311
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:55,250
configuration with relative of the

1312
01:11:52,590 --> 01:12:00,630
topology and of the interior service

1313
01:11:55,250 --> 01:12:02,850
this is a first points at the draft

1314
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:04,830
address the second point that each

1315
01:12:02,850 --> 01:12:07,320
equipment needs to be shipped and it

1316
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:10,380
occupies in space in the rack the third

1317
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,809
point that if there is some modification

1318
01:12:10,380 --> 01:12:14,460
of the topology the technician should be

1319
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,580
sent to this customer premises equipment

1320
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:21,980
of customer premises to perform the

1321
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:30,800
modification of this topology and here

1322
01:12:21,980 --> 01:12:34,709
we try to provide at UCP approach that

1323
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:38,550
is addressing these issues so because

1324
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:40,890
the UCP is our only ask to brutalize

1325
01:12:38,550 --> 01:12:45,150
network appliances at our hardware to

1326
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:48,090
perform the possibility to have this

1327
01:12:45,150 --> 01:12:50,070
hardware as utilized on as virtual

1328
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:52,620
network functions that are

1329
01:12:50,070 --> 01:12:54,240
interconnected between each other this

1330
01:12:52,620 --> 01:12:56,220
is the first point that is trying to

1331
01:12:54,240 --> 01:12:57,480
address the second point that is trying

1332
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,180
to address the draft

1333
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:02,610
as it if you need to specify the desert

1334
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:05,250
configuration bootstrap of the equipment

1335
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:09,509
it could be easily changed in the ECP

1336
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:11,310
and when it changed the hardware

1337
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:15,180
appliance should be they instantiated

1338
01:13:11,310 --> 01:13:20,160
and instantiated a game so the UCP is

1339
01:13:15,180 --> 01:13:23,960
trying to approach say discussed points

1340
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:26,730
that were highlighted in by this slide

1341
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:30,270
the second thing that we in the draft we

1342
01:13:26,730 --> 01:13:34,169
trying to address it each supplier has

1343
01:13:30,270 --> 01:13:38,030
its own net convey an interface that is

1344
01:13:34,170 --> 01:13:40,739
managing the HCP the CCP includes three

1345
01:13:38,030 --> 01:13:43,739
layers the first layer it's hard weather

1346
01:13:40,739 --> 01:13:46,440
the second layer its liberalisation

1347
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:47,940
layer and FES network function

1348
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:53,309
virtualization infrastructure software

1349
01:13:47,940 --> 01:13:57,750
and the third one its Vienna Flair so to

1350
01:13:53,310 --> 01:14:00,540
manage the UCP the explicit is the

1351
01:13:57,750 --> 01:14:03,780
second layer and FES there are different

1352
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:07,800
models used for each supplier and this

1353
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:13,590
draft tries to introduce you could see

1354
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:16,920
on this slide on the bottom the an

1355
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:20,220
example of the UCP infrastructure that

1356
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:24,090
and n FES is a key you could configure

1357
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:27,750
be a annette confirm interface and the

1358
01:14:24,090 --> 01:14:29,910
draft is addressing the the draft is

1359
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:32,880
proposing that Nia is a young model that

1360
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:34,170
is unique for all of the suppliers so

1361
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,620
basically with this young model you

1362
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:40,800
could manage the CP explicit easily

1363
01:14:37,620 --> 01:14:42,809
veered quick emulator so that we

1364
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,840
announce that inside and you also could

1365
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:49,610
manage the vertices or vector packet

1366
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:57,330
processor inside of the UCP so basically

1367
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:59,549
this model is kind of unique for should

1368
01:14:57,330 --> 01:15:02,010
be unique for different kind of

1369
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:04,230
suppliers and it could be placed in

1370
01:15:02,010 --> 01:15:08,040
network Orchestrator or series

1371
01:15:04,230 --> 01:15:12,650
Orchestrator so basically this lights

1372
01:15:08,040 --> 01:15:12,650
presents the model itself on

1373
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:19,190
right and you could we have some

1374
01:15:17,330 --> 01:15:22,910
questions to the working group regarding

1375
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:24,219
the improvement of the document for

1376
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:26,930
example do we need to include some

1377
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:31,220
specific details about this type for

1378
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:34,070
example I D V R T or specific options

1379
01:15:31,220 --> 01:15:35,990
because we could some built on machines

1380
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:37,460
require specification of this so the

1381
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:40,040
question should be should it be agnostic

1382
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:41,840
in gesture service in the Python or Java

1383
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:43,850
logic or should it be at the part of the

1384
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,430
young model the second thing that we

1385
01:15:43,850 --> 01:15:48,650
would like to address its do we need

1386
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:49,970
some augmentations statement on the top

1387
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:53,059
of the model because if you want to

1388
01:15:49,970 --> 01:15:57,350
include it to the series 3 or network

1389
01:15:53,060 --> 01:15:59,090
modeling tree we would like to we need

1390
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:01,460
the young element ation model in this

1391
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:04,130
young model and another question is

1392
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:05,870
about the CP pinning well sometimes we

1393
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:08,060
want to be enough to not intersect

1394
01:16:05,870 --> 01:16:10,700
between each other so we need to assign

1395
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:12,830
one core to one Yein have one little

1396
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,380
Corky purse wedding or the physical book

1397
01:16:12,830 --> 01:16:17,470
or in this case two little course to say

1398
01:16:15,380 --> 01:16:19,970
specifically enough says it to have the

1399
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:23,810
CPP and the kind of isolation between

1400
01:16:19,970 --> 01:16:27,250
zhenya nerves thank you so could you

1401
01:16:23,810 --> 01:16:29,480
please suggest some questions or

1402
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:31,270
suggestions about the how we could

1403
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:34,280
improve the draft

1404
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:38,060
hi Dambach damaged how is this different

1405
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:46,009
from the RFC 85 30 which is the young

1406
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:49,970
model for logical network elements so in

1407
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:53,180
this this this model introduced

1408
01:16:49,970 --> 01:16:58,250
introduces is a desire configuration

1409
01:16:53,180 --> 01:17:00,680
that is specifically allowing us for the

1410
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:03,560
network element to have the possibility

1411
01:17:00,680 --> 01:17:04,880
to specify the variable and the value is

1412
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,290
a variable and the value to these

1413
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,480
variables that you would like to put in

1414
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:13,760
the series because it's like kind of the

1415
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:16,730
bootstrap that you are putting to the to

1416
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:18,530
the BNF you could substitute some

1417
01:17:16,730 --> 01:17:20,570
variables from this bootstrap with some

1418
01:17:18,530 --> 01:17:25,219
values it's the first thing the second

1419
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:28,429
thing that it includes the

1420
01:17:25,219 --> 01:17:30,650
little natural functions in the

1421
01:17:28,430 --> 01:17:33,340
description inside of the model can I

1422
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:40,429
ask you are you familiar with the RFC

1423
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:43,699
8530 it would be nice if you could

1424
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:46,130
suggest some familiar with it or not

1425
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:47,780
it's it's called like yang data like the

1426
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:51,469
young data model for logical network

1427
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:53,030
elements you can say yes or no there's

1428
01:17:51,469 --> 01:17:55,250
no wrong answer there so the point that

1429
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:57,440
I could read it but I'm not sure that

1430
01:17:55,250 --> 01:18:05,180
therefore I could answer that I remember

1431
01:17:57,440 --> 01:18:07,489
it the name actually increased working

1432
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:11,120
with this that he topology service aware

1433
01:18:07,489 --> 01:18:14,239
topology model actually may be relevant

1434
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:15,500
to to your job that maybe you should

1435
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:18,559
take a look at that there's some

1436
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:20,690
overlapping so thank you for the

1437
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,890
suggestion actually there's new versions

1438
01:18:20,690 --> 01:18:27,589
coming and we included the young model

1439
01:18:24,890 --> 01:18:30,830
to the T so we have networks networks T

1440
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:34,040
and after we used a service function

1441
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:38,690
aware topology too as it is draft from

1442
01:18:34,040 --> 01:18:41,630
Tyus and we also try to we worked during

1443
01:18:38,690 --> 01:18:44,000
some time on it and we will we will be

1444
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:45,890
try to combine together different

1445
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,320
tariffs ease and drafts that are

1446
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:51,380
provided by the IDF to achieve the goal

1447
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:57,280
so the basic point that ZT is used in

1448
01:18:51,380 --> 01:19:01,130
the next version so we augment the tt-33

1449
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:04,400
ii Khamenei's seem so there's some other

1450
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:06,620
work in Si and every so as same every

1451
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:10,519
may develop some young data model relate

1452
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:14,180
to the I'm afraid we are for so you also

1453
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:17,360
need to take a look at how to address is

1454
01:19:14,180 --> 01:19:19,969
kind of overlapping okay yes indeed

1455
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:23,120
there some working the work existed at

1456
01:19:19,969 --> 01:19:27,290
sea but the idea here is it with trying

1457
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:29,330
to to integrate the not explicitly with

1458
01:19:27,290 --> 01:19:31,640
this model the next model in the new job

1459
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,230
that is coming if you are interested you

1460
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:36,170
could come and we could discuss we have

1461
01:19:33,230 --> 01:19:39,040
this model in the our not notebook

1462
01:19:36,170 --> 01:19:41,080
so it's openly available

1463
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:44,320
the ideas here that there is some work

1464
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:47,170
at Etsy and they we have some structure

1465
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:50,620
at ITF that we are developing so the

1466
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:55,030
points that it's not maybe it could try

1467
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:57,250
to solve similar problem but the this

1468
01:19:55,030 --> 01:20:02,820
thing here that what we are trying to

1469
01:19:57,250 --> 01:20:08,140
address it's to develop the ITF young

1470
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:12,880
structure does the challenge good for

1471
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:14,800
you or just a sink well then there's

1472
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,870
needed some cream and everything I see

1473
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:25,210
anyway yeah maybe it's true or if you I

1474
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:27,130
would take a look at your and okay so

1475
01:20:25,210 --> 01:20:29,410
they do that in the next version of the

1476
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:31,570
draft we are kind of not creating

1477
01:20:29,410 --> 01:20:33,610
everything from the scratch it's more

1478
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:36,429
like reusing of the existing RFC and

1479
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:38,710
drafts if you want I could take the

1480
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:41,470
notebook and give you some specific

1481
01:20:38,710 --> 01:20:43,800
details after the session all right now

1482
01:20:41,470 --> 01:20:46,720
is the it depends on your desire so

1483
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:49,570
basically the idea here that we are not

1484
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:51,910
ready fining the existing stuff we're

1485
01:20:49,570 --> 01:20:53,590
trying to use not explicitly in this

1486
01:20:51,910 --> 01:20:55,000
model in the next version of the model

1487
01:20:53,590 --> 01:21:00,970
we tried to use what it was defined

1488
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:03,820
already by the ITF just a question for

1489
01:21:00,970 --> 01:21:07,950
clarification that you and then you are

1490
01:21:03,820 --> 01:21:13,210
giving a clue go to the previous slide

1491
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:16,720
yes this one I'm I like to check whether

1492
01:21:13,210 --> 01:21:18,850
your model is used for like the

1493
01:21:16,720 --> 01:21:21,910
controller northbound or accurate or

1494
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:25,120
northbound because like the previous one

1495
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:28,480
the l3 in them they are defining the

1496
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:30,790
network modeling so I'm just - what

1497
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:33,580
check with you whether yours one is a

1498
01:21:30,790 --> 01:21:39,990
service like customer facing service

1499
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:39,990
model or or network like network model

1500
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:47,290
this is a good suggestion I think that

1501
01:21:44,350 --> 01:21:51,250
we just recently saw the draft about l3

1502
01:21:47,290 --> 01:21:53,260
and 3sm and maybe this

1503
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:55,900
draft was that we are presenting it

1504
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:57,790
could be addressed by the network or

1505
01:21:55,900 --> 01:22:00,820
model this could be type of the

1506
01:21:57,790 --> 01:22:04,680
networking modeling yes yes I think this

1507
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:08,650
like relates to the themes comments like

1508
01:22:04,680 --> 01:22:13,330
f3 mm I think they they are augmenting

1509
01:22:08,650 --> 01:22:17,710
the network topology model to do the the

1510
01:22:13,330 --> 01:22:21,309
f3 with him one so I suggest you can do

1511
01:22:17,710 --> 01:22:23,110
the similar book okay okay we I think we

1512
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:25,300
in the next question of the draft we

1513
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:28,750
will have this basically we will have

1514
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:32,070
the RFC that is networks network after

1515
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:36,520
we have T and we augment Eve is specific

1516
01:22:32,070 --> 01:22:38,980
series away and Sarah Sarah topology and

1517
01:22:36,520 --> 01:22:43,660
we add some other RFC's to convert to

1518
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:47,110
add the configuration to the digital

1519
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:50,230
configuration and for the image image

1520
01:22:47,110 --> 01:22:52,330
booting for TCP so sorry we're gonna

1521
01:22:50,230 --> 01:22:54,129
have to Rob and Adrienne can you take

1522
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:56,920
your comments to the list we're running

1523
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:59,740
short on time at this point sure this is

1524
01:22:56,920 --> 01:23:01,610
a general comment yep we'll record it in

1525
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:04,750
the minutes thanks

1526
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,750
[Music]

1527
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:30,129
all right so I'm Andrew gray and I'm

1528
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:31,900
here to talk about a draft idea that we

1529
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:33,610
started circling a little bit at the

1530
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:35,139
last IETF kind of put a little meat on

1531
01:23:33,610 --> 01:23:38,650
it so we're kind of opening it up for

1532
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:40,690
wider audience at 1:06 here and trying

1533
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:42,790
to get some more feedback and input on

1534
01:23:40,690 --> 01:23:46,059
it right now it's called sampled

1535
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:47,530
streaming so as an operator I've got a

1536
01:23:46,060 --> 01:23:49,210
problem coming up and I can see this

1537
01:23:47,530 --> 01:23:51,940
train coming at me from a little wild

1538
01:23:49,210 --> 01:23:54,130
away I have a lot of cooling right now

1539
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:56,710
that takes actual packet data its

1540
01:23:54,130 --> 01:23:58,810
sampling it at one in 1,000 or 1 mm I

1541
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:00,790
have dedicated in line appliances doing

1542
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:04,210
this or sometimes I'm doing this on box

1543
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:05,800
as my link speeds grow every single

1544
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:08,290
iteration of that I have to replace that

1545
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:09,940
hardware and this seems kind of silly

1546
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:11,830
when I have a giant router that's

1547
01:24:09,940 --> 01:24:13,240
sitting there with Hardware on board

1548
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:16,420
that's perfectly capable of replicating

1549
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:18,190
packets for me previous arguments

1550
01:24:16,420 --> 01:24:20,710
against this had been oh you know

1551
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:22,299
computes expensive I've got so much

1552
01:24:20,710 --> 01:24:23,980
virtualized compute right now I've got

1553
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:26,110
gobs and gobs of computer that's not

1554
01:24:23,980 --> 01:24:29,799
really my problem I need to get the data

1555
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:33,790
off the box and a lot of the existing

1556
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:35,530
methods today use on BOTS capabilities

1557
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:37,390
but they're either have control plane

1558
01:24:35,530 --> 01:24:39,610
punts and as I start looking at higher

1559
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:42,160
speed cards where I'm started doing you

1560
01:24:39,610 --> 01:24:44,380
know 14 for Terra 28 Terra on a line

1561
01:24:42,160 --> 01:24:46,540
card punting to the control plane it's

1562
01:24:44,380 --> 01:24:47,980
not feasible I'm not gonna be able to

1563
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:50,230
get a sampling rate anywhere close to

1564
01:24:47,980 --> 01:24:52,780
where I want you know we're hearing one

1565
01:24:50,230 --> 01:24:57,009
in 20,000 might even be optimistic from

1566
01:24:52,780 --> 01:24:59,889
that so I need to be able to control

1567
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:01,750
this sampling or this packet replication

1568
01:24:59,890 --> 01:25:03,310
or span or whatever you want to call it

1569
01:25:01,750 --> 01:25:06,280
I want to be able to do different

1570
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:08,410
variable sampling rates and I want to be

1571
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:11,650
able to filter this on ports or layer 3

1572
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:13,900
information or what have you the other

1573
01:25:11,650 --> 01:25:16,480
kind of nifty thing I would like to be

1574
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:18,759
able to do is be able to grab both

1575
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:22,480
traffic that I'm forwarding and traffic

1576
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:24,100
I'm dropping so inside the draft itself

1577
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:25,719
there's a little bit of nomenclature we

1578
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:27,730
just put in there just to try and keep

1579
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:29,590
things saying the client is basically

1580
01:25:27,730 --> 01:25:32,019
the Box doing the configuration work the

1581
01:25:29,590 --> 01:25:33,790
replicator you can if for most of our

1582
01:25:32,020 --> 01:25:36,430
purposes think the main router the

1583
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,269
control plane the point is usually

1584
01:25:36,430 --> 01:25:39,340
easiest of

1585
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:41,380
be thought of as an ASIC and the

1586
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:43,120
receiver is whatever device off in my

1587
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:46,780
data center cloud that I'm sending all

1588
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:48,880
this sample to traffic - so my

1589
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:52,360
must-haves that I want as an operator

1590
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:55,090
from this is I need this to be extremely

1591
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:57,070
light on my own box CPU the data planes

1592
01:25:55,090 --> 01:25:59,170
are scaling incredibly high incredibly

1593
01:25:57,070 --> 01:26:02,230
quickly but on box control plane and on

1594
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:04,210
box CPU aren't I cannot be sending Tara

1595
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:07,120
bits of traffic to my own box CPU it

1596
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:09,460
will melt down so I need something that

1597
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:12,430
can be handled strictly on the data

1598
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:13,840
plane I want to avoid ASIC recirculation

1599
01:26:12,430 --> 01:26:16,540
or anything that causes me to lose

1600
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,580
performance on this box because again

1601
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:20,230
you know I'm ringing these boxes pretty

1602
01:26:18,580 --> 01:26:20,950
hot I don't want to have to sit here and

1603
01:26:20,230 --> 01:26:23,379
worry about it

1604
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:25,150
and most importantly I need one standard

1605
01:26:23,380 --> 01:26:29,170
method to cover everything

1606
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:30,730
routers ideally servers anything that's

1607
01:26:29,170 --> 01:26:34,390
really passing traffic should be able to

1608
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:37,209
handle it say anything nice to haves as

1609
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:38,770
a packet goes through a box the ASIC

1610
01:26:37,210 --> 01:26:41,350
certainly knows more information about

1611
01:26:38,770 --> 01:26:43,570
it than just the bits and bytes of the

1612
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:45,790
packet itself it has things like what

1613
01:26:43,570 --> 01:26:47,889
port did come in on when precisely

1614
01:26:45,790 --> 01:26:50,350
timestamp wise so that packets start

1615
01:26:47,890 --> 01:26:52,240
arriving what is my intended disposition

1616
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:54,430
of that packet am I gonna forward him I

1617
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,840
gonna drop it if I'm gonna queue it what

1618
01:26:54,430 --> 01:26:57,910
am I actually doing with it

1619
01:26:55,840 --> 01:26:59,350
generally internally Asics will know

1620
01:26:57,910 --> 01:27:02,320
this information they'll have it in

1621
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:04,570
various bits in different places in the

1622
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,969
cells that are it's using - for traffic

1623
01:27:04,570 --> 01:27:08,650
with I'd like to be able to get that I'd

1624
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:10,660
like to be able to pull that off box so

1625
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:14,139
I can do analytics and everything else

1626
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:15,580
on it you know the other point I say on

1627
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:17,920
here is you know being able to see what

1628
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:20,170
traffic on dropping at that box would be

1629
01:27:17,920 --> 01:27:22,600
very useful our Mike us policies working

1630
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:24,280
right or my filters working right being

1631
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:26,410
able to actually pull that traffic off

1632
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:31,179
before the box drops it would be a very

1633
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:33,280
nice to have so we've ran this Draft

1634
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:35,050
around a few different people I always

1635
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:37,540
seem to get the same set of questions

1636
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:39,370
right away so kind of heading some of

1637
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:41,140
this off at the pass

1638
01:27:39,370 --> 01:27:43,090
one question comes up fairly often so

1639
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:45,130
why not use an IP fix extension or

1640
01:27:43,090 --> 01:27:46,540
something along those lines the bullet

1641
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:48,370
points up here kind of talked about the

1642
01:27:46,540 --> 01:27:50,260
big ones of that but the main thing is I

1643
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:51,070
want the raw packets and I want that a

1644
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:53,260
signet it

1645
01:27:51,070 --> 01:27:55,269
Meishan come off of it I need to be able

1646
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:58,450
to set this streaming via sampling rate

1647
01:27:55,270 --> 01:28:00,280
potentially as low as 1 to 1 well in the

1648
01:27:58,450 --> 01:28:02,080
use cases that we mentioned and draft as

1649
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:03,880
having for example a security box that's

1650
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:06,490
watching all my incoming traffic maybe

1651
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:09,130
it pulls it off at 1 a thousand it sees

1652
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:11,019
something strange a DDoS or a micro flow

1653
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:12,910
DDoS whatever you want to call it and it

1654
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,260
can add in an additional rule says hey I

1655
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:17,559
want to see this traffic and I want to

1656
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:19,900
see it at 1 to 1 for example and a lot

1657
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:21,580
of these things are CPU driven they're

1658
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:23,049
either control plane ponds or you have

1659
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:27,030
to do a lot of work on the chip or you

1660
01:28:23,050 --> 01:28:30,430
have to do it recirculation implement

1661
01:28:27,030 --> 01:28:31,780
inside the specification or inside the

1662
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:35,110
draft there is actually a little bit

1663
01:28:31,780 --> 01:28:38,160
negotiation that goes on in the actual

1664
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:41,469
format of the data that comes off

1665
01:28:38,160 --> 01:28:43,599
towards the receiver here that green

1666
01:28:41,470 --> 01:28:46,570
arrow is actually determined entirely

1667
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:49,000
dynamically in the protocol it is not

1668
01:28:46,570 --> 01:28:51,610
set there is no set packet format

1669
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:53,860
instead what's defined is basically a

1670
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:56,230
way to communicate this is the structure

1671
01:28:53,860 --> 01:28:58,960
the data I'll be receiving so for

1672
01:28:56,230 --> 01:29:00,219
example it can say hey I've got 6 bits

1673
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,680
at the header I'll tell you what the

1674
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:04,960
input ports are in by the way here's the

1675
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:06,220
mapping a value of 8 here will be port 0

1676
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,960
or what have you

1677
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:09,970
all of that is handled in the control

1678
01:29:07,960 --> 01:29:12,550
plane negotiation up there between the

1679
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:14,800
replicator and the client the point

1680
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:17,200
doesn't need to do any data conversion

1681
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:19,360
on its own it just copies replicates

1682
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:25,210
throws a header on it and gets it off

1683
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:26,889
the box so that's the main reason behind

1684
01:29:25,210 --> 01:29:29,410
not having a fixed format having this

1685
01:29:26,890 --> 01:29:31,690
negotiate format having an ASIC try and

1686
01:29:29,410 --> 01:29:34,210
do anything fancy with bit minion bit

1687
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:36,669
manipulation almost inevitably results

1688
01:29:34,210 --> 01:29:38,860
in slowing down the information the how

1689
01:29:36,670 --> 01:29:40,150
much it can work through the

1690
01:29:38,860 --> 01:29:41,980
specification is written to be

1691
01:29:40,150 --> 01:29:43,480
reasonably future-proof and we're

1692
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:45,459
looking for additional inputs or what

1693
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:46,990
else we can add in there but if worse

1694
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:49,240
comes to worse there was even a generic

1695
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,889
padding just hey this is 13 bits of

1696
01:29:49,240 --> 01:29:54,309
internal garbage that's gonna be sitting

1697
01:29:50,890 --> 01:29:55,750
on the wire ignore it but having the

1698
01:29:54,310 --> 01:29:57,700
ASIC actually sit there trying where you

1699
01:29:55,750 --> 01:30:00,640
process that packet to take that 13 bits

1700
01:29:57,700 --> 01:30:02,920
out is worth less to me than just being

1701
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:05,640
able to shunt it off at my computer

1702
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,640
capability

1703
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:10,900
so I'm accepts we're at a - OH - right

1704
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:13,420
now which kind of rework a couple of

1705
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:16,330
things there's actually now a mechanism

1706
01:30:13,420 --> 01:30:19,000
for having the replicator present

1707
01:30:16,330 --> 01:30:20,440
different options back to the client so

1708
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:22,360
the client can say hey I want this

1709
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:23,799
replicator can say okay I can give you

1710
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:26,170
exactly that but you're going to take a

1711
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:28,320
research penalty or I can give you this

1712
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:30,730
that's kind of close without a penalty

1713
01:30:28,320 --> 01:30:32,950
we've had a lot of good feedback and

1714
01:30:30,730 --> 01:30:34,330
from a few different operators and a

1715
01:30:32,950 --> 01:30:37,389
couple different hardware providers

1716
01:30:34,330 --> 01:30:40,330
about it so we are continuing to work on

1717
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:42,580
it and just looking for more interest or

1718
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:46,420
input or what-have-you from the

1719
01:30:42,580 --> 01:30:48,790
community at large we probably have time

1720
01:30:46,420 --> 01:30:50,800
for two comments and then the rest I'll

1721
01:30:48,790 --> 01:30:52,990
have to go to the list maybe you have

1722
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,790
one friend programmers and so I have a

1723
01:30:52,990 --> 01:30:57,940
load of sympathy for the draft and you

1724
01:30:54,790 --> 01:30:59,980
said that well you have a load of

1725
01:30:57,940 --> 01:31:02,650
questions that you typically get and I

1726
01:30:59,980 --> 01:31:04,959
would really definitely suggest that you

1727
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:06,759
address them in the draft right so if

1728
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,520
you scan through the draft you don't

1729
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:11,890
even find peace a mention so I would

1730
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:14,260
have expected that you compare to 5476

1731
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:17,020
and say well this is what we're doing

1732
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:18,400
differently and so I would exact well

1733
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:21,610
you can have that example that you have

1734
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,200
in section 4 where you have ACT fields

1735
01:31:21,610 --> 01:31:24,880
that's forwarding status with IP fix

1736
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,920
right so you have incoming port that's

1737
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:28,990
ingress interface you have the time

1738
01:31:26,920 --> 01:31:31,330
stamp field which is your export I'm in

1739
01:31:28,990 --> 01:31:33,639
an IP fix so all these fears are defined

1740
01:31:31,330 --> 01:31:36,040
we can should should have at least if

1741
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:37,600
you're comparing this is how you would

1742
01:31:36,040 --> 01:31:39,519
do it with IP fix and peace I am and

1743
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,190
this is how we do it and hence were more

1744
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:43,870
compact and that's what we're adding on

1745
01:31:41,190 --> 01:31:45,580
let's do that in the draft right so that

1746
01:31:43,870 --> 01:31:46,960
we are clear on what the Delta is that

1747
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:48,640
we're trying to solve as opposed to

1748
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:50,740
right now it seems like something new

1749
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:52,780
well it's it's a delta is a little bit

1750
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:53,679
of a delta on what we have and let's

1751
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:55,960
make that explicit

1752
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,490
okay that's good feedback one thing I'll

1753
01:31:55,960 --> 01:31:59,170
point out is a lot of people will look

1754
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:00,760
in the draft and see you know I have a

1755
01:31:59,170 --> 01:32:02,650
couple examples of what the resulting

1756
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:04,960
packet header will be those are purely

1757
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:08,379
just examples they're not normative in

1758
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:10,780
any way shape or form thank you dan

1759
01:32:08,380 --> 01:32:12,670
Bogdanovich you were mentioning

1760
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:15,370
performance yes and I would have a

1761
01:32:12,670 --> 01:32:17,530
question on capacity and indirectly

1762
01:32:15,370 --> 01:32:18,160
you're mentioning capacity if you want

1763
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:21,040
to do

1764
01:32:18,160 --> 01:32:25,090
any data playing packet in the

1765
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:27,130
collection mirroring you always have a

1766
01:32:25,090 --> 01:32:28,840
choice there's only so much you know

1767
01:32:27,130 --> 01:32:30,460
things on the ASIC that you can do with

1768
01:32:28,840 --> 01:32:33,400
it right any other way what you're

1769
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:35,650
asking for is sort of up you you cannot

1770
01:32:33,400 --> 01:32:38,170
have both you can either have more

1771
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:41,049
telemetry from the data point or you

1772
01:32:38,170 --> 01:32:45,340
have more packet forwarding which one do

1773
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:46,870
you want so outstanding question that's

1774
01:32:45,340 --> 01:32:48,550
actually one of the main things so the

1775
01:32:46,870 --> 01:32:49,930
draft does address us a little bit and

1776
01:32:48,550 --> 01:32:51,340
saying you know if you enable this

1777
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:53,740
option you're gonna take this amount of

1778
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:55,420
performance penalty to do so so that's

1779
01:32:53,740 --> 01:32:57,880
the reason why that option was in there

1780
01:32:55,420 --> 01:32:59,830
in terms of what I want from an operator

1781
01:32:57,880 --> 01:33:01,930
perspective I want the data off the box

1782
01:32:59,830 --> 01:33:04,840
I'd like to do it for free

1783
01:33:01,930 --> 01:33:07,120
but that's incredibly optimistic now I

1784
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:08,800
will say generally speaking in this the

1785
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,960
reason I pulled this slide back up the

1786
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:12,550
the interfaces are being used for the

1787
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:14,380
normal traffic flow or almost certainly

1788
01:33:12,550 --> 01:33:16,720
not going to be the interfaces I use the

1789
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:20,470
Sun traffic off at least in our use case

1790
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:22,360
yes so having the ASIC do its normal

1791
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:24,220
processing and also doing effectively a

1792
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:27,280
packet replication going somewhere else

1793
01:33:24,220 --> 01:33:30,010
yeah that's okay something Asics can do

1794
01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,719
fairly well usually this is just saying

1795
01:33:30,010 --> 01:33:33,840
hey copy the additional med data and

1796
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:37,390
throw UDP header on in front of it so

1797
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:39,790
understood it is a concern but you know

1798
01:33:37,390 --> 01:33:42,100
to your point sacrifices have to be made

1799
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:43,180
and the other part is also when you're

1800
01:33:42,100 --> 01:33:46,120
saying oh we would like to get this

1801
01:33:43,180 --> 01:33:48,460
additional data mm-hmm from it you can

1802
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:51,010
get it in this whole data but again it's

1803
01:33:48,460 --> 01:33:52,660
coming at the cost so it's all it's all

1804
01:33:51,010 --> 01:33:54,220
about you know everything comes there

1805
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:56,220
with the cost and there has been you

1806
01:33:54,220 --> 01:33:58,690
know a long-standing issue with that

1807
01:33:56,220 --> 01:34:00,400
many people was oh we would like to know

1808
01:33:58,690 --> 01:34:01,839
to have this information from it yeah

1809
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:03,160
sure you can have it but this is what it

1810
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,440
cost you and then they're starting to

1811
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:06,910
rethink that the issue so the way the

1812
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:09,690
draft is written the replicator is

1813
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:12,400
offering what it can provide you

1814
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:14,589
essentially for free so for example if

1815
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:16,120
it knows its internal format has this

1816
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:17,260
additional information that's all it's

1817
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,670
describing it's saying here's the

1818
01:34:17,260 --> 01:34:20,680
additional information that's available

1819
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:22,390
we're not really asking for it to do

1820
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:24,820
additionals so my main concern is

1821
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:26,620
whether you're saying for free there

1822
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:30,880
isn't the freedom I I'm being a little

1823
01:34:26,620 --> 01:34:31,960
our ironic / classic yes so we're gonna

1824
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:34,930
we're gonna have to cut

1825
01:34:31,960 --> 01:34:36,940
the mic we take the need to take the

1826
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:42,310
additional comments to the list we are

1827
01:34:36,940 --> 01:34:43,960
very tight on time at this point your

1828
01:34:42,310 --> 01:34:47,890
the ad and it's cutting into your time

1829
01:34:43,960 --> 01:34:49,660
so given Ignace McDonough's given the

1830
01:34:47,890 --> 01:34:51,820
interest in this topic and while we are

1831
01:34:49,660 --> 01:34:54,550
here and you please organize a side

1832
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:56,440
meeting today tomorrow Friday announce

1833
01:34:54,550 --> 01:34:58,239
that to the community and have the

1834
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,690
discussion that this is supposed to be

1835
01:34:58,239 --> 01:35:00,669
needed

1836
01:34:58,690 --> 01:35:02,469
yeah so it's gone out on the mailing

1837
01:35:00,670 --> 01:35:04,360
list a couple times but generally I'll

1838
01:35:02,469 --> 01:35:05,710
say hey here's a new draft out on the

1839
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,469
mailing last year's a little bit about

1840
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:09,940
it so the intention is to you know do

1841
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:11,380
another announcement out there on the

1842
01:35:09,940 --> 01:35:12,940
post I'd Hague you know here's the draft

1843
01:35:11,380 --> 01:35:14,590
let's talk about I think what Ignis is

1844
01:35:12,940 --> 01:35:18,070
saying is we have opportunities to do

1845
01:35:14,590 --> 01:35:20,080
side meetings here while in Singapore so

1846
01:35:18,070 --> 01:35:22,120
if you can schedule one there seems to

1847
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:25,059
be some interest and pulling that

1848
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,570
together in face to face oh okay yeah

1849
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:28,239
absolutely

1850
01:35:25,570 --> 01:35:42,849
it's also now a message asking for that

1851
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:43,959
too thank you Thanks five minutes three

1852
01:35:42,850 --> 01:35:48,820
because I'm freezing

1853
01:35:43,960 --> 01:35:52,330
ah what a nice and warm room um so thank

1854
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:55,929
you this is a new draft that we just

1855
01:35:52,330 --> 01:36:00,519
recently published to fill an old gap so

1856
01:35:55,930 --> 01:36:02,110
we have quite a few IEM drafts in flight

1857
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:04,480
and they are touching on multiple

1858
01:36:02,110 --> 01:36:06,910
aspects there it started off specific

1859
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:09,459
specifying the data fields we have

1860
01:36:06,910 --> 01:36:12,130
drafts that cover operations we have a

1861
01:36:09,460 --> 01:36:14,800
yang model we have a draft on data

1862
01:36:12,130 --> 01:36:16,239
export we have multiple drafts on the

1863
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:19,060
various encapsulations

1864
01:36:16,239 --> 01:36:22,450
for the various protocols that IOM lives

1865
01:36:19,060 --> 01:36:26,950
in but we never had one draft that

1866
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:29,620
pulled it all together well we have one

1867
01:36:26,950 --> 01:36:31,179
now I think that's the announcement that

1868
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:32,830
I want to want to make because many

1869
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:35,680
people have been asking me how does it

1870
01:36:32,830 --> 01:36:38,080
all fit together kind of give me an

1871
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:41,680
inventory of what is out there and tell

1872
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:44,110
me how can I go get it deployed what do

1873
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:45,789
I need to go and consider if I move from

1874
01:36:44,110 --> 01:36:47,980
the very specification

1875
01:36:45,789 --> 01:36:50,079
into something that is real life and

1876
01:36:47,980 --> 01:36:53,379
Wiccan what do I need a don't take into

1877
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:56,110
account so discuss how I use namespaces

1878
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:58,599
how I use layering how the various trade

1879
01:36:56,110 --> 01:37:01,630
option types are used why do you have

1880
01:36:58,599 --> 01:37:03,489
different trace option formats something

1881
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:05,079
that is maybe better for a hardware

1882
01:37:03,489 --> 01:37:06,480
implementation something that is maybe

1883
01:37:05,079 --> 01:37:09,130
better for a software implementation

1884
01:37:06,480 --> 01:37:12,489
we're discussing all of that in that

1885
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:15,039
particular draft we already received a

1886
01:37:12,489 --> 01:37:19,780
bunch of input saying well I want this

1887
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:21,730
to be better specified Barack who's at

1888
01:37:19,780 --> 01:37:24,389
left had a leave yesterday said well I'm

1889
01:37:21,730 --> 01:37:28,598
gonna go and give you a paragraph on

1890
01:37:24,389 --> 01:37:30,340
active measurements and probe packets we

1891
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:32,829
need to go and expand on what a

1892
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:34,539
particular layer is and how you're gonna

1893
01:37:32,829 --> 01:37:35,920
don't suppose that it's supposed to use

1894
01:37:34,539 --> 01:37:37,659
the layer above and beyond the what we

1895
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:39,309
have in the draft so there's a couple of

1896
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:40,719
things we need to go and expand with

1897
01:37:39,309 --> 01:37:41,980
certain and caps that are not really

1898
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:45,070
fleshed out as part of the original

1899
01:37:41,980 --> 01:37:46,959
drafts like with eg re how do you use it

1900
01:37:45,070 --> 01:37:49,000
because there's multiple ways and how

1901
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:52,710
you're gonna go use it so I think we

1902
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:56,380
have a home for that now that's it

1903
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:57,969
any thoughts anything is that useful as

1904
01:37:56,380 --> 01:38:01,090
a document because if it's useful as a

1905
01:37:57,969 --> 01:38:02,530
document and I heard so so far then well

1906
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:04,329
I'm hoping that we can go and make it a

1907
01:38:02,530 --> 01:38:13,179
working group document and not too far

1908
01:38:04,329 --> 01:38:15,670
future s one Jeff I think it is very

1909
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:19,000
useful it puts all the different work in

1910
01:38:15,670 --> 01:38:22,179
single document and especially for

1911
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:25,449
people who come into this area now it's

1912
01:38:22,179 --> 01:38:27,280
really complex to understand what's been

1913
01:38:25,449 --> 01:38:29,739
going on for last five year starting who

1914
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,900
was int and barefoot in everything that

1915
01:38:29,739 --> 01:38:36,360
came after so it's really good document

1916
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:36,360
and out support progress okay thank you

1917
01:38:38,130 --> 01:38:44,019
rajeev oh sorry and cisco this is really

1918
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:46,809
useful one thing that might suggest you

1919
01:38:44,019 --> 01:38:48,760
to consider is that maybe expand on some

1920
01:38:46,809 --> 01:38:52,239
recommendation like there's so many

1921
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:55,840
things that you know it's like a recipe

1922
01:38:52,239 --> 01:38:57,428
for how to cook something out of it if

1923
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:59,110
there is a section where you could give

1924
01:38:57,429 --> 01:38:59,510
some sort of recommendation that would

1925
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:07,250
be

1926
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:09,320
immensely useful okay thank you they're

1927
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:12,039
all up at night I found the document

1928
01:39:09,320 --> 01:39:14,389
quite useful because navigating all the

1929
01:39:12,039 --> 01:39:16,730
IOM at the ends becomes really

1930
01:39:14,389 --> 01:39:18,530
challenging if you're not part of the

1931
01:39:16,730 --> 01:39:21,829
people writing the documents and you try

1932
01:39:18,530 --> 01:39:23,869
to apply it I would agree to that even

1933
01:39:21,829 --> 01:39:28,058
if you're right in that right correct

1934
01:39:23,869 --> 01:39:30,619
no but probably I mean this idea of the

1935
01:39:28,059 --> 01:39:32,960
strict recommendations probably is gonna

1936
01:39:30,619 --> 01:39:36,409
go a little bit too far I wouldn't leave

1937
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:40,099
this open till we have more actual

1938
01:39:36,409 --> 01:39:42,619
experience and the deployment we can

1939
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:44,659
make an amendment and you wanna simply

1940
01:39:42,619 --> 01:39:46,969
simply because of the of the

1941
01:39:44,659 --> 01:39:48,860
accumulation of experience that is

1942
01:39:46,969 --> 01:39:53,989
something that we will require in the

1943
01:39:48,860 --> 01:39:57,469
coming future I guess make sense again

1944
01:39:53,989 --> 01:39:59,419
so given its really applicability think

1945
01:39:57,469 --> 01:40:03,769
I would like to ask it to present in

1946
01:39:59,420 --> 01:40:11,739
routing next year if possible asking us

1947
01:40:03,769 --> 01:40:11,739
routing or no chair good Frank thank you

1948
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:31,190
hello everyone I'm through I'll be

1949
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:37,100
presenting in a brief to the mud

1950
01:40:31,190 --> 01:40:38,450
teyla's profiles for ya I'll be present

1951
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:40,610
you can update to the Marty Ellis

1952
01:40:38,450 --> 01:40:47,389
profiles for IOT devices this first

1953
01:40:40,610 --> 01:40:50,330
version of the draft was presented at ok

1954
01:40:47,390 --> 01:40:52,220
thanks yeah the first version of this

1955
01:40:50,330 --> 01:40:53,690
draft was presented the last idea we

1956
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:55,760
made significant changes to the draft

1957
01:40:53,690 --> 01:40:58,160
after that and I'll be presenting an

1958
01:40:55,760 --> 01:41:00,530
update to this raft we'll go over a

1959
01:40:58,160 --> 01:41:01,940
quick review of free cap of what this

1960
01:41:00,530 --> 01:41:04,550
draft talks about from the solution

1961
01:41:01,940 --> 01:41:08,480
review and our observations with IOT

1962
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:10,330
devices so what we have been doing for

1963
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:12,650
the first few months is basically

1964
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:14,600
correcting a TLS profile from various

1965
01:41:12,650 --> 01:41:17,000
malware families from eka Phillips and

1966
01:41:14,600 --> 01:41:19,100
what we had identified was there were

1967
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:21,800
significant differences between benign

1968
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:24,380
flows and malware flows I've listed some

1969
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,150
of them basically where the certificates

1970
01:41:24,380 --> 01:41:28,580
from malware flows had a mismatch

1971
01:41:26,150 --> 01:41:30,110
between s and I and DNS names they were

1972
01:41:28,580 --> 01:41:32,809
using self-signed certificates were

1973
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:34,730
using expired certificates many of the

1974
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:37,340
malware families were using old cipher

1975
01:41:34,730 --> 01:41:39,500
suits and they had very low diversity of

1976
01:41:37,340 --> 01:41:41,600
pls extensions and there was quite a bit

1977
01:41:39,500 --> 01:41:43,670
of differences between the extinctions

1978
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:46,430
that were used by our two devices versus

1979
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:48,530
what was used by malware and we saw our

1980
01:41:46,430 --> 01:41:51,410
DGA names used by many of the malware

1981
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:54,559
that were properly running on tour or

1982
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:55,790
other communication channels that were

1983
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:57,980
supposed to hide their communication

1984
01:41:55,790 --> 01:41:59,960
patterns and we saw many of the IOT

1985
01:41:57,980 --> 01:42:02,509
devices were not validating the server

1986
01:41:59,960 --> 01:42:06,140
certificates and were easily susceptible

1987
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:09,080
to man-in-the-middle attacks so what we

1988
01:42:06,140 --> 01:42:11,360
identified was that mud as such is very

1989
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:13,640
useful to basically protect various IOT

1990
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:16,339
devices but it was not that useful for

1991
01:42:13,640 --> 01:42:18,140
IOT devices which had very broad

1992
01:42:16,340 --> 01:42:20,180
communication patterns especially those

1993
01:42:18,140 --> 01:42:22,190
I would he devices which put new skill

1994
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:23,690
and that new skill would change the

1995
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:26,120
server and other devices it would

1996
01:42:23,690 --> 01:42:28,639
communicate with and we also saw various

1997
01:42:26,120 --> 01:42:30,440
IOT devices were vulnerable to TLS based

1998
01:42:28,640 --> 01:42:33,200
attacks especially the man-in-the-middle

1999
01:42:30,440 --> 01:42:35,808
attacks so based on that we have been

2000
01:42:33,200 --> 01:42:37,909
profiling various IOT devices in our lab

2001
01:42:35,809 --> 01:42:40,399
from the production and what we had

2002
01:42:37,909 --> 01:42:44,358
identified was that the teal is profiled

2003
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:46,129
for IOT devices based on type of the

2004
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:47,899
device manufacturer and make and model

2005
01:42:46,129 --> 01:42:51,079
is quite different from malware flows

2006
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:53,359
and the Tina's profile did not change

2007
01:42:51,079 --> 01:42:55,969
for many of these most of these devices

2008
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:57,739
even after learning new skills and and

2009
01:42:55,969 --> 01:43:00,530
the clearest profile was fixed set for

2010
01:42:57,739 --> 01:43:03,348
these IOT devices and then we also got

2011
01:43:00,530 --> 01:43:05,449
our TLS profile parameters for thousands

2012
01:43:03,349 --> 01:43:08,389
of malware flows from various malware

2013
01:43:05,449 --> 01:43:10,969
families so based on that we created a

2014
01:43:08,389 --> 01:43:13,909
whitelist of observable DTLS profile

2015
01:43:10,969 --> 01:43:15,889
parameters and this is an extension to

2016
01:43:13,909 --> 01:43:18,499
the murder and it's it's an a model that

2017
01:43:15,889 --> 01:43:20,899
we created I won't go through the young

2018
01:43:18,499 --> 01:43:23,209
model due to lack of time but I will

2019
01:43:20,899 --> 01:43:25,039
just share a few of the data that we

2020
01:43:23,209 --> 01:43:27,019
have we will publish a paper with all

2021
01:43:25,039 --> 01:43:28,909
the data that we have got for various

2022
01:43:27,019 --> 01:43:31,399
types of IOT devices but for example if

2023
01:43:28,909 --> 01:43:32,808
you see here the number of extensions

2024
01:43:31,399 --> 01:43:35,419
offered for my hardware was quite

2025
01:43:32,809 --> 01:43:38,209
different from what echo show had for a

2026
01:43:35,419 --> 01:43:40,398
benign flows we could also see a

2027
01:43:38,209 --> 01:43:43,729
difference in the number of extension

2028
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:46,579
types used by benign and malware flows I

2029
01:43:43,729 --> 01:43:48,019
think the graph has gone bad i right

2030
01:43:46,579 --> 01:43:50,599
sorry for that

2031
01:43:48,019 --> 01:43:52,219
benign flow so using grease values but

2032
01:43:50,599 --> 01:43:55,339
we did not observe any of the malware

2033
01:43:52,219 --> 01:43:56,539
families were using grease values there

2034
01:43:55,339 --> 01:43:58,939
was quite a bit of difference in the

2035
01:43:56,539 --> 01:44:01,550
supported groups that were used sorry

2036
01:43:58,939 --> 01:44:03,800
the graph has gone bad again this was

2037
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:07,039
interesting that there was some malice

2038
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:08,659
which were using a PK base certificates

2039
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,268
but many of the malware for using

2040
01:44:08,659 --> 01:44:12,619
self-signed certificates there was quite

2041
01:44:11,269 --> 01:44:16,550
a bit differences in the signature

2042
01:44:12,619 --> 01:44:18,619
algorithms cypher suits and for google

2043
01:44:16,550 --> 01:44:20,149
home it was quite astonishing that there

2044
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:21,709
was quite a bit of differences in the

2045
01:44:20,149 --> 01:44:24,109
cypher suits that were picked by Google

2046
01:44:21,709 --> 01:44:26,539
home versus what was picked by malware

2047
01:44:24,109 --> 01:44:28,609
flows and the protocol versions was

2048
01:44:26,539 --> 01:44:32,089
quite different that malware was using

2049
01:44:28,609 --> 01:44:35,300
TLS 1.0 whereas we could see Google home

2050
01:44:32,089 --> 01:44:37,429
was using TLS 1.3 and based on this

2051
01:44:35,300 --> 01:44:39,429
observation the conclusion that we could

2052
01:44:37,429 --> 01:44:41,539
at least initially draw is that

2053
01:44:39,429 --> 01:44:44,389
malware's cannot mimic the detail

2054
01:44:41,539 --> 01:44:46,099
asprova files of several hundreds of IOT

2055
01:44:44,389 --> 01:44:48,559
devices and cannot keep up with the

2056
01:44:46,099 --> 01:44:49,579
updates to the Detailers profile so we

2057
01:44:48,559 --> 01:44:51,579
thought it's it's going to

2058
01:44:49,579 --> 01:44:54,259
it's gonna be really useful to have a

2059
01:44:51,579 --> 01:44:56,719
profile for IOT devices that can be used

2060
01:44:54,260 --> 01:45:00,770
to permit intended DTLS behavior and

2061
01:44:56,719 --> 01:45:02,659
block malicious TTS behavior so what we

2062
01:45:00,770 --> 01:45:04,639
are looking for is more feedback from

2063
01:45:02,659 --> 01:45:08,179
the working group and collaboration to

2064
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:09,290
profile IOT devices and if there is

2065
01:45:08,179 --> 01:45:12,040
interest in the working group then

2066
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:15,199
consider for working through production

2067
01:45:12,040 --> 01:45:16,730
Eliot we have like zero time for

2068
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:20,030
comments can you take that to the list

2069
01:45:16,730 --> 01:45:21,650
thank you and we will follow up I would

2070
01:45:20,030 --> 01:45:23,590
like to see more discussion about this

2071
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:26,719
on the list yeah thank you thank you

2072
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:51,770
with that passing over to Warren and

2073
01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:52,790
Ignace so in the interest of time I

2074
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:54,650
think we're going to skip our chair

2075
01:45:52,790 --> 01:46:02,000
slides there's nothing important in them

2076
01:45:54,650 --> 01:46:03,650
is there mr. Benoit yeah I think also

2077
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,409
due to lack of time we're gonna have a

2078
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:08,629
very short ops area open mic at the end

2079
01:46:06,409 --> 01:46:11,000
or maybe not and people just send email

2080
01:46:08,630 --> 01:46:12,770
to the list I would like to make sure if

2081
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:15,500
it was doing jabber ascribing slash

2082
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:22,730
minutes we'll continue to just great

2083
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:24,559
okay all right so I want to present our

2084
01:46:22,730 --> 01:46:27,079
service assurance for in 10 days

2085
01:46:24,559 --> 01:46:29,420
networking so first of all it's an

2086
01:46:27,079 --> 01:46:31,759
architecture but also it's a set of API

2087
01:46:29,420 --> 01:46:34,099
to the yang module it's the first time

2088
01:46:31,760 --> 01:46:35,900
I'm presenting I receive also already

2089
01:46:34,099 --> 01:46:38,360
some feedback that's why there isn't

2090
01:46:35,900 --> 01:46:44,388
like it is our non zero zero version the

2091
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:47,509
drafts all right so what are issues you

2092
01:46:44,389 --> 01:46:49,940
trying to solve first of all facts the

2093
01:46:47,510 --> 01:46:52,340
service being configure doesn't mean it

2094
01:46:49,940 --> 01:46:54,259
works correctly we've been focusing on

2095
01:46:52,340 --> 01:46:56,960
napkins and restaurant and yang that

2096
01:46:54,260 --> 01:46:59,389
parts are to be okay now the second fact

2097
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,760
we have way too much data was telemetry

2098
01:46:59,389 --> 01:47:04,680
data as opposed to information

2099
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:07,440
now what are the issue trying to solve

2100
01:47:04,680 --> 01:47:08,880
is that one our service degrades we

2101
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:12,239
would like to understand what the fault

2102
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:13,890
is what are the symptoms organ better if

2103
01:47:12,239 --> 01:47:16,799
we know it what is the root cause in the

2104
01:47:13,890 --> 01:47:18,600
network now we also want to understand

2105
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:22,200
the reverse if I know a component is

2106
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:23,970
failing like an object for example then

2107
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:27,150
I would like to know which services are

2108
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:28,830
impacted and in the end what we want to

2109
01:47:27,150 --> 01:47:31,049
do is how to solve the closed loop

2110
01:47:28,830 --> 01:47:35,610
because you like to get human out of the

2111
01:47:31,050 --> 01:47:39,060
art of this now the end goal is self

2112
01:47:35,610 --> 01:47:42,920
whatever healing driving in 10 days

2113
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:45,810
networking the thing was intent is that

2114
01:47:42,920 --> 01:47:48,150
yeah this top-down approach declarative

2115
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:52,530
way is a nice concept right we try to be

2116
01:47:48,150 --> 01:47:54,210
super first with ECA now it main it

2117
01:47:52,530 --> 01:47:56,940
works mainly with green field

2118
01:47:54,210 --> 01:48:00,060
deployments right and we have to solve

2119
01:47:56,940 --> 01:48:01,799
it differently so do we want to take

2120
01:48:00,060 --> 01:48:03,900
questions now or at the end knowing that

2121
01:48:01,800 --> 01:48:05,489
work can we take the question at the end

2122
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:10,259
to make sure I go through first light

2123
01:48:05,489 --> 01:48:12,360
thank you them so this architecture is

2124
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:14,820
about service assurance for in 10

2125
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:16,559
basement working we want to decompose a

2126
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:19,110
bigger problem with user sessions into

2127
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:22,170
smaller components and we want to assure

2128
01:48:19,110 --> 01:48:24,420
those smaller components one by one to

2129
01:48:22,170 --> 01:48:26,970
complement them was active probing right

2130
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:28,890
active probing is great end to end but

2131
01:48:26,970 --> 01:48:30,630
it's like a black box of the network yes

2132
01:48:28,890 --> 01:48:33,239
there's nothing happening we want to

2133
01:48:30,630 --> 01:48:36,330
know what's happening crystal box right

2134
01:48:33,239 --> 01:48:38,309
exactly what the issue is now a couple

2135
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:40,050
of cancer that I want to bring here and

2136
01:48:38,310 --> 01:48:42,630
again I will be quick because your

2137
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:44,940
concepts read a draft but we want to

2138
01:48:42,630 --> 01:48:48,060
decompose service instance and I take a

2139
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:50,820
very simple one like a tunnel there into

2140
01:48:48,060 --> 01:48:53,760
sub services instances a tunnel depends

2141
01:48:50,820 --> 01:48:56,250
on what the source or interface destined

2142
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:58,739
external interfaces and then those

2143
01:48:56,250 --> 01:49:01,320
depend on the physical interface that

2144
01:48:58,739 --> 01:49:03,540
depends on the device right I also need

2145
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:05,130
to have IP connectivity that depends a

2146
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:07,920
control plane so if you could assure

2147
01:49:05,130 --> 01:49:10,410
every single part of those sub source

2148
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:14,070
instances in embed link then we would

2149
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:15,990
know what we could infer the score the

2150
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:17,759
house core of the device

2151
01:49:15,990 --> 01:49:20,910
and that's exactly what we want to do

2152
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,430
here and we could have the sentence for

2153
01:49:20,910 --> 01:49:26,130
each of these sub service instance and

2154
01:49:23,430 --> 01:49:29,880
we would be able to know what well first

2155
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:32,130
of all okay no let me take a step back

2156
01:49:29,880 --> 01:49:35,730
here so if I know that my device

2157
01:49:32,130 --> 01:49:38,480
unhealthy I could bubble up the house

2158
01:49:35,730 --> 01:49:41,490
score to the services that are impacted

2159
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:44,099
now there are two ways to do you see

2160
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:46,200
this dependencies right either it is

2161
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:50,280
what I call an impacting dependency if

2162
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:54,840
my interface is down obviously my tunnel

2163
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:58,019
would be broken right if my interface

2164
01:49:54,840 --> 01:50:00,180
with my Turner phase is down

2165
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:02,580
same thing these are impacting

2166
01:50:00,180 --> 01:50:04,590
dependencies but you've got also like

2167
01:50:02,580 --> 01:50:07,260
informal dependency because most of the

2168
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:09,750
time it's more difficult to find a

2169
01:50:07,260 --> 01:50:12,900
symptom that the route goes right if I

2170
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:16,380
put in ecmp there my ecmp is not healthy

2171
01:50:12,900 --> 01:50:19,469
it's unbalanced now I want to receive is

2172
01:50:16,380 --> 01:50:22,410
an information that maybe might my

2173
01:50:19,470 --> 01:50:25,410
services impacted it depends which bus

2174
01:50:22,410 --> 01:50:27,059
I'm taking right maybe so this is the

2175
01:50:25,410 --> 01:50:30,450
distinction between informational and

2176
01:50:27,060 --> 01:50:32,760
impacting dependencies so so far what do

2177
01:50:30,450 --> 01:50:35,490
we know we know that one is service

2178
01:50:32,760 --> 01:50:37,260
degrades we know where the fault is

2179
01:50:35,490 --> 01:50:39,269
because we've got this assurance graph

2180
01:50:37,260 --> 01:50:41,790
we know where it's not because it's

2181
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:45,000
healthy and we know where it is with the

2182
01:50:41,790 --> 01:50:46,710
symptoms or the route goes and we know

2183
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:49,020
the reverse because if we got the three

2184
01:50:46,710 --> 01:50:51,210
in one direction because it's a gigantic

2185
01:50:49,020 --> 01:50:53,580
tree for all services we know which

2186
01:50:51,210 --> 01:50:55,560
services are impacted which is also very

2187
01:50:53,580 --> 01:50:58,070
important for customers I have to solve

2188
01:50:55,560 --> 01:51:04,680
that issue first

2189
01:50:58,070 --> 01:51:06,690
now the architecture we take from the

2190
01:51:04,680 --> 01:51:09,300
service from figuration Orchestrator we

2191
01:51:06,690 --> 01:51:11,519
extract the service type and ideas of

2192
01:51:09,300 --> 01:51:14,700
what we want to configure this is the

2193
01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:16,950
start of the intent of service from

2194
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:21,030
there we go to this Orchestrator there

2195
01:51:16,950 --> 01:51:22,889
that will create a Xuan's 3 and the

2196
01:51:21,030 --> 01:51:24,809
assurance tree goes into what's called

2197
01:51:22,890 --> 01:51:26,820
signage and there that will tell

2198
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:29,879
actually to make sure I get the

2199
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:32,249
interface house I need to go on a device

2200
01:51:29,879 --> 01:51:35,639
for interface get a set of metrics and

2201
01:51:32,249 --> 01:51:36,419
compute the health and that's hella

2202
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:39,300
score

2203
01:51:36,419 --> 01:51:43,019
along with all the symptoms would be

2204
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:45,419
sent through telemetry and this is I

2205
01:51:43,019 --> 01:51:47,399
believe the way to solve the closed loop

2206
01:51:45,419 --> 01:51:49,709
automation because maybe we'll be able

2207
01:51:47,399 --> 01:51:52,919
to tell that interface feeling badly

2208
01:51:49,709 --> 01:51:55,679
that ecmp has got an issue and we could

2209
01:51:52,919 --> 01:51:57,659
either reconfigure or optimize but you

2210
01:51:55,679 --> 01:52:02,189
know exactly what we configure and not

2211
01:51:57,659 --> 01:52:03,449
the entire service now it's a flexible

2212
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:06,059
architecture right

2213
01:52:03,449 --> 01:52:08,308
I could boxes in there I could have this

2214
01:52:06,059 --> 01:52:11,070
config Orchestrator and this assurance

2215
01:52:08,309 --> 01:52:14,789
Orchestrator together same thing like

2216
01:52:11,070 --> 01:52:15,179
this same agents could be outside of the

2217
01:52:14,789 --> 01:52:20,070
box

2218
01:52:15,179 --> 01:52:22,109
the router or in the router itself but

2219
01:52:20,070 --> 01:52:25,259
more importantly this architecture

2220
01:52:22,109 --> 01:52:28,320
should be open why because they're only

2221
01:52:25,260 --> 01:52:30,840
if they are not many operators having a

2222
01:52:28,320 --> 01:52:31,289
single vendor right so if we want this

2223
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:34,649
to work

2224
01:52:31,289 --> 01:52:38,280
it should be open in terms of API how

2225
01:52:34,649 --> 01:52:40,499
for me an API is a young model a young

2226
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:42,780
model that we could have man's so

2227
01:52:40,499 --> 01:52:46,079
whether what is open actually in there

2228
01:52:42,780 --> 01:52:48,509
these are the two arrows over there the

2229
01:52:46,079 --> 01:52:50,308
ability to read and configure this

2230
01:52:48,510 --> 01:52:54,689
assurance tree whenever you got the

2231
01:52:50,309 --> 01:52:56,909
service and the ability to stream the

2232
01:52:54,689 --> 01:53:00,030
health status so the score and the

2233
01:52:56,909 --> 01:53:02,669
symptoms this is what you got in the in

2234
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:05,419
the yang module there what this work is

2235
01:53:02,669 --> 01:53:08,669
not about it's not about solid izing yet

2236
01:53:05,419 --> 01:53:11,369
an Orchestrator too difficult

2237
01:53:08,669 --> 01:53:13,919
it's not about aligning the same agent

2238
01:53:11,369 --> 01:53:16,978
or telling exactly what expression are

2239
01:53:13,919 --> 01:53:19,829
needed to to discover the house core

2240
01:53:16,979 --> 01:53:22,320
vision P right we could do some in the

2241
01:53:19,829 --> 01:53:26,728
ITF like interface etc great but not

2242
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:28,679
everything now typically I put this in a

2243
01:53:26,729 --> 01:53:30,780
purpose in a very small font because

2244
01:53:28,679 --> 01:53:32,309
every single yang tree I see are

2245
01:53:30,780 --> 01:53:34,978
unreadable but this is like a huge

2246
01:53:32,309 --> 01:53:37,559
screen so where she could what is more

2247
01:53:34,979 --> 01:53:40,349
interesting is that I just want to show

2248
01:53:37,559 --> 01:53:42,920
in blue what we could be doing with that

2249
01:53:40,349 --> 01:53:46,870
yang module we

2250
01:53:42,920 --> 01:53:49,610
treat and create the assurance tree

2251
01:53:46,870 --> 01:53:51,620
right remember the tunnel and what it

2252
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:53,929
depends on at this very simple example

2253
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:57,710
we could create it we could augment it

2254
01:53:53,930 --> 01:54:02,510
right the second thing we could do is

2255
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:05,390
read or actually push stream or the

2256
01:54:02,510 --> 01:54:07,790
health score where's the symptoms with

2257
01:54:05,390 --> 01:54:14,690
the Haskell weight telling this symptom

2258
01:54:07,790 --> 01:54:17,480
is pretty important what else we could

2259
01:54:14,690 --> 01:54:19,580
tell what are the parameters of a sip

2260
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:23,299
service if I go to device house a

2261
01:54:19,580 --> 01:54:25,309
typical parameter is the device ID if

2262
01:54:23,300 --> 01:54:30,200
I'm doing the interface health this is

2263
01:54:25,310 --> 01:54:32,330
this interface on that device etc but

2264
01:54:30,200 --> 01:54:35,599
what we could do as well there is that

2265
01:54:32,330 --> 01:54:38,780
we could go command this we could create

2266
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:41,600
more of those sub service you know to

2267
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:44,929
discover the hell's and I even give in

2268
01:54:41,600 --> 01:54:46,940
the document a way to augment it right

2269
01:54:44,930 --> 01:54:50,390
if you've got something specific or

2270
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:53,240
proprietary like a device house for

2271
01:54:50,390 --> 01:54:56,540
example is very specific to a platform

2272
01:54:53,240 --> 01:55:01,070
an OS a vendor so you could have like

2273
01:54:56,540 --> 01:55:04,370
you're your own sub service type so okay

2274
01:55:01,070 --> 01:55:06,860
maybe I was quick on the concept on the

2275
01:55:04,370 --> 01:55:09,620
architecture but this is what I wanted

2276
01:55:06,860 --> 01:55:12,110
to do to to give you the ability to read

2277
01:55:09,620 --> 01:55:14,390
a draft command so is this something

2278
01:55:12,110 --> 01:55:16,849
like a read problem and so far the

2279
01:55:14,390 --> 01:55:19,310
feedback operator is yes and is this

2280
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:24,200
something we should be solving for the

2281
01:55:19,310 --> 01:55:27,230
industry and here so feedback flame

2282
01:55:24,200 --> 01:55:29,870
Tomatoes up to you a little bit of

2283
01:55:27,230 --> 01:55:37,099
everything they are move language yes I

2284
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:39,110
know you so this is a problem to solve

2285
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:41,420
most of the operators today still use

2286
01:55:39,110 --> 01:55:43,190
radius accounting records for the

2287
01:55:41,420 --> 01:55:45,650
service assurance they're saying oh you

2288
01:55:43,190 --> 01:55:48,710
know what service is up if we start

2289
01:55:45,650 --> 01:55:51,559
receiving accounting records looking at

2290
01:55:48,710 --> 01:55:54,110
what they were using they're you know

2291
01:55:51,560 --> 01:55:56,570
essentially what metadata is in there

2292
01:55:54,110 --> 01:55:58,639
that would be a good thing

2293
01:55:56,570 --> 01:56:00,950
to try to model according to that

2294
01:55:58,640 --> 01:56:03,170
because they are different ways you know

2295
01:56:00,950 --> 01:56:08,150
what they're doing there and learning

2296
01:56:03,170 --> 01:56:10,310
some of that would be useful and we will

2297
01:56:08,150 --> 01:56:11,780
know really what they're looking at

2298
01:56:10,310 --> 01:56:16,210
because when you say service assurance

2299
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:19,040
it's a really really wide term number

2300
01:56:16,210 --> 01:56:21,410
two it is and that's why there is

2301
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,940
something Evan mentioned is that even if

2302
01:56:21,410 --> 01:56:25,220
I would like to get yang models for

2303
01:56:22,940 --> 01:56:27,169
everything sometime we don't have that

2304
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:29,060
that's why there is a notion of a metric

2305
01:56:27,170 --> 01:56:30,950
engine where we're getting one time from

2306
01:56:29,060 --> 01:56:34,880
CLI one time formation and P one time

2307
01:56:30,950 --> 01:56:36,800
from yang etc and we have to map it yes

2308
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:39,650
I know but you went there into some

2309
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:42,500
specifics which I'm not 100% sure that

2310
01:56:39,650 --> 01:56:45,110
you know that that's a good way in you

2311
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:46,940
know in the model so maybe doing like a

2312
01:56:45,110 --> 01:56:49,759
pseudo model with a high level not going

2313
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:52,370
down more or more of the informational

2314
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:56,120
model versus a data model would be a

2315
01:56:52,370 --> 01:56:57,950
more useful start this is what I just

2316
01:56:56,120 --> 01:57:00,920
mentioned I'm doing an information model

2317
01:56:57,950 --> 01:57:03,550
of all the metrics to look at yeah so

2318
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:05,960
then with the architecture I have some

2319
01:57:03,550 --> 01:57:07,610
problems because I consider that

2320
01:57:05,960 --> 01:57:11,360
architecture a little bit you

2321
01:57:07,610 --> 01:57:16,309
complicated and this is a separate

2322
01:57:11,360 --> 01:57:18,400
discussion and last would be there is

2323
01:57:16,310 --> 01:57:23,000
difference between autonomic system and

2324
01:57:18,400 --> 01:57:25,670
in intent driven networks these are two

2325
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,300
separate terms and you mangal them up at

2326
01:57:25,670 --> 01:57:33,100
the beginning of your presentation so I

2327
01:57:29,300 --> 01:57:36,080
would like to keep that this this

2328
01:57:33,100 --> 01:57:37,550
distinction clean because you can have

2329
01:57:36,080 --> 01:57:41,000
an intent based network that is not

2330
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:43,030
autonomic okay fair enough

2331
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:45,380
one more thing in your previous point

2332
01:57:43,030 --> 01:57:48,530
something I learned that being an ad is

2333
01:57:45,380 --> 01:57:51,410
that I was beaten by open conflict of

2334
01:57:48,530 --> 01:57:55,070
running code so before doing this here

2335
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:59,240
we spend time a lot of time doing a POC

2336
01:57:55,070 --> 01:58:00,650
and it actually works and just to note

2337
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:01,880
we've only got about four minutes so

2338
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:05,480
we're gonna cut the mic line and also

2339
01:58:01,880 --> 01:58:06,890
please keep calm and short just you just

2340
01:58:05,480 --> 01:58:10,339
kind of explain what they do on daily

2341
01:58:06,890 --> 01:58:13,520
basis so number of observations one

2342
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:16,100
is the intent consumption we still don't

2343
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:18,170
know how to program the system there are

2344
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:20,150
a number of workflows and products but

2345
01:58:18,170 --> 01:58:22,520
they are not industry standards

2346
01:58:20,150 --> 01:58:26,440
everybody does something so it would be

2347
01:58:22,520 --> 01:58:28,940
very utiful to focus on that number two

2348
01:58:26,440 --> 01:58:32,059
expectation generation it's not

2349
01:58:28,940 --> 01:58:34,070
explained in the draft and this is one

2350
01:58:32,060 --> 01:58:36,950
of the most complex thing you need to

2351
01:58:34,070 --> 01:58:39,019
generate expectations with regards to

2352
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:42,349
operational stage as you define the

2353
01:58:39,020 --> 01:58:43,940
service not afterwards I mean nobody

2354
01:58:42,350 --> 01:58:45,890
cares about you know what you care about

2355
01:58:43,940 --> 01:58:47,540
whether service a can reach service B

2356
01:58:45,890 --> 01:58:50,090
and if it's over the tunnel shall be

2357
01:58:47,540 --> 01:58:53,240
budget expectation for it to be up

2358
01:58:50,090 --> 01:58:55,310
should be generated within number three

2359
01:58:53,240 --> 01:58:57,050
here is normalization layer which is one

2360
01:58:55,310 --> 01:58:59,180
of the most complex thing it's really

2361
01:58:57,050 --> 01:59:01,580
what didn't refer to high level

2362
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:03,950
obstructed model I get data over

2363
01:59:01,580 --> 01:59:07,820
streaming telemetry CLI all kind of

2364
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:10,220
api's grid how do you model of the stuff

2365
01:59:07,820 --> 01:59:11,840
in the hereand way I would say those

2366
01:59:10,220 --> 01:59:14,210
three are the most significant problems

2367
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:17,240
and if you could focus on them that

2368
01:59:14,210 --> 01:59:19,130
would be extremely I agree that's why I

2369
01:59:17,240 --> 01:59:24,410
started by opening just the API for now

2370
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:26,960
I two comments at the first comment so

2371
01:59:24,410 --> 01:59:29,930
you I'm not sure I'm understanding you

2372
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:32,600
the riot but I see is clearing more

2373
01:59:29,930 --> 01:59:34,820
layers you the interior you use the you

2374
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:37,430
introduced so I have a little concern

2375
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:40,570
about this walk about the convergence II

2376
01:59:37,430 --> 01:59:43,970
of the young model walk IETF so I think

2377
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:48,139
we already do a lot of layers so I don't

2378
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:50,150
think we try to make more layers so

2379
01:59:48,140 --> 01:59:51,860
these are first concerned the second one

2380
01:59:50,150 --> 01:59:54,019
I think I follow you in the base the

2381
01:59:51,860 --> 01:59:57,019
work in fact for the past three years I

2382
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:59,150
also we also do a lot of work from our

2383
01:59:57,020 --> 02:00:02,030
point of view I think the most that had

2384
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:04,339
injury is not the years a lot of the

2385
02:00:02,030 --> 02:00:06,500
architecture and also this is the model

2386
02:00:04,340 --> 02:00:08,630
I think the most important that you the

2387
02:00:06,500 --> 02:00:11,630
universe attractor definitely you need a

2388
02:00:08,630 --> 02:00:16,630
provider mom you can ISM to collect the

2389
02:00:11,630 --> 02:00:17,990
network estate hers as much as possible

2390
02:00:16,630 --> 02:00:19,990
thank you

2391
02:00:17,990 --> 02:00:22,900
the second point I fully agree with that

2392
02:00:19,990 --> 02:00:27,639
right Eva sorry Cisco

2393
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:29,799
first it is very useful second if you

2394
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:31,510
think about from the perspective of you

2395
02:00:29,800 --> 02:00:34,150
know configuring configuring configuring

2396
02:00:31,510 --> 02:00:36,310
there has not been a concerted effort on

2397
02:00:34,150 --> 02:00:39,179
an industry person on this night you

2398
02:00:36,310 --> 02:00:41,560
have to actually be able to model the

2399
02:00:39,180 --> 02:00:45,100
assurance aspect and create that

2400
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:47,590
hierarchy now things can mean service

2401
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:49,510
assurance such a big enchilada it means

2402
02:00:47,590 --> 02:00:51,580
a lot of things a lot of people might be

2403
02:00:49,510 --> 02:00:53,260
useful to actually contain and define

2404
02:00:51,580 --> 02:00:55,900
what that really means now many of us

2405
02:00:53,260 --> 02:00:57,610
might be thinking about network service

2406
02:00:55,900 --> 02:01:00,580
assurance some might be thinking about

2407
02:00:57,610 --> 02:01:03,849
just security assurance and the list

2408
02:01:00,580 --> 02:01:05,440
would go on now the concept that what I

2409
02:01:03,850 --> 02:01:09,430
gleaned from the slide could equally

2410
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:11,349
apply in any of those cons specific type

2411
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:14,470
of services but I think what's really

2412
02:01:11,350 --> 02:01:18,130
useful is to figure out the hierarchy a

2413
02:01:14,470 --> 02:01:21,250
service depends on ABC a depends on X Y

2414
02:01:18,130 --> 02:01:23,200
Z Z depends on and so on and so forth so

2415
02:01:21,250 --> 02:01:26,160
that hierarchy and modeling that

2416
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:29,110
hierarchy is they are extremely useful

2417
02:01:26,160 --> 02:01:32,410
few things in there you know physical

2418
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:35,410
versus logical awareness would be very

2419
02:01:32,410 --> 02:01:37,780
key to reflect then that's what it

2420
02:01:35,410 --> 02:01:40,059
returns down to us architectural diagram

2421
02:01:37,780 --> 02:01:43,540
is too simplistic we know in reality

2422
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:46,690
that's the utmost complex beast out

2423
02:01:43,540 --> 02:01:49,450
there in production networks we may have

2424
02:01:46,690 --> 02:01:52,059
to find a common ground what is somewhat

2425
02:01:49,450 --> 02:01:54,550
not too complex and not too simplistic

2426
02:01:52,060 --> 02:01:56,260
and reflect that so thank you fully

2427
02:01:54,550 --> 02:01:59,620
understood and that's why the API is

2428
02:01:56,260 --> 02:02:02,410
there to augment those services types to

2429
02:01:59,620 --> 02:02:07,720
not do physical only it's a very basic

2430
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:09,190
example yeah Alex can I have two

2431
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:11,860
comments one thing is I think basically

2432
02:02:09,190 --> 02:02:14,139
I think it's I see two problems actually

2433
02:02:11,860 --> 02:02:15,969
that they are which you might actually

2434
02:02:14,140 --> 02:02:17,950
want to separate one thing is actually

2435
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:19,840
the service assurance itself is the

2436
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:21,790
service monitoring not exactly sure

2437
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,970
where you call it it tend to combine but

2438
02:02:21,790 --> 02:02:26,260
it's really basically service busy

2439
02:02:23,970 --> 02:02:28,180
monitoring there and they showing the

2440
02:02:26,260 --> 02:02:29,650
the service service insurance for the

2441
02:02:28,180 --> 02:02:32,410
service I guess that there's one aspect

2442
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:34,420
the second aspect is the dependency

2443
02:02:32,410 --> 02:02:36,550
graph that you're doing for the model

2444
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:37,780
driven reasoning

2445
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:39,430
there is something that we could almost

2446
02:02:37,780 --> 02:02:41,230
separate out from that because

2447
02:02:39,430 --> 02:02:44,020
model-driven reasoning and basic

2448
02:02:41,230 --> 02:02:46,030
dependency graphs basis one technique to

2449
02:02:44,020 --> 02:02:47,230
address that and you could use this not

2450
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:50,920
just for services but for other

2451
02:02:47,230 --> 02:02:53,379
dependencies in network ecology as well

2452
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:56,920
and that's of course is separate because

2453
02:02:53,380 --> 02:02:58,210
there are other issues of course with

2454
02:02:56,920 --> 02:03:02,970
this even if you are correctly there are

2455
02:02:58,210 --> 02:03:02,970
two separate problems thank you Alex

2456
02:03:10,260 --> 02:03:23,650
thank you the feedback great so we have

2457
02:03:20,170 --> 02:03:25,210
negative two minutes for open mic

2458
02:03:23,650 --> 02:03:27,519
if anybody for anything really pressing

2459
02:03:25,210 --> 02:03:29,830
I guess go to the mic otherwise come and

2460
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,470
child with us directly thank you very

2461

2463
02:03:34,870 --> 02:03:39,099

2464
02:03:37,330 --> 02:03:41,790
