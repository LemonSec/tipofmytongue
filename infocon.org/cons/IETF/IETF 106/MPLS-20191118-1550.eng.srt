00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:17,310
the SFL control draft we had spoken to

93
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:20,020
Stuart last time and he indicated that

94
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,080
he's gathering some input from the

95
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,969
author's or co-authors we would you know

96
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,460
if if you can come up to the mic and

97
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:28,930
give us a quick update there that's also

98
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,949
a good thing

99
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:36,760
Stuart I'm waiting for some input from

100
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:41,340
one of my co-authors they are not very

101
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:44,560
easy to get hold of at the moment okay I

102
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:46,870
guess then we're waiting for more input

103
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,489
from you when you get in touch with the

104
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,860
person as soon as I get hold of them or

105
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:55,960
when I decide it's time doubt I will

106
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,730
pass it to the working group to take the

107
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,590
next steps okay thank you we have a

108
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:07,330

115
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,130
current status is stalled we have

116
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,520
received feedback from the RTG directory

117
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:39,370
and there are comments raised

118
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,949
specifically from Carlos if the authors

119
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:45,730
or the or Carlos is here we encourage

120

them to come up and and share their

121
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,050
inputs we know that there are further

122
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:52,270
discussions that are going to happen

123
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:55,920
face to face as well as on the mailing

124
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:59,980
list they try to come up with the

125
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:04,060
conclusion on this draft how we want to

126
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:07,830
progress it I don't see any authors or

127
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,649
Carlos okay

128
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:14,310
so the second draft or working group

129
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:17,700
document the status its the RMR MPLS

130
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:20,239
based draft it was submitted to iesg for

131
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:25,920
publication we are currently waiting for

132
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:29,850
ad right up and there's no it's not it's

133
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:33,060
not blocked basically the third draft we

134
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:36,480
have LDPR Omar extensions this one is

135
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,939
waiting on the base erimar to be

136
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,459
published and once that happens we will

137
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:49,019
move ahead with requesting publication

138
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:53,099
of this one if you go back the or more

139
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:54,720
one I had we finished last call and they

140
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,350
have to respond to the Directorate

141
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,730
reviews there was a bunch of comments

142
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:05,910
before we can schedule for telogen oh

143
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:08,490
okay yeah double-check that okay and I

144
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:13,589
security is there I thought you they

145
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:16,260
responded but I think it was a security

146
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:18,720
director that had comments they said you

147
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,120
don't have to make a change to this and

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,160
anyway we were locked up so as soon as

149
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,320
well I guess at this point we can make

150
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:31,110
the changes I don't remember anything

151
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:34,110
that was difficult or you know so I I

152
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:38,160
think we're good okay we'll have that in

153
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:42,839
the next week or so your thing okay

154
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:46,730
thank you then for the update okay so

155
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:50,910
moving on we have MPLS mm LDP map

156
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:53,670
document this one has gone a review from

157
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,189
the mid doctor and the comments were

158
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:59,399
addressed but we're waiting for the

159
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:02,310
go-ahead from the the mid doctor we

160
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:04,949
don't have my understanding is is we're

161
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:11,660
trying to get a hold of a mid doctor

162
00:12:04,949 --> 00:12:14,339
there's a replacement in the works but

163
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:16,290
so this one once we have the go-ahead

164
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:18,570
from the mid doctors that all the

165
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:23,240
comments have been addressed we will go

166
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:23,240
ahead and close the working group last

167
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:30,690
the next document we have is MPLS SPL

168
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,580
terminology the status of this one is

169
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,790
it's table ready for working group last

170
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:39,090
call after a minor editorial update of

171
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:40,860
the abstract specifically and the next

172
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,600
steps we will be going ahead with the

173
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,550
working group last call after this

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,940
update the last draft it is it is

175
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:54,300
submitted Tori iesg for publication and

176
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,560
we uploaded a recent revision that

177
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:02,609
addresses all the comments we got and

178
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:03,030
we're waiting on the next steps next one

179
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:10,170
please

180
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:12,300
and LSP ping registries update it is on

181
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:16,620
the agenda so we will be talking more

182
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,260
about it today the MPLS SFL framework

183
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,560
this is the one that I wanted to flag

184
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:26,640
that we triggered a working group last

185
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:29,459
call actually we triggered a a Paul I PR

186
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:33,090
Paul in preparation for a working group

187
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:36,780
last call we did receive two

188
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:38,220
acknowledgments from two authors but the

189
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,040
rest of the authors we haven't received

190
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,080
any response from them so we do

191
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,990
encourage the authors to at least the

192
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:49,530
ones that are present to try to get a

193
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:51,750
hold of the other ones and so that you

194
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:52,230
know we can move ahead with the last

195
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,630
call

196
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,550
could you privately and I mean privately

197
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,210
remind the authors who have responded

198
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:02,670
who they need to go and yeah I did I

199
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:04,800
didn't set resend and mention who

200
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:06,270
responded and not it's already on the

201
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:15,449
list but I'll do that privately sure

202
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:18,030
thank you and the last one it's still

203
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,200
there related to the part of the SFL

204
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:23,939
family drafts it's ready for working

205
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,340
group last call but we want to proceed

206
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:33,540
only after the base SFL document gets

207
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,860
published so the next steps would be to

208
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,130
go ahead with the working group last

209
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:38,370
call

210
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:45,090
after we published the base framework

211
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:48,830
for SF l and that's it I did promise

212
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:51,990
Nick will cover but somehow I kept going

213
00:14:48,830 --> 00:15:17,880
so what's next on the agenda

214
00:14:51,990 --> 00:15:22,620
I think it's SEC one one is up with the

215
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:33,840
path segments NS are MPLS or MPLS

216
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:36,570
interworking good afternoon everyone I'm

217
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:39,150
Tom from City my presentation today's

218
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:41,790
path segments used in s are in MPs

219
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:45,090
interworking this draft has been

220
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:48,540
presented in a stir meeting and we got

221
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:51,810
some feedbacks and comments so thank you

222
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:56,480
very much so this time we updated the

223
00:15:51,810 --> 00:16:08,069
term drafts and made some clarification

224
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:11,940
so let's thank you so let's do some

225
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:15,990
quick recap of their path segments past

226
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:18,480
segment is defined in ITF of spring MPLS

227
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,480
has eggman a draft it has her it has

228
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,560
been proposed and adopted in a spring

229
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:30,330
working group entered a segment phase is

230
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:33,479
an identifier for s our path it can be

231
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:36,110
used to to achieve three function like

232
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,190
the performance measurement

233
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:44,370
bi-directional past correlation and

234
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:48,540
end-to-end pass protection and in this

235
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,300
document at the pass segment we

236
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:54,449
be extended to be used to provide

237
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,300
end-to-end bi-directional service in SR

238
00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:59,430
and MPLS interlocking scenario for

239
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:02,490
example the past segments who may be

240
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:04,859
used at you to do the past correlation

241
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,109
not owning their bidirectional pass

242
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:11,069
correlation but also the inter-domain

243
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:13,319
pass correlation and the past segments

244
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:17,010
may be defined to you and then find an

245
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:23,819
MP asti eternal under the mplt labor

246
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:26,220
list so as the figures show to SR MPs

247
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:29,159
ain't working we stir a path segments

248
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,890
for example we have three domains from

249
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,160
access network aggregation network and

250
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:39,150
call networks respectively and the

251
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:42,030
strain domains maybe or maybe older MPS

252
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:44,669
networks before and then when we used

253
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:49,530
her when we applied the SR architecture

254
00:17:44,669 --> 00:17:53,610
to the network's we may be used and we

255
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:57,629
may be up we may upgrade there s are a

256
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:59,820
technology to deploy desert largely to

257
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:03,210
the access network and the core network

258
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:07,950
and then we must consider their scenario

259
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:10,410
over SR in mpos in trucking under the

260
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:13,110
pass segment as we all know the pass

261
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:17,580
Agana may be used to enter the head end

262
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:22,799
to correlate the bi-directional passes

263
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:28,309
and to achieve their bi-directional past

264
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:32,340
so we lead to concede consider their

265
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:35,250
bi-directional end-to-end service from

266
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:37,980
their access network to Colette works

267
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:41,429
for example from the load one to load

268
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:46,130
nine so there are path segments one two

269
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:49,410
three and are the antenna fires after

270
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:53,669
three domains and there at the head end

271
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:56,630
the path segments can be used to tube to

272
00:18:53,669 --> 00:19:01,559
do the by directional correlation as the

273
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,720
before ester ITF amperes per segment of

274
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:07,200
the draft

275
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:11,190
described her and in this document we

276
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:15,900
define their path segments to do to do

277
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:18,779
the intro to make correlation first we

278
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:22,620
define the path segments to be and and

279
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:25,110
then fire off over there NPR's GE Turner

280
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,678
and then there are path segments one and

281
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:32,639
past document EMBA correlated to dude

282
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:36,600
enter enter poem a stitching and there

283
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:39,480
are the procedure is the same mr.

284
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:43,199
bi-directional correlation so the

285
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:45,840
resentment can can be used that you do

286
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:51,960
to achieve the end-to-end bi-directional

287
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:57,000
VPN so we got comments from last meeting

288
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:59,490
so we made clarification first in SR and

289
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,580
M POS interworking there are two models

290
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:05,279
nasty model and the stage model in the

291
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:08,070
in estimate the less term nasty modo the

292
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:11,370
fungus age and the path segments can be

293
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:14,480
combined to achieve the in enter to May

294
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:18,299
stitching and the past past monitoring

295
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:21,179
durapan estate is can be used to to to

296
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:24,418
the intimated staging and as per segment

297
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:27,480
to do therapist monitoring and in the

298
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:30,840
button nurse TV model the stitching

299
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,480
overpass segments could be used that you

300
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:37,500
achieved poster into domain stitching

301
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,510
and past monitoring the because their SR

302
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:44,760
and MPs domains may be deployed in

303
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,039
incrementally and independently and thus

304
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:50,940
TV modem may be appropriate for this

305
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,429
scenario under a comparison with the

306
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,779
bone in seat as we know the policy could

307
00:20:53,429 --> 00:21:01,130
be bound to a seat list of selected

308
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:04,230
paths for example Durham PST eat earlier

309
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:07,980
under used to choose teach the surface

310
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:10,710
cross much much more domains but alter a

311
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:13,740
Bonnie said mark must be provided and

312
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:15,480
pushed onto the label stack add to the

313
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,850
head head end

314
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,630
and all over there all of them are

315
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:26,219
popped at and a lot of men are popped

316
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:29,429
after the engine or example in in the in

317
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,900
transit to me and the gesture

318
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:36,720
pour pour push pull out the pandan seat

319
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:39,960
which panda chill under domain at the

320
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,830
current domain but not popped out the

321
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:48,059
county seat of the Nestor domain so they

322
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:51,649
said to me must maintain their ponies it

323
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:55,918
of the last domain so we considered this

324
00:21:51,650 --> 00:22:00,419
procedure is not independently so we

325
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:04,250
proposed the there pass teaching all

326
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:08,070
path segments to do the end-to-end

327
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:11,370
soviet bidirectional surface and there

328
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:13,080
the the path segments can be used to

329
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:18,590
achieve the endodermis teaching and

330
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:21,389
repass monitoring so we need more

331
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:24,149
feedbacks and ER to to their further

332
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:36,710
updates so comments and the discussions

333
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:36,710
are very working thank you any questions

334
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:46,470
the next one we have is Rakesh are you

335
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:49,678
asking question or just asking

336
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:53,070
so the path segment draft which is the

337
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,410
spring working of document and I think

338
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,510
the comment was also given I describes

339
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:03,660
the path segments of binding seed base

340
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:05,520
stitching so what is new here compared

341
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:07,679
to that like how is this different I

342
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,650
know it it still just teaching because I

343
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:13,500
know you call it nesting but it's this

344
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,630
allows us to you know go from one end to

345
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,080
other end and it's sewn in figure 3 in

346
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:23,669
that document so I'm not sure what's new

347
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:25,860
here and what is it that this draft

348
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:28,240
trying to do is it like an information

349
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:33,269
or you trying to define the standard or

350
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:36,549
not clear to me yeah my draft at their

351
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:40,619
creation is that we defined their past

352
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:44,139
agna to identify an MP else a te Turla

353
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:48,509
second we used up a segment to do their

354
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:51,070
intimate stitching not the bunion seat

355
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:54,220
we think they're bunnies it is not

356
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:58,350
appropriate for the stitching model so

357
00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:02,110
I'm next in key so yeah I have a

358
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:03,850
follow-up question to Rakesh yeah well I

359
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,189
actually I think it would be a good idea

360
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,769
if you took the author groups on both of

361
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,649
these documents sometimes you're in this

362
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:14,049
week's sat down and try to sort out how

363
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:17,199
many documents do we actually need can

364
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:19,570
be merge in one should we do - and what

365
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,519
should you in each document and did that

366
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:26,259
offline and report it back to the

367
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:31,090
mailing list and I think that trackage

368
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:35,850
has the you're the stock key here you

369
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:35,850
need to make it happen okay yeah thanks

370
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:46,090
so I think the solution there is a

371
00:24:43,179 --> 00:24:49,360
another different appoint from the

372
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:54,789
biting is that it can support a high

373
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:59,049
direction stitching solution in the I

374
00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:02,289
think it it's a very useful for some

375
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:07,480
operator who have a deployed the past

376
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:09,970
segment with that we it can can be

377
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:16,960
convenient for them to get in the to

378
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:18,549
enter monitoring thank you yeah we'll

379
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,879
talk more during the week but the

380
00:25:18,549 --> 00:25:24,610
binding seed itself would contain the

381
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:26,709
label stack as well as the path segment

382
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:28,418
right so the stitching really happens

383
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:30,610
between path segments and bindings it

384
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:36,009
not the path segment here and path

385
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:38,559
segments there kind of thing so I be

386
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:40,749
I've tried to discuss with one already

387
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,870
but we are not able to come to an

388
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,240
agreement on the

389
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:45,709
fact that when you define path segments

390
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,500
and it has a particular use for

391
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:51,049
identification only can we start using

392
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:53,029
the same path segments now stitching

393
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:55,220
that's the crux of the argument they

394
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:56,480
their thing is we already have the path

395
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,700
segment we want to add more

396
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,500
functionality to it and on the other

397
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,450
hand we said that's not how it was

398
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,580
envisioned it had a particular meaning

399
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,080
and if you are changing the meaning of

400
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,639
the path segment let's go through the

401
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,020
process and discuss it a little bit more

402
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:13,100
I think that's where we are right now

403
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:14,960
thank you yes we use the path segments

404
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,709
to do the stitching but the stitching

405
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,610
not they're the same meaning waster the

406
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:24,590
stitching before we use their paths

407
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:27,918
correlation to do this to do the stitch

408
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,809
like the bidirectional correlation so I

409
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,830
think their procedure is the same ways

410
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:43,820
to bi-directional we also both do their

411
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:45,500
correlation the difference basically is

412
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,418
that in case of bi-directional there is

413
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,429
no forwarding thing happening here when

414
00:26:47,419 --> 00:26:51,770
I received the spot segment on one

415
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:54,350
inter-domain again I need to forward it

416
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,059
on on to the next segment so it's

417
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,070
leaving into the same action that a

418
00:26:56,059 --> 00:27:00,230
binding segment already does when I

419
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:03,620
receive the binding segment my job is to

420
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,240
decide what I need to do next and we are

421
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,340
saying that I want to use the path

422
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:09,740
segment to do what binding segment

423
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:17,149
already does that's where the confusion

424
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:19,789
is so in terms of y direction all paths

425
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:21,610
this drop doesn't add anything new then

426
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:31,760
what's already there in the path segment

427
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:34,129
draft okay thank you we will do the

428
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:37,090
discussion of nine for further

429
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,090
discussion thank you

430
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:05,980
yeah good afternoon everyone my name is

431
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:10,180
Lucas Gandhian presenting the p.m. for

432
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:15,940
SR MPLS Taft on behalf of the authors

433
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:18,670
and contributors so uh this look this is

434
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:20,350
a 0-0 draft but this was just

435
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:25,300
transferred from the spring working

436
00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:27,280
group to the MPLS working group so the

437
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,639
agenda will look at the requirements and

438
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:34,090
scope the history of the draft the

439
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:36,820
updates that's made since last this was

440
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:41,649
presented in spring some summary and the

441
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:44,560
next steps so this is for the delay and

442
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:47,920
loss measurements for SR links and

443
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:51,490
end-to-end policies advertising the

444
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,710
metrics in the network various

445
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:57,490
measurement modes one way to way in the

446
00:28:53,710 --> 00:29:03,340
back the scope is SR with MPLS data

447
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:07,230
plane using RFC 66 74 as well as 7876

448
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:11,110
for the UDP return path for the response

449
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:17,620
so a draft is about a year and half old

450
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:21,040
it was a spring draft it was it has been

451
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:26,199
presented in spring as well as I ppm

452
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:30,940
working group and recently moved to MPLS

453
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,600
with a new name is mentioned so since it

454
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:38,170
was presented last time we have I did

455
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:40,540
return party LV block number TLV it's a

456
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:43,720
standards track because there is an iron

457
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:46,750
accents loopback mode is defined and

458
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,060
added some details on p2 MPs our policy

459
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:53,200
as well as a CMP and some various

460
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:55,480
editorial changes so just a summary

461
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,320
since this is being presented first time

462
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:02,340
in this work

463
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:05,049
in group so using the the 60 374

464
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,408
mechanisms gal gas as well as the

465
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:12,279
message formats the delay and loss is

466
00:30:08,409 --> 00:30:14,950
measure for asar links the measure

467
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:21,899
metrics are advertised in the network

468
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:25,299
there are RFC's 74 31 or 78 10 or 85714

469
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:28,120
s our policy the probes are said using

470
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:30,429
the label stack the path segment idea we

471
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,709
were just discussing is is just about

472
00:30:30,429 --> 00:30:37,269
the gal the one way measurement mode

473
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:41,500
where the reply is sent out of band

474
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:43,690
using the existing 7876 mechanisms for

475
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:47,049
two-way measurement mode this job

476
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:50,110
defines a return path TLV for look-back

477
00:30:47,049 --> 00:30:52,570
measurement mode the return path label

478
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:57,399
stack is added in the header of the

479
00:30:52,570 --> 00:31:02,559
packet so the new return party lv4 to a

480
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:05,918
measurement defines a few types so we

481
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,460
had a sill feedback to align this the

482
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,070
TLB with the BFD kind of structure so we

483
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,259
have done that so there is one one

484
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:20,529
written part TLV and it contains the sub

485
00:31:14,259 --> 00:31:23,500
t elvis and it defines either asada MPLS

486
00:31:20,529 --> 00:31:25,720
label stack or binding succeed or in

487
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:30,970
case of bundle you want to send a reply

488
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:33,610
back on the same incoming interface for

489
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:36,929
loss measurement it defines a block

490
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:39,850
number TLV so although we use the

491
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:43,000
synonymous flow label for coloring the

492
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:46,418
traffic when we send the probes we use

493
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:52,389
this TLV to identify the counter is for

494
00:31:46,419 --> 00:31:57,669
which block number replication seed is

495
00:31:52,389 --> 00:32:00,029
use can be used for p2 MPs our policy so

496
00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:04,539
we welcome your comments and suggestion

497
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:07,750
the RFC 6334 has been implemented and

498
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,580
deployed in many networks it's been

499
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,950
around for a while

500
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:13,689
we do believe that this draft is ready

501
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:16,810
for working group adoption in MPLS

502
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:20,290
working group the IANA core points

503
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:22,120
allocated by MPLS working group we've

504
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:25,030
been asked to keep spring working group

505
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,520
in the loop for SR aspects so we'll

506
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:30,190
update the spring mailing list when we

507
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:32,590
update the drafts and about the

508
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,300
milestones this is the message from

509
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:36,870
Bruno that please keep spring in the

510
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:41,350
loop for their spring specific content

511
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:44,879
so that's all I had for this one Greg

512
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:57,780
yes Greg Mirsky city can you roll back

513
00:32:44,880 --> 00:33:01,390
to return path TLV yes so how this

514
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:08,590
proposed return path TLV is different

515
00:33:01,390 --> 00:33:12,850
from non FAC till V proposed in B of D

516
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:16,590
for spring because it proposes to use a

517
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:20,590
segment list explicitly for return path

518
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:24,730
for the BFD session yeah so these are

519
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:28,300
the probe messages crafted probe

520
00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:30,820
messages injected by query R and this

521
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:33,940
TLV is added in the payload and when

522
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:36,429
this one disease is it has a choice so

523
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:39,660
without this TLV it would send a reply

524
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:42,220
out of bed IP UDP part using RFC so

525
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:43,930
distant otherwise it would send using

526
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:47,260
this yeah I understand mechanics I'm

527
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:51,460
asking how this is different from what's

528
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:53,290
proposed in BFD draft for spring yes

529
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:58,780
there are many return party Elvis

530
00:33:53,290 --> 00:34:01,870
proposed for LSP paying or the BFD

531
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:03,639
so the intent is the same there is and

532
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:09,069
wise in this draft is because we need

533
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:16,149
the IANA code points for the 6334 tier

534
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:18,640
TLV right but it's already being

535
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:23,139
proposed so why not reference it and

536
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,509
just use one construct for a FD and for

537
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,279
perform

538
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,800
measurement so it's the same construct

539
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,050
and I think you give a feedback and the

540
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,780
structure of this theory is the same as

541
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:34,639
the BFD

542
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:37,880
thanks for your feedback the reason why

543
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,750
is here is that we need to get all of

544
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:46,639
this quote points listed in the 6334

545
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:51,800
types a location from from one of these

546
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:55,610
registries you can't have a private

547
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:57,980
discussion okay okay I was just

548
00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,740
reinforcing what was said from the front

549
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:04,070
that the only way to get a registry in

550
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:06,740
entry in the I honor code points is to

551
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:09,230
specify that you need it so they've

552
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:11,089
chosen to do that rather than virus an

553
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:13,130
indirect route some other how but they

554
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:17,620
do need to say please can we have an

555
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:17,620
allocation for this T or the identifier

556
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:31,280
yeah can we go to the next slide please

557
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:33,680
so you said that this block number T V

558
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,450
is for alternate marking method with the

559
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,310
synonymous for labels yeah I mean the

560
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:42,799
coloring of the traffic can be done by

561
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:45,560
in any means which is beyond the scope

562
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,700
of this draft the draft is for the probe

563
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:51,680
messages and it carries counters and it

564
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:54,049
needs to identify the context of the

565
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,750
counter to say which block number it

566
00:35:54,050 --> 00:36:01,790
belongs to so that's what this TLB is

567
00:35:56,750 --> 00:36:06,950
for okay so so this is not for alternate

568
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:08,900
marking method so alternate marking

569
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,270
method Vedic basically says you need to

570
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,340
color the traffic right so so the

571
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,770
coloring of traffic is done either with

572
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,560
synonymous labels or some other

573
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:20,900
mechanisms outside the scope of this

574
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:24,140
drug but all dot is defining the probe

575
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:26,620
messages for counters for the loss loss

576
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:29,089
measurement so you need to say the

577
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:32,120
contexts say this counter is for this

578
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:34,640
color or this block number so you can

579
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,160
correlate but okay it's controlling a

580
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,710
Greg well I think

581
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,240
yours and Rakesh discussion now is

582
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:43,519
nearing the point where you actually

583
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,439
need to take it to the mailing list okay

584
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:50,089
so you need to do that okay

585
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:55,460
we cut excutive in line okay so we cut

586
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:58,910
the line off direct Sam Waldron a couple

587
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,680
of quick questions in this case are you

588
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,868
proposing the I haven't at the draft

589
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,210
completely so I don't know exactly what

590
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:07,130
the content is but the curious to know

591
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:08,960
are you proposing some extension to

592
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,839
existing mechanism like Alice pooping or

593
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,460
something because I want to know for

594
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:16,940
example everything is working it's fine

595
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:18,619
but if they LSP breakage or whatever

596
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:22,970
right how do you know you are actually

597
00:37:18,619 --> 00:37:24,920
getting response from the right node how

598
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:29,480
do I know the response from the right

599
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:33,829
node so the RFC sixty seventy four does

600
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,890
have a source address TLV and seward is

601
00:37:33,829 --> 00:37:39,349
nodding his head so that basically tells

602
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,910
you who is sending you the message so

603
00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:42,920
you can check I mean like for example

604
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,399
let's take you have LSP breakage and it

605
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,680
pops a packet right so are you

606
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,299
discovering that okay this packet is not

607
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,788
distinct for this so I'm not going to

608
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:55,640
process and respond but if it is punted

609
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:56,990
right you lose the context of where the

610
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,848
packet has come from and who's the

611
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:01,939
destination is and in that case you

612
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:05,390
respond back and so you don't know

613
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:07,220
exactly who who is responding from the

614
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:11,629
source yeah so let's say if you have

615
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:13,819
node ABC is it's supposed to be pointed

616
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:16,130
at C but it's pointed on me we will

617
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:19,308
reply back to a you'll put the source

618
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:21,650
address as B so a it comes to a looks at

619
00:38:19,309 --> 00:38:25,779
the session ID and says why is be

620
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:25,779
replying and not C so something is wrong

621
00:38:27,279 --> 00:38:32,029
so you're purely basing on the source

622
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,930
address of the response yeah so it's

623
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:43,849
already in the RFC 64 TL V is defined

624
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:45,710
for this purpose I see okay thanks dark

625
00:38:43,849 --> 00:38:48,230
I have a question Rakesh I asked it on

626
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:50,529
the list about the delay measurement for

627
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:50,529
end-to-end

628
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:56,850
quickly when you have easy NP so you end

629
00:38:54,690 --> 00:39:00,990
up your probes or whatever way you're

630
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:04,549
testing the delay they end up has been

631
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:07,290
hashed on any of the ecmp paths yeah

632
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,210
you don't necessarily exercise all the

633
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:13,380
paths but your response was you you need

634
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:15,900
entropy label and I want to make sure

635
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,510
that you're stating that entropy label

636
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:23,940
is a must in this case you cannot do

637
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:26,130
hashing on any other field you have to

638
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:27,810
have entropy label for your delay

639
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:30,890
measurements to work if that's the case

640
00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:33,480
why don't you mention it in the draft so

641
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,879
so it is there in the draft there is a

642
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,320
section I forgot to include this in the

643
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:44,730
slide but the entropy label is there in

644
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,880
the draft for ecmp handling this is MPLS

645
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,980
so there is no IP header here so housing

646
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,170
has passing either is done using label

647
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:53,640
stack or entropy label there is not

648
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:58,560
nothing else that you can use for

649
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,629
testing hashing on any other field so 63

650
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,240
74 is I remember talked quite a lot

651
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,330
about this issue was newer to have

652
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:07,799
closer to the mark sorry I think C&C 374

653
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,670
talks about this quite a lot for as I

654
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,470
remember

655
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:13,080
certainly synonymous labels talks about

656
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:14,970
this quite a lot so I think the the

657
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,470
normative references will give you a

658
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:18,209
pretty strong hint although there's no

659
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:20,520
harm in reinforcing it with a sentence

660
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:24,570
or two here yeah it is there in the

661
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,520
draft okay thank you okay

662
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:33,060
I mean I see one next presentation

663
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:37,770
please so a second draft for SRM pls

664
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:40,170
this is the IOM draft so presenting the

665
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:46,440
drafts on behalf of the authors and

666
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:48,210
contributors many thanks to them the

667
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:50,850
agenda requirements and scope the

668
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:56,180
history of the draft updates made since

669
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:59,850
last ITF this was presented in Montreal

670
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:03,029
some summary and the next steps so this

671
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:04,290
is to transform transport the IOM data

672
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,070
fields with

673
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:11,660
pls and cap so the III ppm working group

674
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:15,390
has done quite a bit of work for IO am

675
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:17,700
defining various data fields there are

676
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:21,779
many drafts are some of them listed here

677
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,710
but they will be you know more drafts

678
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,690
and more progression of the technology

679
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:31,460
but here all we doing is defining the

680
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:35,100
end cap and D cap procedure for SRA pls

681
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:40,410
we cover the s to s as well as a hop by

682
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:44,400
hop so the history of the draft is about

683
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:47,670
a year old it was originally

684
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,650
discussing.i ppm working group then was

685
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,830
asked to take it to the spring working

686
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:56,880
group so it this was presented in spring

687
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,779
as well as in MPLS working groups and we

688
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,990
have a home now

689
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,620
so this draft will be a progressed in

690
00:42:00,990 --> 00:42:03,620
this working group

691
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:12,210
so since Montreal we have addressed

692
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:15,390
several comments so one comment was

693
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:18,510
about incorrect IP header based hashing

694
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:21,240
so we have added flow label based

695
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:24,980
mechanisms there is an example added

696
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,950
with past segment ID various editorial

697
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:30,840
changes as well we do have an open item

698
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:36,569
to add procedure for hop-by-hop

699
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:40,440
IOM so just to recap there is an

700
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:43,920
indicator label added on the MPLS header

701
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:47,060
and just below this is the IOM data

702
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,910
field so I ppm working group has

703
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:54,330
extensive procedures for IO am so what

704
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:57,720
this job doesn't really talk about how

705
00:42:54,330 --> 00:43:05,460
to process the IO am various trace

706
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:08,430
points and in order to not break the IP

707
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,710
header base hashing there is a second

708
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:13,859
format defined using a different

709
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:18,180
indicator label and right after that the

710
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:22,680
first four neighbors are zero so that

711
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:24,720
ipv4 ipv6 hashing is not broken and we

712
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,999
took advantage of the space to put the

713
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:32,430
float labeled that as well so basic

714
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:35,399
procedure is that encap node inserts the

715
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:40,499
indicator label and iom data fields and

716
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:44,460
the d cap node pops it and text takes a

717
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:51,230
local timestamp and gives the the iom

718
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:55,859
data to for further processing so

719
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:58,769
indicator label allocation methods there

720
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:01,680
is there are two TB a one and T be a two

721
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:05,038
labels can be allocated from the

722
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:07,499
extended special-purpose labels it can

723
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:12,029
be allocated by a controller as well or

724
00:44:07,499 --> 00:44:16,230
can be allocated by signaling by the D

725
00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:19,319
cap node similarly for hop-by-hop

726
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:21,329
it's a different indicator label is used

727
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,089
to indicate the transit know so this is

728
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:26,400
hop-by-hop although I do agree that it's

729
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:31,288
difficult to implement with current

730
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:35,160
hardware and similarly one for the to

731
00:44:31,289 --> 00:44:38,339
not break the IP hashing so next steps

732
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:41,970
we we have some more work to do for

733
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:44,009
hop-by-hop or p2 FP and whatnot but

734
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:46,890
meantime we welcome your comments and

735
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:48,980
suggestions we would say MPLS working

736
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:51,660
group is the home for this draft now

737
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:55,769
we'll keep a spring working group in the

738
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:57,779
loop for the SR aspects and the often

739
00:44:55,769 --> 00:45:00,299
this comes up in IPP a working group as

740
00:44:57,779 --> 00:45:06,470
well so we will keep that working group

741
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:13,200
in the loop as well that's all I had

742
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:17,038
Adrian hello I'm Adrienne if I read this

743
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:21,049
right you're asking for four new labels

744
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:24,380
and that worries me we've only got eight

745
00:45:21,049 --> 00:45:24,380
currently free

746
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:34,480
we have yeah so an option here and is it

747
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:36,170
extended yeah it's extended yeah oh

748
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,880
sorry

749
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:40,100
I will change my question could you

750
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:41,840
consider redrawing the pictures to show

751
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:50,290
that these are extended special-purpose

752
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:50,290
labels yeah yeah we'll do that Thanks

753
00:45:54,430 --> 00:46:30,009
thank you thank you so thank you and

754
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:36,230
good afternoon and I think it this

755
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:41,119
chapter we have a presentation it two

756
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:44,840
times and before this meeting we have

757
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:51,410
already received some comments and we

758
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:58,850
also accept Azusa comments and the will

759
00:46:51,410 --> 00:47:03,440
update the draft next next time and I

760
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:06,830
still hope to present the draft here and

761
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:11,540
the zoom we will give some our next

762
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:14,960
static line why we want to present this

763
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:18,440
droplet because we have a deployed in

764
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:23,960
our network it works really fun it can't

765
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:29,350
give you some experience share so the

766
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:33,680
requirement it's for the large network

767
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:36,710
especially when we deploy our piece the

768
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,040
functions it's really important for us

769
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:43,780
to monitor and

770
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:46,420
to end network performance at the this

771
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:49,960
morning as that happened I give an

772
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:53,560
example that has one biggest city

773
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:57,400
Beijing we need to deploy even more than

774
00:47:53,560 --> 00:48:03,910
30 key nodes and it's really hard for us

775
00:47:57,400 --> 00:48:08,710
to manage that so we need the curator in

776
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:11,680
Banda Om to help us to manage the whole

777
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:16,570
network so the requirement here is that

778
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:21,029
we want the OEM is in band you know we

779
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:23,770
want 8k money to the hop-by-hop

780
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:27,780
performance and end-to-end the

781
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:32,080
performance we hope it can use a unified

782
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:36,910
solution to do the post VP in monitoring

783
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:43,240
and tunnel monitoring and we also wanted

784
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:46,359
the esteem controller can support such

785
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:51,069
as a telemetry something like that to

786
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:54,400
improve the efficiency and the the

787
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:58,450
intention of the draft we defined the

788
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:02,170
the encapsulation for MPI's performance

789
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:06,970
measurement with alternate marking

790
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:09,940
method and the outer need marking master

791
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:13,330
to require one can't beat over the data

792
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:16,950
packet to measure the packet loss of the

793
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:20,400
data traffic the traffic flow and

794
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:23,410
require one more comes damper bit of

795
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:29,320
data packet to measure the delay and

796
00:49:23,410 --> 00:49:33,490
jitter and the the basic encapsulation

797
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:37,360
like this figure III know there are a

798
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:42,250
lot of them big concern here such as we

799
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:47,500
touched the Liebherr here we redefined

800
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:51,100
as a TC bit but here I want to see that

801
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:52,220
based on our experience this solution is

802
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:56,328
really easy

803
00:49:52,220 --> 00:50:00,410
to be implemented in the existing

804
00:49:56,329 --> 00:50:04,400
network because it it's a if you can

805
00:50:00,410 --> 00:50:07,250
support an multiple layer labor and you

806
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,180
can support this definition because the

807
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:14,470
TC beats can easily be redefined within

808
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:19,180
this environment but of course may be

809
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:24,140
standard from under standard point view

810
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:28,149
it break some rules but it's very easy

811
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:31,730
to implement and it's very effective to

812
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:37,220
monitor the performance it's a high

813
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:41,560
efficiency and here is our deployment

814
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:44,290
scenario and the left one is our

815
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:48,500
end-to-end

816
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:52,130
stitched as our panel we may have a

817
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:54,980
different domains within one work when

818
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:58,849
that work and we can use this solution

819
00:50:54,980 --> 00:51:01,420
to stitched the Asano's and on the

820
00:50:58,849 --> 00:51:01,420
second one

821
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:11,460
it can provide the end-to-end between

822
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:15,620
service performance monitoring and this

823
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:19,380
is a basic use case in our network and

824
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:23,390
in Beijing and Shanghai to speak city we

825
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:30,600
have a deployment the ice artist network

826
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:33,740
to carry 5g base station and we use this

827
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:36,650
solution to monitor the end-to-end

828
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:40,890
performance it provides a really good

829
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:44,190
result and our maintenance team give a

830
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:47,490
really good feedback and it's very easy

831
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:52,620
to implement it our vendors also give a

832
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:56,959
really good feedback because it did for

833
00:51:52,620 --> 00:52:01,520
them the workload a is very low but the

834
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:04,710
performance really good and a next step

835
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:10,680
we received some concerns as the first

836
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:14,700
one is a special-purpose labor is unable

837
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:21,000
to assigned so maybe the solution is

838
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:25,080
that we will hope to get some something

839
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:29,490
like the last presentation we use the

840
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:32,130
extended special-purpose labor and the

841
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:35,370
second concern is that the trafficker

842
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:40,830
class and the ttio of NPR's labor can't

843
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:45,660
be changed we will not touch it

844
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:50,940
in next version and this other one we

845
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:56,040
cut some comments from email it seems as

846
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:58,500
if our solution can be used to wrestle

847
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,779
the unfairness of performance

848
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,640
requirements but here we compare that

849
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,410
and we found that the current version of

850
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:12,089
SF our draft cannot meet our requirement

851
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:15,589
including hop-by-hop performance and the

852
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:20,719
performance our RSP and

853
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:24,249
in parallel so we will update our draft

854
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:26,150
to follow the standard but we will keep

855
00:53:24,249 --> 00:53:28,848
the solution

856
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:35,390
yeah we'll network it's a not so good

857
00:53:28,849 --> 00:53:38,779
but the word maybe works like that

858
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:42,499
that's all Thank You Stuart

859
00:53:38,779 --> 00:53:44,689
a few comments some of which you sort of

860
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:49,160
address but I'm going to touch on I'll

861
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:50,959
touch on them anyway so first as I

862
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:56,529
understand it if you in order to do

863
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:58,879
you're in network along the LSP

864
00:53:56,529 --> 00:54:01,609
instrumentation you're expecting the

865
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:04,519
packet parser to look at to pack two

866
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:06,828
labels in the packet the top label

867
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:10,189
another this is a topic that we

868
00:54:06,829 --> 00:54:13,519
discussed extensively during the time

869
00:54:10,189 --> 00:54:17,598
when we were looking at the T MPLS OAM

870
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:19,879
design and the opinion of this working

871
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:22,279
group was that that did not conform to

872
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:24,679
the MPLS architecture and was not

873
00:54:22,279 --> 00:54:27,410
something that we could support being

874
00:54:24,679 --> 00:54:29,329
deployed it has particular difficulties

875
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:31,428
in building parsers because you've got

876
00:54:29,329 --> 00:54:35,630
to get your address recognition engine

877
00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:37,609
to go and look up two labels we we have

878
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:39,559
rejected that solution in the past at

879
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:45,049
yeah yeah that would be a major major

880
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:48,019
change in a major major turnaround you

881
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:51,799
want to use domain wide labels all right

882
00:54:48,019 --> 00:54:53,839
so you specify that the same label has

883
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:57,380
to be recognized by any node along the

884
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:59,689
path now this is an area that the

885
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:02,599
segment routing people explored in depth

886
00:54:59,689 --> 00:55:05,629
and they discovered that actually it was

887
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:07,939
impossible because all the different

888
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:09,589
platforms have a different range of

889
00:55:07,939 --> 00:55:11,689
labels that they allocate from their

890
00:55:09,589 --> 00:55:14,449
platform space that is why they have the

891
00:55:11,689 --> 00:55:17,828
complexity of the segment routing global

892
00:55:14,449 --> 00:55:20,390
label base so how can we possibly

893
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:22,759
standardize something here that another

894
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:26,118
working group is explored in detail and

895
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:28,079
decided is impossible to do implement on

896
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:30,599
the deployed equipped

897
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,400
bass in fact it's a it's a violation of

898
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:35,430
the MPLS architecture because the MPLS

899
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,619
architecture makes no comment of where

900
00:55:35,430 --> 00:55:40,049
the label bases are and whether you

901
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:41,579
should expect the same labels to be in

902
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:45,690
any other router that's why they do

903
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:48,959
swapping for example here the

904
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:51,390
redefinition of the TTL I believe is a

905
00:55:48,959 --> 00:55:53,700
major architectural change and the

906
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:56,819
particular definition that you use for

907
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:58,859
it when you set it for zero I believe is

908
00:55:56,819 --> 00:56:01,680
essentially an undefined operation in

909
00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:04,170
MPLS you see you were allowed to

910
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,609
pipeline operations when you have to

911
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:09,809
deal with multiple labels and the second

912
00:56:07,609 --> 00:56:11,519
stage of the pipeline is perfectly

913
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:15,180
entitled to reject the packet at that

914
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:17,758
point so you cannot a redefine the TTL

915
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:20,339
and that was a cause of major discussion

916
00:56:17,759 --> 00:56:26,279
between the ITU in the IETF in a

917
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:28,259
previous design of an MPLS OEM I have no

918
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:31,229
idea what the consequences of your

919
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:34,739
redefinition of the TC bits would be but

920
00:56:31,229 --> 00:56:37,038
I would point out to you the the the ecn

921
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:39,630
people have an interest in this as well

922
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,910
because there's a congestion

923
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:44,339
notification architecture based on the

924
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:46,769
use of one of these consists of Al use

925
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:48,328
in the network but I have no idea what

926
00:56:46,769 --> 00:56:50,399
is going to happen and indeed if I look

927
00:56:48,329 --> 00:56:52,529
at the direction the deterministic

928
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,979
networking is going then

929
00:56:52,529 --> 00:57:01,529
they may well wish to classify the TC as

930
00:56:55,979 --> 00:57:02,910
part of classifying the packet we've

931
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:06,329
already covered the fact that you need

932
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:08,430
to use a an ESP L because it seems

933
00:57:06,329 --> 00:57:10,199
inappropriate at least at this stage to

934
00:57:08,430 --> 00:57:11,640
take one of our precious tiny number of

935
00:57:10,199 --> 00:57:14,039
labels which everyone wants and

936
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:15,989
dedicated to this until until whatever

937
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:18,920
this is a proven technology so I think

938
00:57:15,989 --> 00:57:21,539
you're gonna have to go on ESP LS and

939
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:24,089
finally you've not made no comment about

940
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:26,670
security and privacy indeed you've

941
00:57:24,089 --> 00:57:28,828
dismissed that and yet you've got a flow

942
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:31,170
identification label in here which I

943
00:57:28,829 --> 00:57:34,190
know the security area is going to be

944
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:36,119
all over the top of and you need to

945
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:38,549
explain how you're going to deal with

946
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,810
their security and privacy issues yeah

947
00:57:38,549 --> 00:57:43,020
yeah

948
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:45,840
thank you very much and I think the most

949
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:55,550
comments from you is really valuable for

950
00:57:45,840 --> 00:58:01,500
us and to to keep the solution follow

951
00:57:55,550 --> 00:58:06,270
the principle of NP RS III I think we

952
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:09,900
totally agree that and here I just given

953
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:13,380
some feedback about this labor and yes

954
00:58:09,900 --> 00:58:14,670
currently the this maybe we can keep as

955
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:19,400
a TDI oh no problem

956
00:58:14,670 --> 00:58:22,410
and here the flow ID I think if it can

957
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:27,390
labor some flu no problem

958
00:58:22,410 --> 00:58:31,200
it's a within the Empire's architecture

959
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:37,080
and we have some consensus we also rise

960
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:42,540
to some concerns that here we reused the

961
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:44,940
traffic class to indicate the lost

962
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,720
measurement at column marking and the TB

963
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:51,030
measurement at column aking from my

964
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:55,529
point of view there is no clear

965
00:58:51,030 --> 00:58:58,560
definition of the traffic class and the

966
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:04,050
traffic class can be used by operator to

967
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:08,900
indicate what traffic is there and we

968
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:13,050
can use the definition but themselves

969
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:16,650
use of the traffic class bits to

970
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:23,460
indicate that he is a color for the

971
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:26,990
traffic so maybe this solution this

972
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:29,670
labor can be within the umpires

973
00:59:26,990 --> 00:59:33,209
architecture and the problem is this

974
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:36,150
labor if we change this labor to the

975
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:40,020
extended labor

976
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:43,590
maybe the whole solution can be under

977
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:46,890
the amperes architecture so yeah we will

978
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:48,720
we are running quite late so oh sorry I

979
00:59:46,890 --> 00:59:50,310
would I think there are plenty of

980
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,810
comments so I would like to move the

981
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:56,130
discussion to the mailing list

982
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:59,320
to address all the comments yeah okay

983
00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:02,950
thank you okay

984
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:07,300
raucous Francisco system so this problem

985
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:12,399
has been solved by the IOM already using

986
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:14,950
direct export right so no no it's

987
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:23,950
different how is it different

988
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:26,379
I'm not sure the child okay yeah I I

989
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:28,569
don't want to explain why I just point

990
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:32,440
Rakesh to my email on the list

991
01:00:28,570 --> 01:00:35,470
so I indicated how alternate marking

992
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:37,840
method is different okay time for any

993
01:00:35,470 --> 01:01:13,120
other person to pre sit down and we go

994
01:00:37,840 --> 01:01:18,070
on so I'm going to talk about the draft

995
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:24,460
on updating the LSP LSP being Jana

996
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:29,140
registers last time I talked about the

997
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:31,060
use and misuse and abuse of some of the

998
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:35,109
registers and we actually sorted that

999
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:37,029
out and getting home we found one new

1000
01:01:35,110 --> 01:01:40,720
problem that I actually also wanted to

1001
01:01:37,030 --> 01:01:43,630
include in this draft and it has to do

1002
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,640
with again the background we have we

1003
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:50,560
have had a couple of changes over years

1004
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:54,970
and some of the graphs has been making

1005
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:57,940
small changes in oracy 81-66 we tried to

1006
01:01:54,970 --> 01:02:00,310
actually do what we thought was the

1007
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:04,390
intention and it turned out that you

1008
01:02:00,310 --> 01:02:06,880
failed there also so

1009
01:02:04,390 --> 01:02:11,549
but discussing now is mandatory and

1010
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:16,809
optional theories with my background

1011
01:02:11,549 --> 01:02:21,549
pretty much within LDP a mandatory

1012
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:23,980
LDP is something that needs to be in a

1013
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:26,799
message if it's defined to be in the

1014
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:31,650
message an optional clearly is something

1015
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:36,400
that can be there or cannot be there and

1016
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:39,099
the message is still well-formed I have

1017
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:44,680
an example here on the hello message

1018
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:47,260
from phone LDP the common parameters

1019
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:50,078
hello parameters are mandatory they need

1020
01:02:47,260 --> 01:02:51,700
to be there the there are also a lot of

1021
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:55,740
optional parameters that you can stick

1022
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:07,779
into a Hello machine if you want to the

1023
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:10,990
whoops what happened so in Odyssey for

1024
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:16,599
379 and also be it in eight is twenty

1025
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:20,618
nine they used actually they never

1026
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:25,210
explicitly used the term mandatory and

1027
01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:29,289
optional TLB but implicitly they had a

1028
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:36,009
different meaning the meaning was that

1029
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:39,069
if you get a till V or a sub theory from

1030
01:03:36,009 --> 01:03:42,640
a range that is defined as half of this

1031
01:03:39,069 --> 01:03:46,029
base lower half of this page you are

1032
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:48,308
required to take an action that's also

1033
01:03:46,029 --> 01:03:50,349
defined in the document that is what we

1034
01:03:48,309 --> 01:03:53,230
talked about this mandatory deal way so

1035
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:56,200
subtly is optional theory is in that

1036
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:59,769
rapid or in that type document is till

1037
01:03:56,200 --> 01:04:03,129
these that you can just don't care you

1038
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:07,359
can kind of silently drop them the

1039
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:09,819
problem here is that it has been hard

1040
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:12,250
for people coming with the different

1041
01:04:09,819 --> 01:04:17,529
background actually to to agree on what

1042
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:26,200
mandatory and optional means in 43 79 80

1043
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:35,380
99 so so what we propose is actually to

1044
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:39,359
change the text on the teal isn't up to

1045
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:41,980
you actually sub theories are not

1046
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:44,560
discussed at all in any of these dr.

1047
01:04:41,980 --> 01:04:46,540
documents is only two theories but sub

1048
01:04:44,560 --> 01:04:48,730
teensiest has the same effect if it's

1049
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:54,520
not recognized you need to send a

1050
01:04:48,730 --> 01:04:58,840
message back so we are saying that we

1051
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:02,490
are removing the mandatory and optional

1052
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:04,900
and yes defines what is required for

1053
01:05:02,490 --> 01:05:10,209
teal V sub T is raised from those

1054
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:16,330
wrenches and I think I think this worked

1055
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:19,630
quite well the drawback is that if we do

1056
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:21,850
this there are I think three or maybe

1057
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:26,440
four documents it also needs to be

1058
01:05:21,850 --> 01:05:29,650
updated on the other hand if we don't do

1059
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:31,750
it they're all about sixteen or

1060
01:05:29,650 --> 01:05:36,880
seventeen documents that would need to

1061
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:40,600
be updated to actually make the you make

1062
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:44,350
a consistent view of sub the optional

1063
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:49,200
and mandatory theories in in India list

1064
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:56,140
of ping releases so this is the least

1065
01:05:49,200 --> 01:06:01,210
hard way to do it and our next step is

1066
01:05:56,140 --> 01:06:04,120
actually to go home do the updates add

1067
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,220
text that actually changes the document

1068
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:10,380
that we need to change and then we would

1069
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:10,379
be very ready working group last call

1070
01:06:12,690 --> 01:06:15,690
questions

1071
01:06:25,640 --> 01:07:00,690
you're going to do I thought were you to

1072
01:06:38,640 --> 01:07:09,140
have Carlos hair but ah you up next for

1073
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:12,540
a moment I thought safar was going to hi

1074
01:07:09,140 --> 01:07:17,359
Carlos pignataro from Cisco and today I

1075
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:20,100
have a very very straightforward draft

1076
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:23,580
in a couple of slides detailing what

1077
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:30,690
we're doing this is four segments

1078
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:32,670
routing actually hold on let me see how

1079
01:07:30,690 --> 01:07:39,390
she so far do you wanna Billie Jean yeah

1080
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:42,810
and I'll do the other one they were the

1081
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:46,440
mistaken B title of the draft it was

1082
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:48,090
switch so that's why in the agenda they

1083
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:53,180
were the switch of the title so Eddie

1084
01:07:48,090 --> 01:07:56,550
okay so I'm going to talk about the

1085
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:58,859
draft on generic fact Telly's for allah

1086
01:07:56,550 --> 01:08:07,560
sleeping this is for a segment outing on

1087
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:11,850
behalf of my co-authors okay so problem

1088
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:16,890
step in the issue that we have today for

1089
01:08:11,850 --> 01:08:20,839
the mpls onm is that every time a new

1090
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:26,670
FAQ is defined we have to go and define

1091
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:28,559
onm FAQ for every time a new segment or

1092
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:29,779
sit type is defined we have to go and

1093
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,359
define

1094
01:08:29,779 --> 01:08:35,900
feck aesthetic subkey lv4 Wenham

1095
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:39,409
purposes what happens because of this is

1096
01:08:35,899 --> 01:08:43,250
that and then we have in incidences here

1097
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:46,129
that some fact type forest segments

1098
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:48,828
routing are already defined but the OEM

1099
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:50,839
factory nation does not exist and

1100
01:08:48,828 --> 01:08:53,089
working group just started to look into

1101
01:08:50,839 --> 01:08:56,868
this and this thing can happen in future

1102
01:08:53,089 --> 01:08:59,448
as well and the issue is not only this

1103
01:08:56,868 --> 01:09:03,170
the show not only about defining and

1104
01:08:59,448 --> 01:09:04,939
when in fact but the issue is also that

1105
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:09,710
whenever the new one in fact is defined

1106
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:15,049
it requires software upgrade to the

1107
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:19,038
network and it does not stop there we

1108
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:21,469
also have scalability issue in terms of

1109
01:09:19,038 --> 01:09:25,658
the parameter the sheer number of

1110
01:09:21,469 --> 01:09:27,549
parameter we need to fill in these

1111
01:09:25,658 --> 01:09:29,960
segments or defects

1112
01:09:27,549 --> 01:09:32,210
so just to give you a preview of this

1113
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:37,399
and and this is not to pick up on one

1114
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:40,569
particular example but let's say we take

1115
01:09:37,399 --> 01:09:45,318
a look at even existing fact for

1116
01:09:40,569 --> 01:09:47,599
parallel or agency said it has many

1117
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:52,039
parameters that interest needs to

1118
01:09:47,599 --> 01:09:54,500
specify what is the responder node ID

1119
01:09:52,038 --> 01:09:57,619
what is the responder interface ID what

1120
01:09:54,500 --> 01:10:03,309
is this neighbor node ID neighbor

1121
01:09:57,619 --> 01:10:06,170
interface ID and because Inglis cannot

1122
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:09,110
know in some cases like para legend

1123
01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:12,199
ceases where or which interface the

1124
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:15,019
packet will lend to then we do not have

1125
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:20,000
actually a validation procedure properly

1126
01:10:15,020 --> 01:10:25,849
defined in existing RFC and as we try to

1127
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:29,929
define an and n continue to cover new

1128
01:10:25,849 --> 01:10:32,480
seat types for second outing we see this

1129
01:10:29,929 --> 01:10:35,989
some of these definition that are in

1130
01:10:32,480 --> 01:10:38,570
individual drafts and and a lot of this

1131
01:10:35,989 --> 01:10:41,808
thing is coming really from the fact

1132
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:43,160
that the onm for MPLS or define with

1133
01:10:41,809 --> 01:10:46,550
control plane

1134
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:50,240
and aeroplane validation together so the

1135
01:10:46,550 --> 01:10:53,300
information was there so that the nodes

1136
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:57,440
can validate data plane and against

1137
01:10:53,300 --> 01:11:00,680
important consistency and that is the

1138
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:05,780
root cause of what we are seeing here

1139
01:11:00,680 --> 01:11:09,020
and today we do not have a procedure

1140
01:11:05,780 --> 01:11:12,429
that if you want to simplify this we can

1141
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:16,130
just validate the data plane itself and

1142
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:20,570
escaped the control plane validation the

1143
01:11:16,130 --> 01:11:23,930
closest of that that comes is an ill

1144
01:11:20,570 --> 01:11:27,500
fake but but we don't have the net

1145
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:30,320
effect does not have enough validation

1146
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:36,920
building it way so motivation here is

1147
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:40,070
that we try to simplify and the effect

1148
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:44,330
definition define one fact definition

1149
01:11:40,070 --> 01:11:51,650
that works for all segments outing set

1150
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:53,390
type set types and it actually is simple

1151
01:11:51,650 --> 01:11:57,469
so once we deploy we don't have to

1152
01:11:53,390 --> 01:12:02,210
update that and and second part is that

1153
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:04,940
it it also simplifies the initiator job

1154
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:07,520
in terms of filling the data that is

1155
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:09,589
required for validation and control

1156
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,800
plane and a replay validation is a node

1157
01:12:09,590 --> 01:12:16,240
behavior note local behavior and it

1158
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:20,570
should be done in a node local fashion

1159
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:23,090
so that's the motivation so for solution

1160
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:24,590
is really going back to if you try to

1161
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:27,920
look at from that point of view is we

1162
01:12:24,590 --> 01:12:31,310
really have to look into the MPS data

1163
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:35,240
plain data model and and I will explain

1164
01:12:31,310 --> 01:12:38,090
it using an example here so from a

1165
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:42,139
procedure point of view one way to look

1166
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:43,850
at it is that when we have an LSP or

1167
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:46,430
when you're thinking we have as end

1168
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:48,410
point in mind so in this case we are

1169
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:53,210
looking at node 8 as the destination

1170
01:12:48,410 --> 01:12:55,280
node and node 1 is the initiator so now

1171
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:57,920
it can develop against all the labels

1172
01:12:55,280 --> 01:13:01,370
that it has it locally

1173
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:05,090
let's say his local agency said it is

1174
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:08,570
local prefix it's whether they belong to

1175
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:10,360
the men I'll go off to the Flex I'll go

1176
01:13:08,570 --> 01:13:14,900
so let's say sixteen thousand and eight

1177
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:17,660
one six zero zero zero eight is is local

1178
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:20,870
prefix it say basically just bounded to

1179
01:13:17,660 --> 01:13:23,000
that I can for n for this said for this

1180
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:27,230
label I can receive packet on any

1181
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:32,690
interface and and and I can validate

1182
01:13:27,230 --> 01:13:35,629
that that data plane action for a send

1183
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:39,889
for this label cop label was correct

1184
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:43,820
similarly for the CID 16 1 to 88 which

1185
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:45,950
is for the flux I'll go 128 it can

1186
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:48,590
receive an aura interface but only

1187
01:13:45,950 --> 01:13:51,710
agency said which is which is set up at

1188
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:54,620
node seven you can have multiple cases

1189
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:56,680
one cases the agency said one nine one

1190
01:13:54,620 --> 01:14:00,590
seven eight which is bound to link one

1191
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:04,610
so the node it creates is local

1192
01:14:00,590 --> 01:14:06,020
information that for this label type for

1193
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:08,780
this agency that I should be receiving

1194
01:14:06,020 --> 01:14:12,770
this packet on this link one and I

1195
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:15,500
should be the endpoint and four nine

1196
01:14:12,770 --> 01:14:20,000
seven nine two seven eight which is did

1197
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:22,250
link on the south it binds their

1198
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:26,080
information that for any packet receive

1199
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:30,890
a with this label an endpoint being me

1200
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:33,380
it has to be linked to and for a federal

1201
01:14:30,890 --> 01:14:35,090
agency it would determine that I can

1202
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:37,760
receive either on link one or link to

1203
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:40,790
but this is done there is a local

1204
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:46,910
decision when an initiator

1205
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:49,910
initiates the thing it puts in the FAQ

1206
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:51,470
the label the target label and the end

1207
01:14:49,910 --> 01:14:54,170
point the expected end point and it

1208
01:14:51,470 --> 01:14:55,520
would work also for binding said you can

1209
01:14:54,170 --> 01:14:58,100
see how it would work for by Nancy very

1210
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:03,590
easily and however work for other said

1211
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:05,330
type and with that top label all I said

1212
01:15:03,590 --> 01:15:06,950
if the it's a packet itself with table

1213
01:15:05,330 --> 01:15:07,970
level six one six zero zero zero eight

1214
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:10,040
it will land it

1215
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,389
no number eight don't know what it would

1216
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:14,139
say

1217
01:15:10,389 --> 01:15:16,810
am I the endpoint yes is this my local

1218
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:19,150
said yes so that's a positive response

1219
01:15:16,810 --> 01:15:21,909
if the packet lines are some other node

1220
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:24,759
then the endpoint would not match and it

1221
01:15:21,909 --> 01:15:27,509
may not be the local label for that that

1222
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:30,460
node and the validation will fail

1223
01:15:27,510 --> 01:15:33,280
similarly if the target is our agency

1224
01:15:30,460 --> 01:15:36,340
said the endpoint is no d8 no rate is

1225
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:38,920
able to validate whether it receive the

1226
01:15:36,340 --> 01:15:42,040
packet on the right interface or not

1227
01:15:38,920 --> 01:15:45,940
whether this is being per religion C or

1228
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:51,070
this is being the agency they're bound

1229
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:52,599
to one particular interface so I have a

1230
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,420
question regarding this this this

1231
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:56,770
particular example Chris Bowers with

1232
01:15:55,420 --> 01:16:00,909
juniper yes

1233
01:15:56,770 --> 01:16:05,679
so if you add a link from 6 to 8 yes

1234
01:16:00,909 --> 01:16:09,339
okay and that also has the label 92 78

1235
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:12,639
yes how how does ate properly validate

1236
01:16:09,340 --> 01:16:16,510
that that again then again the link

1237
01:16:12,639 --> 01:16:18,280
let's call that link link 3 ok would

1238
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:23,199
have a local information at it it will

1239
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:26,019
be bound to that link 3 so a valid a

1240
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:29,710
ping very response should be received on

1241
01:16:26,020 --> 01:16:31,840
interface link 3 not shown here it

1242
01:16:29,710 --> 01:16:34,810
receives receive only imposes to come in

1243
01:16:31,840 --> 01:16:36,810
on the link between 7 and 8 and instead

1244
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:39,219
it comes in on the link between 6 and 8

1245
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:44,560
you can't tell the difference between

1246
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:50,770
that with this scheme if if you have the

1247
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:54,040
link if it if it's the endpoint yes so

1248
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:58,060
and this is sort of a least common

1249
01:16:54,040 --> 01:17:02,409
denominator approach to validating the

1250
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:07,179
forwarding plane so it kind of works in

1251
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:10,360
most situations but doesn't work in some

1252
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:13,719
situations in some situation when you

1253
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:17,139
have same your label advertised by the

1254
01:17:13,719 --> 01:17:19,270
neighbor and you have a clash label

1255
01:17:17,139 --> 01:17:21,610
clash for agency said only not for

1256
01:17:19,270 --> 01:17:24,510
prefix it you can have that condition

1257
01:17:21,610 --> 01:17:27,790
but those those things should

1258
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:29,760
so I mean it seems like you know a lot

1259
01:17:27,790 --> 01:17:32,260
of work a lot of the work goes into

1260
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:35,469
actually getting the forwarding plane

1261
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:36,880
validation correct and this is sort of

1262
01:17:35,469 --> 01:17:38,440
simplifying the control playing

1263
01:17:36,880 --> 01:17:42,040
validation but that's actually not the

1264
01:17:38,440 --> 01:17:43,269
hard part to do so it seems like if

1265
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:46,030
we're going through the trouble of doing

1266
01:17:43,270 --> 01:17:48,699
this we should do it as robustly as

1267
01:17:46,030 --> 01:17:51,580
possible and not sort of at least common

1268
01:17:48,699 --> 01:17:53,919
denominator approach no I mean my take

1269
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:57,940
on this okay so please come to Naaman so

1270
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:59,650
there are there are there are two

1271
01:17:57,940 --> 01:18:01,928
approaches here one approach is a little

1272
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:03,160
bit approach which is this there's

1273
01:18:01,929 --> 01:18:04,840
another approaches which is the

1274
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:09,820
interfaces based approach where you can

1275
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:11,890
bound a specific specific interface on

1276
01:18:09,820 --> 01:18:15,190
which you should be receiving or a set

1277
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:18,040
of interfaces okay but you're not

1278
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:21,730
concerned with like which IDP oh I

1279
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,960
realize this is what the f is is you're

1280
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:25,449
not concerned with those part you're

1281
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:28,840
concerned with this is the behavior from

1282
01:18:25,449 --> 01:18:31,030
one one in generating a pain you should

1283
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,380
be receiving on this interfaces is my

1284
01:18:31,030 --> 01:18:36,190
forwarding plane is working correctly

1285
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:42,010
okay and and and and I'm not saying okay

1286
01:18:36,190 --> 01:18:44,980
so the point here is there we can still

1287
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:46,210
define a fact type that works in the

1288
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:49,059
cases that you mentioned which is

1289
01:18:46,210 --> 01:18:54,570
basically rather than having the onus on

1290
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:57,100
node number eight to do this of this

1291
01:18:54,570 --> 01:19:00,730
generation of this table that it can use

1292
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:02,949
to verify if I receive this this packet

1293
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:05,259
correctly which also means rather than

1294
01:19:02,949 --> 01:19:07,900
having the agency sit in the effect we

1295
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:10,810
can have the label the interface

1296
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,989
information of eight as the endpoint on

1297
01:19:10,810 --> 01:19:16,120
which it should receive against that

1298
01:19:12,989 --> 01:19:18,339
label stack so so I mean it seems though

1299
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:21,280
that defining two approaches is sort of

1300
01:19:18,340 --> 01:19:24,870
the worst of both possible worlds I mean

1301
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:29,199
no maa a robust approach and then a

1302
01:19:24,870 --> 01:19:31,420
least common denominator approach then

1303
01:19:29,199 --> 01:19:35,949
sort of results in just interrupt

1304
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:37,730
problems and more more testing I also

1305
01:19:35,949 --> 01:19:40,910
disagree with your initial State

1306
01:19:37,730 --> 01:19:44,150
and that this is sort of a process that

1307
01:19:40,910 --> 01:19:46,460
we're changing we're proposing a

1308
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:50,780
protocol that sort of robust to IETF

1309
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:55,250
process that is you mentioned people are

1310
01:19:50,780 --> 01:19:59,210
defining OAM effects when they're

1311
01:19:55,250 --> 01:20:01,190
defining the original segments I mean

1312
01:19:59,210 --> 01:20:04,940
that seems like you know if we had

1313
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:07,190
better discipline we could simply solve

1314
01:20:04,940 --> 01:20:08,989
that problem so it is not only the

1315
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:11,379
problem is that you know define the fact

1316
01:20:08,989 --> 01:20:15,610
the problem is is also to get those

1317
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:19,040
parameter fill in by an ingress node

1318
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:22,429
ability for an ingress road to grab all

1319
01:20:19,040 --> 01:20:26,540
those parameters to be able to send in

1320
01:20:22,430 --> 01:20:29,330
this message even is not possible in all

1321
01:20:26,540 --> 01:20:31,910
ways and a lot of time you actually have

1322
01:20:29,330 --> 01:20:34,309
to go and then there is another draft on

1323
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:36,860
the agenda once it comes you see that

1324
01:20:34,310 --> 01:20:38,239
you actually have to go and get that

1325
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:40,179
information from the control plane

1326
01:20:38,239 --> 01:20:43,250
because it's not for a human to be

1327
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:44,660
entering all those information or

1328
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:47,150
parameter is not possible

1329
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:49,820
so you get it from the control plane so

1330
01:20:47,150 --> 01:20:52,339
we are running late very late so just I

1331
01:20:49,820 --> 01:20:53,509
cut secure after Carrick and then we

1332
01:20:52,340 --> 01:20:56,860
should move the discussion to the

1333
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:59,390
mailing list talking at arc with juniper

1334
01:20:56,860 --> 01:21:01,880
so far I did send comments about this

1335
01:20:59,390 --> 01:21:04,280
draft on the mailing list I encourage

1336
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:07,250
you to respond I will raise one comment

1337
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:09,739
here from the set there are cases where

1338
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,540
the label a collision can happen on

1339
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:15,320
eight you have multiple SR effects

1340
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:17,300
trying to clean the same label and there

1341
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:19,670
are actually there stated in one of the

1342
01:21:17,300 --> 01:21:22,730
spring working group documents how you

1343
01:21:19,670 --> 01:21:26,420
handle such collisions and you have a

1344
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:28,519
tiebreaking criteria now for the egress

1345
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:31,370
to do validation the label is valid and

1346
01:21:28,520 --> 01:21:34,220
it will pick one of the facts and bind

1347
01:21:31,370 --> 01:21:36,320
it to that label but the ingress may

1348
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:39,140
think it's validating something

1349
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:41,599
different a different fact so unless the

1350
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:44,090
ingress fails the SR fact that is trying

1351
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,770
to validate it doesn't know what it's

1352
01:21:44,090 --> 01:21:49,160
trying to validate it will say yeah it's

1353
01:21:45,770 --> 01:21:51,110
a valid label but it might not be the

1354
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:55,700
correct value label that the ingress

1355
01:21:51,110 --> 01:21:57,740
once to validate so it's missing that

1356
01:21:55,700 --> 01:22:02,179
there are holes there I see yeah so I

1357
01:21:57,740 --> 01:22:03,679
think what could be and and this is the

1358
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:05,870
work that we could do it to address

1359
01:22:03,680 --> 01:22:08,360
these comment is to actually have the

1360
01:22:05,870 --> 01:22:09,740
interface information on which the

1361
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:14,740
package should be received rather than

1362
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:14,740
the label that's more direct and NN

1363
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:23,570
completing all the parameters I think

1364
01:22:21,740 --> 01:22:25,160
it's very simple just to be GPL s you

1365
01:22:23,570 --> 01:22:27,469
get the whole topology and then you know

1366
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:29,389
what each label means yeah but you can

1367
01:22:27,470 --> 01:22:31,370
you take the information from the

1368
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:35,300
control plane and then validate that

1369
01:22:31,370 --> 01:22:36,980
information on the node so you take them

1370
01:22:35,300 --> 01:22:39,200
from which the whole point of doing

1371
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:42,679
control plane versus data plane

1372
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:44,720
validation procedure get get lost

1373
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:58,040
because you get the information from

1374
01:22:44,720 --> 01:23:01,240
these okay now it's call us and I think

1375
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:01,240
I'm recur at this time

1376
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:52,800
all right second try this is indeed a

1377
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:54,630
very very straightforward draft and a

1378
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,840
couple of slides probably more than a

1379
01:23:54,630 --> 01:24:02,449
couple actually you know just to give a

1380
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:04,949
lot of contextual details on this but

1381
01:24:02,449 --> 01:24:07,860
you know essentially if I have to

1382
01:24:04,949 --> 01:24:12,629
summarize what this is about is really

1383
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:15,719
about asking for a code point for OSPF

1384
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:19,920
b3 for a couple of information elements

1385
01:24:15,719 --> 01:24:22,530
within LSP ping and that's because when

1386
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:25,949
we set those up we set them up for OSPF

1387
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:26,910
generically and now we're finding that

1388
01:24:25,949 --> 01:24:30,690
we actually need to differentiate

1389
01:24:26,910 --> 01:24:36,380
between OSPF v2 and v3 so you want to

1390
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:36,379
start with a question law thank you

1391
01:24:37,910 --> 01:24:42,900
problem statement is this is a

1392
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:45,660
rephrasing of what I said the main

1393
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:48,509
intention is that we created a couple of

1394
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:50,820
sub registries in the LS peeping

1395
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:53,820
parameters which actually use a protocol

1396
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:57,179
field and this protocol field is really

1397
01:24:53,820 --> 01:25:00,570
used for doing control plane validation

1398
01:24:57,179 --> 01:25:02,840
and verification of the data plane the

1399
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:07,110
protocol fill exists in the downstream

1400
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:14,360
detailed mapping TLV and it also exists

1401
01:25:07,110 --> 01:25:17,040
in the seeds for the target fix for

1402
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:24,509
there are three of them target fixed

1403
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:31,019
acts for segmented effects you can see

1404
01:25:24,510 --> 01:25:32,270
right there graphically the three seed

1405
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:36,190
sub TL

1406
01:25:32,270 --> 01:25:36,190
is where we define the protocol field

1407
01:25:36,850 --> 01:25:45,980
and how we actually set it up

1408
01:25:39,590 --> 01:25:50,600
historically for OSPF only I guess is is

1409
01:25:45,980 --> 01:25:53,809
agnostic to layer three OSPF b2 runs

1410
01:25:50,600 --> 01:25:58,520
over ipv4 and advertises ipv4 prefixes

1411
01:25:53,810 --> 01:26:03,850
and reachability OSPF v3 runs over ipv6

1412
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:06,230
but advertises both address families and

1413
01:26:03,850 --> 01:26:10,610
the other place where we have the

1414
01:26:06,230 --> 01:26:15,950
protocol field defined for OSPF only is

1415
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:21,889
within the label stack subtly in the DD

1416
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:27,519
map this is a request that this graph is

1417
01:26:21,890 --> 01:26:34,820
making OSPF v3 in those two specific

1418
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:37,220
registries and you know even though this

1419
01:26:34,820 --> 01:26:39,019
is a fairly straightforward drafting

1420
01:26:37,220 --> 01:26:40,970
which we actually explain some of the

1421
01:26:39,020 --> 01:26:44,030
context for when we actually realized

1422
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:45,140
that we needed this even though it's

1423
01:26:44,030 --> 01:26:49,940
really straightforward we'll really

1424
01:26:45,140 --> 01:26:52,520
invite and welcome review in that review

1425
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:55,490
comments questions observations

1426
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:56,870
constructive criticism and you know even

1427
01:26:55,490 --> 01:27:00,290
though that is a fairly straightforward

1428
01:26:56,870 --> 01:27:02,630
draft also we actually request adoption

1429
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:07,010
on this very first presentation so thank

1430
01:27:02,630 --> 01:27:10,100
you okay so lower Anderson Carlos there

1431
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:13,160
is so I think this is a very neatly to

1432
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:16,970
draft it does what it's tells us that

1433
01:27:13,160 --> 01:27:23,750
you want to do pretty clear is to read I

1434
01:27:16,970 --> 01:27:27,740
have about one problem so today there is

1435
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:30,740
a code point for OSPF in the registers

1436
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:35,870
are you giving to use that code point

1437
01:27:30,740 --> 01:27:40,460
for OSPF v2 in the future if that is the

1438
01:27:35,870 --> 01:27:42,200
case you should rename it correct and

1439
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:45,719
that's that's a great question Louis oh

1440
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:50,789
you know our experience say that

1441
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:52,979
point is not using deployment today are

1442
01:27:50,789 --> 01:27:56,369
you saying it you're not used at all

1443
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:59,909
so our yes what we understand is that is

1444
01:27:56,369 --> 01:28:02,579
not using deployment today and if that

1445
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:05,070
the case you know the easy thing to do

1446
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:07,619
is to actually rename that to SPF v2 at

1447
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:09,749
the same time the safer thing to do is

1448
01:28:07,619 --> 01:28:13,110
to obsolete it and get a new one for v2

1449
01:28:09,749 --> 01:28:17,159
and we're really open to doing either of

1450
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:19,558
those I would take the safe way out and

1451
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:24,420
actually obsolete the current kill point

1452
01:28:19,559 --> 01:28:29,909
and add two new code points one for his

1453
01:28:24,420 --> 01:28:32,670
path v2 amount or III I'm not I thought

1454
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:35,190
we had deployments of this if we have

1455
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:37,110
had deployments I would be very strict

1456
01:28:35,190 --> 01:28:39,570
on doing it that way but if you don't

1457
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:41,039
have any differentiation I should take

1458
01:28:39,570 --> 01:28:43,889
that back because I was thinking of just

1459
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:46,710
to be you know very specific and clear I

1460
01:28:43,889 --> 01:28:55,130
was thinking of this use of the protocol

1461
01:28:46,710 --> 01:28:57,239
field however this one is absolutely

1462
01:28:55,130 --> 01:28:59,880
running and deployed everywhere

1463
01:28:57,239 --> 01:29:02,459
throughout so so and I think we should

1464
01:28:59,880 --> 01:29:06,719
deprecated an instance a two new cool

1465
01:29:02,460 --> 01:29:10,110
points thank you

1466
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:12,239
at arc with juniper Carlos I have a

1467
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:14,009
maybe it's a silly question but just

1468
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:18,839
clarification from you

1469
01:29:14,010 --> 01:29:22,769
Oh SPF v3 is specific to ipv6 can we not

1470
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:26,550
rely on the efi on indian message 16

1471
01:29:22,769 --> 01:29:30,150
bytes - no this is OSPF III and it might

1472
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:32,969
be miss a silly no no no such a thing at

1473
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:35,190
all you know and if anything there's

1474
01:29:32,969 --> 01:29:38,340
only silly answer so hopefully I'll I'll

1475
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:41,039
give you one that is not too silly the

1476
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:44,309
address family is gonna tell the rich

1477
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,409
ability information address family right

1478
01:29:44,309 --> 01:29:49,229
not the protocol that is advertised in

1479
01:29:46,409 --> 01:29:53,638
it and in that case if you get IP if you

1480
01:29:49,229 --> 01:29:55,849
get ipv4 that can be OSP v2 or v3 so

1481
01:29:53,639 --> 01:29:57,869
that's why you cannot disambiguate

1482
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,470
basically so what you're saying is

1483
01:29:57,869 --> 01:30:03,490
Version three can

1484
01:29:59,470 --> 01:30:12,730
we both address families okay although

1485
01:30:03,490 --> 01:30:14,160
right and I think we wrote that down but

1486
01:30:12,730 --> 01:30:17,200
maybe we did oh yeah on

1487
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:20,580
do you mind scrolling in yeah thank you

1488
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:24,120
so yeah you can see that there yeah

1489
01:30:20,580 --> 01:30:24,120
thank you for the question

1490
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:29,669
any other questions thank you very much

1491
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:54,280
hi again it's dark and I'm giving you an

1492
01:30:51,430 --> 01:30:59,140
update on the yang the data models that

1493
01:30:54,280 --> 01:31:01,540
were driving in MPLS working group this

1494
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:03,820
is a quick update I'll go over the draft

1495
01:31:01,540 --> 01:31:06,490
current status and the next steps that

1496
01:31:03,820 --> 01:31:12,040
we're projecting we have the first one

1497
01:31:06,490 --> 01:31:14,610
is the MPLS yang draft this draft has

1498
01:31:12,040 --> 01:31:18,190
undergone a yang doctor review recently

1499
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:21,880
and we've addressed all of the comments

1500
01:31:18,190 --> 01:31:24,849
that came back from the review we have

1501
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:26,710
no outstanding issues on this so the

1502
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:32,320
next steps are going going ahead and

1503
01:31:26,710 --> 01:31:34,510
requesting working group last call no

1504
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:36,940
open issues we encourage the working

1505
01:31:34,510 --> 01:31:41,430
group to give us feedback if if they get

1506
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:45,719
to review it again the second one is the

1507
01:31:41,430 --> 01:31:49,930
MPLS static King for static Ellis fees

1508
01:31:45,720 --> 01:31:53,410
this again undergone a yang dr. review

1509
01:31:49,930 --> 01:31:56,350
and the author's did address all of the

1510
01:31:53,410 --> 01:31:59,769
comments there are no outstanding issues

1511
01:31:56,350 --> 01:32:05,250
and we're going to go ahead with the

1512
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:05,250
working group last call as a next step

1513
01:32:05,370 --> 01:32:10,330
now next we have this MPLS LDP hang

1514
01:32:09,070 --> 01:32:14,230
craft

1515
01:32:10,330 --> 01:32:17,800
this draft we version seven of it it's

1516
01:32:14,230 --> 01:32:20,769
currently a non version seven and we did

1517
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:23,080
go ahead completed its it's working

1518
01:32:20,770 --> 01:32:27,250
group last call and we did submit it to

1519
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:31,059
iesg but part of that process because of

1520
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:35,530
the first yang doctor review happened in

1521
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:37,750
22nd 2017 on an older revision we were

1522
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:40,360
asked to review it again and that

1523
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:42,730
happened and there were comments that

1524
01:32:40,360 --> 01:32:46,570
came back off the from the last review

1525
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:48,070
that happened so the authors my

1526
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:51,130
understanding are looking into the

1527
01:32:48,070 --> 01:32:54,790
comments and they will they will look to

1528
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:57,520
address them there are also more

1529
01:32:54,790 --> 01:33:01,060
comments that came from town patch about

1530
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:04,540
the draft so we did we do encourage you

1531
01:33:01,060 --> 01:33:06,730
the author's to look into them as I

1532
01:33:04,540 --> 01:33:10,600
mentioned the currently the draft is in

1533
01:33:06,730 --> 01:33:12,759
iesg so we want as next steps we want to

1534
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:17,470
address the comments and give a go-ahead

1535
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:20,680
so that the ad does the proper next

1536
01:33:17,470 --> 01:33:23,140
steps come run you want a comment on

1537
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:25,150
this yeah says discussed offline yes

1538
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:26,740
we'll be working on this and addressing

1539
01:33:25,150 --> 01:33:29,410
all the comments from yarn doctors and

1540
01:33:26,740 --> 01:33:31,450
any pending comments from our D review

1541
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:37,450
and we'll be submitting a draft post

1542
01:33:31,450 --> 01:33:41,250
idea okay thank you so the next draft is

1543
01:33:37,450 --> 01:33:45,190
actually a sister draft of the first one

1544
01:33:41,250 --> 01:33:47,680
it's not it's not in the it's not

1545
01:33:45,190 --> 01:33:51,269
submitted to IES yet and but we

1546
01:33:47,680 --> 01:33:54,160
understand it's close to being complete

1547
01:33:51,270 --> 01:33:57,100
but just like the first one the one I

1548
01:33:54,160 --> 01:34:00,730
did mention on the previous slide it has

1549
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:03,910
undergone a young doctor review and back

1550
01:34:00,730 --> 01:34:06,190
in 2017 so most likely we will go

1551
01:34:03,910 --> 01:34:08,769
through another round of review and they

1552
01:34:06,190 --> 01:34:10,330
will trigger comments so we we do

1553
01:34:08,770 --> 01:34:13,390
encourage the authors to proactively

1554
01:34:10,330 --> 01:34:15,930
respond so that we can progress faster

1555
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:15,930
on this one

1556
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:24,830
have a draft for LSP pingyang and it has

1557
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:28,429
a config next to it although we were

1558
01:34:24,830 --> 01:34:31,900
discussing it it covers state and config

1559
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:34,760
so the the config there is questionable

1560
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:37,820
the current status it's at the the

1561
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:40,970
revision 6 at the moment and we did

1562
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:42,860
complete a working group at option Paul

1563
01:34:40,970 --> 01:34:46,310
there were several comments that came

1564
01:34:42,860 --> 01:34:48,860
back as part of that process

1565
01:34:46,310 --> 01:34:52,240
there was no traction from the authors

1566
01:34:48,860 --> 01:34:52,240
to address those comments

1567
01:34:52,450 --> 01:35:00,230
currently the the draft is an expired

1568
01:34:55,070 --> 01:35:03,019
state as next steps we we want to hear

1569
01:35:00,230 --> 01:35:06,910
from the authors if there is still

1570
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:11,360
interest in driving this draft forward

1571
01:35:06,910 --> 01:35:14,330
we want to refresh the idea if so and we

1572
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,570
move ahead with adopting the document if

1573
01:35:14,330 --> 01:35:26,130
any one of the authors is present and

1574
01:35:17,570 --> 01:35:28,920
wants the comment feel free ok and

1575
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:31,170
that was it these are the yang models

1576
01:35:28,920 --> 01:35:34,410
that we're driving in the in this

1577
01:35:31,170 --> 01:35:37,460
working group and you know let us know

1578
01:35:34,410 --> 01:35:37,460
if you have any questions

1579
01:36:16,010 --> 01:36:26,090
good evening I'm talking on behalf of my

1580
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:29,130
co-authors about EP om fake definition

1581
01:36:26,090 --> 01:36:31,410
so there's nothing new here it's you

1582
01:36:29,130 --> 01:36:33,720
know traditional MPLS om there are new

1583
01:36:31,410 --> 01:36:38,099
labels and we are defining facts for

1584
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:39,330
those new labels so that's the

1585
01:36:38,100 --> 01:36:41,280
background you have presented it

1586
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:43,050
multiple times and I wouldn't spend more

1587
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:47,820
time here and just find a little bit

1588
01:36:43,050 --> 01:36:51,090
time on the updates in this revision so

1589
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:54,269
we did a few editorial changes and TLB

1590
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:59,250
structure optimisation for considering

1591
01:36:54,270 --> 01:37:01,710
ipv4 and ipv6 addresses so we we jump on

1592
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:03,690
to peer nodes it because peer adjacency

1593
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:06,240
said it's the same and there is no

1594
01:37:03,690 --> 01:37:07,950
change from last revision so peer node

1595
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:12,000
said has changed a little bit from last

1596
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:13,920
revision so we had a address family

1597
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,470
there instead we thought that it's

1598
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:19,230
better to have number of ipv4 interface

1599
01:37:16,470 --> 01:37:23,790
pairs and number of ipv6 interface pairs

1600
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:26,280
this is because the there can be two

1601
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:28,170
interfaces on which the peer load side

1602
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:31,349
wants to load balance the traffic on one

1603
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:33,210
is ipv4 and as ipv4 address and neither

1604
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:37,140
has ipv6 address and we you should be

1605
01:37:33,210 --> 01:37:39,750
able to accommodate that and when so so

1606
01:37:37,140 --> 01:37:41,490
the TLB structure has been updated

1607
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:46,020
when there are both ipv4 and ipv6

1608
01:37:41,490 --> 01:37:48,990
addresses the IPV force will be ipv6

1609
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:52,770
will be followed after the ipv4 address

1610
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:53,330
pairs so that's the update in this

1611
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:57,990
revision

1612
01:37:53,330 --> 01:37:59,790
similarly Pierce X it the same update so

1613
01:37:57,990 --> 01:38:02,700
instead of having an address family we

1614
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:06,630
have number of ipv4 interface pairs and

1615
01:38:02,700 --> 01:38:12,179
number of ipv6 interface pairs in the

1616
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:15,480
TLB definition we request for review and

1617
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:18,240
comments and we also ask for working

1618
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:20,580
group adoption it's being presented

1619
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:23,730
multiple times this is the third time we

1620
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:26,910
presenting it and we believe that this

1621
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:30,570
should have been done when the EPE sits

1622
01:38:26,910 --> 01:38:32,340
were defined so so as to just avoid you

1623
01:38:30,570 --> 01:38:33,719
know having situation when EPE is

1624
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:37,050
deployed and we don't have oh I am

1625
01:38:33,720 --> 01:38:40,850
photos so I think this is the really the

1626
01:38:37,050 --> 01:38:43,920
work needed to be done quickly yes uh

1627
01:38:40,850 --> 01:38:48,120
friendly so I have the same common can

1628
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:51,950
you go back to one slide see the thing

1629
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:55,010
is this that this is getting much more

1630
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:57,660
complex we need to get simplification

1631
01:38:55,010 --> 01:38:59,460
this information the amount of

1632
01:38:57,660 --> 01:39:04,110
information that's going is button one

1633
01:38:59,460 --> 01:39:09,120
ingress button on egress you try to get

1634
01:39:04,110 --> 01:39:11,339
information to validate essentially the

1635
01:39:09,120 --> 01:39:14,099
forwarding behavior so what we will be

1636
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:16,920
willing to work with again the document

1637
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:19,380
that I presented and we spoke offline is

1638
01:39:16,920 --> 01:39:21,630
to work with to find an easier ground

1639
01:39:19,380 --> 01:39:24,330
this is we started this router as well

1640
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:26,310
and we realized that this is this is way

1641
01:39:24,330 --> 01:39:30,540
too complex and then how long it'll

1642
01:39:26,310 --> 01:39:32,850
chase a sit type of asset type to define

1643
01:39:30,540 --> 01:39:34,470
a new fact ID and we're going to be in

1644
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:39,210
dissipation forever

1645
01:39:34,470 --> 01:39:41,580
so I what I would say that we were

1646
01:39:39,210 --> 01:39:44,040
willing to work with the authors of this

1647
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:48,150
draft to try to find and simplify it

1648
01:39:44,040 --> 01:39:51,240
ground and and and and we believe it can

1649
01:39:48,150 --> 01:39:52,789
be achieved it can be achieved by using

1650
01:39:51,240 --> 01:39:59,989
either

1651
01:39:52,789 --> 01:40:01,400
the the siddell locator ID or it could

1652
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:02,808
be achieved by the interface addresses

1653
01:40:01,400 --> 01:40:05,449
on which the packet should be received

1654
01:40:02,809 --> 01:40:08,989
it should be done so that it is not

1655
01:40:05,449 --> 01:40:11,000
bound to the egress pe will not bound to

1656
01:40:08,989 --> 01:40:14,169
the BGP it can be used for federal

1657
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:17,090
agencies of any type with the IEP EPE

1658
01:40:14,170 --> 01:40:17,690
some other type that would be my

1659
01:40:17,090 --> 01:40:20,420
recommendation

1660
01:40:17,690 --> 01:40:23,449
yeah so if you want a robust or

1661
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:26,210
mechanism that people are used to for so

1662
01:40:23,449 --> 01:40:28,219
many years with the MPLS I think you

1663
01:40:26,210 --> 01:40:31,639
have to leave with coming up you know

1664
01:40:28,219 --> 01:40:33,829
preparing this this kind of effect and

1665
01:40:31,639 --> 01:40:36,079
then validating them on the egress if

1666
01:40:33,829 --> 01:40:38,000
you want a very generic mechanism I

1667
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,730
think it's not going to be that robust

1668
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:42,500
it may not it might falsely defect it

1669
01:40:40,730 --> 01:40:44,989
might falsely detect something and

1670
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:46,039
sometimes it may not even detect I think

1671
01:40:44,989 --> 01:40:47,928
that was discussed in the last

1672
01:40:46,039 --> 01:40:54,170
presentation like in wha in which cases

1673
01:40:47,929 --> 01:40:57,380
it it can break no I come back it's like

1674
01:40:54,170 --> 01:40:59,989
presentation if you use the assignor ide

1675
01:40:57,380 --> 01:41:03,530
then you solve the problem the comment

1676
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:05,570
that was there actually if you add the

1677
01:41:03,530 --> 01:41:09,110
assignor ID this problem is solved and

1678
01:41:05,570 --> 01:41:14,058
it's all false it so here what do we

1679
01:41:09,110 --> 01:41:16,759
gain by maybe that if the graph is

1680
01:41:14,059 --> 01:41:19,460
updated probably we can read in yeah

1681
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:21,980
josh is updated and and and but but the

1682
01:41:19,460 --> 01:41:25,340
point is not the point is that we local

1683
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:30,348
information remote information locally s

1684
01:41:25,340 --> 01:41:32,989
number remote es number Medina said I

1685
01:41:30,349 --> 01:41:35,900
think what we should look for is some

1686
01:41:32,989 --> 01:41:39,138
simplification that can we apply across

1687
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:41,329
the board not for the EP u only but for

1688
01:41:39,139 --> 01:41:44,570
the IDP we can simplify there as well

1689
01:41:41,329 --> 01:41:50,480
and and will be completely willing to

1690
01:41:44,570 --> 01:41:54,049
work on that front but so I have a

1691
01:41:50,480 --> 01:41:56,570
question sort of I guess safar commented

1692
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:59,030
on like simplifying even the IGP

1693
01:41:56,570 --> 01:42:02,960
versions which are already defined and

1694
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:05,480
what is it 8287 I mean those are you

1695
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:06,739
know implemented interoperability tested

1696
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:08,989
deployed

1697
01:42:06,739 --> 01:42:10,848
I I mean I would strongly object to

1698
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:13,909
anything that says we're going to define

1699
01:42:10,849 --> 01:42:14,329
a second version of those four to what

1700
01:42:13,909 --> 01:42:16,759
purpose

1701
01:42:14,329 --> 01:42:19,150
I see no no reason to do that for the

1702
01:42:16,760 --> 01:42:26,710
iGPS

1703
01:42:19,150 --> 01:42:28,759
okay even if you don't do that this

1704
01:42:26,710 --> 01:42:30,949
information if they're too much and

1705
01:42:28,760 --> 01:42:35,690
could be simplified and we can I mean we

1706
01:42:30,949 --> 01:42:37,489
try to do go that route and we can

1707
01:42:35,690 --> 01:42:40,308
simplify and I think we should discuss

1708
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:44,119
that a bit more I don't think in the

1709
01:42:40,309 --> 01:42:45,710
current form it is it is the information

1710
01:42:44,119 --> 01:42:52,480
it would be to buy difficult for both

1711
01:42:45,710 --> 01:42:52,480
ingress and egress is over-engineered

1712
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:31,719
[Music]

1713
01:43:32,450 --> 01:43:39,090
so this draft is about inter ASO a.m.

1714
01:43:36,330 --> 01:43:43,830
for Assad networks we presented it last

1715
01:43:39,090 --> 01:43:50,790
time in Montreal and we be presenting

1716
01:43:43,830 --> 01:43:52,950
updates to this draft in the new version

1717
01:43:50,790 --> 01:43:58,950
so we have new co-authors nagi indras

1718
01:43:52,950 --> 01:44:01,950
afar and Carlos so we go back to updates

1719
01:43:58,950 --> 01:44:04,410
from last revision so we received a

1720
01:44:01,950 --> 01:44:08,519
comment that so we had labels in the

1721
01:44:04,410 --> 01:44:10,260
reverse path TLB and so you received a

1722
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:11,940
comment that they should be segments

1723
01:44:10,260 --> 01:44:15,960
instead of labels so we took that

1724
01:44:11,940 --> 01:44:18,540
comment and updated this so that so

1725
01:44:15,960 --> 01:44:22,950
there is a reverse path sub TLV which

1726
01:44:18,540 --> 01:44:25,110
reverse path TLV which is under MPLS OEM

1727
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:28,920
IANA registry and then there are

1728
01:44:25,110 --> 01:44:31,380
segments up TLV so each six segments of

1729
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,690
TLV looks very similar to what is

1730
01:44:31,380 --> 01:44:38,430
defined in SR policy lists sub tier V

1731
01:44:33,690 --> 01:44:41,129
and it could have either labels or it

1732
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:45,420
could have IP v4 address and optional

1733
01:44:41,130 --> 01:44:49,230
set and ipv6 said enough or optional

1734
01:44:45,420 --> 01:44:51,990
sent so right now this draft is

1735
01:44:49,230 --> 01:44:53,820
referring to the IANA registry of SR

1736
01:44:51,990 --> 01:44:58,760
policy Lee sub tier V because this this

1737
01:44:53,820 --> 01:45:01,559
this Ayana code points is a sub TLV so

1738
01:44:58,760 --> 01:45:03,750
right now we're directly referring to it

1739
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:06,480
I wasn't too sure if this is the that is

1740
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:08,610
the right way or we should define a new

1741
01:45:06,480 --> 01:45:12,900
registry for this and looking for inputs

1742
01:45:08,610 --> 01:45:14,910
from the working group so this this

1743
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,370
looks the segment sub T always look

1744
01:45:14,910 --> 01:45:22,080
exactly same as what is defined in SF

1745
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:24,900
policy sub T Elvis so we have three

1746
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:28,920
types we have taken type one which is a

1747
01:45:24,900 --> 01:45:32,580
label MPLS label type 3 which is ipv4

1748
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:37,020
node address and optional said and type

1749
01:45:32,580 --> 01:45:40,340
for ipv6 address and the optional set so

1750
01:45:37,020 --> 01:45:44,099
we have covered SR MPLS SR MPLS for v6

1751
01:45:40,340 --> 01:45:48,840
and as our v6 has been moved out of

1752
01:45:44,099 --> 01:45:52,469
scope of this document and as per

1753
01:45:48,840 --> 01:45:55,050
discussion from last meeting we will be

1754
01:45:52,469 --> 01:46:00,030
moving it to MPLS working group and

1755
01:45:55,050 --> 01:46:02,460
renaming the draft so we also have

1756
01:46:00,030 --> 01:46:05,550
another new section added so this is for

1757
01:46:02,460 --> 01:46:09,059
dynamically building the reverse path so

1758
01:46:05,550 --> 01:46:10,980
in this example our one may not have the

1759
01:46:09,059 --> 01:46:12,840
capability to figure out what the

1760
01:46:10,980 --> 01:46:16,320
reverse path is for when it's pinging

1761
01:46:12,840 --> 01:46:19,079
from r1 to r4 so we have a mechanism how

1762
01:46:16,320 --> 01:46:22,768
this can be done and the reverse path

1763
01:46:19,079 --> 01:46:26,429
dynamically built as the MPLS trace

1764
01:46:22,769 --> 01:46:28,019
route mechanism progresses so this is

1765
01:46:26,429 --> 01:46:31,050
applicable for only place road procedure

1766
01:46:28,019 --> 01:46:33,929
so when when ASB r3 receives or trace

1767
01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:35,909
around MPLS traced or packet it finds

1768
01:46:33,929 --> 01:46:38,369
out that this packet is received on an

1769
01:46:35,909 --> 01:46:40,768
interesting and so it knows that it has

1770
01:46:38,369 --> 01:46:43,139
to build the reverse path and the way it

1771
01:46:40,769 --> 01:46:45,539
builds it is it takes its own node set

1772
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:49,920
and EPE said in the reverse direction

1773
01:46:45,539 --> 01:46:54,780
that is SB r3 to SBR one and then update

1774
01:46:49,920 --> 01:46:57,389
puts this this information in the

1775
01:46:54,780 --> 01:47:02,389
reverse path segment TLV in the DD empty

1776
01:46:57,389 --> 01:47:05,880
and and so ingress uses it for the next

1777
01:47:02,389 --> 01:47:12,840
so the next trace route when when the

1778
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:17,719
packet has to visit r3 so this is a

1779
01:47:12,840 --> 01:47:17,719
simple solution for inter assr OEM and

1780
01:47:17,869 --> 01:47:27,780
request MPLS working group to accept it

1781
01:47:21,269 --> 01:47:32,760
as a working group document it's great

1782
01:47:27,780 --> 01:47:36,360
quote I have a kind of admin question

1783
01:47:32,760 --> 01:47:39,150
yeah if you look at the two drafts the

1784
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,460
EP and the entry yes which one do you

1785
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:48,138
think is closest to working group last

1786
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:48,139
call also working group adoption yeah

1787
01:47:50,449 --> 01:47:59,460
talk to Mike so epi

1788
01:47:53,790 --> 01:48:02,010
is very straightforward and I would

1789
01:47:59,460 --> 01:48:04,910
expect that the this this draft is also

1790
01:48:02,010 --> 01:48:07,950
kind of quite stable in the sense

1791
01:48:04,910 --> 01:48:11,040
functionally there has not been much big

1792
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:16,830
change and probably we should accept

1793
01:48:11,040 --> 01:48:21,900
both as working group documents okay

1794
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:26,910
Gregg mercy City so you introduced what

1795
01:48:21,900 --> 01:48:31,980
can be characterized as a 3ds of SIDS

1796
01:48:26,910 --> 01:48:37,920
and POS ipv4 ipv6 so do you envision

1797
01:48:31,980 --> 01:48:45,150
that in the return path more than one

1798
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:47,340
family will be used there is so-so more

1799
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:52,620
than one family in the sense one ipv4

1800
01:48:47,340 --> 01:48:55,680
and one IP v6 yes or MPLS and v6 yeah so

1801
01:48:52,620 --> 01:48:58,230
I need to think more about more about

1802
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:02,300
that why if somebody would do that but I

1803
01:48:58,230 --> 01:49:05,790
definitely think that you know the ipv4

1804
01:49:02,300 --> 01:49:08,550
address and thus it is a very valid use

1805
01:49:05,790 --> 01:49:10,530
case because if the sRGB czar different

1806
01:49:08,550 --> 01:49:13,950
just signing the labels doesn't work

1807
01:49:10,530 --> 01:49:18,000
yeah because again if that's the case I

1808
01:49:13,950 --> 01:49:21,179
think that there some illustration when

1809
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:25,200
it will be will be helpful yeah

1810
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:28,830
otherwise what seems that introduction

1811
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:30,080
of sub TVs creates an overhead without

1812
01:49:28,830 --> 01:49:32,700
good reason

1813
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:35,660
sure I will I'd the explanation to that

1814
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:35,660
okay thank you thank you

1815
01:50:07,570 --> 01:50:16,929
hi Anoosh and this graph basically talks

1816
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:32,648
about an interoffice UV so in a recent

1817
01:50:16,929 --> 01:50:36,369
customer site okay so this is the

1818
01:50:32,649 --> 01:50:40,679
topology that was used and here all the

1819
01:50:36,369 --> 01:50:45,308
nodes are LD P and a GP n LD P enabled

1820
01:50:40,679 --> 01:50:49,929
let's consider the following LD P LS

1821
01:50:45,309 --> 01:50:55,199
piece to prefix e at node B so node B we

1822
01:50:49,929 --> 01:51:00,369
have a primary LSP PR e which takes the

1823
01:50:55,199 --> 01:51:05,728
be a path that is IJ P primary path and

1824
01:51:00,369 --> 01:51:05,728
the backup LSP follows the BCD AE path

1825
01:51:09,570 --> 01:51:18,820
the next two slides describe the

1826
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:23,978
sequence of events that we so in this

1827
01:51:18,820 --> 01:51:27,179
particular topology so at time T 0 the

1828
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:36,880
link between node a and node B was

1829
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:41,260
brought down at t1 node B receives LDP

1830
01:51:36,880 --> 01:51:43,630
shutdown notification from PR a the

1831
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:45,999
shutdown notification can make it

1832
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:50,939
through over the TCP session as long as

1833
01:51:45,999 --> 01:51:50,938
some reach ability access from A to B

1834
01:51:56,969 --> 01:52:06,209
at time t2 noed beter stone the allah

1835
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:10,539
pls peace to prefix see both the primary

1836
01:52:06,209 --> 01:52:15,669
LSP PRI and the backup which is tied to

1837
01:52:10,539 --> 01:52:21,030
this primary as a result of this any l2

1838
01:52:15,669 --> 01:52:25,659
VPN and VPN services or node B which use

1839
01:52:21,030 --> 01:52:26,228
LD pls p2 e they see complete traffic

1840
01:52:25,659 --> 01:52:31,179
laws

1841
01:52:26,229 --> 01:52:38,050
till the LSPD converges that is at time

1842
01:52:31,179 --> 01:52:43,719
T for at t3 B receives the link down

1843
01:52:38,050 --> 01:52:49,780
event for be a physical link and maybe

1844
01:52:43,719 --> 01:52:51,699
here I mean LDP on B IP for maybe I

1845
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:55,719
could try I want to clarify something on

1846
01:52:51,699 --> 01:52:57,688
is this some like remote LFA so is there

1847
01:52:55,719 --> 01:53:02,860
a target LDP session involved here that

1848
01:52:57,689 --> 01:53:06,400
may occur or now the session between the

1849
01:53:02,860 --> 01:53:11,589
NB a direct link LD position right right

1850
01:53:06,400 --> 01:53:15,009
but for the backup path they decided

1851
01:53:11,590 --> 01:53:16,389
looking okay but is that one of the

1852
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:21,570
sessions you're worried about going down

1853
01:53:16,389 --> 01:53:21,570
or just the primary neighbor session

1854
01:53:21,749 --> 01:53:26,469
okay I just wanted to make sure that

1855
01:53:24,070 --> 01:53:35,169
that was the targeted LTP wasn't

1856
01:53:26,469 --> 01:53:38,219
involved before Ali pls P P really

1857
01:53:35,169 --> 01:53:41,610
converges over the BCD AE but and

1858
01:53:38,219 --> 01:53:41,610
traffic resumes

1859
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:51,490
the question now on Joseph you better

1860
01:53:48,980 --> 01:53:51,490
understand

1861
01:53:51,730 --> 01:54:01,099
so a detects the ring going down

1862
01:53:57,140 --> 01:54:04,160
so a sending an LSP taking into account

1863
01:54:01,100 --> 01:54:11,390
it's a SAS or OSPF and visa are ESPYs

1864
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:14,150
flooded to be be is recovering yeah but

1865
01:54:11,390 --> 01:54:17,720
at the same time if the link is going

1866
01:54:14,150 --> 01:54:31,429
down there is also an IP message sent by

1867
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:37,430
a yeah it's cool it could but when you

1868
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:40,790
say bearish when you say to freebie

1869
01:54:37,430 --> 01:54:43,490
receives link down event is it it's

1870
01:54:40,790 --> 01:54:46,670
local detection of detection of su

1871
01:54:43,490 --> 01:54:50,030
reception of the LSP from a no no it's a

1872
01:54:46,670 --> 01:54:59,990
local detection and yeah before it may

1873
01:54:50,030 --> 01:55:02,570
have received DSP from a but that's also

1874
01:54:59,990 --> 01:55:05,929
a possibility you don't have to wait for

1875
01:55:02,570 --> 01:55:08,840
be to detect locally the link if if it

1876
01:55:05,930 --> 01:55:10,520
be received via recipe from a you can

1877
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:13,490
also a convert because you don't have

1878
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:16,280
anymore fee to way connectivity okay

1879
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:21,670
just to clarify here when I talk about

1880
01:55:16,280 --> 01:55:24,590
bi actually mean LVP at B so these are

1881
01:55:21,670 --> 01:55:27,200
so the events from t1 to t4 are

1882
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:32,090
basically what is seen by LEP okay and

1883
01:55:27,200 --> 01:55:35,300
when you say B remove your SP do you

1884
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:42,760
assume that B is running out of control

1885
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:49,370
of LD P or independent Goatwhore be runs

1886
01:55:42,760 --> 01:55:57,320
okay does it remove the ALM or just via

1887
01:55:49,370 --> 01:55:59,300
via rewrite structure when you say VSP

1888
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:03,549
is just very right structure

1889
01:55:59,300 --> 01:56:07,010
or is it really i am so the boat boat

1890
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:09,320
LSPs as well as yeah but if so you are

1891
01:56:07,010 --> 01:56:22,220
assuming that it's running order control

1892
01:56:09,320 --> 01:56:28,130
LDP yeah it is ordered control if there

1893
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:30,890
is any question you can so these are the

1894
01:56:28,130 --> 01:56:35,210
possible solutions or clarifications

1895
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:37,340
that is being suggested so one needs to

1896
01:56:35,210 --> 01:56:40,130
relax the requirement of immediately

1897
01:56:37,340 --> 01:56:43,550
flashing labels when we receive a

1898
01:56:40,130 --> 01:56:46,630
shutdown notification shutdown

1899
01:56:43,550 --> 01:56:50,510
notification is basically a fatal error

1900
01:56:46,630 --> 01:56:52,850
and the other possible thing is here LDP

1901
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:56,090
needn't research session to neighbor

1902
01:56:52,850 --> 01:56:58,700
immediately under saving on detecting

1903
01:56:56,090 --> 01:57:01,600
allentown event that is when physical

1904
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:04,099
connectivity to pier goes down it may be

1905
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:13,250
reasonable to wait for LDP hello

1906
01:57:04,100 --> 01:57:15,140
adjacency to timeout and now question

1907
01:57:13,250 --> 01:57:17,360
can i common actually common is a Cisco

1908
01:57:15,140 --> 01:57:18,980
system so I look at your draft you

1909
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,410
haven't mentioned it here but I think

1910
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:23,919
that draft talks about these all this

1911
01:57:21,410 --> 01:57:29,480
problem statement in the context of gr

1912
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:34,270
RFC 2478 is this correct assumption

1913
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:38,120
understanding yes so what we basically

1914
01:57:34,270 --> 01:57:41,030
trying to say if the if LD P has a shed

1915
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:42,769
and and the bottom line was that it gets

1916
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:44,780
a shutdown message and you remove the

1917
01:57:42,770 --> 01:57:47,540
label bindings and because of that you

1918
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:49,969
know and you want it to basically a wide

1919
01:57:47,540 --> 01:57:51,740
shutdown message so from your draft it

1920
01:57:49,970 --> 01:57:54,230
is reading what are you odd that you

1921
01:57:51,740 --> 01:57:55,790
wanted to avoid your relax sending of

1922
01:57:54,230 --> 01:57:58,549
the shutdown message and that's why your

1923
01:57:55,790 --> 01:58:00,650
dog is also recommending update of 50:26

1924
01:57:58,550 --> 01:58:03,350
so one come and I will have it if this

1925
01:58:00,650 --> 01:58:05,360
is G in within the context of a gr I

1926
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:07,190
think it should be the gr procedure that

1927
01:58:05,360 --> 01:58:10,250
should be upgraded updated rather than

1928
01:58:07,190 --> 01:58:12,648
LD PBS procedures from 50:36 second

1929
01:58:10,250 --> 01:58:15,320
coming I will have it rather than

1930
01:58:12,649 --> 01:58:17,300
rather than you know blocking sending of

1931
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:19,969
the shutdown message if you look at look

1932
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:21,800
at ldpr SC 50 36 when you send a

1933
01:58:19,969 --> 01:58:25,099
shutdown message you can also send an

1934
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:27,800
extended status TLV that's good point

1935
01:58:25,099 --> 01:58:30,110
that can give extra information to the

1936
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:33,019
receiver so you can always basically

1937
01:58:30,110 --> 01:58:34,820
send an extended status you let receiver

1938
01:58:33,019 --> 01:58:36,379
know that you know you know shutting

1939
01:58:34,820 --> 01:58:37,820
down but this is a gr case you know you

1940
01:58:36,379 --> 01:58:40,039
you may wanna do whatever you want to do

1941
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:41,599
so instead of shedding you know blocking

1942
01:58:40,039 --> 01:58:43,459
shutdown message you should extend the

1943
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:51,769
shutdown message and use some eternity

1944
01:58:43,459 --> 01:58:53,539
away after discussions so now we are not

1945
01:58:51,769 --> 01:58:55,639
recommending blocking of shutdown but

1946
01:58:53,539 --> 01:58:57,820
I'm open to suggestions so whatever you

1947
01:58:55,639 --> 01:58:59,749
suggested then the draft I read is

1948
01:58:57,820 --> 01:59:02,629
different totally different then it's a

1949
01:58:59,749 --> 01:59:04,579
gr and all this that's what ya know dr

1950
01:59:02,629 --> 01:59:06,409
is still you know but yeah I agree with

1951
01:59:04,579 --> 01:59:07,728
your comments but if ye are specific I

1952
01:59:06,409 --> 01:59:09,860
think it should be the gia procedure

1953
01:59:07,729 --> 01:59:14,110
that should be upgraded northerly BBS

1954
01:59:09,860 --> 01:59:14,110
procedures okay

1955
01:59:14,919 --> 01:59:21,860
so we cut the queue after tarik so tarik

1956
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:25,639
with juniper we had conversation over

1957
01:59:21,860 --> 01:59:27,110
the mailing list and I think one of your

1958
01:59:25,639 --> 01:59:31,309
one of the possible solutions you're

1959
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:33,739
presenting is wait until the hello it's

1960
01:59:31,309 --> 01:59:36,559
timed out on their JCC and then react

1961
01:59:33,739 --> 01:59:40,098
and flush the labels remote labels that

1962
01:59:36,559 --> 01:59:43,399
you know B will get from a so if you go

1963
01:59:40,099 --> 01:59:48,229
back to your drawing you delay flushing

1964
01:59:43,399 --> 01:59:50,809
the labels on B until the hello times

1965
01:59:48,229 --> 01:59:53,209
out there are those times out is that

1966
01:59:50,809 --> 01:59:56,209
correct is that one of the possible

1967
01:59:53,209 --> 01:59:58,280
solutions you have okay let's say hello

1968
01:59:56,209 --> 02:00:00,769
times out and when you tear down the

1969
01:59:58,280 --> 02:00:03,949
session but you haven't received any

1970
02:00:00,769 --> 02:00:06,050
shadown message yet so you won't flush

1971
02:00:03,949 --> 02:00:09,409
the label mappings if the air is enabled

1972
02:00:06,050 --> 02:00:12,289
so you are concerned about two cases one

1973
02:00:09,409 --> 02:00:14,089
is reacting on link down and one another

1974
02:00:12,289 --> 02:00:21,349
one is they're reacting on a shut

1975
02:00:14,090 --> 02:00:24,590
message yes right yes okay so if you

1976
02:00:21,349 --> 02:00:25,699
delay the action until the hello times

1977
02:00:24,590 --> 02:00:28,590
out for

1978
02:00:25,699 --> 02:00:32,549
your solution you're okay with that

1979
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:35,010
right yes if it is but I don't think I

1980
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:38,040
see that's what how okay that's what I'm

1981
02:00:35,010 --> 02:00:41,580
gonna say next is I thought RFC 5036

1982
02:00:38,040 --> 02:00:45,030
does mention that so we might want to

1983
02:00:41,580 --> 02:00:47,670
reread that text and and see if they're

1984
02:00:45,030 --> 02:00:51,830
recommending waiting for the hellos to

1985
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:54,659
timeout before taking action okay so

1986
02:00:51,830 --> 02:00:57,449
this was actually seen in a customer

1987
02:00:54,659 --> 02:01:00,030
side and our reading was while it

1988
02:00:57,449 --> 02:01:01,049
suggests that it's a criteria of

1989
02:01:00,030 --> 02:01:03,030
bringing down session

1990
02:01:01,050 --> 02:01:06,389
it keeps options open to the

1991
02:01:03,030 --> 02:01:16,199
implementation but here we can discuss

1992
02:01:06,389 --> 02:01:18,420
more if okay thank you so the next step

1993
02:01:16,199 --> 02:01:21,540
Serbia we welcome reviews questions

1994
02:01:18,420 --> 02:01:25,849
suggestions and possibly working group

1995
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:29,519
adoption after discussion okay thanks

1996
02:01:25,849 --> 02:01:33,210
so that was the last presentation and we

1997
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:35,960
closed MPLS for society F meeting see

1998
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:35,960
