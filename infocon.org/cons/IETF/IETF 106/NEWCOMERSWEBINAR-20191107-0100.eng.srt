lay out where the IETF fits in this

23
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:24,060
whole ecosystem and then talk about what

24
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,490
the week will be like in Singapore in

25

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:42,649

30
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,820
sorry about that any questions no so the

31
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,170
first of two slides about the note well

32
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:00,658
um this describes the IETF policies of a

33
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,040
number of areas outside of the technical

34
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:06,900
specifications so it talks about patent

35
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,670
requirements ie

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,379
if you know any patents and you are

37
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,200
participating in the discussion you must

38
00:02:10,378 --> 00:02:15,689
disclose them we don't want to get you

39
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,988
know caught by submarine patents you

40
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:21,828
agree you understand that

41
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:26,189
proceedings the meetings are recorded

42
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:28,579
videotapes and so on is available on the

43
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:32,340
next slide please

44
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:34,140
um and then here are some of the details

45
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,379
about the specific policies and

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,779
practices that we follow the ITF is

47
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:45,268
known for a publication series known as

48
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:47,310
RFC's they started years ago 20-30 years

49
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:50,099
ago I guess is requests for comments

50
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,200
people joke now that means requests for

51
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,319
compliance

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:58,858
they do not NRC once it's published is

53
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:04,768
frozen so that if we change and revise

54
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:08,159
something such as a next version of TLS

55
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:14,069
TLS 1.2 became TLS 1.3 that's a separate

56
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:17,459
RFC HTTP 1.0 was you know 26 16 and so

57
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:20,668
on um however what we've done is on

58
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,319
layered on top of that a series of in

59
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:24,989
directions right like any computer

60
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,060
science problem so there's that's the BC

61
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:30,840
key best current practices series and

62
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:35,280
that will always point to the specific

63
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,159
RFC that is appropriate so ECP 9 will

64
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,489
point to a specific RFC I don't know the

65
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,760
number on that is how the standard

66
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,849
process works how the working groups

67
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,548
press then the last ones are about

68
00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:53,879
anti-harassment a code of conduct that

69
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:56,459
we expect on mailing lists and in the

70
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:58,260
face-to-face meetings copyright

71
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:04,109
considerations patents and so on

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:06,510
if you search for you know IETF BCP 54

73
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,919
you'll get a one of the search results

74
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,040
will show it point to the code of

75
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,169
conduct all of these are on the note

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,798
well link that you see there at the top

77
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,940
of the slide and in the slides and in

78
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:21,149
the note well they are actually

79
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,969
hyperlinks so that you can see read the

80
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:27,989
details on this is presented before

81
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:29,729
every working group meeting at the

82
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:32,400
meetings it's also present it's also

83
00:04:29,729 --> 00:04:34,380
mentioned or referred to when there are

around different tables the newcomers

105

you know someone speaking French is not

123
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:33,680
stuck with someone like me who could

124
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:35,150
only speak English and that there's a

125

second first ish IETF meeting for many

158
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,910
things the ITF considers the age of

159
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:17,070
majority similar to the voting age on is

160

is one of your first five meetings then

162
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:25,469
you can still consider yourself a

163
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,450

committed to read three internet drafts

167
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:38,669
and co-author a second a fourth one you

168
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:40,199
know you don't need any more help but we

169
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:43,890
try to be very welcoming we try to

170
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,690
really encourage people and in the main

171
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:47,699
the middle section

172
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:50,130
Karen will talk a lot about strategies

173
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,930
how to make the most of the meeting we

174
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:56,010
do remote participation as well as

175
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:58,770
in-person stuff this this presentation

176
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:01,860
will not talk about the history of the

177
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,449
IETF how do our standard things like

178
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,930
that

179
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:07,290
the IETF has a YouTube channel where you

180
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:10,290
can

181
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,680
all of the previous versions for many of

182
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,730
the previous versions of this tutorial

183
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:18,329
probably won't find too many different

184
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:21,990
speakers unfortunately as well as all of

185
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:24,720
the meeting sessions as well as all the

186
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,110
meeting sessions they are recorded by

187
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,970
the fine folks that need echo here we

188
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:36,030
should thank Tamiya for staying up the

189
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:37,950
2:00 a.m. over in Europe and so if you

190
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,480
have a conflict and you find that

191
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,640
there's two sessions you want to attend

192
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,770
that are done at the same time you can

193
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,410
attend one and then go back a couple

194
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:48,449
days later and watch the YouTube video

195
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,730
of that same session of the other

196
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,130
session that has the advantage that you

197
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:56,670
can you know speed it up when I do you

198
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,770
know one and a half times or skip whole

199
00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,510
sections if it's there's only if you're

200
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,160
only interested in one particular draft

201
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:06,410
you can skip to the parts you're

202
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:14,750
interested in next slide please

203
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:19,380
so talk about the ecosystem next slide

204
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,200
so the mission of the IETF and we have a

205
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,810
mission statement we want to make the

206
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,150
internet work better and the way we do

207
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,739
that is we are engineers for the most

208
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:34,140
part is you have some product managers

209
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:35,940
almost no sales people I don't think we

210
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,060
want to make the internet work better by

211
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:42,000
right by developing high quality

212
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:43,890
relevant technical documents we've

213
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,100
influenced the way people design use and

214
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:51,569
manage the Internet relevant meaning

215
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:54,210
we're not going to discuss how the

216
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,970
browser should lay out a file choice

217
00:10:54,210 --> 00:11:00,200
combo box you know that would be if

218
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:03,240
anywhere that might be in w3c

219
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,120
high-quality there's a process for how

220
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,970
they are how documents are developed and

221
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,560
published and become RFC's we can talk

222
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:13,470
about that you know during the week

223
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:18,000
you'll learn during the week or see us

224
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:20,940
one of us you know after after Sunday's

225
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,430
tutorial and

226
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,470
the key word I would take from the

227
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:27,979
sentences influence the way people

228
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:30,600
design use and manage the Internet

229
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:31,980
one of the phrases you'll hear mention

230
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,990
sometimes is something though

231
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,900
well what if people don't do this do it

232
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,830
this way and the answer is well we're

233
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:45,480
not the protocol police we have no

234
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:48,090
authority to to make people do things we

235
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:51,240
can influence them we can explain why

236
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,800
this is the best way but if they choose

237
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,810
to go another way there's nothing we can

238
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:59,189
do to stop that what we get is we get

239
00:11:54,810 --> 00:12:01,349
leverage from the fact that everyone on

240
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,380
the internet if it's a public standard

241
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,450
is you know derived from the rfcs

242
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,950
and so if you want to play along with

243
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:11,790
everyone else then you just have no

244
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:15,750
choice but to you know participate and

245
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:21,240
follow you know what the ITF does we are

246
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:23,730
not like the Uniform Commercial Code you

247
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,490
entry-level thing which describes how

248
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,700
international commerce should work in

249
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:31,530
with you know compliance a way to force

250
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,780
compliance under penalty of law or

251
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:40,530
something like that

252
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:42,569
next slide please so what is the ITF we

253
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,370
are an organization that we develop

254
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,940
standards SDIO standards development

255
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:52,040
organization self selected participants

256
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:55,350
it's all on into individual basis

257
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,069
company affiliation if any is given for

258
00:12:55,350 --> 00:13:01,320
identification purposes only so that you

259
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:04,980
can help remember that then at Akamai is

260
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,890
different from Ben Ben Campbell works

261
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,320
but yeah it's designed to identify and

262
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,340
it's also a way you can say oh hey looks

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,650
like you got a real job congratulations

264
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,230
and they still come for the idea um

265
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:18,120
there is no formal membership if you

266
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,910
want to participate in something in a

267
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,950
group for example you joined the mailing

268
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,449
list if there's many groups you want to

269
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:29,160
participate in you join all the mailing

270
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:33,230
lists there is no formal voting if you

271
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,949
look at say ISO which does voting by

272
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:38,460
country or news

273
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,650
State or ANSI which does it by corporate

274
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:43,140
membership or w3c which does it by

275
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:47,699
membership we don't have any of that

276
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,949
kind of voting we do consensus and we do

277
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,130
that by humming humming has a number of

278
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:54,540
neat properties you can't look to see

279
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:57,150
you something so you can't look to see

280
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,670
who else's hand is up and be influenced

281
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,910
by that it's hard to hum really really

282
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:05,610
loudly it's also you know kind of hums

283
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:07,560
at the same volume so when we say yes or

284
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:08,910
no when we hum appropriately you can

285
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,119
sort of stand almost anywhere in the

286
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:13,829
room and get a feel a good you know

287
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:17,160
rough consensus as to what the room

288
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:21,600
believes there is no final government

289
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,640
role there used to be obviously in the

290
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,060
domain system and so on and that's a

291
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:32,189
separate organization I can for a while

292
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:36,030
the DoD helped sponsor the IETF stuff

293
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:38,070
and provided a home for it but the US

294
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,880
government plays no role any different

295
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,100
than anybody else

296
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,720
we do have government people involved

297
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,130
we've seen people from the river

298
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,200
standards Institute from Georgia a lot

299
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:52,320
of you know Asian governments or banks

300
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:54,930
you know and go oh thanks then people

301
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:59,370
the u.s. DoD sends people but there are

302
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:02,040
as individuals participate our goal is

303
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,310
to develop a standard going that as

304
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:08,520
mentioned on the previous page that is

305
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:11,489
relevant and useful so if we define

306
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:14,069
standard and it's never deployed even if

307
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:15,240
it's the best specification ever that

308
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:17,940
will be treated as a failure

309
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:20,040
the real standard the real measure of

310
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:23,340
success is it's a standard that people

311
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:26,430
use as I said we're focused on Internet

312
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,400
technology capital I internet and it's

313
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:32,489
from the bottom up people who have

314
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,709
something they want to work on propose

315
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,620
it it gets accepted if it gets accepted

316
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:39,480
and then the coalition of people in the

317
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:40,800
working group will prepare documents and

318
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,740
it will flow its way up through the

319
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,170
working group through the area and up to

320
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,490
the IETF as a whole we're pretty unique

321
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,490
we're pretty proud of that

322
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:59,920
and I guess the next slide okay so the

323
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,810
ITF is divided into at the countless

324
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,790
number every time I see the slide seven

325
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:10,119
areas they tend to is occasionally

326
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:11,800
slight perturbation applications used to

327
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,070
be one real-time used to be another they

328
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,380
got merged this is what we would call an

329
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,850
eye chart there's a lot you know if you

330
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,220
imagine this being projected on a screen

331
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:23,020
at the front of the room it'd be lots a

332
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,510
really teeny tiny printing you have to

333
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,490
squint to read it I'm not going to go

334
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:30,810
through them I'll point out that the

335
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:33,880
operations area is people interested in

336
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:37,359
deployment and deployment of the

337
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:41,339
protocols what it's like to run a DNS

338
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:43,180
server what it's like to do routing and

339
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:45,339
that's different from the people

340
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,510
defining the routing protocols or

341
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:53,080
defining the DNS protocols security is

342
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:54,819
more of a horizontal area in that these

343
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,470
days everything has to have some kind of

344
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,089
security which means some kind of

345
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:00,880
cryptography encryption or

346
00:16:58,089 --> 00:17:04,959
authentication involved and then the

347
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:08,679
last one is the self referential the

348
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,959
medic this is where we work on things

349
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:16,079
that change the way the IETF itself

350
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:18,459
works well next slide

351
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,109
consensus so this is another one of the

352
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:25,030
truisms that IETF is like quotes rather

353
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,500
we reject Kings presidents and voting we

354
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:29,050
leave a rough consensus and running code

355
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:32,860
and the key point is that last phrase

356
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:34,960
rough consensus and running code over

357
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,610
the past few years when you've got added

358
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,890
more and more effort and more

359
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:40,959
participation in hackathons which

360
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,350
happened in the weekend before the

361
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,750
meeting Saturday Sunday there's a wiki

362
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:48,428
page which talks about the projects

363
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,020
people want to bring we've had

364
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:56,679
prototypes who've had TLS quick teeth

365
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:02,619
which is a connection protocol to talk

366
00:17:56,679 --> 00:18:05,509
to you know secure zone or SGX enclaves

367
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:07,009
many things happen there why bring your

368
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:09,099
laptop sit down with a group of people

369
00:18:07,009 --> 00:18:12,709
in the same area and start packing away

370
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:14,989
rough consensus means we listen to all

371
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:17,659
the opinions we don't have to

372
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:20,599
accommodate everybody and it's not

373
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:23,449
controlling that's different from say

374
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:27,168
other standards organizations where you

375
00:18:23,449 --> 00:18:28,609
know when you're doing voting if you

376
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:30,109
want to get everybody to vote on

377
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,029
something you end up with a standards

378
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:35,149
it's got well this seems kind of strange

379
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:36,949
but he wanted it right sort of like the

380
00:18:35,149 --> 00:18:38,869
US tax code they wanted this thing done

381
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:41,029
and they didn't want that thing yeah

382
00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:42,859
it's a lot of negotiation here we're

383
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:45,679
trying to focus solely on the sole on

384
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:48,289
technical merits and again the focus on

385
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,729
what most of the people in the group

386
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:55,279
feel the session chair is responsible

387
00:18:52,729 --> 00:18:59,929
for building or checking consensus area

388
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:01,579
directors will often step in on that the

389
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,699
meetings almost every time there's a

390
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:06,349
consensus discussion the chairs will

391
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:09,409
then say okay we'll confirm that on the

392
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:11,629
man list for the most part the mailing

393
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:13,339
lists for every working group or the

394
00:19:11,629 --> 00:19:16,129
place as the official record and the

395
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:19,279
place where all the trail the official

396
00:19:16,129 --> 00:19:21,228
decisions are taken into account and of

397
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,009
course there's an RFC on how to do

398
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:26,689
consensus and humming one thing you'll

399
00:19:25,009 --> 00:19:28,639
find is funniest people will just start

400
00:19:26,689 --> 00:19:30,919
out yeah hey if you considered how this

401
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:32,779
would be affected by RFC 2616 and

402
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,939
everyone else oh yeah right they know

403
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:38,769
all the numbers I don't know what the

404
00:19:34,939 --> 00:19:38,769
numbers next slide please

405
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:47,839
the culture you can see that the dress

406
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:49,369
code is pretty informal you means you

407
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,739
can wear whatever you are comfortable

408
00:19:49,369 --> 00:19:53,738
with in a professional environment

409
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:59,029
obviously there you know there's some a

410
00:19:56,689 --> 00:20:02,089
lot of people wear t-shirts a lot of

411
00:19:59,029 --> 00:20:06,559
people wear shorts or short skirts or

412
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:08,149
we're long skirts dashikis there are a

413
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,209
couple people who dress in three-piece

414
00:20:08,149 --> 00:20:13,879
suits all week it's whatever comfortable

415
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:16,310
with the key thing is technical

416
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:20,179
excellence is what we care about

417
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,919
we don't and we have close relationships

418
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:24,170
so the combination those first two

419
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,930
actually the combination the first

420
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:29,840
second and fourth means sometimes

421
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:31,250
they'll get some heated discussions you

422
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:34,970
know I've been working with you forever

423
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:38,420
and this just it doesn't affect you know

424
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:40,850
what the you know that decision you made

425
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,650
here is stupid we don't want to talk

426
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,990
like that one saying no that decision is

427
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:46,430
not good and here's why but these are

428
00:20:44,990 --> 00:20:50,480
people who many of them have been

429
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:52,310
working together for 25 plus years so

430
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,880
they can be frank they can speak in

431
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:58,159
shorthand don't be put off by it just so

432
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,020
you know listen and then if you have

433
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:06,350
something technical to say just please

434
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:08,120
by all means speak up next page the

435
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:12,949
alphabet soup so this is the ecosystem

436
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:19,280
in which the ITF works the ietf is that

437
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:20,810
blue circle on the right that is what we

438
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,710
think of as the ITF looks like cell

439
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,899
division each area and I mentioned there

440
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:30,290
seven of them working groups are all

441
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:33,280
within an area and they Pro that's where

442
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:36,680
the documents get published the iesg

443
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,350
internet Engineering steering group is

444
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:43,310
the technical leadership of the ITF and

445
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:46,100
has the all of their rfcs or would be

446
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:48,530
RFC's flow through the isg before going

447
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:52,040
out to the general membership mailing

448
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:58,129
list for word you know review or final

449
00:21:52,040 --> 00:22:00,260
comment is the IRT F also you can see on

450
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:02,960
the right on the left hand side the pink

451
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,970
square is there's the IRS G the internet

452
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,550
research steering group this is

453
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:09,740
analogous to the IETF but whereas the

454
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:10,580
ITF is working on standards and best

455
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,270
practices

456
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:16,340
the IRS G is working on research for

457
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:19,420
things that may be picked up by other

458
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:22,760
groups or may just be areas of interest

459
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:25,640
human rights and internet protocols is

460
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:29,140
sort of general interest crypto foreign

461
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,820
research group is defined is looking

462
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:32,440
cryptographic algorithms that are then

463
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,850
picked up and used by other things

464
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:38,830
he ll sing the black square on the top

465
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:42,879
first the IAB the red square bud has

466
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:46,560
general oversight of those other areas

467
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:49,620
and the LLC is the legal entity that

468
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:53,169
runs and hosts all of these other things

469
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:56,739
it didn't used to be a legal entity we

470
00:22:53,170 --> 00:23:00,280
used to be unaffiliated or an

471
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:03,520
unorganized organization on part of say

472
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:05,590
the Internet Society but that made hard

473
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,740
if the IETF wanted to sign a hotel

474
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:10,870
contract for 1200 people for a week we

475
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:14,530
needed a legal entity to do that as

476
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:17,080
opposed to relying on the I sock so we

477
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:19,270
have a formal legal entity now a limited

478
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,449
liability corporation particular type of

479
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:25,030
corporation you generally don't care

480
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:28,480
about it but it's the Board of Directors

481
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:32,110
is five people who sign the checks or

482
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:37,270
hire somebody to sign the checks next

483
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:39,280
slide I mentioned what they all do I

484
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:44,410
will just skip this in the interest of

485
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:47,440
time next slide and I guess we turn it

486
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:48,760
over to Karen now okay

487
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:53,020
so I'm going to talk a little bit about

488
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:55,480
what happens during an IETF week there's

489
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,530
and I'm going to hit these briefly and

490
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,980
then I'll go into a little bit more

491
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,960
detail in the subsequent slides there

492
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:05,230
are a number of organized events that

493
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,810
are on the agenda during the week first

494
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:09,670
the biggest and sort of the meet of the

495
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:13,480
meeting are all of the various working

496
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:15,430
group sessions as a significant subset

497
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,620
of the active working groups in the IETF

498
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:19,900
will meet during IETF week but not

499
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:21,399
necessarily all of them

500
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,890
there's also birds have feathers

501
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,440
sessions identified on the agenda you

502
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,390
know by the acronym by the acronym bof

503
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,440
and I'll talk a little bit more about

504
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:34,810
what those are rich mentioned the IRT F

505
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,380
as opposed to the IETF there will also

506
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:42,190
be in addition some number of research

507
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,830
groups meeting and those are identified

508
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,500
on the again

509
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:50,449
by the RG acronym on the agenda list

510
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:52,760
there are some area wide sessions we

511
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:57,350
talked about the IHF having various

512
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:58,760
areas the seven areas and each some of

513
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:00,860
those areas have meetings that are

514
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:03,710
across all of the working groups for the

515
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:08,658
whole area there's and then there's I H

516
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:10,549
F wide plenaries then there's the

517
00:25:08,659 --> 00:25:14,029
hackathon and code sprint activities and

518
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:17,080
the weekend prior there are various sets

519
00:25:14,029 --> 00:25:19,490
of social events and then there's also

520
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:21,230
tutorials sometimes there are deep dives

521
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:25,190
and sometimes there's various lunch

522
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:27,620
sessions there's the hot RFC lightning

523
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,830
talks which gives you sort of a really

524
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:33,439
quick introduction to new work that

525
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:35,000
people are considering and then there's

526
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,860
side meetings and open time and those

527
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,230
are all sort of organized official

528
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:40,789
events and then there's all the events

529
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:45,730
that are not organized

530
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:48,408
there's the hallway meetings barb offs

531
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:50,480
which are informal gatherings in various

532
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:51,919
places sometimes they'll get announced

533
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,320
on a mailing list sometimes there will

534
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,769
be a group of people that with

535
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:00,799
coordinating interests that get together

536
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:03,679
editing sessions on documents also there

537
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,850
is an app there is both an Android and a

538
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:11,000
an Apple iPhone version of the app it's

539
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:13,730
very helpful for you know figuring out

540
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,429
where meanings are and finding where it

541
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:19,100
has a map usually has a map of venues

542
00:26:16,429 --> 00:26:22,429
you can look at where your meeting is in

543
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,600
the context of that sort of and rich

544
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:25,880
we'll talk a little bit more later about

545
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,559
data tracker but you know that's sort of

546
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,880
your one-stop shop for everything that

547
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:34,809
you need to know about what's going on

548
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,549
ITF week and and that's available there

549
00:26:34,809 --> 00:26:40,730
so anyway specific starting with there's

550
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:42,110
working group sessions so if you recall

551
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,600
earlier the iesg

552
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:47,689
has areas and areas has working groups

553
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,090
each working group has a charter for the

554
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,059
work that would be done in the context

555
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:56,000
of that working group and the meeting

556
00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:56,660
that happens during the week depends

557
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,790
heavily on

558
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,900
where the working group is in that

559
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:04,340
charter they will be most of the work is

560
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,030
done on the mailing lists in between

561
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:11,360
meetings face-to-face meetings are tried

562
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:14,780
to be focused on solving key issues so

563
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,870
if there's you know often times that the

564
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:19,310
editor of the document or the author of

565
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,570
a document will get up and you know

566
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,399
these are the issues that have been

567
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:27,470
identified on the mailing list recently

568
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:30,080
that that that merit further discussion

569
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:33,320
or merit real-time conversation at that

570
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,990
point because all the sessions are

571
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:39,800
strained and recorded the technology

572
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:41,630
that you will use to do that is is meet

573
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:44,120
echo so all of the meet echo sessions

574
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:47,210
will be recorded and you can get to them

575
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:52,010
later and this is the bulk of the work

576
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:55,460
in the in the in the IETF now generally

577
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:57,070
speaking it's not going to be tutorials

578
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:59,780
about documents it's going to be

579
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:01,580
resolving issues on existing documents

580
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:06,080
or introducing new documents that the

581
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:08,090
working group may choose to adopt second

582
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,590
is birds of a feather session a little

583
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,000
bit later in this presentation we'll

584
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:13,909
talk a little bit about bringing new

585
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:20,240
work to the IETF birds of the feathers

586
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:22,760
sessions are the the historically the

587
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,820
the term comes from birds of a feather

588
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,500
flock together which basically means a

589
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:30,620
group of people interested in a similar

590
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:32,420
topic it often precedes the formation of

591
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:35,080
a working group so it's one of the steps

592
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:38,210
to getting a working group established

593
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,399
if that if it is a working group forming

594
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:42,380
birds of a feather session it will

595
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:45,160
include discussion of a proposed working

596
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:47,870
group Charter but sometimes it's not

597
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:50,900
sometimes it's it's for discussing other

598
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:53,449
types of topics we had a you know a

599
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,390
couple examples we had a birds of a

600
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:58,190
feather session one time on where to go

601
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,410
with the education and mentoring

602
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:03,080
activities in the nhf and we had another

603
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:04,520
one about you know network requirements

604
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:09,290
for the meeting Volf these are clearly

605
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:13,150
not working group meetings but they were

606
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:15,050
meetings that have broad applicability

607
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:16,880
generally a group of people that are

608
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:19,129
interested in a topic will propose it

609
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,900
and then the area directors will review

610
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:23,450
all of the proposals in advance of the

611
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,200
IETF and and choose which ones actually

612
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:29,090
get to me generally above only meets

613
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,340
once occasionally they'll they might

614
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:32,780
meet twice if if they get part of the

615
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,550
way through the chartering discussion

616
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:35,990
and they decide that you know they're

617
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:37,520
really not ready to charter a working

618
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:42,470
group then they go back and try one more

619
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:45,260
time next thing is the IRT F research

620
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:46,610
group sessions these are officially an

621
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:50,060
activity of the internet architecture

622
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:53,360
board they are more research topics as

623
00:29:50,060 --> 00:29:55,190
opposed it to engineering topics they

624
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,350
could as rich mentioned it could be

625
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,020
something like that the CFR G which is

626
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:02,629
the crypto one there's one on global

627
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:06,050
access global Internet access for all

628
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:11,720
Gaia which is really about global

629
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:14,570
Internet access there was one on deke

630
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,770
delay-tolerant networking there's

631
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:21,970
currently one on privacy they meet

632
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:26,389
during IETF meetings they're open to

633
00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:28,760
IETF attendees just like the regular

634
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:33,740
IETF working group meetings are there is

635
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,150
a RFC on a primer for for IETF

636
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:41,060
participants if you're interested in the

637
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:44,030
research angle of it area wide sessions

638
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:47,389
plenaries and invited talks so often the

639
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:50,090
areas will have meetings that are across

640
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:51,980
the whole area a good example of that is

641
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,970
the security area advisory group which

642
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:58,400
meets usually on Thursday after lunch

643
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,050
and this is a session that where you

644
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,060
might get a quick snapshot of all of the

645
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:04,159
working groups that are doing that are

646
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,720
in the security area or that are outside

647
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:10,090
of the security area that are doing

648
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:12,860
security work and then presentations of

649
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:15,830
material that is interest of interest to

650
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:18,110
the whole area or discussions of topics

651
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:21,260
that the security community in general

652
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:22,639
at the IETF need to have you know

653
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,650
transport area has one

654
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,660
I believe the applications area has one

655
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:32,690
as well and so those would be area wide

656
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:35,440
and then i hf wide generally is the

657
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:39,049
plenary there's two types of plenaries

658
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,160
that there's a technical plenary which

659
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:44,809
is generally chaired by the IAB there

660
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,470
may or may not be a technical plenary

661
00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:50,600
with any particular IETF meeting these

662
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,420
are generally focused on topics that are

663
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:57,649
of interest across the entire IAB I

664
00:31:53,420 --> 00:32:00,580
think across the entire IETF recently

665
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:05,419
we've had one on privacy for example

666
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:09,379
we've had one previously on global

667
00:32:05,419 --> 00:32:15,890
Internet access I think one time we had

668
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:17,929
one on automotive IOT types of topics I

669
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:21,500
don't believe there is a technical

670
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:25,580
plenary planned for this upcoming IETF

671
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:28,309
but often the two plenaries are held

672
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:30,500
together the second type of plenary is

673
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:33,200
the administrative plenary and that's

674
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:35,090
the one that basically goes is the

675
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,400
report out to the community about all of

676
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:41,990
the administrative aspects of the IETF

677
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:46,270
and then discussion about general

678
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:49,720
policies and administration of the IETF

679
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,799
at that plenary there's also a

680
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:53,809
question-and-answer session what they

681
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,970
call an open mic and you see the picture

682
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:58,520
on the lower right it says iesg open mic

683
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:01,100
it's an opportunity for the community

684
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,770
the IETF community to ask questions of

685
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,570
the of the three basic bodies of

686
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:10,870
leadership which is the administrator

687
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:14,080
for the LLC the IAB and then the iesg

688
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:17,989
so those are the plenaries

689
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,178
also there's if there's a host there

690
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:22,370
might be an invited lunch talk

691
00:33:20,179 --> 00:33:24,770
it's a brown-bag lunch so you have to

692
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,799
bring your own lunch but she usually

693
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:32,960
Thursday at lunchtime is the is the

694
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:35,120
invited speaker hackathons and code

695
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,410
sprints hackathons as rich mentioned

696
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:42,979
earlier is something we stir

697
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:45,310
a few years ago and these basically

698
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:47,690
anybody is open to bring a project

699
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:50,960
anybody who doesn't have a project as is

700
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,270
welcome to come and participate there's

701
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,910
no additional cost they do ask that you

702
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:57,980
sign up in advance and that's for you

703
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:02,870
know capacity and food planning purposes

704
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:06,170
and all of that the hackathon can be

705
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:07,969
topics that are something new that

706
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:10,520
people want to try to develop a little

707
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:14,960
bit before they perhaps bring it to the

708
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:18,590
IETF is the technology it might be the

709
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,600
working group it might be initial

710
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:25,880
implementations or interoperability

711
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,219
analysis of existing work in working

712
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,320
groups a number of working groups now

713
00:34:28,219 --> 00:34:34,219
are using the hackathon to help progress

714
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,400
their specifications and then it also

715
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:39,589
might be tools around the you know I

716
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:42,740
know that there was a hackathon project

717
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:46,370
recently on improving the Android app

718
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:48,620
for the IETF meeting separate from that

719
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:50,418
is the code sprint there's a whole set

720
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,029
of tools that are developed by the

721
00:34:50,418 --> 00:34:54,409
community for the IETF and there's a

722
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:56,270
team of developers that have

723
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:57,950
specifically been working on that for a

724
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:01,100
number of years and so if you're

725
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:03,080
interested in in approving tools or

726
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:05,450
working on data track or doing any

727
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,580
number of things related to that then

728
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:10,100
that's part of the code sprint both of

729
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:13,400
those the code sprint is on Saturday

730
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:14,930
PACA thon is on Saturday and Sunday and

731
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,730
it's a great way especially for

732
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:19,790
newcomers the hackathon is a great way

733
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,650
to to come in and sort of get your feet

734
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:27,620
wet with the community in a small way

735
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:32,060
before you jump in next is networking in

736
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,859
social events depending on the host and

737
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,870
a number of other factors there may or

738
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:38,120
may not be a social event there is one

739
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,819
in Singapore it will be on Tuesday

740
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:43,759
evening generally there's a ticket

741
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,150
attached to that it's to cover some of

742
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,150
the cost

743
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,730
and those tickets sometimes can turn

744
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:53,890
into hot items depending on how big the

745
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:59,320
the capacity plant how big the venue is

746
00:35:53,890 --> 00:36:03,400
for the social but it's usually it's a

747
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:07,090
nice opportunity to have you know an

748
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:11,920
evening out with seven to nine hundred

749
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:14,190
of your colleagues there's also a

750
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,390
networking there there is a organization

751
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:18,190
it's not really an organization it's

752
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:20,980
more like a mailing list and a list

753
00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:25,060
collective of folks called the sisters

754
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:26,800
sisters is a is basically just a way for

755
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:31,710
the the women of the IETF to meet each

756
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,940
other we're focused on on helping women

757
00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:35,980
connect with each other and be more

758
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,200
effective in the ITF particularly

759
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:41,380
interested in in supporting newcomers in

760
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,020
whatever way we can on the current

761
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:47,530
agenda for this ITF there is a sister's

762
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:49,630
lunch on Thursday and we've also added a

763
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,770
breakfast networking event earlier in

764
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:54,970
the week I believe it's on Monday

765
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:56,440
morning there's a link later on to join

766
00:36:54,970 --> 00:37:00,819
the sisters mailing list if you want

767
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:03,880
more information about that and then

768
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:07,360
there's side meetings and this is open

769
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,280
time it's it's basically it's an ongoing

770
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:13,060
agenda experiment to figure out how to

771
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,480
make IETF meetings more productive and

772
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,100
get make better use of our time those

773
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,900
meetings are not going to show up on the

774
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:22,779
main agenda they're gonna be in this

775
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,700
wiki and so you you can go in there and

776
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,130
see what meetings anybody can propose a

777
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:29,589
meeting and sign up for space obviously

778
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,840
there's their space limitations nine of

779
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:35,650
the last two meetings where they did

780
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:37,390
this the side meetings filled up the

781
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:39,010
first time they did this it was in like

782
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:42,190
an afternoon like a Wednesday afternoon

783
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:44,890
but they changed it and so the last time

784
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:46,990
and this time as well it's it's in the

785
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,580
mornings before the session starts oh

786
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:51,129
there's there's opportunity for side

787
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:52,690
meetings I mean you can organize your

788
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:55,900
own side meeting any time you want but

789
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:57,340
if you want space you know if you want

790
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,620
to be able to get a meeting room that's

791
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,359
provided by the IHF thing this is the

792
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:04,180
way to do that

793
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:09,490
there are some tutorials generally there

794
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:10,930
on Sunday afternoon the this time

795
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,930
there's the newcomers over here which is

796
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:18,308
this tutorial and then there's also a

797
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:20,319
tutorial on service discovery and then

798
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:22,480
the last couple idf's we've had an

799
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,269
experiment on deep dives which has taken

800
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,029
a specific technical topic and delving

801
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:29,799
into it a little bit more deeply this

802
00:38:28,029 --> 00:38:32,529
time it's not actually a technical topic

803
00:38:29,799 --> 00:38:34,089
and it's not actually a deep dive but

804
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:36,549
that timeslot on Tuesday morning is

805
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:39,970
being used for the evolution of the RFC

806
00:38:36,549 --> 00:38:42,880
series editor module and I specific I

807
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:45,430
mentioned lightning talks earlier if you

808
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,130
attend other conferences you know the

809
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:50,788
concept of a lightning talk is usually

810
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:54,670
like five minutes or less that basically

811
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:56,049
gets you a little bit of exposure here's

812
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,029
something I'm interested in here's an

813
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:59,349
idea that I have and if you're

814
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:01,089
interested in working with me further

815
00:38:59,349 --> 00:39:05,079
discussing this further here's how you

816
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:06,519
contact me and so it is a good way to

817
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,160
see what other people are thinking about

818
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:10,180
it's also a good way if you are

819
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,618
interested in trying to find the right

820
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:13,509
people at the IETF and you have some

821
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:16,690
ideas and you can you could propose a

822
00:39:13,509 --> 00:39:19,809
lightning talk and it's Sunday evening

823
00:39:16,690 --> 00:39:25,210
from 6 to 8 p.m. it's turned into a very

824
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:27,869
useful and productive activity so

825
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:31,089
general meeting etiquette

826
00:39:27,869 --> 00:39:33,579
obviously you can't follow everything

827
00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:35,170
but it's most people come to the IETF

828
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,420
interested in one or two of the working

829
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:39,009
groups so you want to join the mailing

830
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:41,289
list you want to read the mailing list

831
00:39:39,009 --> 00:39:42,609
and then you want to read the documents

832
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:46,150
of interest before the working group

833
00:39:42,609 --> 00:39:48,970
sessions and that'll mean that any

834
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:54,400
questions that you ask would be informed

835
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:56,348
by that and we want you to behave

836
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,319
respectfully and tolerantly towards all

837
00:39:56,349 --> 00:40:00,940
participants IETF is a global

838
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:02,739
organization people come from a lot of

839
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:10,390
different backgrounds and and cultures

840
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:13,480
and you know I think the what the Oasis

841
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:16,480
the Jon Postel quote about you know

842
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:19,540
being generous and being careful in what

843
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,210
you you know generous and what you

844
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,680
receive and careful what you send I just

845
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:28,119
got it wrong but I can't think of it

846
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,410
right now but basically you know be

847
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:34,329
respectful talk and listen to people

848
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:36,759
sometimes you know some IETF people can

849
00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:40,060
appear a little bit gruff but in general

850
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,650
there are they're very approachable and

851
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:43,299
these are people that are very

852
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:45,490
passionate about their work and they're

853
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:47,109
they're very interested in in working

854
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:49,839
with people and talking to people that

855
00:40:47,109 --> 00:40:51,970
are interested in their work so enjoy

856
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,320
yourself and remember to sleep because

857
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,540
it can be a long week so just as an

858
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:05,980
extra slide on bringing new work to the

859
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:13,440
IETF they the first step is you know you

860
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:16,030
have your idea there you have your idea

861
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,290
or the thing that you are interested in

862
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:19,180
approaching so the first thing you

863
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:21,460
really need to do is to sort of expand

864
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:23,470
your collaborators outside of your core

865
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:24,700
group so you want to find some

866
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:28,919
collaborators that have a similar

867
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:30,910
interest and discuss the idea with them

868
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:33,040
then you want to write some initial

869
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:38,649
drafts maybe maybe have some barb offs

870
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,480
and this is all about developing sort of

871
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:42,369
a critical mass of people that think

872
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:46,270
this is a good idea and the time is

873
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:51,609
right to do it if you you know if you

874
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:53,380
come along you know for example if you

875
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:55,810
come along and something is really far

876
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:57,160
down the pike then coming into the

877
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,869
working group and saying well I think

878
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,000
this is a really bad idea we should

879
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:04,030
start over from scratch it's probably

880
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,089
not going to be well-received but if you

881
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:08,890
have you know a new idea that's not

882
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:13,480
really currently covered then that that

883
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:17,680
might be very well received so once you

884
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,480
have you know a solid idea you have a

885
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,520
little bit of documentation you're able

886
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,170
to clearly articulate your idea then you

887
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:25,329
want to talk to the area directors in

888
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:26,930
the relevant area they might send you to

889
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:28,970
something called dispatch

890
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,490
some work some areas now have set up a

891
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:35,078
process or a working group called the

892
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:39,470
dispatch working group which is a way to

893
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:42,230
quickly decide you know if somebody

894
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:43,848
brings in a draft does this draft you

895
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:45,380
know is it something that needs a new

896
00:42:43,849 --> 00:42:47,150
working group is it something it could

897
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:49,790
be covered by an existing working group

898
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:52,430
is it something that we could do in the

899
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:53,720
area you know without actually forming a

900
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,839
working group is is something that's

901
00:42:53,720 --> 00:43:00,529
fairly straightforward to do so that is

902
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:04,578
a process to help expedite those kinds

903
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:06,530
of discussions once you get to that

904
00:43:04,579 --> 00:43:09,800
point then proposing you know propose a

905
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:12,020
charter you need the drafts you need a

906
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,980
charter you can need an agenda for a

907
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:17,839
boss and then execute on the boss and

908
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:20,900
then depending on the outcome of the

909
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,750
boss would depend on what the next steps

910
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:26,059
would be there is a tutorial that was

911
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,859
recently done on bringing new work to

912
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:29,329
the IETF and the slides in the video

913
00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:33,460
ranker right there I'd strongly

914
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:40,339
encourage you to take a look at that and

915
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:42,380
ietf session etiquette speak speak

916
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:44,869
directly into the microphone all of

917
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:47,089
these meetings are you know have remote

918
00:43:44,869 --> 00:43:49,099
participants and they are recorded and

919
00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:51,770
so speaking into the microphone is very

920
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:53,750
important so being people that stand up

921
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:55,430
and aren't in the microphone you know

922
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:59,059
anybody who's remote it's not going to

923
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:00,348
be able to hear them say your name every

924
00:43:59,059 --> 00:44:02,599
time you speak at the microphone

925
00:44:00,349 --> 00:44:06,890
generally goes microphone say you know

926
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:09,260
I'm Karen and Karen O'Donoghue and go

927
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:11,598
from there there will be blue sheets and

928
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:14,150
this is a record of who is in the room

929
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:16,569
remote participants also get recorded

930
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:21,079
when you signed on for this meeting you

931
00:44:16,569 --> 00:44:23,630
provided your name this is important for

932
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,880
a number of reasons and the blue sheets

933
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:29,049
are scanned and become part of the

934
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,049
permanent record of the meeting

935
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:34,910
technical comments and questions are

936
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,150
welcome obviously you know time is of

937
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:40,140
the essence then so short quite um you

938
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:44,309
know concise

939
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:45,868
questions especially questions that you

940
00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:47,759
know if you have a question more than

941
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:52,579
likely somebody else in the room has the

942
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:56,219
question as well but not a question like

943
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:57,989
tell me how this works again you know a

944
00:44:56,219 --> 00:45:00,630
question along the lines of you know I

945
00:44:57,989 --> 00:45:03,119
see that you've decided to do this this

946
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:07,019
way did you consider this other way that

947
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,150
would be a way there is a jabber channel

948
00:45:07,019 --> 00:45:10,828
to discuss meeting rel relevant topics

949
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,190
that you could use to ask questions as

950
00:45:10,829 --> 00:45:16,890
well and we'll talk a little bit more

951
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:19,529
about jabber later on this can be it's a

952
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:23,279
back-channel way of you know discussing

953
00:45:19,529 --> 00:45:24,779
both the meeting and also the you know

954
00:45:23,279 --> 00:45:26,910
the technical topics of the meeting and

955
00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:29,459
then also you know like the audio is not

956
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,229
working or you know those kinds of

957
00:45:29,459 --> 00:45:40,109
things are also sometimes discussed in

958
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:42,348
there and with that resources rich sorry

959
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:45,569
I was yes okay

960
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:48,529
closing in on the last third here okay

961
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:51,150
so the key people are the Secretariat

962
00:45:48,529 --> 00:45:53,630
mentioned them before and we've mixed

963
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:55,769
them a couple times this is a

964
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:59,940
professional organization that is

965
00:45:55,769 --> 00:46:02,368
employed by the IETF you'll recognize

966
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:07,109
them by throughout the week they'll all

967
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:10,619
be wearing blue polo shirts they know if

968
00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:12,509
you have a question they're possibly the

969
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:15,749
first people non-technical question as

970
00:46:12,509 --> 00:46:17,910
in where can I find this room or you

971
00:46:15,749 --> 00:46:19,348
know that Grand Ballroom is way too hot

972
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:19,920
everybody's sweating and taking off

973
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:22,709
their shirts

974
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,920
um Secretariat is the people to talk to

975
00:46:22,709 --> 00:46:27,149
first by the end of the week at the end

976
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,609
of the week at the last day is their

977
00:46:27,150 --> 00:46:31,199
starting to take down everything though

978
00:46:29,609 --> 00:46:32,848
I'll be wearing Hawaiian shirts but

979
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,029
they're really very friendly very

980
00:46:32,849 --> 00:46:37,670
professional and know everything or can

981
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:41,969
point you to everything about how the

982
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:49,349
meeting or conference itself runs next

983
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:52,229
page the RC editor Ana staff these

984
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:53,940
people will have tables at this in the

985
00:46:52,229 --> 00:46:55,560
same room that

986
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:57,210
registration is so when you know when

987
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:59,460

maintain the registries which say for

1004
00:47:49,230 --> 00:48:00,750
example HTTP is TCP port 80 DNS is UDP

1005
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,380
port 53 and then also in within things

1006
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,640
such as

1007
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:07,770

for TLS they just do all of the

1009
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:11,759
secretarial work for doing that to make

1010
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:15,210
sure that people don't trump on each

1011

the IETF corporation we had an interim

1023
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,700

1024
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:56,520
professional executive director not

1025
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:59,839

1027
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:06,150

was funny the first time I saw it and

1092
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:56,279
now I've seen it four times so the

1093
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:59,210
ribbons are less useful except if you're

1094
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:03,810
looking for a particular thing and the

1095
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:08,060

1101
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:26,310
reasonably short document handful of

1102
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,520
pages that describes some of the history

1103
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:31,980
and how things are done within there

1104
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:34,470
it's informal it was just recently

1105
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:39,060
revised by somebody who had been

1106

1110
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,450

00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:52,380
ticket - social ticket have a social

1150
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:56,729
ticket cell how do I get a SIM card and

1151
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:59,250
so on local the local hosts read that

1152
00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:01,859
and the wiki pretty well so that you can

1153
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:10,410
get your questions answered by local

1154
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:13,880
experts next slide two websites count

1155
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:16,500
are important is that as Karen mentioned

1156
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:19,319
data tracker got IETF Thorg

1157
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:22,140
can also be repeated DT data I eat after

1158
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:25,200
or look on the left sample page on the

1159
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:27,660
right it has web pages for every single

1160
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:29,040
working group within every single group

1161
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:31,828
there is a list of what it's about

1162
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,079
pointers to the mailing lists and then

1163
00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:36,119
the big thing is a list of documents and

1164
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,800
their status so you can see you know

1165
00:55:36,119 --> 00:55:39,720
it's kind of hard to read on my screen

1166
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,339
but you can see that oh this document

1167
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,848
has been progressed as waiting for the

1168
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:48,330
ROC editor as you get more involved and

1169
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:53,010
hopefully will in writing drafts

1170
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:54,750
so on you might be fools Paige just

1171
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:56,610
mentioned that it exists it has all

1172
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:58,500
sorts of interesting statistics about

1173
00:55:56,610 --> 00:56:00,090
how many are which are our C's are

1174
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,250
mentioned the most and things like that

1175
00:56:00,090 --> 00:56:06,390
in which people have wanted the most

1176
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:08,610
RFC's kind of fun as well as the data

1177
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:12,810
conversion tools from XML or mark down

1178
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:15,170
to the RFC publication for that next

1179
00:56:12,810 --> 00:56:15,170
slide please

1180
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:23,210
remote participation we you don't have

1181
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:25,500
to attend Faced you don't have to attend

1182
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:28,200
certainly the novella meetings which are

1183
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:30,510
typically in Asia tend to be more

1184
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:33,330
inconvenient for large portions of the

1185
00:56:30,510 --> 00:56:35,610
attendees I'm you can attend remotely

1186
00:56:33,330 --> 00:56:38,790
every working group will have an online

1187
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:41,850
video conference set up like this run by

1188
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:45,860
me taka our organizer here is to buy it

1189
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:48,540
the third one on the right from the left

1190
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:52,260
we support remote attendants we have

1191
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:53,550
jabber as Karen mentioned not the next

1192
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:55,590
slide we'll talk a little bit more about

1193
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:58,230
that and the media Co is just a browser

1194
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:59,420
based video conferencing communication

1195
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:04,080
chatroom and so on

1196
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:08,010
next slide please the network hit the

1197
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:10,200
ITF is something else we run our own

1198
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:12,870
network we make arrangements with the

1199
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:15,870
local telecom company we bring in you

1200
00:57:12,870 --> 00:57:18,000
know all sorts of least temporary leased

1201
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:21,180
lines we run it through out the whole

1202
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:26,160
IETF hotel usually at this time so tell

1203
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:28,319
in the overflow there are there's a

1204
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:33,420
whole bunch of network IDs that are

1205
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:35,820
available ITF ITF 64 if you do ipv6 all

1206
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:37,800
of the secure networks or user IETF

1207
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:41,460
password IETF the point is not for

1208
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:43,350
authenticate but encryption there's a

1209
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,420
helpdesk in the registration area

1210
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:47,970
there's a quiet room we used to call the

1211
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:50,430
terminal room it no longer has terminals

1212
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:52,399
but it's got power ethernet activity and

1213
00:57:50,430 --> 00:57:54,930
there's a way to enter service tickets

1214
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,530
if you have problems with the network or

1215
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,009
anything else speeding up goes around

1216
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,310
the time

1217
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:01,310
next

1218
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:10,119
gabber XMPP is a messaging protocol

1219
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:12,160
instant messaging chat get a client get

1220
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,780
an account there's a couple places which

1221
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,509
to do it

1222
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:19,900
for basically every working group is

1223
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:21,970
kind of mentioned the DNS op working

1224
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:24,040
group will be DNS op at jeopardy

1225
00:58:21,970 --> 00:58:26,669
template or it gets a chatroom

1226
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:29,130
it's where remote people can people

1227
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:32,170
participating remotely can ask questions

1228
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:34,599
it's where they describe locally will

1229
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,070
say who's speaking and what page it is

1230
00:58:34,599 --> 00:58:39,730
that's why it's important to state your

1231
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:45,160
name every time you come to the mic next

1232
00:58:39,730 --> 00:58:47,260
slide so I think this is final one enjoy

1233
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,990
yourself all the smiling happy faces

1234
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:51,760
here the picture of fireworks was one of

1235
00:58:49,990 --> 00:58:53,319
the prog meetings where we actually at

1236
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:53,890
the end of the social event they had

1237
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:57,670
fireworks

1238
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:59,618
I was pretty really impressive it's a

1239
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:04,060
fun time it's an exhausting time you

1240
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:06,490
relieve leave your head fun and

1241
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:09,940
hopefully lots of scribbles and notes

1242
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:12,848
and follow-up things to do to meet with

1243
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:15,819
and talk with new colleagues look

1244
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:18,190
forward to meeting many of you and I

1245
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:21,279
think we're just about out so I'm not

1246
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:23,680
repaired with questions if you if

1247
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,550
there's things we missed either as you

1248
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:29,520
figure it out during the week

1249
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:32,109
contact us an edgy team in today's team

1250
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,339
Thursday mornings a feedback session and

1251
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:38,049
really would like a survey for this is a

1252
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:40,599
survey specifically for the newcomers

1253
00:59:38,050 --> 00:59:42,430
we'll have a general the Secretariat

1254
00:59:40,599 --> 00:59:44,740
will run a general survey after the

1255
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:47,259
meeting for all attendees to talk about

1256
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:49,089
things like the open time what was it

1257
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,680
like how many conflicts did you notice

1258
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:52,060
in terms of wounding one other would

1259
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:57,009
tend to different meetings at the same

1260
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:58,420
time and so on all right I think that

1261
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:59,589
brings us to the end I don't know if

1262
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:01,300
there's any questions I've been

1263
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:05,619
monitoring the chat and I haven't seen

1264
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:07,780
any questions show up I did post in the

1265
01:00:05,619 --> 01:00:11,609
chat this look the link to the slides

1266
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:11,609
these slides are available online

1267
01:00:12,390 --> 01:00:20,009

1268
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:23,160

1269
01:00:20,009 --> 01:00:27,029
