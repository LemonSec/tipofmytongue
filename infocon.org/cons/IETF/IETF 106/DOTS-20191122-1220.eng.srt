00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:20,140
[Music]

2
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,140
so shall we start

3
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:31,369
hello everybody its dot walking group

4
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:33,379
session and I'm sure everybody is tired

5
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:37,310
it's the last session of the week but

6
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:41,540
let's let's concentrate

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:44,630
so first I'm your your speaking here

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:48,980
today because Frank worked so hard that

9
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:52,480
she caught it cold and get most his

10
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:57,669
voice so I think I think he'll recover

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:01:01,640
wish you so can you hear me

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,430
so you know what happened yeah it's very

13
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,920
sexy so I don't want to frighten you so

14
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,590
I try to keep silent but if necessary I

15
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,840
still wait a comment something ok so

16
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:22,850
please forgive me it's forward sorry so

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:27,770
I'm gonna speak in here today well so

18
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:28,939
this is not well just I think everybody

19
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:31,908
if you knows about it

20
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:36,619
just look look at look again it's it--if

21
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:42,560
action so oh oh we would you will say

22
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:46,060
today it's a subject for note well we

23
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:51,979
have a couple of administrative tasks

24
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:54,649
blue sheets going around I think they're

25
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:56,950
somewhere in the room and we need Java

26
00:01:54,649 --> 00:02:05,109
scribes and no takers

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:09,969
so anyway lunches okay thank you

28
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:09,969
and the job is correct

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:30,959
well I jump is crap no volunteer okay

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,959
thank you

31
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:46,349
so or group draft status so from the

32
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:50,680
last meeting we have some progress on

33
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:55,470
the signal channel draft it got stuck

34
00:02:50,680 --> 00:03:00,720
for quite a long time with disgust from

35
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:05,440
transport area and director but recently

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,690
there is some progress and there were

37
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,299
some suggestions from Carsten Borman and

38
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:14,560
just they were accepted by the draft

39
00:03:10,299 --> 00:03:16,870
authors so I hope the draft will be

40
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:22,260
progress after that and it will be

41
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:28,449
discussed today the changes then we have

42
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:32,319
to draft go home and several discoveries

43
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:34,480
that have just passed working group last

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,760
call and they are waiting for right up

45
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:48,608
to be sent to IHG for publication we've

46
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:50,980
also have draft dirtiest cases and dot

47
00:03:48,609 --> 00:03:55,030
architecture that have already been sent

48
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:59,730
to ICS are waiting for our ID to review

49
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:06,639
it review them and to move them further

50
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:08,948
so overall there is some good a mountain

51
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:15,609
of TVG in the working group since the

52
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:19,299
last session so our agenda for today we

53
00:04:15,609 --> 00:04:22,690
have several presentations I think that

54
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:32,080
will start the coding well any button

55
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:36,880
about agenda any suggestions okay then

56
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,810
we start with dots telemetry relating

57
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,810
hackathon activities

58
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,710
I'm kinda mean she's got from NTT

59
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:15,180
communications this weekend I joined the

60
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:20,359
IETF hackathon then I did things about

61
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:24,779
the territory then the target was

62
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:29,009
territory draft written by Tyrion meadow

63
00:05:24,779 --> 00:05:32,119
and other members then the target was

64
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:35,430
target target was preliminary

65
00:05:32,119 --> 00:05:38,490
implementation and POC of Daughtery

66
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:43,639
Matauri however I found at that time

67
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:47,129
that there the draft needs a lot of

68
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,610
clarification so I've tried it but at

69
00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:55,469
most the most works at that time was a

70
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:57,749
design review of dots telemetry think I

71
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:01,229
just be summary of design of the

72
00:05:57,749 --> 00:06:04,860
parameter II that purpose is giving the

73
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:07,589
maximum capability of conveying normal

74
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,319
and attack traffic really related

75
00:06:07,589 --> 00:06:14,180
metrics as a hint

76
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:20,249
Roma dot client server and server to

77
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:22,919
dock quiet so the timing of geometry can

78
00:06:20,249 --> 00:06:25,709
be divided into two these two timings

79
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,709
first one is pre mitigation and second

80
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:31,680
one is post mitigation so other

81
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:34,709
primitive Asian what is the prim it

82
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,519
acacia so the division of limitation

83
00:06:34,709 --> 00:06:39,119
telemetry

84
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:42,029
is here limitation resources are not

85
00:06:39,119 --> 00:06:45,809
bound to any mediation request because

86
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:48,300
it is before mitigation any before which

87
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:52,889
is a request so you are new you are a

88
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:57,769
past telemetry is defined in that draft

89
00:06:52,889 --> 00:07:02,490
then the first 2.0 telemetry config and

90
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:05,189
total metrics can be set beforehand so

91
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,120
it will not be frequently updated

92
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:12,060
however I found that attack detail can

93
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,820
be updated most more

94
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:19,680
frequently because it is the update of

95
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:23,730
current status of attacks so my proposal

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,490
is separate the URI path of them into

97
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:28,890
two so that update of attack detail

98
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:34,280
doesn't always require configure

99
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:36,930
configuration related update so hit the

100
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:39,479
proposal you are your thoughts it

101
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:42,750
indicates that elemetary config so

102
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:47,460
telemetry config includes the telemetry

103
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:51,510
coffee itself and the total reacted

104
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:54,780
metrics like baseline of the traffic and

105
00:07:51,510 --> 00:08:00,650
capacity total capacity from viewpoint

106
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:03,989
of dot client so get delete we work with

107
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:07,140
like this written that's right

108
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:12,300
then theoretically it works well with

109
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:15,630
tcid time to reconfigure identifier so

110
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:19,380
in this spec I dropped the attack detail

111
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:24,260
then DT this will be in the separated

112
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:27,540
URL path but before that I'd like to

113
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,580
other consideration related to machine

114
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:32,610
learning applause machine learning

115
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,960
approach is already written in the

116
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:38,190
territory draft

117
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:40,650
however the specification current

118
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,990
specification only care about the first

119
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:46,829
point so assigning the normal traffic

120
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:51,240
baseline status coracle created at

121
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:54,900
taught client however the second one is

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:59,370
more machine learning based approach I

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:09:04,350
think and I mean if you use the Machine

124
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:07,140
growing approach not client need to send

125
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:12,480
the traffic metrics periodically to the

126
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:16,410
dot server then dot server can do the

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:20,670
status status car learning in order to

128
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:24,329
learn the normal traffic of normal

129
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:26,709
traffic or normal matrix of geometry

130
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,269
metric so

131
00:09:26,709 --> 00:09:34,540
in order to accomplish it the

132
00:09:31,269 --> 00:09:40,720
requirement to the dot client is sending

133
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:45,069
the metrics in periodic manner so as a

134
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:49,120
primitive agent you are a path I like to

135
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:53,110
propose the normal traffic module in

136
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:58,060
addition to otaku detail then third and

137
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:01,240
gate undelete will be used for conveying

138
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:05,380
the current information of attack and

139
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,310
normal traffic from dot crier they now

140
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:12,250
get under it is so written here however

141
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:15,130
here is a note so if the agents and the

142
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:17,560
traffic metrics I do need to be compared

143
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:21,459
with other approaches like the IP fix

144
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:24,819
however I think those metrics is worth

145
00:10:21,459 --> 00:10:33,579
to be conveyed in dots in each other or

146
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:36,009
they tutorial get you if we are relying

147
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:38,439
on sending traffic metrics periodically

148
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:41,680
I suggest we rely on existing protocols

149
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:45,250
like ipv6 IP fix and not reinvent

150
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,349
something right the only reason why dot

151
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:50,110
signal channel was picked because it

152
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,089
would send the baseline behavior what's

153
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:54,430
normal behavior of the traffic that it

154
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,959
would see in high low and medium person

155
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:57,609
profile but what if it is supposed to

156
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,130
send traffic or performance metrics

157
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:01,990
periodically then we should be using

158
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,170
other protocols like ActiveX which is

159
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,389
already designed for that purpose and

160
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:11,800
most of the network devices support IP

161
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:15,120
fix already right so if you want to use

162
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,709
the telemetry details periodically then

163
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,350
if you see today menu of the network

164
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:23,349
devices send IP fix traffic to DDoS

165
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:27,310
detection system for identifying

166
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:28,810
anomalous traffic right so I don't think

167
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:31,649
we should be doing what IP fix is

168
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:35,649
already doing in this trap

169
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:40,540
okay about that way I agree with that

170
00:11:35,649 --> 00:11:43,769
but if it could be conveyed with dots

171
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:52,620
each other then it can be easily

172
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:55,570
combined into the context of dots so yes

173
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,610
through here but it's it's not stopping

174
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:59,260
us to use IP fix right I mean IP fix

175
00:11:57,610 --> 00:12:03,040
also uses client server authentication

176
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,589
and it's pretty much the the dots client

177
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,170
that Connect is a client and send the IP

178
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:10,420
fix telemetry back to the zoo all right

179
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:12,760
I'm going to say if it's already use a

180
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,740
template for defining the telemetry

181
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:16,779
attributes the network attributes and

182
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,850
the template can be easily changed on

183
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:20,800
the fly right IP fix has various

184
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:27,700
advantages we should not try to reinvent

185
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:31,750
a new protocol for that okay I think you

186
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:34,269
kind of make sense sorry so can I

187
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:37,000
confirm to you that you want to maybe

188
00:12:34,269 --> 00:12:39,490
you want something like the IP fixed

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,420
element which can be also conveyed by

190
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:45,390
the DOS

191
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:52,510
China protocol is that your intention oh

192
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:56,470
yes so in this nama topic or normal

193
00:12:52,510 --> 00:13:00,819
connection it conveys statistical or

194
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:04,570
some metrics measured on dot client-side

195
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:09,480
so yeah as you mentioned it can be

196
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:12,940
conveyed by IP fixed if it is defined so

197
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:17,649
if we see does specifically related

198
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:20,529
maybe we can consider I am an online but

199
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:23,079
to waste we need to see what is what is

200
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,930
information your view are talking about

201
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:29,739
how you want to convert by the toss

202
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:33,339
protocol because January I think I agree

203
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:36,220
with you that we do not need to be

204
00:13:33,339 --> 00:13:43,020
invented existing protocol IP fixes were

205
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,020
good right so we can discuss later okay

206
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:53,650
my point so thank you for the comment

207
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:56,870
okay then from dadada to quiet the

208
00:13:53,650 --> 00:14:01,790
doesn't include nominal fee because our

209
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:08,690
tactical will be needed to be conveyed

210
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:11,839
then I also proposed separated your URL

211
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:16,190
path because these resources are worthy

212
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:20,080
of observation of the attack pin for

213
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:24,790
stored in the server side so it would be

214
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:30,650
and can be also used for a synchronous

215
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:34,099
notification to DDOT client okay then

216
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:38,209
now here the some scenario for you

217
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,850
because some people might have locations

218
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:43,880
that why server to client attack repo in

219
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,820
pre mitigation stage is needed so here's

220
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,150
a scenario where DDoS attack happened

221
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,940
 some security operation center at

222
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:55,280
the but grass cry and sign channel did

223
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,790
something going wrong but cannot figure

224
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:03,890
out which idea race is exactly attack so

225
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:06,349
what if my solution is what if shock at

226
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:09,050
the dot server side can convey attack

227
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:12,530
details to the dots quiet then finally

228
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,760
described can figure out which one is

229
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:19,480
attack so then it can finally regarding

230
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:22,790
education request so this is actual

231
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:28,750
scenario are hard from some shock people

232
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,750
so if use case is was to be considered

233
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:40,380
we have already updated the draft to

234
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:44,200
accommodate this one yeah thank you so

235
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:46,830
pops past mitigation here's a brief

236
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:51,930
summary of communication telemetry

237
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:56,680
Harkins pick is enough to convey those

238
00:15:51,930 --> 00:16:02,079
parameters so there is no update from my

239
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:04,209
site so in the itraq to introduce two

240
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:06,970
considerations so first one is about the

241
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:11,290
percentile calculation the percentile

242
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:15,430
calculation requires the piece

243
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:19,079
parameters so one needs pimpy period of

244
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:23,949
time and second one is time granularity

245
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:26,290
and so if the not quiet on the server is

246
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:30,940
not agreed on the period of time that

247
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:37,660
they can miss configured so they should

248
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:39,070
be that's a good one gonna be I think I

249
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:41,500
think that's I think you should raise a

250
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:43,390
comment and we'll fix it as an issue and

251
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,710
we will look into that I think this is

252
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,990
gonna be really useful especially for

253
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:49,330
flash drawer attack scenarios because

254
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:52,000
flash Road happens maybe once in any

255
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:54,940
year or twice and giving that period of

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,220
time where the profile was generated is

257
00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,160
gonna be really useful for the DDoS

258
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:02,080
mitigation and the granularity typically

259
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,329
is probably for IP fix I believe it's

260
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,160
around one minute to five minutes so we

261
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,800
need to figure out the white parameters

262
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,020
for granularity but period of time is

263
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,599
how long you take to baseline the normal

264
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:27,220
traffic behavior and it could be weeks

265
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:29,830
or months all requests yeah I what I

266
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:33,580
thought was there is no exact efficient

267
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:38,830
of what the request is and what pass or

268
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:44,100
request is incorrect but said to me of

269
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:46,360
like that those the faster request is

270
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:50,260
characteristics of

271
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:52,479
Rory so theories happy to update

272
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,519
atrocity the next version see related

273
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,220
terminology for the marshal requests

274
00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:01,750
what it means up over to Marshall quest

275
00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:05,019
means yep yep okay so this is the last

276
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:09,159
point so I'd like to do a brief update

277
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:12,870
of Interop so actually our eye on the

278
00:18:09,159 --> 00:18:17,169
gern hobby have been conducting the

279
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:21,100
continuous interval testing so we found

280
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:23,080
several bugs on both sides however this

281
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,299
is must be a good new stuff there is no

282
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,139
significant issue or know each other

283
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:34,870
versions 38 and the data channel 31

284
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:38,049
except one however the issue found in

285
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:40,239
here was already at the rest so next

286
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:42,850
version we cover this point so there's

287
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:49,419
no significant issue currently I think

288
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:52,750
then yeah maybe the next or next of next

289
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:56,769
presentation we may mention about new

290
00:18:52,750 --> 00:19:00,639
dot heartbeat mekinese but it will be

291
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:03,519
introduced in the version 39 of juvenile

292
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:08,850
child rust then I on the journey are

293
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:11,529
waiting to test the version 39 so as

294
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,158
possible so it will be a report back to

295
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:18,880
the working group after that finally our

296
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:22,120
code implementation is open source so

297
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,389
you can touch it and you can use it

298
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,549
freely and the Manistee remain

299
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:32,350
deployment will be available soon so

300
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:35,309
that is the latest use form from me

301
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:35,309
thank you so much

302
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:49,980
equations we Pam from highway I have a

303
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:55,620
question about your machine learning

304
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:58,260
page you can turn turn that page yeah

305
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:02,090
yeah in this page you mean that the

306
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:06,059
toughts client first calculate some

307
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:09,678
traffic baseline information and send it

308
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:13,080
to the server and then server again use

309
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,230
machine learning technicals to calculate

310
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:21,480
another normal baseline in the server

311
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:24,540
side right do you do that no actually a

312
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,650
current draft is doing the calculation

313
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:32,010
of this line on client side yeah glad

314
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:38,610
only sent the result of calculation as a

315
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:43,049
baseline so however this right I try to

316
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:46,979
explain that the calculation on client

317
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:49,250
side is not enough to do the actual

318
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:53,370
machine learning approach because the

319
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:57,990
server side you require the raw data of

320
00:20:53,370 --> 00:21:01,409
it reeks in order to make modeling of

321
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:03,630
those metrics in server side so you

322
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:06,660
means actually in the server is better

323
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,600
for the server to collect the raw data

324
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:12,480
to do the machine learning things by

325
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,820
itself not just by the client to do the

326
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,520
machine only and I just ascend a few

327
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:26,909
dates of the normal baseline traffic

328
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:30,139
like that yeah Claire has limited could

329
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:35,240
have the limited resource of calculation

330
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:37,620
dadada it's v need to make the each own

331
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:41,850
modeling of normal traffic

332
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,979
so yeah this makes sense to me and I I

333
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:48,330
think maybe the also scan considerately

334
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:50,530
and also do by using the machine

335
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:53,649
learning approaches do you have

336
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,020
some preference for I'm not familiar

337
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:59,170
with this kind of technology so I don't

338
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:04,510
know whether the information need to be

339
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:07,570
trans con Vedas is like common or kind

340
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:09,129
of we can't standardized it maybe you

341
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:17,649
can offer some information on the

342
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:20,710
mailing list okay okay yeah I mean when

343
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:23,020
you use a tester for you you you use the

344
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:25,680
machine learning approach what kind of

345
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,910
information you need and based on what

346
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,580
approach to some kind of background

347
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:37,510
information you can share with us yeah

348
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:39,340
yep thank you yeah I'm not opposed to a

349
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:42,280
machine learning approach but what I'm

350
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:45,159
trying to say is that IP fix is already

351
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,530
used by routers and DDoS mitigation

352
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,650
systems and he dose detectors for

353
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:52,240
baselining and profiling I think we

354
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:54,360
would want to leverage an existing

355
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,710
protocol and not reinvent something

356
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:59,139
because this has been already done there

357
00:22:56,710 --> 00:23:01,660
are products in the market which take IP

358
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:03,970
fixed data and do analytics on that I

359
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:06,040
can name few of them but our borders

360
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:07,630
your adware does it so most of the

361
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,060
reader education providers who are doing

362
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:12,010
it for doing that so unless we have more

363
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:16,090
requirements why this needs to be done

364
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,920
in dot signal channel we should have a

365
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:22,949
very strong reason for that and I do not

366
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,950
see a strong reason yeah I write

367
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:31,600
thank you so much for the feedback and

368
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:33,580
thank you Kaname your activities is

369
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,129
amazing thank you for doing this thank

370
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:39,259
you

371
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,259
[Music]

372
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:04,170
so the next is about the current status

373
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:08,370
of working group documents which have a

374
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:18,090
common set of alters so till this yeah

375
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:20,550
this would be I think even update on

376
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,689
various working group documents and

377
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:25,110
their statuses

378
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:26,580
the first one is dot server discovery we

379
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,790
have done couple of revisions to the

380
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:31,230
draft after the last IDF and we have

381
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:32,909
addressed all the comments received from

382
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:35,400
the working group mainly to integrate

383
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,110
call home so that the call home dots

384
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,530
client could be discovered by the call

385
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:42,959
home dot server and added illustrative

386
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,430
examples on how an agent which is acting

387
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,980
as both thoughts over and called home

388
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:48,840
dot client can be discovered by the dots

389
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,660
client and the call home dots over and

390
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:55,169
the fix of normative languages and some

391
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,780
hardening text and both the signal and

392
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,890
call home IDs have been moved to

393
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:00,960
informational because an implement who

394
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:04,430
can just implement the tour's over disk

395
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,430
without going through those drafts

396
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:09,990
hmmm have added explanation on multiple

397
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,899
IP addresses that could be returned by

398
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:15,180
the DHCP server so that it can act as a

399
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,360
both primary and secondary servers in

400
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,920
case if the parameter cannot be reached

401
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:22,560
dot signal general already discusses

402
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,870
happy.i pulse mechanism for establishing

403
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:27,240
communication with dot server so the

404
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:32,520
trap does not go into details on how to

405
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:34,410
establish communication with dots the

406
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,660
working group loss call is over and away

407
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:38,990
waiting for Shiva writer both for the

408
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,990
draft

409
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:45,870
toward signal child whom had got good

410
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,820
review comments especially for adding

411
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,679
tests to avoid conflict with what dot

412
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:51,960
signal channel does and we have added

413
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,760
called home reference architecture with

414
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,620
new terminology to avoid confusion with

415
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,559
the dot with the bass signal channel

416
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,229
and you also integrated all the working

417
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:06,870
group last comments received and the

418
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:08,640
draft is also waiting for right you

419
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,590
cannot received much feedback from the

420
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,570
working group on this draft and we would

421
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,459
request more comments on this one of a

422
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,230
quarter swipe in hat centers offline

423
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,230
comments will fix that and posted you

424
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,880
reviewed but will really ask for more

425
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:26,880
feedback on this craft from the working

426
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:28,800
group are going to issue an update for

427
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,920
this draft yes we will do it because it

428
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:38,178
can update it do that in the next one

429
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,179
yeah thank you

430
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:06,210
so I think it's one of the most

431
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:08,430
interesting parts of today's yeah yeah

432
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,280
you think working on this for the last I

433
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:14,070
mean trying to follow up with the custom

434
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:15,389
inform this and bairn and others for

435
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:16,980
this because we were not sure what is

436
00:27:15,390 --> 00:27:18,540
the alternative mechanism but in the

437
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,059
last few weeks we've made significant

438
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:24,690
progress on this thanks to all the help

439
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:26,520
from Karsten especially so just a quick

440
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,559
recap on what happened right I mean the

441
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,670
draft was approved by all the icig

442
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,080
members but the transport ad major had

443
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:36,570
an objection to the way we were using

444
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,428
clapping clapping had certain

445
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,240
disadvantages that it was using

446
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:45,600
conformal messages which would cause

447
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:48,630
exponential retransmissions and that was

448
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,760
something that the the working group had

449
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:53,670
picked that at that time because there

450
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,379
was no way for the dots over at least to

451
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,960
send request messages back to the client

452
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,330
and queer ping was the only message we

453
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,520
thought that this would send back to the

454
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,169
client and the reason we had picked ping

455
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,720
but it was under the full control of the

456
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:08,940
dots application by both the dots client

457
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,220
and server and we had a very vanilla

458
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,620
behavior what the client was acting as

459
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:17,490
our client and dot so was acting as a

460
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:19,139
web server and our transport ad had

461
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,610
objections to that and we were not sure

462
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:23,580
what the alternative approach could be

463
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:26,729
why but the recent introduction with

464
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:29,550
caution and the co-op liability co-op we

465
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,420
will be looking into indicated that the

466
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:35,399
dots client can behave as a quiet light

467
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:37,830
and it can act as both client and server

468
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:40,440
similarly the server can also act as a

469
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:42,540
client at servers so it means that the

470
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,150
dots so we can now say it refers back to

471
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:47,520
the client and the client can now

472
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:50,429
respond to requests coming from the

473
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,470
server so with that in mind it was

474
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:55,350
pretty evident that we could easily move

475
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,080
away from the confirmable co-op messages

476
00:28:55,350 --> 00:29:00,540
to dots level non comfortable messages

477
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,110
so in that context what we have done is

478
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:05,870
we have updated the draft to say that

479
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:08,029
the behavior of the client with regard

480
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,699
to our clients continues to stay for all

481
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:12,830
the dots mechanisms excluding the dots

482
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,960
heartbeat operations who are four dots

483
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,760
heartbeat operations the client acts as

484
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:21,649
both client and server and similarly the

485
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:25,010
server axis both grant and server so in

486
00:29:21,649 --> 00:29:26,600
that regard the the the feedback that we

487
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,950
had received with this this was pretty

488
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,889
easy that all that we had to do is

489
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:34,100
define a new dot specific heartbeat for

490
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,409
every twist we have introduced as HP as

491
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:40,519
the URI suffix for the heartbeat request

492
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:42,620
and we have added PHP state is an

493
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:46,210
attribute within that request I will go

494
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,209
into the details why we had added that

495
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:51,049
as I have already explained it's it's

496
00:29:49,399 --> 00:29:52,820
it's going to be non comfortable message

497
00:29:51,049 --> 00:29:54,460
and which gives us more control in the

498
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,960
with regard to the periodic

499
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:59,360
retransmission of the dots heartbeat

500
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,889
messages and one of the forage feedback

501
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,740
that we have received from Kirsten is

502
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:05,418
initially we wanted to go with get but

503
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:07,159
Custance register that gate for since

504
00:30:05,419 --> 00:30:09,440
get would not influence the applications

505
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:12,830
Ted it it would better be to take either

506
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,070
put or a post so that's the reason we

507
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,110
picked put and the other reason was the

508
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:21,139
peer heartbeat status is a good way of

509
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,820
indicating back to the peer dots agent

510
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:26,178
whether a heartbeat requests are coming

511
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,000
from the peer agent or not so that way

512
00:30:26,179 --> 00:30:31,669
the peer agent could basically change

513
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,559
the way change the frequency with which

514
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:38,840
it is sending heartbeat request to the

515
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:41,570
to its beer so in that regard the other

516
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,970
feedback that we had received was if you

517
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:46,460
are sending request without any

518
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:47,990
responses then core has a message

519
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,269
transmission parameter called probing

520
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:53,990
weight which is basically set to one

521
00:30:50,269 --> 00:30:56,330
byte per second and custom solution whoa

522
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:59,360
but the flexibilities applications do

523
00:30:56,330 --> 00:31:02,210
have a control on what value to pick and

524
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,799
so that's reason probing really can be

525
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:05,990
negotiated during the piece time between

526
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:10,039
the dots agents similar to other message

527
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:12,470
retransmission parameters and and and

528
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,940
further to add avoid interfering with

529
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:16,880
the medication request medication

530
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,250
request today already follow the

531
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:22,910
the transmission guidelines defined in

532
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:25,010
RFC 8:08 five so if the round-trip time

533
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:28,400
is not known then medication requests

534
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:31,280
are not sent more than three 3 seconds

535
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,560
power just only one mitigation request

536
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:36,200
is sent further three seconds so with

537
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,260
that we the dots medication requests do

538
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,460
not need to follow the probing rate and

539
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:42,820
they would continue to follow the

540
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:49,250
message transmission guidelines given in

541
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:54,200
RSA it's zero at five but however for

542
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:56,030
the dots heartbeat requests we wanted to

543
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,870
make sure that it follows the probing

544
00:31:56,030 --> 00:32:01,879
rate that was defined in the choir so

545
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:03,350
what we have done is we have come up

546
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,960
with a couple of algorithms to define

547
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:08,060
what would be a reasonable probing rate

548
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,530
assuming we want to send the probing

549
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,700
rate at least every 30 seconds for both

550
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,680
liveliness checks and to keep the net

551
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,210
banding alive so that's reason we had

552
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,740
come up with a simple formula where you

553
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:20,690
would use hard wait interval into

554
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:25,970
probing rate bytes to figure out what

555
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:28,520
would be an ideal value for the for the

556
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:31,190
probing rate and that's the value that

557
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:34,940
the client can calculate and pick for

558
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,230
it's hard weight requests pinkie luck so

559
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:39,260
can you go back to the previous slide

560
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:41,360
please so I just want to double check

561
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,150
here we have this new text which is

562
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:47,000
talking you must not apply other

563
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:51,020
congestion control checks and I think

564
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,360
from what you were saying when you're

565
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:55,250
talking about that that you know we have

566
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,840
some exterior limit about you know you

567
00:32:55,250 --> 00:32:58,700
you can't send more than one of these

568
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:02,480
every three seconds to certainty

569
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,340
mitigation requests yes okay good

570
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,020
because you know if we if we just had

571
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:07,699
this new text that would be kind of you

572
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,520
know problematic from the transmitter

573
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:12,590
side we have very clear text saying it's

574
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,510
it's a normative text saying that we

575
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,220
must follow the transmission guidelines

576
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:19,930
given in 8c rate forward we should not

577
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:19,930
exceed that excellent

578
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:28,160
and then and internally right beyond the

579
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,620
way the hardwood messages are exchanged

580
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:32,270
the way or the client and server logic

581
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,300
would be there to make decisions with

582
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:37,010
regard to the heartbeat missing number

583
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:39,200
of heartbeats allowed or there won't be

584
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,090
any change in that so it's mostly a

585
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
change with regard to the negotiation of

586
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:43,370
heart

587
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,169
probing rate but the interval lying

588
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:47,629
implementation for detecting whether the

589
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:52,610
pair is alive or dead is not changing

590
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:55,160
with this approach and and thanks to all

591
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:57,949
the feedback and the help we got from

592
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,960
Canada and John I think some initial

593
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:02,870
testing shows that this new mechanism is

594
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:06,050
you know is working and we believe this

595
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:09,500
issue is resolved and we already sent a

596
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:12,590
mail too much already and probably

597
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,480
review from our ad and chairs would help

598
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:16,669
us to progress this and from the working

599
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,600
group as well to quickly close this

600
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:23,199
issue just codification equation and new

601
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:28,250
hit beat mechanism exists some

602
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:29,899
introduction if reliable HP yes for a

603
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:31,940
reliable channel also we are using the

604
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:35,600
same dots heartbeat message but it's

605
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:36,560
just one message and the underlying TCP

606
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,870
transport would take care of

607
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,159
retransmissions because the probing rate

608
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:45,699
would not be applicable here

609
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:51,859
so is it reflected yes okay thank you so

610
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:54,168
well next steps and I will ask our AG

611
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,720
what to do in this situation because

612
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:00,410
there is there seem to be some

613
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:03,230
substantial changes to the draft and the

614
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:07,399
draft is already in that is the

615
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:10,670
evaluation so what shall we do right so

616
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,410
I have been talking to Maria throughout

617
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,720
this week about you know the proposed

618
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:18,310
changes and how they were looks I

619
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,520
believe that she should be able to

620
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,210
rebound

621
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:27,020
soon and then because we did make some

622
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:29,420
fairly big changes to how things work as

623
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:33,259
a result of the isg review I think it's

624
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:35,120
probably a good idea to do just like a

625
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,720
short one week working group last called

626
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:39,589
on

627
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:42,040
the changes you know since the the 31 I

628
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:45,920
think is what we did the ITF last call

629
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,869
now are on the 39 just to get a quick

630
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,790
sanity check from the working group that

631
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:52,250
this still makes sense it works for

632
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:54,200
everybody but I don't think we need to

633
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:59,329
do another ITF last call or something

634
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,848
like that okay so you will return the

635
00:35:59,329 --> 00:36:04,069
drought bit to working group will issue

636
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:06,740
let's go and then request a publication

637
00:36:04,069 --> 00:36:08,329
again no I don't think we need to do

638
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,629
that I think I can just just issue

639
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:14,869
what's called looking at just asking

640
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:17,690
thank you so well I think will issue a

641
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:21,920
last call probably in a week

642
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:24,920
just to have all the people I returned

643
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,339
from ITF and all the sense leaving Day

644
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,369
holidays first so in the beginning of

645
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:30,369
December

646
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:11,689
so the next is about Telemachus recipe

647
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:13,250
thanks I'll be presenting updates to the

648
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:15,349
dots telemetry draft or we have made

649
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:16,880
significant updates to the draft from

650
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:28,670
the last time you heard I had presented

651
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:29,839
this at the last ITF so what we have

652
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:33,589
done is we have addressed all the

653
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:36,619
comments received between zero one zero

654
00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:37,970
one zero four actually addresses all the

655
00:37:36,619 --> 00:37:41,869
comments received from the working group

656
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:43,308
and it also integrates the integrates

657
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:45,020
the work that mailing has been doing in

658
00:37:43,309 --> 00:37:47,079
her other draft so we have discussed

659
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:49,790
often with her and pieces which was

660
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:51,670
which we all wish at least the working

661
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:54,079
group had consensus regarding

662
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:55,609
that had details and that was the

663
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,619
portions that were updated in to the

664
00:37:55,609 --> 00:38:02,540
router I'll explain the changes that

665
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:05,150
were done to the draft as a quick

666
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:06,829
reminder or dots telemetry was discussed

667
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,319
in the working group I mean when the

668
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:12,950
working group was formed at least that

669
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:14,420
it's it's it's it's it's probably but at

670
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:16,578
the time it was decided that it's an

671
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:19,579
optional piece of information and need

672
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:21,230
not be taken up immediately so we

673
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:23,299
published this draft offer the most of

674
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:25,309
the you know base protocol drafts had

675
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:26,960
progressed and it's basically a

676
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:29,000
collection of attributes characterizing

677
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,970
both the normal baseline behavior and

678
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,670
that act characteristics and both are

679
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:36,709
useful for DDoS detection and mitigation

680
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,000
especially for statistical analysis

681
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:41,930
machine learning or deep learning

682
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,609
techniques Doss telemetry is is an

683
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:45,290
optional set of attributes as defined in

684
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:47,450
the dots requirements and it can be

685
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:51,890
signaled in both signal and data channel

686
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:54,859
protocols weapon from Huawei a quick

687
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:57,379
question I asked you before about

688
00:38:54,859 --> 00:39:01,098
whether to use dog take a channel to

689
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:03,890
convey that austerity and you your

690
00:39:01,099 --> 00:39:06,950
response was to just use that a signal

691
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,379
channel and do you change it in that now

692
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:11,629
we have not done any changes so it's

693
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,860
it's I don't want to use two protocols

694
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:15,780
for the same information so a

695
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:17,280
should pick one of them basically right

696
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,020
I mean there's no point in using two

697
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,130
protocols to signal the same telemetry

698
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,500
but I would ideally like to have it like

699
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,730
more discussion on whether dot signal or

700
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,350
data channel is appropriate for

701
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:34,020
signaling the dots telemetry okay yeah

702
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:36,960
so well you know from a fellow I have

703
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:39,390
the Murphy's the same don't

704
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,960
well my doubt is that you're using

705
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,940
signal channel for transferring

706
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,460
additional information but in case

707
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,980
enough of attack signal channel will

708
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:51,600
probably be saturated and mitigation

709
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,350
requests is much more important

710
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:58,950
information so if you if you add an

711
00:39:55,350 --> 00:40:00,720
additional bender ease if you use a

712
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,549
signal channel for transferring more

713
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,709
informations are probably more important

714
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:09,300
request to mitigate an attack will get

715
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:11,100
lost so yeah so there's it's it's more

716
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,380
of a problem especially during the

717
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:15,029
attack time right hand during attack

718
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:16,800
time towards data channel is not

719
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,780
supposed to work right towards data

720
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,340
channel is not designed to work and if

721
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,740
you see the telemetry that we are

722
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:25,500
discussing here is in separate requests

723
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,930
it can either piggyback a medication

724
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:30,540
request or if the size exceeds it can be

725
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:32,370
always sent as a separate request so it

726
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:33,990
need not be tied to the mitigation

727
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:36,810
request because that's the most critical

728
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,759
one the bit the normal during peacetime

729
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:40,500
I think we can send the dots telemetry

730
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,280
Iser using the signal or data channel

731
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,280
that's not the problem

732
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,510
but during at that time when you have

733
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,400
lots of attack traffic coming and the

734
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:50,130
link is saturated the only way you can

735
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,840
convey their attack details is using the

736
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:53,460
signal channel and we don't have an

737
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,320
option of using the data Channel I just

738
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,970
think the traffic must be prioritized

739
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,340
so as mitigation request is much more

740
00:40:56,970 --> 00:41:01,169
important since limitless yes I think

741
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,010
that's good comment and we'll update

742
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,010
that or thank you

743
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:13,410
so as Canada was presented a path suffix

744
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,870
J / telemetry was added but I agree with

745
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:19,500
him that this probably needs to be split

746
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:21,600
into any telemetry which is more of a

747
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:24,120
baseline and less frequently changed

748
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,589
versus telemetry which would frequently

749
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:30,060
change based on that a characteristics

750
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:32,790
so this is something that we have

751
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,570
updated to the draft to discuss the

752
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:38,790
draft was previously focusing mostly on

753
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:41,550
bandwidth consuming attacks but nobody's

754
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:43,110
we see a large increase in resource

755
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:47,070
consuming DDoS attacks so we have added

756
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:48,930
various baseline behavior with regard to

757
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,460
resource consuming itaú attacks that the

758
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:52,560
client can signal to the server

759
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:54,180
it could include various parameters like

760
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,870
max number of simultaneous connections

761
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,160
are allowed to the target max number of

762
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,569
simultaneous candidate conditions

763
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,060
allowed to the target server per client

764
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:04,830
in case if a client is bombarding the

765
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,040
server with various DDoS attack

766
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:09,990
connections now simultaneous embryo

767
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,670
connection refers to half open

768
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:14,040
connections because we have seen various

769
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,510
DDoS attacks by just the client

770
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,950
establishes half of foreign connections

771
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:18,450
just sends in packet but does not

772
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:20,220
respond to the Cena coming from the

773
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:22,680
server and you just waste just waste the

774
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,390
CPU cycles and the memory cycles of the

775
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:26,819
server to basically process these and

776
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:30,420
storage state for these half open

777
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:32,400
connections and and similarly the other

778
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,350
other properties like max number of

779
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,410
embryonic connections that are allowed

780
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:38,819
per second the number of max number of

781
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:44,460
connections allowed per second to the

782
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:46,830
target per line and this is at the

783
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,600
transport layer and we also have a tax

784
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:51,120
at the layer server and if you see the

785
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,040
recent trends the attacks at the layer

786
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,830
seven have increased drastically with

787
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,259
regard to 1/2 with with regard to

788
00:42:55,830 --> 00:43:00,810
slowloris attacks where the client just

789
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,090
sends garbage data or partial requests

790
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,560
so that the application server would

791
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,270
just store that partial request

792
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,549
expecting the rest of the data to arrive

793
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:10,080
and that just consumes the memory of the

794
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:12,330
server so that it cannot process

795
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,210
legitimate requests coming from other

796
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:17,009
clients and that's a pretty new

797
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:17,670
technique that has come up and it's it's

798
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:24,870
going to be pretty challenging

799
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:26,340
especially with HTTP 2 3 and HTTP 2 so

800
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:27,720
this these parameters just because the

801
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:29,180
max number of requests allowed per

802
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,230
second to the target server

803
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:32,759
max number of requests allowed per

804
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:35,130
second to the target server per client

805
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:36,960
and the max number of partial it was a

806
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:38,400
lot per second to the target server and

807
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,810
the max number of partial requests

808
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,810
allowed per second to the target so

809
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,189
and with regard to the same resource

810
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:50,850
consuming attacks the percentile values

811
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:52,810
of low medium high and peak of

812
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:54,880
simultaneous attack conditions to the

813
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:57,310
target server number of simultaneous

814
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,790
embryonic connections to the target so

815
00:43:57,310 --> 00:44:02,440
and attack conditions per second and

816
00:44:00,790 --> 00:44:03,820
attack request to the target server I

817
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:06,580
mean we missing couple of attributes

818
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:08,619
here with regard to attack request to

819
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,270
the target server per second and attack

820
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:15,010
conditions per second to the target

821
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:17,710
server so we will fix this and I raised

822
00:44:15,010 --> 00:44:19,690
issues indeed already so we need more

823
00:44:17,710 --> 00:44:21,760
feedback from the working group on to

824
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:26,580
get a complete list of attributes that

825
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,660
we think are required to for these

826
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:32,440
especially resource consuming DDoS

827
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:34,270
attacks attack details had received

828
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:37,570
several feedback from the working group

829
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:40,240
especially with regard to that add

830
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:42,250
details being signaled from the dot

831
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:43,720
server to client which was not there in

832
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,670
the original draft and we have updated

833
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:47,890
to add that with an example on fight

834
00:44:45,670 --> 00:44:50,170
that would happen just like an app I had

835
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,299
explained and we have also updated the

836
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,730
attack details in very similar way that

837
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:56,200
products use it today with regard to the

838
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:59,050
start time of the attack there in time

839
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,390
and percentile values of sources

840
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:05,260
involved in the attack to understand the

841
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:08,170
number of attackers in world in this the

842
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,609
scale of that act basically and whether

843
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,869
to know whether it's in bandwidth or a

844
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:13,210
resource consuming attack and the

845
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:14,619
corresponding attributes for attack the

846
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,820
worst case it would be both bandwidth

847
00:45:14,619 --> 00:45:17,890
and race was considering attacker and

848
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:20,080
that would also be signal and the list

849
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:21,490
of top talkers targeting the victim and

850
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,980
attack traffic from each of the top

851
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:25,720
talkers one of the important parameters

852
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:27,790
that was added is whether the top duck

853
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:29,680
that is a spoofed IP address or not if

854
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,970
it's a spoofed IP address you cannot put

855
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:32,830
an ACL rule and block the traffic

856
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:36,459
because that would penalize legitimate

857
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:38,470
traffic right imagine somebody using a

858
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:40,090
tornado date to send Tina spoof

859
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:41,290
responses you don't want to block

860
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:42,460
traffic from a rotatory

861
00:45:41,290 --> 00:45:45,490
because that would block all good

862
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,680
traffic coming so identifying a spoofed

863
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:50,109
IP addresses is very important so that

864
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,270
legitimate clients are not penalized and

865
00:45:50,109 --> 00:45:54,100
further the bandwidth of resource

866
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:54,349
consuming DDoS attacks and corresponding

867
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:58,459
at

868
00:45:54,349 --> 00:46:00,769
attack attributes per target we also

869
00:45:58,459 --> 00:46:02,089
have a configuration parameter where the

870
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:03,769
client and server can negotiate the

871
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:05,949
configuration parameters for telemetry

872
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:09,319
data the low mid high and peak values

873
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:11,689
and we have recently added a nang wa

874
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:15,319
duel in the version 3 and c bore mapping

875
00:46:11,689 --> 00:46:16,819
history for Tots implementation one of

876
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:18,380
the major questions I'm in the comments

877
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:22,069
that has that we have not yet addressed

878
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:23,539
is where do we draw the line basically

879
00:46:22,069 --> 00:46:25,219
right especially during the attack time

880
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:27,229
we know certain attributes can only be

881
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:29,809
set using tor signal channels but now

882
00:46:27,229 --> 00:46:32,629
during the piece time do you want to use

883
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:36,019
the dot signal channel or do you want to

884
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:38,589
use the dot status channel right we just

885
00:46:36,019 --> 00:46:40,669
picked on the dot signal channel because

886
00:46:38,589 --> 00:46:42,949
tor signal channel also are those

887
00:46:40,669 --> 00:46:46,848
confirmable messages and co-op is also

888
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:50,209
used nowadays for configuration purposes

889
00:46:46,849 --> 00:46:51,769
so whether we want to use dots signal

890
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:54,678
channel during the piece time for

891
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:56,178
sending the dots telemetry is a question

892
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:57,829
for the working group and I think both

893
00:46:56,179 --> 00:47:01,849
the protocols can do the job here it's

894
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:03,619
just that if we have to pick one and but

895
00:47:01,849 --> 00:47:05,929
at least during the attack time any

896
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:08,319
attack details that can be sent can only

897
00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:11,209
be sent using the toughts signal channel

898
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:12,919
and we would let poor feedback on any

899
00:47:11,209 --> 00:47:15,019
other configuration parameters other

900
00:47:12,919 --> 00:47:19,519
than percentiles that can be negotiated

901
00:47:15,019 --> 00:47:20,988
between the client and server and and I

902
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:22,189
think we have been receiving lots of

903
00:47:20,989 --> 00:47:25,459
comments and we've been trying to

904
00:47:22,189 --> 00:47:26,868
address that and I see a lot of interest

905
00:47:25,459 --> 00:47:30,948
in this raft and will request for

906
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:40,179
working group reduction thank you

907
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:45,529
so how many people already draft okay I

908
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:51,259
think there is some interest in the

909
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:54,140
group for for this draft we can I think

910
00:47:51,259 --> 00:48:02,869
we can make a home for adoption and then

911
00:47:54,140 --> 00:48:06,949
confirm it in the least so well let's if

912
00:48:02,869 --> 00:48:08,230
you are in favor of adoptions is draft

913
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:19,530
as a working group

914
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:24,970
document please hum now in favor yes

915
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:29,760
let's try again if you want this

916
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:29,759
document to be adopted let's come now

917
00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:36,490
it's it's it's louder if you don't want

918
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:43,660
to turn this document to bed okay please

919
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:46,240
come now noise so I think that the

920
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:49,600
feeling in the rooms that the document

921
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:57,819
should adopt it but we will confirm this

922
00:48:49,600 --> 00:49:00,779
in the list so thank you - thanks okay

923
00:48:57,820 --> 00:49:00,780
thank you

924
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:29,580
okay we have one more presentation

925
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:37,410
regarding telemetry use case yes thank

926
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:40,680
you I mean you hear her she from entity

927
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:43,890
so I will show a use case of the state

928
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:47,810
tournament we use case name it if she

929
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:51,000
use of DMS based on track boundaries

930
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:54,000
this is somebody of presentation we

931
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:58,860
carried out Pio she about efficient use

932
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:01,080
of DMS based on bandwidth and we assess

933
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:04,860
that adopts enemy terrific especially

934
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,370
yeah mojo created a top talker and bad

935
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:10,560
Willis

936
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:14,910
I can be applied in the use case so TC

937
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:17,930
this life is assumption or use case a

938
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:21,629
network provides a team service to

939
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:25,169
subscriber and some network equipment

940
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:28,350
are deployed in the network to provide

941
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:31,290
service our routers which contain

942
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:34,490
natural and reflector which can detect

943
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:37,740
it attack and EMS which can mitigate

944
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:41,100
DDoS attack on a slick sure which can

945
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:45,569
accommodate appropriate DMS and finally

946
00:50:41,100 --> 00:50:47,640
Orchestrator and volume DDoS attacks to

947
00:50:45,570 --> 00:50:52,320
DM a service subscriber is carried out

948
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:54,420
by other Earth's to subscriber and at

949
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:58,350
this time our bandwidth of attack

950
00:50:54,420 --> 00:51:03,200
traffic destined to target is more than

951
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:06,089
available capacity of DMS then property

952
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:10,710
detects attack on same attack reported

953
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:13,200
to Orchestrator and the report

954
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:16,170
attack report includes bandwidth to

955
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:20,089
debris flow this is the assumption and

956
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:22,350
this is use case scenario of ours and

957
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:26,360
this use case

958
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:31,350
Pio she is was carried out in our

959
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:32,930
laboratories I want to explain this

960
00:51:31,350 --> 00:51:35,700
scenario

961
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:38,970
Orchestrator carries out some process a

962
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,939
fast receiving attack report unchecking

963
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:44,759
the duplication and register the

964
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:47,670
boundaries of two double floats and

965
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:51,990
check available available capacity of

966
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:57,440
DMS and a check mixer this IP is the

967
00:51:51,990 --> 00:52:02,060
email service subscribers wrong and then

968
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:05,760
okay sorry the direct attack row two DMS

969
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:08,750
if so DMS available capacity is more

970
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:12,150
than at this IP broadband with Alvida

971
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:15,000
Orchestrator redirects all of this IP

972
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:17,910
road to a better with TMS on the other

973
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,030
hand demon cerebral capacity is destined

974
00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:23,549
at this type across boundaries

975
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:29,130
Orchestrator dialect to topple rows of

976
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:31,500
top talker preferentially and network

977
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:36,800
operator can use available capacity of

978
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:40,530
demons in T by using this scenario and

979
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:45,329
we assist that kind of traumatic can be

980
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:48,210
applied to the use case lift figure is

981
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:51,540
shows this region shows that I am Mojo

982
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:54,980
related to top topper on path wheels on

983
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:57,930
the right one is a low Robo Orchestrator

984
00:52:54,980 --> 00:53:00,270
assertively is a young module related

985
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:06,180
the top talker and panelists can be

986
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:08,900
applied to the use case this case if my

987
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:08,899
presentation is

988
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,489
[Music]

989
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:25,079
from NTT communications one

990
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:30,539
clarification question so you need the

991
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:34,670
bandwidth information of couple of th IP

992
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:38,339
and source IP rights address right so

993
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:40,439
sorry back to the previous yeah that one

994
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:46,469
so in order to convey that information

995
00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:52,969
you will use the pre-initiation module

996
00:53:46,469 --> 00:53:56,160
because it only includes a target IP

997
00:53:52,969 --> 00:53:58,410
source IP address subject right so yes

998
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:00,709
that's right yeah so attack detail is

999
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:05,729
not enough because it only includes

1000
00:54:00,709 --> 00:54:23,189
Disney IP address also your source IP

1001
00:54:05,729 --> 00:54:30,839
address yes thank you the target renter

1002
00:54:23,189 --> 00:54:32,249
and the source of that ech somebody

1003
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:35,160
attributes are present if you see the

1004
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:37,649
telemetry it has both the target the

1005
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,259
victim of the attack and the source who

1006
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:43,619
source prefixes and those details who's

1007
00:54:40,259 --> 00:54:56,339
attacking the target both the peoples

1008
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:58,829
are present okay this is like I just saw

1009
00:54:56,339 --> 00:55:02,880
a mitigation scope or includes the

1010
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:06,319
target IP address and then source

1011
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:10,349
address is included in attack detail

1012
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:14,130
whether you hate require you the

1013
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:19,319
bandwidth of couple of each nation IP

1014
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:24,799
address and source address and that

1015
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:30,269
mutation scope only includes a group

1016
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:32,410
however he required each source IP

1017
00:55:30,269 --> 00:55:36,580
address and each

1018
00:55:32,410 --> 00:55:41,500
business like the other way see so TV

1019
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:44,710
separate here we need the array of those

1020
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:47,160
metrics which includes one toaster

1021
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:50,230
gallery's found Disney together with

1022
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:55,120
please speak to Mike and the bandwidth

1023
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:56,860
of duplicating that the other way could

1024
00:55:55,120 --> 00:55:58,870
be that you could send a medication

1025
00:55:56,860 --> 00:56:07,960
request water it basically rather than

1026
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:09,940
grouping them benkei doc so I me on the

1027
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:12,790
slide it talks about the tuple of the

1028
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:15,610
source and destination IP addresses and

1029
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:18,220
then Konami was just talking about maybe

1030
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:21,580
you have the source prefixes so do you

1031
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:26,109
have a sense for how much coalescing

1032
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:28,930
there is between source IP addresses of

1033
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:33,220
the attack into having just a source

1034
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:36,220
prefix because if we need to always send

1035
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:38,790
the source IP address then it might be a

1036
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:42,939
very large amount of information that's

1037
00:56:38,790 --> 00:56:46,710
my assumption insult send only top two

1038
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:52,810
cars a to top of role and so my since

1039
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:59,100
maybe 1000 or 100 horses are so to so

1040
00:56:52,810 --> 00:57:03,490
use DMS capacity so if you sorry

1041
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:08,080
mmm sorry I don't have the concrete at

1042
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:10,479
the nut number or if it's a large scale

1043
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:12,160
II decided it would be a group of source

1044
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:14,350
prefixes that would be launching and

1045
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:16,089
they would be the top talkers it's very

1046
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:17,799
difficult to identify just 10 top

1047
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:21,040
talkers who could basically bring down a

1048
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:24,120
large so basically so it has to be a

1049
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,230
group of thousands of malware which are

1050
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:29,500
coordinating America and of an attacker

1051
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:30,790
and that would be a prefix range coming

1052
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:33,340
from a specific geography because

1053
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:35,380
malware is typically start with a

1054
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:40,350
specific geography and then they move

1055
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:40,350
across to other geographies so secure

1056
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:55,660
more questions comments I want to say

1057
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:59,230
that the use case for is a taught

1058
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:02,200
elementary such work is very useful and

1059
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:09,180
to validate whether that ultimate

1060
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:14,740
Elementary's are needed or complete and

1061
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:17,669
I'd like to raise another discuss or use

1062
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:21,040
case about how telemetric can be used

1063
00:58:17,670 --> 00:58:23,650
for imaging we discussed the way that

1064
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:27,460
you use a signal channel at for

1065
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:31,000
telemetry at the attack time so at the

1066
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:33,730
attack time the both signal channel and

1067
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:37,150
a channel may first a channel won't work

1068
00:58:33,730 --> 00:58:41,380
as we designed it and the signal Channel

1069
00:58:37,150 --> 00:58:45,130
may or may also can not be useful so

1070
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:47,980
post telemetry can be used before they

1071
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:49,930
attack to convey some on the normal

1072
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:53,200
traffic baseline information to the

1073
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:56,020
server and the server can observe the

1074
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:58,569
traffic but it can may it may not be

1075
00:58:56,020 --> 00:59:01,210
able to judge whether the attack has

1076
00:58:58,570 --> 00:59:03,730
happened on the client but with the

1077
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:06,790
telemetry information or with the

1078
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:10,140
baseline information and the client and

1079
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:15,040
the server can compare the current

1080
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:18,100
traffic with the baseline and to charge

1081
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:21,009
it there is a attack and then there is

1082
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:23,859
no need to send all the medication

1083
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:27,700
requester feared to be received by the

1084
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:31,290
server but the server can still you know

1085
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:35,500
arrange our mitigation for the client

1086
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:38,230
the second young men wait time from

1087
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:41,800
Howie okay please please see you then

1088
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:43,900
where you coming through so if you see

1089
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:45,880
the telemetry right telemetry can be

1090
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:47,619
stills and during the peacetime for

1091
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:50,470
example the baseline and the capacity

1092
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:51,760
one like we discussed in the raft can be

1093
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:54,399
sent during the plea statement as a

1094
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,450
recommendation if the text is not there

1095
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,799
definitely add that but the

1096
00:59:55,450 --> 00:59:59,770
recommendation is to threaten the

1097
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:02,288
baseline do your traffic and the

1098
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:03,849
capabilities of the dots over like how

1099
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:05,799
many connections it can and all that can

1100
01:00:03,849 --> 01:00:07,480
be sent during the peace trip the only

1101
01:00:05,799 --> 01:00:09,730
one that meet that is mandatory and

1102
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:11,799
required to be certain during the pre

1103
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,190
mitigation or at at time is that ACTA

1104
01:00:11,799 --> 01:00:14,259
deals

1105
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:16,119
what kind of attack you're seeing is it

1106
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:18,010
a resource-based one what what is the

1107
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:20,910
scale of the attack and only that can be

1108
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:20,910
sent during in at that time

1109
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:25,230
thank you for comments

1110
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:34,868
one more thing do you consider to write

1111
01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:38,859
a draft about the use case thoughts Matt

1112
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:43,390
telemetry or just try to integrate it

1113
01:00:38,859 --> 01:00:46,089
into the current draft yes so I would

1114
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:49,118
like to write to cinema to a use case

1115
01:00:46,089 --> 01:00:54,190
draft and so I have several term to use

1116
01:00:49,119 --> 01:01:00,339
case this use case and maybe other

1117
01:00:54,190 --> 01:01:04,599
operator company he hard territory use

1118
01:01:00,339 --> 01:01:08,890
case and I want to use them to be closer

1119
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:12,059
and to describe the use case a lot of

1120
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,058
symmetry yes

1121
01:01:14,849 --> 01:01:22,930
actually as a chair yes it's a good good

1122
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:25,420
thing to do when card you you sorry

1123
01:01:22,930 --> 01:01:27,788
but if you really want to propose use

1124
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:30,789
case please be quick because we're

1125
01:01:27,789 --> 01:01:34,240
already on the dock on the track on the

1126
01:01:30,789 --> 01:01:36,839
solution draft and actually they are

1127
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:40,808
also included some use cases in the a

1128
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:42,788
solution draft so we'd like to see is

1129
01:01:40,809 --> 01:01:44,980
there any differently okay you your

1130
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:46,599
scales for your side or you have the

1131
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:51,900
same concern with the current solution

1132
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:54,819
so if more quickly is better okay yeah

1133
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,619
till here I agree I think we need it we

1134
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:58,210
need to list all the possible use cases

1135
01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:00,520
so that we can basically go back and

1136
01:01:58,210 --> 01:02:02,529
check if the dots telemetry is meeting

1137
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,779
those use cases or not and unfortunately

1138
01:02:02,529 --> 01:02:07,240
the original dots use cases does not

1139
01:02:04,779 --> 01:02:08,320
talk about perimetry so we definitely

1140
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,279
need a dots use case

1141
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:15,520
for telemetry well as a chair since that

1142
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:18,240
it's probably was to st. if to include

1143
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,640
use cases in the telemetry dropped

1144
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:24,580
because it's always easy for reading it

1145
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,740
to first look at these cases and then

1146
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:28,930
look at the solution it depends on the

1147
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:30,220
number of use cases probably we need to

1148
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:32,580
judge whether we need a separate

1149
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:35,709
document or just include an additional

1150
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:38,259
introduction sector section describing

1151
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:41,200
common use cases for the tonight rain

1152
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:42,580
yeah it works for me I mean whatever the

1153
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:44,680
working group decides but well let's

1154
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:47,200
start it'swell him although use cases in

1155
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:54,339
one doc and when it's right time we can

1156
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:56,560
make a call whether to decide yeah I

1157
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:59,710
mean if it's like 40 50 pages kisses

1158
01:02:56,560 --> 01:03:05,640
truck when you don't know if it's just a

1159
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:05,640
couple of pages it's thank you

1160
01:03:28,509 --> 01:03:43,579
so the next topic

1161
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:46,578
it seems that well okay it seems that we

1162
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:49,400
have some new items compare it to the

1163
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:56,089
original charter of the working group

1164
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:59,329
and just for the formal purposes we

1165
01:03:56,089 --> 01:04:04,160
probably need to update our charter by

1166
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:08,539
including them into charter so it's and

1167
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:11,328
this documents are partly already we can

1168
01:04:08,539 --> 01:04:16,910
group document for example like server

1169
01:04:11,329 --> 01:04:23,450
discovery and signal go home and that

1170
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:25,879
sends it it's it's probably a worse to

1171
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:31,189
update our chat our charter just reflect

1172
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:33,319
what we are doing and it's not a big

1173
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:38,630
update it's currently just adding a

1174
01:04:33,319 --> 01:04:42,440
couple of working group items grow items

1175
01:04:38,630 --> 01:04:48,410
that were working on so I'm again asking

1176
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:50,890
our AG what does what do you think what

1177
01:04:48,410 --> 01:04:50,890
does he think

1178
01:04:54,259 --> 01:04:58,430
benkei dock yeah so I was actually

1179
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:00,950
looking at the Charter yesterday or the

1180
01:04:58,430 --> 01:05:03,919
day before thinking about the new

1181
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,450
milestones and I agree that we should

1182
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,069
have a little bit more clarity in the

1183
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:10,700
Charter about what we're working on

1184
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:12,650
right now it's a little bit ambiguous so

1185
01:05:10,700 --> 01:05:16,939
I think it's probably worth going

1186
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:22,549
forward with the recharter okay then I

1187
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:24,019
think house tips are to send a new chair

1188
01:05:22,549 --> 01:05:27,619
tied to the working group even if

1189
01:05:24,019 --> 01:05:34,549
everyone agrees and send it to you and

1190
01:05:27,619 --> 01:05:38,070
you'll approve it okay so I think we've

1191
01:05:34,549 --> 01:05:48,620
through our agenda any

1192
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:55,110
questions comments any other business so

1193
01:05:48,620 --> 01:05:57,660
we've done so thanks to everybody we

1194
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:59,870
wish a quick recovery - Frank whiskey
