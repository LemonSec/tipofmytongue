3
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:59,209
okay it's it's time to get started so we

4
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:08,250
need a jabber scribe and a note-taker

5
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:15,959
hello do we get started please we need a

6
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:22,850
jabber scribe in a minute taker thank

7
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:38,210
you beat someone

8
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:49,190
minutes please you're gonna do it

9
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:51,500
Thank You max okay a reminder that we're

10
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,380
under the ietf note well if you're not

11
00:03:51,500 --> 00:04:03,230
familiar with this please get familiar

12
00:03:54,380 --> 00:04:06,920
before you speak posted the agenda a

13
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,119
couple weeks ago didn't see any bashes

14
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:20,120
on the list

15
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:22,910
are there any now okay so the we have

16
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,710
four documents that are with the arrests

17
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,630
one thing so we had this I did a

18
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,280
presentation a while ago which was an

19
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,710
odd amount working draft about a key

20
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,409
update for fifty four eighty it's not on

21
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,430
the list so I didn't think it actually

22
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:38,360
had to be on there because this is

23
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:47,080
updates in the drive harder so five

24
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:51,130
seconds at the end if you got it okay so

25
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:59,719
we have four documents that are with the

26
00:04:51,130 --> 00:05:03,980
is G or the RFC editor I unaware of any

27
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:08,240
thing on the first three that needs to

28
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:09,200
be reported are there well maybe I'll

29
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,660
just it this way

30
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,920
Quinn do you have anything on on either

31
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:19,510
of the shaykhs documents no okay the

32
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:25,070
there's nothing on the hash sigdoc and

33
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:28,690
we had ad review on the you know wrong

34
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,690
document so nothing on that one either

35
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:32,810
so it's room engineer so I think on

36
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:35,060
those four they're all actually with the

37
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:37,750
editor yep I think that's right I think

38
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:40,419
that's exactly right

39
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:45,660
I got it confused with the Seaboard

40
00:05:40,419 --> 00:05:45,659
argument for a moment right okay right

41
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,770
okay so we have one working group

42
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,410
document where we have active discussion

43
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,389
we need to have and then we're gonna I

44
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:03,460
think Bernie's gonna brief that in a

45
00:05:58,389 --> 00:06:09,009
minute and then we have some things that

46
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:11,080
are being considered for charter that

47
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:16,050
charter I believe is on the first

48
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:18,310
Telesat in December so we're going to

49
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:21,190
continue to work on those assuming

50
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:23,979
that's going to pass and then we have

51
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:28,210
some other business of time allows we

52
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:32,289
have a very short meeting today so we

53
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:35,729
want to make sure we get to that the

54
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:35,729
first thing then is Bernie

55
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:55,190
yep you just even if you wish but I find

56
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:55,190
it doesn't work

57
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,720
it works

58
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:25,719
[Music]

59
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:28,330
I'm building a nice clothes okay now you

60
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,120
can hear me my name is Fiona and I will

61
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:35,050
talk about data protection requirement

62
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,270
in use cases we have been talking

63
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,130
already

64
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,900
during two IDF's about the topics so

65
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,449
this time you're not anymore going to

66
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:46,780
into you're not anymore go into the

67
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:51,669
details of the requirements so we wrote

68
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:52,948
our summary that quick recall what

69
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:56,049
you're talking about

70
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,729
on the left side you have a typical

71
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:00,490
email like we have a head on the orange

72
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:02,800
part and the content the green part the

73
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,660
content can be protected by the means we

74
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,550
have the headers usually cannot be

75
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,430
protected or the header section can

76
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,660
usually not be protected and s/mime

77
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:16,810
fredo tom says ok put the whole message

78
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,639
and drop it inside another one which is

79
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,289
the in the redhead oh there cannot be

80
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,020
protected but all the rest can be

81
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:26,229
protected including the original headers

82
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,180
like the orange ones yeah so this is

83
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:31,840
just like to remind you to remind you

84
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,890
what you're talking about then we made a

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,689
document traffic requirements use cases

86
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:42,309
based on the feedback we got last time

87
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:45,339
and some other feedback we get the

88
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:47,349
following things move the implementation

89
00:08:45,339 --> 00:08:49,660
considerations appendix because this is

90
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:53,470
kind of really early work in progress

91
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:56,610
and may have been not recommend that is

92
00:08:53,470 --> 00:09:00,100
talking about the solution then

93
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,779
simplified one requirement this was

94
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,329
about data fields that should not be

95
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:07,839
included in the clear text or they are

96
00:09:04,329 --> 00:09:10,120
not included in the clear text then edit

97
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,990
a new requirement that will also be on

98
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:17,230
the next slide as an open issue that

99
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,700
they may close it's about the case where

100
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:22,980
encryption is only applied without

101
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:27,240
signature that how to deal with that

102
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:29,160
and then we added one example of one

103
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:32,120
implementation doing header protection

104
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,890
which is the pep implementation and

105
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,140
explained it a bit more edits more

106
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,300
information this PCC discussion we had

107
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:41,819
last time that's one of the outcomes

108
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:45,300
from last time

109
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,730
you remember that for pcc's you have to

110
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,490
produce at least two sometimes three

111
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:52,730
different kind of messages PCC to

112
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:55,950
preserve the original purpose of the PCC

113
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:59,010
and the abstract foreshortening Auto

114
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:01,440
editorial changes that's just for

115
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,430
information now I have to slide is the

116
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
open issues

117
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:08,189
I collected for open issues of which the

118
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,189
last one is big proton so the first one

119
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:14,160
I already mentioned is are we now clear

120
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:16,740
that whatever we document here in the

121
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,959
accretion only case so the case where

122
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,630
it's only encrypted we are not saying

123
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:24,210
anything for the sending side because

124
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:26,070
it's not really a recommended state but

125
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,080
we are saying something about if you

126
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:30,420
receive such email and how we created

127
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:33,030
basically documentation of the receiving

128
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,479
side is that the common standing in the

129
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:36,720
room

130
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:42,520
or is it not or can we close this open

131
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:45,460
issue nobody want

132
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:47,140
comment on this so I presume this is the

133
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:55,480
conclusion of the discussion of this

134
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:58,390
issue and it will be like this good then

135
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:00,070
the next one we had one requirement that

136
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:03,430
was not clear whether it should be in or

137
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,580
not like do we want to require a single

138
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:10,719
format that cause all protection levels

139
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,270
like signed only or signed an encryption

140
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,780
which are left do we want the single

141
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:20,050
format or is it okay if it's a shoot or

142
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:22,000
should it be a must or don't we want to

143
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:32,130
talk about that at all are there any

144
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:38,310
opinions on this this is Danny

145
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:41,970
no more from the ACLU I think if we only

146
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:43,979
define signed only messages then we are

147
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:47,610
missing a big chunk of what people want

148
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:51,390
this for I think if we define encryption

149
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:53,520
only without signing we are also missing

150
00:11:51,390 --> 00:11:57,689
a major piece so I think this document

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:12:01,230
needs to have both signatures over clear

152
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:04,350
text messages as well as encrypted

153
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:11,040
messages encrypted messages be signature

154
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:15,690
we thought signature so how do I put

155
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,760
this the receiving end is going to

156
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:19,110
receive messages that are encrypted

157
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,390
whose signatures they cannot validate

158
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:22,950
simply because we are terrible at

159
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:25,530
validating signatures effectively

160
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:28,020
there's using too many error cases so

161
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:29,819
yes we will need to handle the case

162
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:32,579
where your hat message is encrypted but

163
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,960
the signature cannot be validated but I

164
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,030
don't think we should be encouraging

165
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,590
people to create encrypted messages that

166
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:41,910
are not signed okay they could be in

167
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:44,640
line with the point one I also could I

168
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:46,079
still cannot assign your comment was it

169
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:49,410
on there the second point on the first

170
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:53,210
point let me try to do a clarification

171
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,209
this requirement is actually was about

172
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:58,140
the way we do how the protection will be

173
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,760
done the same way for signing an

174
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:02,069
encryption case we don't want two

175
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,720
different ways of doing this yeah I

176
00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:05,580
think it's more of an implied assumption

177
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,530
so I hope nobody contest this but this

178
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:09,720
is just to confirm okay

179
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:16,680
yeah is this this one yeah am i right

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:20,130
yeah yeah let's okay yeah okay so I see

181
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,329
no resistance to keep that in and it

182
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:28,200
would should be probably on a shoot

183
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:30,090
basis for time being okay so any more

184
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:34,150
comments on the point two here honto

185
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:40,540
issue two so

186
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:42,550
then the issue phrase be more difficult

187
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:46,300
actually it was all referring to before

188
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:48,339
we left it open we started the clearest

189
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:51,579
start at an email discussion which

190
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:53,080
nobody was really engaging in to let

191
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:56,550
extent we're like addressing the

192
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:59,170
backward compatibility requirements and

193
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,660
not sure whether we get anything out

194
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,410
today which we drink it out last time

195
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,890
but maybe I should sort so my backup

196
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:13,360
slides it's basically about these

197
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:16,930
requirements and we are pretty clear on

198
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,410
the b1 but all the rest is a bit unclear

199
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:22,180
whether we should do this or not

200
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:24,339
basically it's about feature negotiation

201
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:26,349
kind of stuff like do we need to tell

202
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:28,839
other clients what kind of stuff we

203
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,310
support and one issue was like if if

204
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,570
different clients rating the same

205
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:47,079
mailbox you end up with being in a clear

206
00:14:34,570 --> 00:14:48,760
area so any comments on this or what to

207
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:56,150
do with that how much of this should we

208
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:59,000
address here Alex here

209
00:14:56,150 --> 00:15:02,060
think these to eat well this is sort of

210
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,440
two types of issues distinguishing

211
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:08,290
between for the unwrapped and mobility

212
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,760
negotiation I think we'll get to them

213
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:13,699
but I think there are probably simpler

214
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:15,560
issues that the main choice we need to

215
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,350
make about how we protect the header and

216
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:21,339
once we make the choice it will be much

217
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:26,450
easier to decide you know which ways

218
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:29,690
it's kind of true yeah this is Daniel

219
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:31,340
con Gilmore so I think that this is the

220
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,070
main sticking point that we're running

221
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:36,710
into in thinking about ways to address

222
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,770
header protection and in particular just

223
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:42,530
to be clear backward compatibility means

224
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,710
a legacy client that is capable of

225
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,449
reading the message but maybe doesn't

226
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,000
know about header protection scheme that

227
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,170
we settle on what happens for them when

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,870
they receive a message that has

229
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,160
protected headers hmm that's that is the

230
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,740
that is the specific situation and I do

231
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,089
think that that's a relevant factor for

232
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:07,850
making a decision about how we do this

233
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:10,670
yeah so should it just leave that still

234
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:15,500
open and decide later what we need is

235
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:17,839
that the conclusion of the room I think

236
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:21,590
most of the discussion we'll have today

237
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,020
is sort of related to this and it's

238
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:28,370
variation of this you know UI issues and

239
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:30,260
it yeah yeah so if it for now so issue

240
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:33,560
free will be postponed

241
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:35,900
then what I would like you to know is of

242
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:39,640
those people who have read the draft and

243
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,640
know what kind of requirements are in

244
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:44,840
will we have a complete set of

245
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:47,150
requirements and all their requirements

246
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,340
need to be adjusted so first question

247
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:55,540
again who has read the draft from to the

248
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,540
end it's about topple as last time

249
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,300
Freehan like to yeah okay

250
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:10,010
Ross can I ask you a question

251
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,520
what do you think we should do with the

252
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:20,520
requirements part is it just helping us

253
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:22,170
to make a decision do you want to law

254
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,760
school in the requirements even if we

255
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,790
don't publish the document what they

256
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,710
want to do as a chair I I don't think

257
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:34,050
the requirements are helping us make

258
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:38,070
decisions at this point I think that we

259
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:41,309
need to propose solutions to go forward

260
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:44,990
and have the discussion from that

261
00:17:41,309 --> 00:17:48,300
perspective the I think the requirements

262
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:51,690
got us to a good place where we are now

263
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:54,210
but let's focus on getting a solution

264
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,830
that everybody can live with I think

265
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,420
it's going to be a balancing act as

266
00:17:55,830 --> 00:18:00,059
we've just heard

267
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,710
and so it's can we find a balance point

268
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:07,220
that we can all live with or we're all

269
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:09,900
equally unhappy with right okay so yeah

270
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:15,179
so we didn't go to the next slide or do

271
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:16,800
you have no comment so to the answer of

272
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:18,720
should we publish it I think it'd be

273
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,790
fine to leave it as an appendix to the

274
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:30,000
final solution doc you know that talks

275
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:32,879
for me okay so the next two slides will

276
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,290
be probably causing some more lively

277
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,000
discussions it is one aspect that

278
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:42,000
actually track of these things

279
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,280
not the only one but one aspect we

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,059
already had some comments on a Mike on

281
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,550
this basically how do we deal with

282
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,750
rendering issues at the receiving site

283
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:56,370
Alexei is term for this was Fiat

284
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:59,400
artifacts so some out some situations

285
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:02,040
that the receiving users are confused or

286
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,340
how do we help broke clients that cannot

287
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,320
handle encapsulate the messages and does

288
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:09,270
also not of all the message is because

289
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,960
it's basically it appears to be the same

290
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:17,089
on the mime layer so how do we help them

291
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,309
and what you're talking about this some

292
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:21,589
messages you receive if you receive an

293
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:24,349
empty message in best case you see there

294
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:26,448
is an attachment and sometimes are able

295
00:19:24,349 --> 00:19:28,938
to open it attachment sometimes not and

296
00:19:26,449 --> 00:19:31,849
these kind of things they have been

297
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:33,949
discourse some time ago not true or

298
00:19:31,849 --> 00:19:35,509
whether all of these quarries are still

299
00:19:33,949 --> 00:19:37,639
apply or whether they have been has been

300
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:39,499
some improvements in clients because

301
00:19:37,639 --> 00:19:45,889
anyway need to fix this for for other

302
00:19:39,499 --> 00:19:50,659
messages yeah so that's what we assume

303
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:53,238
that there is a problem in that area so

304
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:56,989
how do we deal with that problems is we

305
00:19:53,239 --> 00:20:00,529
can tell the broken implementations fix

306
00:19:56,989 --> 00:20:01,819
it because if you can't for show or if

307
00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:06,139
you cannot display forward a message

308
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:09,139
properly and of course then you can also

309
00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:14,359
not displayed encapsulate the message is

310
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:17,119
properly this is like one way to solve

311
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:18,799
it and the other one is we are making a

312
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:20,569
new standard that helps the broken

313
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,139
implementation or like that all comes

314
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:27,639
there are weaknesses so I call it the

315
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:29,899
workaround to the broken implementation

316
00:20:27,639 --> 00:20:33,258
which some people in the room probably

317
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:36,049
don't created so walk around or but I

318
00:20:33,259 --> 00:20:38,359
see this way the clients are broken and

319
00:20:36,049 --> 00:20:43,519
are we fixing the clients or are we

320
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:45,319
going to to do it the clients don't make

321
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,959
this anymore like are we fixing

322
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:49,219
something in the format that the clients

323
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:52,969
don't do this we attack all the

324
00:20:49,219 --> 00:20:56,599
anymore so I think I finished the slides

325
00:20:52,969 --> 00:20:58,189
before you give your comment so I just

326
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:59,208
want I think you were referring to Miu

327
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:01,759
and you said some people in the room

328
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:03,979
don't think this is the workaround and I

329
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,479
was going to explain my perspective on

330
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,639
why I think it is a workaround but if

331
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:10,549
you'd rather finish the slides okay that

332
00:21:07,639 --> 00:21:17,389
okay I didn't speak out any particular

333
00:21:10,549 --> 00:21:21,289
what I just made some assumptions okay

334
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:22,779
so this is walk around actually he was

335
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:26,059
one of the key

336
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:28,839
what dissidents of this workaround it's

337
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,170
known as memory hole or nowadays as

338
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:34,419
legacy display you say

339
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:38,550
so the doctrines Cheston you know my

340
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:38,550
know that contains the protected petals

341
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,570
in a structure so it's not like putting

342
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:45,700
the whole message here in a row

343
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:48,790
it's putting like speaking up the

344
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:51,100
message in headers and content and make

345
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,420
to mime attachments I hope I explained

346
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,750
it correctly otherwise you can correct

347
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,850
later it's not correctly explained in

348
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,130
any case it means it's deviation from

349
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,590
the current mime standards which says

350
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,150
like you're up the whole message in it

351
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,770
would allow depending on the

352
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:07,480
interpretation would allow also such

353
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:09,850
things but it's not like how it has been

354
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,740
designed earlier so the current mind

355
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:16,240
standard says you take the whole message

356
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:17,830
and encapsulate it so the conclusion

357
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,840
more or less at this time is we need

358
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:24,010
more research in particular on the

359
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,139
receiving side one thing is if you do

360
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:30,490
such a work around what kind of problems

361
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:32,410
causes this we already know of some

362
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,550
impacts on mime libraries especially if

363
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:35,560
you don't write them on your own

364
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:40,419
libraries if you use some and you need

365
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:42,190
to adjust them and so on is I call him

366
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:48,190
as well side effects have been

367
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:52,960
discovered and also like if it would is

368
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:57,580
a memory hole approach or then there may

369
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,860
be or there are auto wield artifacts

370
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:03,490
whether or not there were also battle I

371
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:05,770
don't know at this time but still also

372
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:07,660
some clients do not display well what we

373
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,210
would do in a workaround as described by

374
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:12,490
the draft op mention above and we need

375
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,010
to update the existing research that has

376
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:16,450
been done earlier on the real artifacts

377
00:23:15,010 --> 00:23:18,820
alike on the clients that do not behave

378
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:22,150
well when header protections apply it as

379
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:24,730
its defined in s/mime I hope I could

380
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:28,800
provide a good summary and open the

381
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:28,800
discussion about this topic how we go on

382
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:40,150
hi Daniel Kongo

383
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,740
I'm one of the authors of the the draft

384
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,679
that describes the legacy display part

385
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:50,050
up there so thank you for including that

386
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:53,200
and mentioning it so the I'm not sure

387
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,870
how many people have read the the draft

388
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,679
auto crypt lamps protected headers up

389
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,469
there

390
00:23:56,679 --> 00:24:03,030
can we people up for raising your hand

391
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:03,030
if you've read if you've read that draft

392
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,600
okay so the same relatively relatively

393
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,030
small number as well so just to be clear

394
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:17,800
that draft just describes two different

395
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:19,750
things that are used in conjunction to

396
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:23,350
try to offer a form of header protection

397
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:26,290
one thing is basically placing the mime

398
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:30,340
headers that you care about at the top

399
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:32,170
of the primary mind part that's sort of

400
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,490
the cryptographic payload and it

401
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:36,520
describes how to how to find the

402
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:38,350
cryptographic payload that's how you

403
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,510
that those are the protected headers and

404
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,790
then it has this additional legacy

405
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,640
display part that is intended to provide

406
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:49,840
visibility to an obscured subject line

407
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,660
in an encrypted email the it does not

408
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,780
stick all of the additional protected

409
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:56,980
headers right every header is protected

410
00:24:55,780 --> 00:25:01,330
in the sense that it is within the

411
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:02,830
cryptographic envelope including you

412
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,649
know message ID and things that the user

413
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:07,570
is never exposed to but the only things

414
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,610
that show up in the legacy display part

415
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:11,470
are the parts are the things that the

416
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:13,719
user would typically be expected to see

417
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:16,900
we call them user facing headers in that

418
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,150
document so that legacy display part is

419
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,360
really only to make sure that a an

420
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:25,150
obscured user facing header is visible

421
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:26,649
to the user of a legacy client that is a

422
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:30,190
client that's capable of decrypting the

423
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:33,580
messages and but it but doesn't know

424
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:36,580
about protected headers so the goal is

425
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:39,909
explicitly backward compatibility for

426
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:46,570
that part but that part is not intended

427
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:48,520
to be treated specially by the receiving

428
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,428
client the only actual special thing

429
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,940
that the client that a non legacy client

430
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:54,430
does

431
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,580
when it sees a legacy display part is

432
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:59,140
hide it because it actually knows what

433
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,669
the actual protected headers are by

434
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,890
looking in a mime structure of the of

435
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:04,990
the of the received message so I wanted

436
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:08,800
to point out that that this legacy

437
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:11,650
display mechanism is one piece of of a

438
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:13,870
broader puzzle for how for how the stuff

439
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:15,580
fits together I recommend I would

440
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:17,800
appreciate more comments on the document

441
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,139
it will get updated again shortly I mean

442
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,970
it's currently documented for PGP mime

443
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,560
because that's where it's actively in

444
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,050
use there are multiple implementations

445
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:27,639
in the wild but I believe it is

446
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,260
compatible with s Prime and I will be

447
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:36,520
expanding it to cover s mine in the next

448
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:39,400
version ok I should be clear I also

449
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:42,460
welcome additional contributors to that

450
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:45,810
draft so if folks are interested in it

451
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:58,590
I'm happy to to work with with you all

452
00:26:45,810 --> 00:27:02,379
right so who are like Alexi still I

453
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:06,850
think this slide in the previous slide

454
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:12,520
is burnish old is trying to get to the

455
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:16,120
sticking point we're at it looks like

456
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:21,190
the only way we can make progress is to

457
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:23,620
analyze how big of impact legacy display

458
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,750
issue is with you know wrapping messages

459
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:29,409
as well as you know memory hole approach

460
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:33,010
and as well as look at api's and their

461
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:33,550
limitations in open source projects and

462
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:36,400
other things

463
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,050
I know it's somewhat open-ended question

464
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,630
how far do we look how many

465
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:44,350
implementations we evaluate but it would

466
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:48,010
be nice at this point to collect both

467
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:50,439
screenshots trying to send you know this

468
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:53,140
heather protected messages to old

469
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:59,020
clients and see how they display to see

470
00:27:53,140 --> 00:28:02,770
how bad the problem is and for people to

471
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:05,410
report issues with API how difficult is

472
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:12,100
for them to handle on the receiving side

473
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:14,230
both approaches um so I think maybe one

474
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:17,790
approach to doing that is to be a little

475
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:20,500
more crisp in the question and then ask

476
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:23,530
maybe through SurveyMonkey or something

477
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:25,450
like that on the list for people to look

478
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:29,080
at their own clients and report what

479
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:30,730
they see yeah and maybe we sort of do a

480
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:34,060
mini interrupt type thing

481
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:36,880
I mean if you have a test message of a

482
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:43,090
of choice a of a test message of choice

483
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:45,730
be sure this is dkg so in draft autocrat

484
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:48,909
lamps protected headers - 0 1 there are

485
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:51,150
test messages and if anybody wants to

486
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:55,330
try to and those test messages work from

487
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:58,690
using their open PGP PGP mime messages

488
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:00,129
and they can be decrypted by the secret

489
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,230
keys that are available in the reference

490
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:06,610
draft that draft refers to another draft

491
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:10,750
that has some sample open PGP secret

492
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:12,310
keys and open PGP certificates that are

493
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:14,710
capable verifying the signatures and

494
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:17,290
decrypting those things so if anybody

495
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:20,680
has an email client that they use or

496
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:23,800
that they work on or just that they know

497
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:25,690
of and have access to that can deal with

498
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,909
PGP my messages and they want to test

499
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:29,710
those things I would love it if you

500
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:34,510
could test it and send back a screenshot

501
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:36,160
to the list to be even more specific our

502
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,629
pointer to the screenshots I will try to

503
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,150
collect those if they come in on the

504
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,860
list but so we have test vectors and I

505
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:43,720
aim to create test vectors for s my

506
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,850
messages as well as I said the next

507
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,320
revision of the draft I will I will

508
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:53,110
happily work with anybody who wants to

509
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:55,510
make as my test vectors if it helps wait

510
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:58,000
in my email client which is what my

511
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:59,950
waist I can generate it the type of

512
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,440
messages so it might be easy for me to

513
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:06,370
just very cool if people want to

514
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,920
volunteer so that I send them messages

515
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:11,050
and they send back screenshots and

516
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:12,970
describe you know or this crush my

517
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:15,129
client or you know this didn't display

518
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:18,220
or this is truncated I think this would

519
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:18,850
be very useful at this point right I we

520
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,440
do need

521
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:23,428
to do this for us mine because that's

522
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,980
what the Charter is here um

523
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:29,440
don't mind helping the other community

524
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:31,630
along as well but that's what the focus

525
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,120
needs to be yeah if we can just have the

526
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:38,380
test messages and have a discussion

527
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:41,168
about what the user experience is with

528
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:49,450
each of the approaches to find that

529
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:51,759
equally unhappy point so the other the

530
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:53,860
other question that Alexa asked so one

531
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:55,629
of them was how do you leg acedia with

532
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,879
these messages and the second question

533
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:59,889
that he asked was how do the libraries

534
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:01,539
deal with them so this effect this

535
00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:03,850
address is Bernie's question here about

536
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,669
adverse side effects on mime libraries

537
00:31:03,850 --> 00:31:09,309
right and I I'm wondering if we can't

538
00:31:06,669 --> 00:31:11,980
ask that as a more specific question as

539
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:15,100
well right so we said I think in this

540
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:16,600
case we want test vectors for the UI we

541
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:20,379
want test vectors and basically

542
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:22,209
screenshots yeah right so my question is

543
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:26,039
what do what is the question we are

544
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:29,259
asking for mime libraries yeah so what

545
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:31,570
the same test messages could be used the

546
00:31:29,259 --> 00:31:39,009
question is what's the response she went

547
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:41,860
back yeah and some well sometimes you

548
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:45,070
can imply the answer from how it's

549
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:47,080
displayed or not displayed and sometimes

550
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:48,700
you might need to dig a bit further

551
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,769
right so the answer might not be obvious

552
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:53,740
so I think you know for example one

553
00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:59,440
issue might be if people have a limit on

554
00:31:53,740 --> 00:32:02,769
how big this header can be from memory

555
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:06,820
keyhole approach that's arguably it's a

556
00:32:02,769 --> 00:32:10,259
bug but if if it trans gates it then

557
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:13,629
would be nice to know and who does it

558
00:32:10,259 --> 00:32:16,929
things like this right so yeah I don't

559
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:20,139
actually sorry the question about the UI

560
00:32:16,929 --> 00:32:21,549
for legacy clients says what do legacy

561
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:23,080
clients do right we're gonna we all

562
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:25,299
acknowledge that the legacy clients will

563
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,779
be with us forever because this is email

564
00:32:25,299 --> 00:32:30,429
and we just want to know what they do so

565
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:32,940
we know what what kinds of things work

566
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:36,779
we are emitting but the mine libraries

567
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:39,570
is more I think a question of do we

568
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:41,759
think that existing mail user agents

569
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:44,210
will be able to do something better with

570
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:47,700
this than what the legacy clients do

571
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:49,259
right will your mind will your mind live

572
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,479
will you be able to make the next

573
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,710
version of your mail user agent actually

574
00:32:51,479 --> 00:32:56,720
work with these messages these

575
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:59,489
protective messages in a in a better way

576
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,049
right what is the upgrade path and

577
00:32:59,489 --> 00:33:03,539
that's a different question from like

578
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:07,049
how is your current mime library choking

579
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:09,239
on this so I would like to like well I

580
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:11,999
think it does matter if it's causing a

581
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,739
crash yes right you're right so there's

582
00:33:11,999 --> 00:33:15,330
so that's one that's one piece of it but

583
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:16,529
the other piece of it is like can we

584
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:20,389
work with it right when Chris has spoke

585
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:23,489
with us I think it was two sessions ago

586
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:26,699
she identified that working with the

587
00:33:23,489 --> 00:33:28,619
mime library that they had was like in

588
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,599
more detail was problematic that they

589
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:32,399
had to actually go like fix something in

590
00:33:30,599 --> 00:33:34,139
the mine library but I don't understand

591
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,268
what that constraint was and I don't

592
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:37,830
know how to ask someone to articulate

593
00:33:36,269 --> 00:33:40,019
that constraint yeah one has to

594
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:44,309
implement to actually understand what

595
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:47,849
problem she ran into and I would like to

596
00:33:44,309 --> 00:33:50,070
bring the risk another aspect I don't

597
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:53,009
know how many s1 implementations to be

598
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:56,509
have in the world and is this really an

599
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:59,519
issue for s/mime implementations we have

600
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:02,549
so far we have no you know that this has

601
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,489
been a problem with PGP mine but I don't

602
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:08,879
know about concrete s mine cases maybe

603
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:13,859
you have known somehow well we have at

604
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:21,509
minimum thunderbird an Outlook I think

605
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:27,779
we have Gmail we have iOS client is as

606
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:31,409
mine capable maybe things like evolution

607
00:34:27,779 --> 00:34:39,029
and there are maybe some Android clients

608
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:41,639
I don't know what volcano that yeah yeah

609
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:45,989
at least six probably maybe more

610
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,440
something like in five in ten together

611
00:34:45,989 --> 00:34:49,020
than

612
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,099
we can ask the list in the day I guess

613
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,379
we did do these things called

614
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:53,940
implementation reports and one of them

615
00:34:52,379 --> 00:34:55,440
was done for CMS and there's a whole

616
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,129
bunch of implementations they're listed

617
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,829
in there

618
00:34:56,129 --> 00:35:00,900
I can tell you sir I've no idea you're

619
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:01,980
not talking to the mic so way back in

620
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,569
the day we did these things called

621
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:05,099
implementation reports when you move

622
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:07,740
standards along the standardization path

623
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,390
and when one was done for CMS and so I

624
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,339
believe that there were nine

625
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:12,839
implementations I have no idea whether

626
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:15,180
they're alive or not but I can certainly

627
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,650
provide the pointer to the thing about

628
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:23,180
what it tested yeah so I think we need

629
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:27,030
six messages to to do this signed

630
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,848
encrypted signed and encrypted and the

631
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:32,450
two approaches so I can also generate

632
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,250
triple wrapped messages now this is fun

633
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:37,500
three layers of with Heather protection

634
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:39,180
you know I think that's I don't think we

635
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,819
can answer the question that's being

636
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:48,540
asked with less than six as well yes

637
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:52,290
okay so how many weeks do you guys need

638
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,060
to put together these I think it would

639
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:56,339
help to have a deadline so I would say a

640
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:01,790
couple of weeks so while we're still

641
00:35:56,339 --> 00:36:04,078
fresh after ITF so middle of December

642
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:06,569
that's when I'm returning from holiday

643
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,180
should I be involved that's that's fine

644
00:36:06,569 --> 00:36:13,560
with me I'm happy I can I can deliver

645
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:16,379
test vectors for the approach that I

646
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,119
documented in that several of us mm-hmm

647
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:21,630
documented in this draft autocrat lamps

648
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:25,619
I can probably deliver them by the end

649
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:28,980
of the week as well so the questions the

650
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:31,680
other two the the other approach that we

651
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,329
want to compare it to right yeah I

652
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,190
probably realistically would say next

653
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:38,760
week I can I can do some stuff on this

654
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:41,099
all right couple weeks is fine yeah with

655
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,930
the holidays approaching bullets but

656
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,680
let's get this started so we could find

657
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:49,618
out what we and I think my call for the

658
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:51,690
people in the room and listening is if

659
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:56,040
you have your favorite clients that you

660
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:59,700
really care about help us in a fantastic

661
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:00,000
yeah exactly you know please yeah send

662
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,509
me

663
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,800
Bernie and dkg emails and well both

664
00:37:03,510 --> 00:37:10,170
tested with with your client well okay I

665
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,360
can't be involved in the next two weeks

666
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:17,010
because I will be in New Zealand

667
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:18,920
I think holiday queries do I have to be

668
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:23,040
involved

669
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:25,170
well we can figure this out you know you

670
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:27,630
can connect me to your co-workers right

671
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:31,220
so we can read it if you guys can sort

672
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:36,350
that out you know not real-time right

673
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:42,120
just before you leave here have a plan

674
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:44,670
okay okay oh great least we have a way

675
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:51,180
to compare these yeah that brings us

676
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:54,510
some basis to choose a solution so what

677
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:57,120
I see is next steps we already discussed

678
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:59,880
on the second last more research and a

679
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,520
bit artifacts we already like decided

680
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,340
now I would like to close the open

681
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,500
issues but probably are not going to

682
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:11,550
close them so you know I have to update

683
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:13,080
to the first forum do we need to confirm

684
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:17,520
the set of requirements on the mailing

685
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:19,080
list which test so reach out to

686
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,780
implement us would also be a good idea

687
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:24,960
maybe this can be combined with the

688
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:27,090
current approach like to see whether

689
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,620
this is it it's based on requirements

690
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:33,960
and update requirements ID and at some

691
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:41,640
point in time you should start on the

692
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:48,350
solution ID okay that was it from my

693
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:48,350
side okay thank you

694
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:58,690
so that is our one chartered item the

695
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:11,890
next thing we want to talk about is

696
00:39:05,109 --> 00:39:11,890
Hendrick with the CMP profile and update

697
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:28,160
yeah thanks for us so I put the status

698
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:30,910
of both of both IDs into one

699
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:43,339
presentation so to be a bit quicker

700
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:46,160
through this okay okay so this is the

701
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:50,240
status of the results of the last two

702
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:54,859
meetings already for the July meeting I

703
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,290
split the profile document into a

704
00:39:54,859 --> 00:40:03,369
profile and and updates document as we

705
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:09,490
discussed in in Prak I included since

706
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:12,500
July the encrypted value exchange with

707
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:15,319
encrypted key as this was discussed as a

708
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:19,510
preferred solution to enable envelope

709
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:22,970
data further the encrypted key packages

710
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:29,260
yeah we started in the recharter so we

711
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:30,459
are in the queue for the the iesg

712
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:35,690
[Music]

713
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:38,690
meeting in in early december and yeah so

714
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:43,760
we decided that the updates EMP should

715
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:46,490
be an standard track RFC at least and we

716
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:52,339
have some milestones for the reach our

717
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:56,270
turing so i think we are a good way okay

718
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:59,740
so status of the lightweight cmp profile

719
00:40:56,270 --> 00:41:03,859
since the last version from july i

720
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:06,189
mainly completed the the content of the

721
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:09,670
document so i added

722
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:14,799
the support of legacy PKI szeliga CCA's

723
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:18,250
with transport of p10 requests I added

724
00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:20,319
this yeah quite quite large chapter on

725
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,769
the central key generation and the

726
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,220
encrypted transport of key packages with

727
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:31,058
different key transport and n key

728
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:33,009
establishment mechanisms I added the

729
00:41:31,059 --> 00:41:36,400
section on the delayed enrollment part

730
00:41:33,009 --> 00:41:41,859
with a polling mechanism and I added

731
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:44,799
some examples for support messages using

732
00:41:41,859 --> 00:41:49,019
this a general message general response

733
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:52,089
feature of CMP and yes oh they are

734
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:56,258
optional but we know that there are

735
00:41:52,089 --> 00:41:59,109
quite some use cases where I'm getting a

736
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:05,279
see a chain updating a root certificate

737
00:41:59,109 --> 00:42:08,078
with this total of certificates and

738
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:12,309
getting some request parameters in

739
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:15,279
advance to an enrollment so there are

740
00:42:12,309 --> 00:42:20,170
some examples of how to utilize is this

741
00:42:15,279 --> 00:42:22,390
general message concept in NC MP yeah

742
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:26,589
what are the next steps for for the

743
00:42:22,390 --> 00:42:29,109
profiling draft so of course discussing

744
00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:32,730
feedbacks from from different sides from

745
00:42:29,109 --> 00:42:40,359
the working group and others or also

746
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:43,900
deciding on whether to incorporate so we

747
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:48,009
have a request response profile

748
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:50,109
specified for enrolling to a new PKI so

749
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:53,400
it's quite academic we could also use

750
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:56,619
this for an existing already trusted PKI

751
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:59,519
but in CMP this is handled with a

752
00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:03,640
different message type so we could

753
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:07,538
discuss whether to specify also this so

754
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:11,680
it's it's it not not really different to

755
00:43:07,539 --> 00:43:14,019
the one with a new PK I actually but we

756
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,038
could could address this as an optional

757
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:20,009
one if yeah I'm happy for for feedback

758
00:43:18,039 --> 00:43:24,940
on on the

759
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:27,900
for this central key generation part if

760
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:34,140
you want to make use of the symmetric

761
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:37,359
key encryption key management technique

762
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:41,049
you need to make use of a shared secret

763
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,750
if you have some one-time password

764
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:46,900
mechanism that you also want to use for

765
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:50,260
the protection of the cmp message you

766
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:52,690
may want to derive a different shared

767
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:59,460
secret from that one-time password for

768
00:43:52,690 --> 00:44:05,829
the key transport mechanism and

769
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:09,240
therefore we propose to use this Mac

770
00:44:05,829 --> 00:44:14,940
this password based Mac parameter

771
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:21,189
mechanism from the cmp Mac Protection

772
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:24,220
even though it it does not fully fit and

773
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,160
I left some some comments in the in the

774
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:30,040
draft the profiling draft and I'm happy

775
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:35,649
for feedback on that whether people

776
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:38,440
think that mechanism fits so there is a

777
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:42,520
section on the transport of cmp messages

778
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:46,359
for file based transport so I'm not sure

779
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:50,619
whether to really fully specify that

780
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:53,529
maybe I just do some some references in

781
00:44:50,619 --> 00:44:56,740
some more general description on what

782
00:44:53,530 --> 00:45:01,780
route to think about if you want to do

783
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:04,930
the message transport on an offline or

784
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,990
file based a transport but yet if there

785
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:11,680
is a feelings about this section please

786
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:13,328
let me know then in the update CMP I

787
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:19,270
will come to that and then on the next

788
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:24,339
slide we added three extended key usages

789
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:27,339
for use in in CMP and I would like to

790
00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:30,130
incorporate and describe how to make use

791
00:45:27,339 --> 00:45:32,850
of this in the context of the profile so

792
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:37,690
this is something I didn't manage to do

793
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:40,210
since the last update yeah we have some

794
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:43,870
our IDs that are needed especially for

795
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:46,510
the support messages they need to be

796
00:45:43,870 --> 00:45:50,560
specified and registered at the Ayana

797
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:52,120
and yeah of course the security's

798
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:55,660
consideration I have to think about

799
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:59,859
whether to add new parts to that or not

800
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:04,180
and of course polishing and and typos

801
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:13,720
are still to be done okay any questions

802
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:19,180
to the CMP profiling document okay so

803
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:22,660
the CMP updates is much shorter so what

804
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:25,960
I did since the last update I added the

805
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:29,440
section on these extended key usages so

806
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,340
we think three extended key usages are

807
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:36,760
quite quite helpful one to specify keys

808
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:40,750
of a CMP certification Authority one for

809
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,830
CMP registration authority and one for

810
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:47,290
the a CMP key generation authorities

811
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:50,529
specifically used when you have central

812
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,660
key generation because generating a

813
00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,880
public/private key pair on behalf of

814
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:59,160
some other entity is a really specific

815
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:05,170
role and this I think should probably be

816
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:09,730
yeah identified yeah I added the section

817
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:13,270
or I updated the chapter on encrypted

818
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:16,300
values in the CMP document with regard

819
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:19,509
to making use of encrypted key and

820
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:23,200
therefore envelope data but I kept it

821
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:25,330
quite short and the details on how to

822
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,770
make use of it and how to implement it

823
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:34,480
are than in the profiling document yeah

824
00:47:29,770 --> 00:47:39,130
I did some minor generalization in two

825
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:42,670
sections of the CMP document one is on

826
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:45,600
nested messages so there wasn't or there

827
00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:49,380
is currently a sentence that

828
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:54,960
you should only incorporate CMP messages

829
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:59,360
of the same type in nested messages we

830
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:03,030
do make use of nested messages also for

831
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:05,400
bundling messages on an array sigh to

832
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,040
forward that and we cease as a

833
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:11,190
disadvantage if you are restricted to

834
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:13,320
only incorporate the same message types

835
00:48:11,190 --> 00:48:16,140
in one nested message and therefore we

836
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:18,660
would propose or like to propose to to

837
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:23,580
just delete the sentence actually we

838
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:28,710
didn't find any good reason why to to

839
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:32,580
restrict ourselves that much the second

840
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:36,660
part is while writing the profiling on

841
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:41,279
the polling mechanism we realized that

842
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:44,250
the polling was not or whether the the

843
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,130
pkcs 10 certificate request transport

844
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:49,410
was not covered by polling and we

845
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:54,960
thought quite a while about it this is

846
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:59,460
finally I think because a pkcs 10 or P

847
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:03,090
10 CR CMP message has no request ID and

848
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:05,820
as Kent can typically only be used with

849
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:08,730
one request in one message and as it is

850
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:12,390
a restriction we anyhow half was a

851
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:16,440
profiling and we would therefore like to

852
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:21,000
to open cmp also for polling on peat

853
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:26,790
NCR's in case there is only one request

854
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:30,930
in it so both are quite generic and as

855
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:33,690
in general I have a hard question I'm

856
00:49:30,930 --> 00:49:36,930
not understanding the reason for the

857
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:42,750
extended key usage for a CA you either

858
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:45,180
have the search sign key usage or the

859
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:47,840
basic constraints with the CA value set

860
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:49,830
to true to know whether it's a

861
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:54,570
certification Authority what does this

862
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:58,990
additional way of telling provide you so

863
00:49:54,570 --> 00:50:01,770
finally if the CA signs the cmp message

864
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:04,060
you may not want to make use of the CA

865
00:50:01,770 --> 00:50:06,369
certificate and key for this and

866
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:09,310
therefore the CA may want to use a

867
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:12,310
different key and different certificate

868
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:18,070
but still it's the CA that signs a

869
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:21,970
message and I'm not understanding the

870
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:24,070
flow that you just described so - to

871
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:28,540
make sure that you are not using the C a

872
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:30,610
key too often you may not want to make

873
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:33,130
use of the same key for signing

874
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:36,880
certificate than for protecting CMP

875
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:40,480
messages and therefore a CA may want to

876
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:45,540
use a different key and certificate for

877
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,540
signing the CMP messages I see thank you

878
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:57,310
okay other questions okay so what are

879
00:50:53,470 --> 00:51:00,279
the next steps for this yeah of course

880
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:06,790
discussing whatever feedback there is

881
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:10,960
and at the extended key usages to the

882
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:13,779
profile document asset adding the oids

883
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,650
for these key usages and register them

884
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:20,140
at Ayana of course at the security

885
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,350
considerations part there is a

886
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:27,100
completion of the asn.1 module needed

887
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:31,270
maybe I I need some guidance on how to

888
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:35,310
do and how much - - railing is needed to

889
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:38,770
add to this draft and yeah of course

890
00:51:35,310 --> 00:51:45,700
polishing and typos need to be done -

891
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:48,119
yeah so that's it from my part okay

892
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:48,118
thank you

893
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,700
sorry

894
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,220
seconds remember this but there's also

895
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:57,319
there's also a key search for

896
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,580
registration authority in CMC so you

897
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,530
might look there so you don't need to

898
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:04,040
necessarily register a new one you can

899
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:06,619
just use it we could yet just use it so

900
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:12,020
that's a point of discussion yeah as it

901
00:52:06,619 --> 00:52:13,610
is named CMC RA I yeah just I would like

902
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,650
to think that that'll aid that that

903
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,480
string is not encoded in any way there

904
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:20,210
anyone any normal human being would read

905
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,960
that it would be perfectly fine I'd be

906
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:29,050
fine with that

907
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:29,050
thanks Sean Reid Zoids

908
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:35,810
okay okay

909
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:37,490
thank you thank you other topics we were

910
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:43,970
going to talk about today Michael

911
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:45,680
Richardson on the RFC 70/30 esthe I did

912
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:54,680
not get any slides so I'm assuming you

913
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:58,520
have little to say yeah thank you I

914
00:52:54,680 --> 00:53:01,580
posted a new document which I think has

915
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:07,009
Russ's nicely ASN module that Sean

916
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:12,109
formatted nicely and like that's really

917
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:16,690
it right there's there's a third issue

918
00:53:12,109 --> 00:53:20,180
that I with which there's a rata on and

919
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:23,170
I'm not qualified to understand it at

920
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:25,640
this point so I'm seeking help for that

921
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:28,160
but mostly the working group said they

922
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:31,520
needed to retire and to adopt this

923
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:35,118
rather short document so please read it

924
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,009
and yeah chairs will do something I go

925
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,100
home right a little bit of a backlog

926
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:42,980
there yeah so I don't think it's a big

927
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,500
rush or anything just you know let's all

928
00:53:42,980 --> 00:53:47,030
please read the document and if you have

929
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,790
some expertise on the third piece of

930
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:50,780
errata I don't I really just I just

931
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:53,740
don't get it

932
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,740
so thanks

933
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:10,670
Shawn I posted your slides but they're

934
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:36,589
not appearing here you got to reload the

935
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:38,480
whole agenda page hello my name is Shawn

936
00:54:36,589 --> 00:54:41,540
Turner these slides should look very

937
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:46,099
familiar as they are exactly the slides

938
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:48,230
that I presented at IETF 105 so why am I

939
00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:50,839
here

940
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:54,440
54 80 section 3 provides some

941
00:54:50,839 --> 00:54:57,049
information about key usages first the

942
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:00,710
sort being subject Pablo key info for

943
00:54:57,049 --> 00:55:03,230
our IDC public key ID ECM PvE and hi de

944
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,900
CDH but only only seven of the nine

945
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:08,059
values are described that seems like a

946
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:10,490
flaw um

947
00:55:08,059 --> 00:55:14,089
so we'd like to fix that so what we're

948
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:16,040
proposing is to provide new requirements

949
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:17,750
for the key insight from it and data

950
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:21,200
insight from Ian say that they must not

951
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:23,180
be set for those things um I will

952
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,339
chanter channel Ryan sleeve he he was

953
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:28,160
not here who said yes please this has

954
00:55:25,339 --> 00:55:30,859
caused us problems in the past please do

955
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:33,920
so so that's it the draft is like

956
00:55:30,859 --> 00:55:35,839
literally a page long but the extra

957
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,109
boilerplate from the IHF it's maybe one

958
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:41,509
and a half please adopt me when you can

959
00:55:39,109 --> 00:55:47,450
I will said I will send a set a message

960
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:50,079
to the mailing list once I sit down yeah

961
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:50,078
that's what I want

962
00:55:52,990 --> 00:55:55,990
Thanks

963
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:21,950
we're way running out of time we have

964
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:23,900
less than five minutes so I'm not even

965
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:27,200
gonna put my slides up just gonna say

966
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:34,369
there's a CMS update for algorithm

967
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:36,859
protection document if you have CMS

968
00:56:34,369 --> 00:56:40,819
embedded in your brain you'll understand

969
00:56:36,859 --> 00:56:43,069
quickly that when you could there's two

970
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:46,099
hashes computed to sign a message

971
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:48,740
one is you hash the content that value

972
00:56:46,099 --> 00:56:50,270
gets put in a signed attribute then you

973
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:53,359
take all the signed attributes and

974
00:56:50,270 --> 00:56:58,040
compute the hash over that and that's

975
00:56:53,359 --> 00:57:00,440
what gets signed the issue is that with

976
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,660
the number of hash algorithms we're

977
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,599
getting that have all the same lengths

978
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:08,149
it might be possible to do a hash

979
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,000
substitution attack if it turns out that

980
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:13,700
one of these hash algorithms is weak so

981
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,800
the proposed text says use the same hash

982
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:21,759
algorithm in both cases don't get

983
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:23,869
tricked and points to RFC 62 11 which is

984
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,540
include a message that has the

985
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:29,930
identifier for the hash as well as the

986
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:33,290
hash values themselves that's it it's

987
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:37,759
kind of a situation where we used to

988
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:39,980
have only one algorithm that was 256 bit

989
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,200
long and that is no longer the case and

990
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:47,810
so we just want to include the algorithm

991
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:50,598
identifier the protection max you asked

992
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:54,910
for sometime in the if time allows and

993
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:57,980
I'm gonna say time is not allowing so

994
00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:01,730
that's I believe we've reached the

995
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:03,079
agenda end because of that I don't think

996
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:08,109
he could have gotten your point across

997
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:11,569
in three minutes anyway so is there any

998
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:17,598
other business than Max's presentation

999
00:58:11,569 --> 00:58:21,470
that will take less than two minutes in

1000
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:25,550
that case we're we're done and have a

1001
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:28,359
good dinner blue sheets can somebody

1002
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:28,359
bring them forward
