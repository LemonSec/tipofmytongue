1
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:23,930
okay good morning everyone welcome to AI

2
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:25,910
ppm and welcome to IETF 106 so since

3
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,700
this is the first meeting we hear it was

4
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:34,790
the note well please do take the time to

5
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:36,050
look through this and have know the what

6
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,440
you're getting into by participating

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,968
here and I'd have up if you haven't look

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,820
at this before the blue sheets are going

9
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:48,440
around so please do sign your name on

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:52,339
all of those as well so we have a pretty

11
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:55,190
full agenda today so today we will not

12
00:00:52,339 --> 00:00:57,079
be necessarily having time to go through

13
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,879
any lightning talks at the end we did

14
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:01,820
have a couple people with lighting

15
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,170
content and so you can look at that just

16
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:08,150
on the list of slides that we have so we

17
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,560
will be starting with just some status

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:11,660
on the documents that we have in the

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:15,380
group and then we're gonna cover some

20
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:18,619
stuff from Greg about stamp the stamp en

21
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,289
document and the option TLV after that

22
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,320
we're going to get an update on our

23
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:27,560
registry documents from Al as well as

24
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,179
the route the ARA document we're also

25
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,860
going to get some time to talk about

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:32,750
multi-point Altmark and the updates

27
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,880
there and then we're gonna have a fairly

28
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:39,770
long chunk to talk about all the work on

29
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,970
the various I am documents so these are

30
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,429
all the working group documents

31
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:46,460
recovering after that we do have some

32
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,310
time allocated to go over other work

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,559
that is not yet adopted but has been

34
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,980
receiving good discussion on the list

35
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:57,650
that we are interested in as a group do

36
00:01:54,980 --> 00:02:03,119
we have any agenda bashing any thoughts

37
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:05,880
here all right

38
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,690
so looking at the status since we met

39
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,739
last time we have adopted two new drafts

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:16,079
so we have the IOM Flags document was

41
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:19,379
officially adopted and then we also did

42
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,700
adopt the ipv6 options document and this

43
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:25,739
is based on the feedback from 6-man the

44
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,679
stamp document is in the RFC editor

45
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:31,650
queue so that's great

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,330
couldn't get that shipped and the metric

47
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,670
registry and initial registry documents

48
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,980
are currently and I is she waiting on ad

49
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,798
write up and we did get some feedback

50
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:42,869
there from Ayane about the registry

51
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:44,430
request and I assume that I will be

52
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:48,000
going into more detail on the status

53
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,500
there and the other document we have

54
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,970
that's out there is teaming up being

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,950
still remaining in miss Roth and

56
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,599
hopefully that gets cleared up as all

57
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,230
these other documents push through so

58
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:01,859
I'll be great I think that's all we have

59
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:10,380
here so with that Greg do you want to

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:19,639
come up it's working it's working so far

61
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:25,220
let me know if it doesn't all right okay

62
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:25,220
so the update on the yang model is that

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:51,180
trying again okay yeah okay so we

64
00:03:48,109 --> 00:03:54,989
discussed and we had a very good

65
00:03:51,180 --> 00:04:01,859
comments from Hendrick neidell from

66
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:08,090
Assyrian about their resolution for

67
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:11,760
their timestamp and looking at

68
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,160
applications that are in out reliable

69
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:21,500
latency silo of 5g

70
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:24,560
we agreed that it will be beneficial if

71
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,250
their unit would be a nanosecond not a

72
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:32,500
microsecond so that what we have changed

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:35,960
we changed units for their delay and

74
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:43,850
delay variation from microsecond to not

75
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:53,380
a second okay any questions objections

76
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:53,380
to that these are 32-bit nanoseconds

77
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:59,150
it's a gauge - yes so every two-bit

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,489
minute seconds means the max val is four

79
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:05,890
seconds yes that's that's what we

80
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:10,400
thought for delay we made it 64 god I

81
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:13,880
think that we need to go back yes for

82
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,419
the delay it's a 64 so which gives us

83
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,710
plenty of delay but for delay variation

84
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:23,600
yes your variation okay okay okay yes we

85
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:26,630
actually we discussed that and we

86
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,910
decided well we might get by with the 32

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:34,460
for delay variation but again because

88
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:38,870
this is a working group document we made

89
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:41,680
this change and we proposed it so if

90
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:44,350
there are any questions concerns please

91
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:50,300
bring it on the list

92
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:55,670
next okay no just a little bit back so

93
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,920
and for the percentile we made the

94
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,100
change because it was a different units

95
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,890
so but now it's the same nanoseconds

96
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:08,150
because that that would make sense for

97
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:13,340
the percentile another change that we

98
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:15,260
made is their way of expressing the

99
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:19,989
request for the percentile to be

100
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:23,180
reported it used to have three decimals

101
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:25,669
now actually now incorrect myself it

102
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,830
used to have two decimals which allows

103
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:29,830
you to do 99.99

104
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:35,470
there was a suggestion okay why not to

105
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:40,510
make it bizarre and make it five

106
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:43,600
decimals because we do have space so now

107
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:48,730
if you can express five nines after

108
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:53,980
their decimal point so if there is any

109
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:55,870
questions concern please bring it up and

110
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,660
we'll talk about it but that's for now

111
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:03,220
what is potential to express as a

112
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:07,090
percentile request next please

113
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,510
so there UDP port we had a discussion in

114
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:14,080
the list about what could be used as a

115
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:22,990
destination UDP port and the agreement

116
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:27,789
is that one it's 862 which is a sine 2t

117
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:32,350
womp test protocol and then it's a user

118
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:36,130
range and a dynamic range the user range

119
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:39,700
does bring their potential for the using

120
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:45,159
stemmed packets as a denial of service

121
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:48,880
attack but well in another hand we were

122
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,890
told is that operators would like to use

123
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,490
this tool as a simulate certain

124
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:57,539
application so basically to be to to

125
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:01,210
have a higher level of guarantee or

126
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:03,880
chance to follow the same path if you

127
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:06,039
share the destination port address with

128
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:08,710
your application and usually that

129
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,020
probably can be done and used we need

130
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:14,560
you're doing a service activation

131
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:17,650
testing so when there is no active

132
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:22,840
traffic so you're not piggybacking on

133
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:24,880
your active application again if there

134
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:30,070
are any questions concerned

135
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:35,140
please bring it up next slide please

136
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:37,299
okay so we still all a lot of updates

137
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,150
and improvements to the text with the

138
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,979
reference and everything to address all

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,490
the comments received as

140
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:48,850
early young doctor review we'll be

141
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:53,320
working on it now more actively once the

142
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:57,430
base specification is out of our hands

143
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:04,420
and being published and comments are

144
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:06,280
welcome always any questions okay

145
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,360
so let's discuss it then on the list

146
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,360
next please

147
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:25,990
extension draft next no it's fine yes

148
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:30,000
so we do have two new coffers who

149
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:33,700
welcome Eddie and their Nesta and they

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,820
contributed to new extensions that are

151
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:40,990
excess report TV and follow-up telemetry

152
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:45,520
TLV please next slide so what is excess

153
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:49,720
report Tilly it comes from performance

154
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:54,370
measurement function that is worked by

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:58,270
3gpp and their intention is or at least

156
00:09:54,370 --> 00:10:01,360
one of the proposal is to use stamp

157
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:07,240
protocol as a performance measurement

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,540
function in a TSSs but it does require

159
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,820
or with it was considered that it will

160
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:16,630
be convenient if the same protocol in

161
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:21,250
addition to measuring performance will

162
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:24,760
be able to do some specific 3gpp pass

163
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:27,580
information in in way of announcement

164
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,510
and this is the purpose of excess report

165
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:34,270
TV which provides the information about

166
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:38,200
excess identifier and the return code

167
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:41,140
which simply signifies basically working

168
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:43,960
available and not available that's for

169
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,780
now and excess identifier actually it's

170
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,930
a very simple clear for characterizes

171
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,709
the XSL whether it's one of the

172
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:55,819
technologies that define by 3gpp or then

173
00:10:53,710 --> 00:11:01,310
just identifies as

174
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:05,560
non 3gpp access and because this is more

175
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:10,630
like even its announcement but it

176
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:15,380
requires explicit acknowledgment so once

177
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:17,990
there note sends this packet stamp

178
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:23,230
packet with the access report TV its

179
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:29,630
arms the timer and then if timer expires

180
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:32,150
then it may repeat the report and there

181
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:35,990
should be a mechanism to control the

182
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:39,850
timer I think that their default value

183
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:44,200
is set probably like three seconds and

184
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:47,720
default number of transmissions

185
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,210
consecutive transmission is four but

186
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:57,620
again that requires control so that can

187
00:11:50,210 --> 00:12:04,940
be change okay let's go next follow-up

188
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:08,390
telemetry TV I think that back in or one

189
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:11,780
T one documents with this especially in

190
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,480
t1 this document we discussed that for

191
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:17,390
the reflector and the same for the

192
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:22,940
sender to get accurate timestamp is a

193
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:26,840
challenge because the timestamp better

194
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:29,240
to be recorded in the packet as close as

195
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:33,470
possible to the physical transmission of

196
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:37,810
the packet so to exclude queuing which

197
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:40,130
introduces delay variation that's

198
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,469
effectively that's the purpose of this

199
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,470
but that's basically to collect the

200
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:48,290
follow-up telemetry from the reflector

201
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:52,430
and I can explain why the sender is not

202
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:56,150
critical because especially in a virtual

203
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:59,630
machine environment the sender may get

204
00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:01,579
their physical timestamp from their

205
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,270
hardware once the packet being

206
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,850
transmitted so it can associate this

207
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,819
value even the value in a packet was

208
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:11,570
different

209
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:16,170
so the sender does know the real

210
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:18,780
transmission timestamp the problem is

211
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,819
more on the reflector side because the

212
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:22,740
reflector puts the timestamp then time

213
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:24,990
stamp is passed for the transmission and

214
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,680
when their Hardware passes this

215
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:32,460
timestamp to their reflector application

216
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,709
in the packet long gone so that's the

217
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:38,760
purpose of follow-up telemetry TLV it

218
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:43,230
may be included in a consecutive stamp

219
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:46,410
packet so that real transmission

220
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:50,070
timestamp for the preceding packet will

221
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:52,949
be returned to the sender in this way

222
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,450
basically you can associate and because

223
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:57,060
it has a sequence number of that

224
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:59,490
preceding packet so you can associate

225
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,859
the real time stamp of a sending packet

226
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,530
on the sender with the real time stamp

227
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:15,240
on the reflector and get more accurate

228
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:17,430
measurements hi Sarah banks correlate I

229
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,790
have a question are you are you

230
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,729
proposing then if I set the time stamp

231
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:25,500
in hardware send it to a reflector the

232
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,150
reflector can't consume for whatever

233
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,160
reason that time stamp you're allowing

234
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,590
the reflector to overwrite the time

235
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,500
stamp with its own time stamp no no no

236
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:37,500
okay no again in a packet in the stem

237
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,500
packet there we are collecting three

238
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:42,930
time stamps so their sender transmission

239
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:46,590
time reflect the receive time and

240
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:49,829
reflector transmission time this is the

241
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:52,770
follow-up information so basically in

242
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,920
addition it's a TLV that follows stamp

243
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:59,310
packet and it collects specifically on

244
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:03,510
the information that the reflector may

245
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:07,859
have from the hardware if we believe

246
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:12,540
that it may it has access to their more

247
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:14,970
accurate time stamp for the proceed

248
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,920
Paquette it doesn't override any other

249
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:20,690
information at times them that we

250
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:20,689
normally collect in the stand packet

251
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,689
it's an additional information okay

252
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:27,599
let's okay

253
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:29,850
let's imagine this their sender sends

254
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,400
the packet it received by their

255
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:35,580
reflector and then the reflector

256
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:38,760
prepares that reflected packet and sends

257
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:43,970
it back so in the packet that it sends

258
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:48,000
back it has three time stamps okay

259
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:50,930
the next packet from the sender will

260
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,150
come with the follow-up telemetry T of V

261
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:57,150
so the reflector will put all three time

262
00:15:54,150 --> 00:16:00,569
stamps relevant to that second packet in

263
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,579
a stamp packet and then there are times

264
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,440
them it acquired for the preceding

265
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,800
packet it will put in the follow-up

266
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,170
telemetry TV so there is no override

267
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,449
there is nothing no information is

268
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:19,020
overwritten its additional information

269
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:20,880
is the confusion about what that extra

270
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,040
time stamp is representing because it's

271
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,820
yeah the actual transmission time right

272
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,670
well again the reflector doesn't know

273
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:33,690
it's actual not but if there is a

274
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:36,020
situation that hardware provides or

275
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:38,340
system provides with a more accurate

276
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,290
time stamped on the physical

277
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:43,080
transmission of the packet and this

278
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:45,270
information are at least in some systems

279
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:47,970
available to their application that

280
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:49,380
requested the transmission it's not

281
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:51,090
clear to me how an application would

282
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:54,960
make the decision that the reflectors

283
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:58,200
time stamp was more accurate than the

284
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:05,610
sender's no it's not the sender's all

285
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:07,230
there don't come to the mic

286
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:08,550
how do you know this the sender didn't

287
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:11,130
put our Hardware time stamping in the

288
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:11,609
first place no sender doesn't involve

289
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,620
here

290
00:17:11,609 --> 00:17:20,879
this information is returned by the

291
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:25,688
reflector Albertan this this seemed to

292
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:28,240
make sense to me but maybe maybe

293
00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,960
deserves more description in the draft

294
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,870
great okay thank you sorry Rick Taylor

295
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,309
um I understand what you're doing here I

296
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:37,689
I have a couple of quick questions and

297
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:40,658
it might be my lack of knowledge in stem

298
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:43,059
no how does the application that's

299
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:44,919
actually consuming this telemetry know

300
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,629
that follow-up tlvs

301
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,179
are going to be used for this particular

302
00:17:46,629 --> 00:17:50,469
path and perhaps not for that path where

303
00:17:49,179 --> 00:17:52,090
is the negotiation with the user

304
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:56,379
application ah okay

305
00:17:52,090 --> 00:18:00,850
that's under some random fourth TLV oh I

306
00:17:56,379 --> 00:18:04,418
forgot about that sequence no okay again

307
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:08,080
the assumption is that this information

308
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:11,080
is returned for really immediately

309
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:15,779
preceding packets understood yes okay

310
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:18,610
so true there is no assurance that our

311
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:22,210
packets even consecutive packets follow

312
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:24,399
the same path understood again but if if

313
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,850
I'm writing an application this is using

314
00:18:24,399 --> 00:18:30,820
stamp how do i as the application in my

315
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:34,120
control loop know that I have to wait

316
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:36,939
for the follow-up telemetry TLV you know

317
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:39,610
don't get the accurate timestamp or just

318
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,940
say hey I've had my response I've got my

319
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:45,939
three times I can I go act okay okay

320
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:50,230
good question because instantiation of

321
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:52,960
the test session is based on some

322
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:56,350
management and one of this would be yang

323
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,480
model so you would know whether you want

324
00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:00,759
to use follow-up telemetry and whether

325
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,159
your reflector will support follow-up

326
00:19:00,759 --> 00:19:05,620
telomerase so pre configuration here has

327
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:14,740
depend on both ends yes okay understood

328
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:16,989
things you could have in a I have a

329
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:18,669
little bit more a process related

330
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:21,220
question and it's more on the previous

331
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:23,080
till the Edit because since this

332
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,970
document was adopted as a working

333
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,789
document you not just added to T of ease

334
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:29,830
to it right so like how much more do you

335
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:31,090
want to add and how do you like why does

336
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,949
it have to be in this document you could

337
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:34,299
also follow doc documents that will be

338
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,200
discussed separately by the working

339
00:19:34,299 --> 00:19:38,960
group and especially the previous govt

340
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,140
so there's no

341
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,539
work in 3gpp that is adopting stamp

342
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,610
already for any kind of measurements and

343
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:48,350
I'm not sure how likely does is so maybe

344
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,969
this TIV is not even needed at all

345
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:51,709
there's no decision made so maybe that's

346
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,070
too like premature to actually edit to

347
00:19:51,710 --> 00:20:02,000
the draft okay point taken

348
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:06,320
thank you sorry Rick Taylor again I'm

349
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,580
going back to the previous TLV and I

350
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,689
suppose I need to go away and read the

351
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:15,049
draft properly actually there there is

352
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:20,840
mercy reflected so it's basically it's

353
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:23,139
very special case for their 3gpp PMF

354
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,320
requirements what they want to do and

355
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:29,840
decision was that yes if we use stamp as

356
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:32,689
a performance measurement function then

357
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:35,959
why not rather than introducing a new

358
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:39,740
mechanism use existing mechanism to do

359
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:42,320
this state reporting okay so I'm

360
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:46,010
involved with doing a lot of performance

361
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,200
measurement on non 3gpp radio rings so

362
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:49,940
I'm really quite interested in sorry

363
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,149
I've got a cold I'm really quite

364
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:59,000
interested in this sort of extension

365
00:20:53,149 --> 00:21:03,379
point for non 3gpp radios so a I need to

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:06,320
get involved and be I'm not sure this is

367
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:08,029
cooked yet I think there's some more

368
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,428
that could be done here to make it a bit

369
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,899
more powerful so I need to understand

370
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,419
better what you're trying to achieve

371
00:21:11,899 --> 00:21:16,699
with this kov there will be excellent so

372
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:24,260
let's talk together let's bring you the

373
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:27,350
to the list and let's make it okay so

374
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:29,770
yeah comments are welcome I think that

375
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:31,850
working group was go it's a premature

376
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:33,860
yeah yeah that makes sense

377
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:36,189
alright thank you for sharing this I

378
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:40,340
think based on this discussion a couple

379
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:43,130
follow-ups a you know since we are

380
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,389
adding tea leaves here which I think you

381
00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:45,799
know can certainly be appropriate but

382
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,320
since this is a working group document

383
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:50,149
we do want to get a good idea that the

384
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,879
working group user this in consensus oh

385
00:21:50,149 --> 00:21:54,919
I think we can maybe have like an

386
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,890
just kind of getting consensus on these

387
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,200
TVs make sure if there's any concerns

388
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:02,030
about them that can be raised and we can

389
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,740
see if these are appropriate to take for

390
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:06,020
the access report TV I think we've heard

391
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:07,700
feedback that having something that's

392
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:10,600
generic would be good and to the point

393
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,240
of the interaction with 3gpp it may be

394
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:16,370
easier if we you know allow it to be

395
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,400
used for other cases such that if 3gpp

396
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:22,399
doesn't decide to use it it's still fine

397
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,290
and I think we do want clarification I

398
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,510
read through the texts again for the

399
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:27,649
follow-up flow injury and at least my

400
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:29,480
impression is training to help you

401
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:31,640
measure the delay between software and

402
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,070
hardware transmission reflector in a way

403
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,990
it was like kind of explaining why you'd

404
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:37,580
notice I think would help get to the

405
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,310
point because I think it's useful but we

406
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,129
need to have clarification sorry very

407
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:46,070
good question again underlying my lack

408
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,760
of knowledge on stamp is there any kind

409
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:52,389
of inbound session in band extension

410
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:55,900
negotiation within stamp at all it's all

411
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:59,240
band pre-configuration so from a process

412
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:01,100
perspective you could move ahead with

413
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,590
the raw stamp but the basic core stamp

414
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,629
documents and then produce later drafts

415
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:07,550
which say this is extension have an eye

416
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,920
on a registry or whatever is required

417
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,070
for I don't need a registry there's no

418
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:18,400
code place so you can split this up from

419
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,399
a process perspective okay thank you

420
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:40,100
okay hi everybody I'm al Morton and

421
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,389
we've been working on big teams

422
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,490
basically have been working on a

423
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,940
performance metrics registry and the

424
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,960
initial contents of that registry since

425
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,540
2012 can you believe it

426
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:53,000
let's finish it up okay and and really

427
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,930
we're damn close now and you can see

428
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,970
that right here

429
00:23:55,930 --> 00:24:01,190
the IETF last call is complete and

430
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:04,250
willing about that after me Ria's review

431
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:06,880
Mary's review was very good we made a

432
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:10,060
lot of changes and drafts 11 and 20

433
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,340
the contents and the registry design

434
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:15,220
itself are the result Thank You Maria

435
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:18,340
so now we have the Jen art and the

436
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:21,310
security reviews and and they really

437
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:26,770
were mostly about helping Ayane do its

438
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:28,720
job and that's good but we also got an i

439
00:24:26,770 --> 00:24:31,780
Ana review during last call and they

440
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,910
basically said what the last line is you

441
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,649
know they their reviews complete but

442
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,450
they'll work with the author's to

443
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:39,730
establish and populate the registries

444
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:43,450
and that meeting happens this week I've

445
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:45,220
seen Michele cotton she's here if

446
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,800
anybody's interested in joining that

447
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:50,170
meeting with Michelle and me and the

448
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:53,350
rest of the Guyana staff to sort out the

449
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:56,230
the last details Thank You Benoit will

450
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,350
will do that Ronnie even who commented

451
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,850
for Jen art may be willing to do that as

452
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:06,939
well so the big knockout for

453
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:09,370
understanding this registry and what it

454
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:11,320
is has been a mock-up that we created

455
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:14,379
and we're trying to get Ayanna to post

456
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,639
that in a like a temporary place so

457
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,700
we're going to work that out this week

458
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:21,400
too and here's why the registry itself

459
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,740
is is fairly complex it's got all these

460
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,560
categories of summary metric definition

461
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,900
method of measurement output

462
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:31,570
administrative info comments blah blah

463
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:34,480
blah I Anna is only going to deal with

464
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:37,210
the summary column and have a link to a

465
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,960
text file that displays the rest and

466
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:42,850
here's how that looks in practice so we

467
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,800
start out here we have the registration

468
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:46,990
procedures now incidentally that's going

469
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:50,500
to change when I first met with Michelle

470
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:52,450
about this years ago she said please

471
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,700
make this expert review please make this

472
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,680
expert review please make this expert

473
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,440
review just like like saying Beetlejuice

474
00:25:56,680 --> 00:26:01,840
three times and and so I got and so I

475
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,700
heard her and we made it expert review

476
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,679
but it looks like it would have it's

477
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:09,070
better to make it specification required

478
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,360
because that includes expert review so

479
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,220
now you know we're gonna make that

480
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,550
change and who are the experts its

481
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,280
performance metrics experts and and so

482
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:20,889
forth so this information should really

483
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,870
go in the in the registry design

484
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:25,320
draft as well not just the mock-up so

485
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:27,550
it's a it's a performance metrics group

486
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,409
we're gonna have a performance metrics

487
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:31,780
registry and and really there's two

488
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,340
registries included below there but

489
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:38,889
there's I think we've actually designed

490
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:42,280
more now so the summary includes an ID a

491
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:44,650
name for the metric the URIs which we've

492
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:47,950
reduced now just to the URL to the text

493
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:50,950
file that's HTML eyes that brings you

494
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:53,560
all the good stuff and about building a

495
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:55,780
metric and method of measurement that's

496
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,070
compliant and we have a nice description

497
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:59,830
there that nobody's going to be able to

498
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:02,139
read today at all my apologies

499
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,270
the reference the change control is an

500
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,750
open issue Michelle told me when we

501
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:10,450
added that it should be IETF there was a

502
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:13,570
discussion about it that maybe it might

503
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,720
become iesg I don't know if that

504
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:17,919
discussion has concluded but we will do

505
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,860
the right thing we'll put the right

506
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:25,590
value in when we're done okay so let's

507
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:29,409
just take it as that we know that the

508
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:32,679
that the names like RT delay active IP

509
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:35,350
UDP periodic blah blah blah that's that

510
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:38,260
that's going to that's going to evolve

511
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:40,719
over time as we get more metrics so we

512
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:42,629
want the metric name elements to be a

513
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,620
registry that people choose from as well

514
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:47,110
extensible registry just like the

515
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:49,959
metrics and we will be able to add to

516
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:53,040
those four different things that we

517
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,360
measure okay

518
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:57,430
does anybody in the working group want

519
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,500
to raise issues on these two drafts now

520
00:27:57,430 --> 00:28:06,120
or forever hold your peace thank you Mir

521
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:08,650
yeah I mean I just noted that it says

522
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,620
expert review or maybe specification

523
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:13,090
credit in future and IETF standards

524
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,290
action is that on purpose that you only

525
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,290
want proposed standards and not

526
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:19,270
information or documents in here we know

527
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:22,000
we don't want we do want specifications

528
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:22,360
I think we have a fairly high bar for

529
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,190
this

530
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,830
it's got to be metrics that are in

531
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:30,310
widespread use and we don't want to be

532
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:34,480
sort of blasted with with metrics that

533
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:34,870
are yes I think you don't have industry

534
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,520
consent

535
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:39,100
let's put it that way you want a

536
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:40,809
specification and expert review if you

537
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:43,059
if you assign based on a specification

538
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,950
or if you have an hour see you don't

539
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:46,570
need the expert review is that weird oh

540
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:47,950
no no you still need expert review

541
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,750
because somebody's gonna build

542
00:28:47,950 --> 00:28:52,180
somebody's gonna have to build the

543
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:54,460
metric entry and the experts are going

544
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:56,680
to review that as well as the specific

545
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:58,830
with the support of the specification

546
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:04,020
because at least on your slides it says

547
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:06,879
ITA expert review or standard section

548
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:08,620
right right so that's gonna be standards

549
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,300
well I guess it's gonna be reference

550
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:14,889
required that's a special occasion yeah

551
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:17,260
that's we're gonna change it to yeah I

552
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:20,620
haven't I didn't update this I and then

553
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,990
sorry sorry sorry sorry

554
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:24,729
good good catch I have to fix that yes

555
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:26,860
please Rick Taylor very good question

556
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:28,750
are you still reserving some

557
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:30,879
experimental space these things are hard

558
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:32,679
to do and will need a little bit of

559
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,809
random space to build experiments to

560
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:36,910
work out whether what we're doing makes

561
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:41,020
any sense at all before bringing it to

562
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:42,940
the IGF here's what you can do we

563
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,440
already found out when going through

564
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,240
working group last call that there was

565
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,670
like an experimental non experimental

566
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,390
but a private version of this registry

567
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:54,670
being built in Brazil and that was kind

568
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:58,720
of cool and they helped us clarify a few

569
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:02,260
things so I would say you know build

570
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:05,650
your metric test with it be able to tell

571
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:07,890
us what how widespread it is and and and

572
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,720
whether the meth whether the met

573
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:14,110
specification of it works with

574
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,540
sufficient energetic clarifying answer

575
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:20,229
can you go to you go to your example a

576
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:23,740
registry thing yeah show me a show me

577
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:24,010
the thing with the IDs I'm going the

578
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,870
wrong way

579
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:31,000
yeah yeah yeah right so that ID number

580
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,639
that's not a code point that's gonna

581
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,270
show up on the wire that is that is you

582
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:40,440
int in you int infinite length T right

583
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:42,879
right so like there is the practical

584
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,220
limitation that like you probably want

585
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,320
your your names to be less than four

586
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:48,340
kilobytes so the set of names is like

587
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,649
the set of possible

588
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:52,500
four kilobyte UTF strings which i think

589
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:55,000
is large enough that I mean there's no

590
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:58,960
that yet there's experimental space

591
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,820
because there's no there's no scarce

592
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,250
identifier space that were allocating

593
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,110
either okay if someone were to then

594
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,419
build a protocol that used this registry

595
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:10,449
and say I'm going to use the ID we'd

596
00:31:07,419 --> 00:31:12,279
have to talk to them but um like the

597
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:13,510
registry here has like a whole bunch of

598
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,309
pointers to this working group so as

599
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,470
long as this working group is here and

600
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:20,350
it's been here since 83 so I think it's

601
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,580
gonna be around for a while um then you

602
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:24,939
know they would come to us we would say

603
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,320
don't make this a UN date T but I don't

604
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:29,470
think that needs to be in this doc

605
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,320
though because the doc is not like

606
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,700
though the level of metrics that we're

607
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,649
dealing with in this registry and the

608
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:38,549
transports we're gonna use for those are

609
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:41,168
going to be not such that we really have

610
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:43,510
constrained space like it would not make

611
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:46,710
sense to have this this this ID be a

612
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:53,850
constrained integer space okay thank you

613
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:58,059
better answer much better good thank you

614
00:31:53,850 --> 00:32:00,490
cool um no requests for the floor so

615
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:02,408
I'll send to the list when I schedule

616
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:05,110
something with Michele cotton and her

617
00:32:02,409 --> 00:32:07,690
staff from I Anna folks are willing to

618
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:10,120
join us please do and let's move this

619
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:12,039
along this is too big drafts that's been

620
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,250
around for a long time it's it's helping

621
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:17,830
get stuff off our milestones thank you

622
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:18,940
thank you so yeah we'll get you'll send

623
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:21,070
out an update of when you're gonna meet

624
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:23,440
with Ayanna and then hopefully after

625
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,970
that we can get update of yeah the

626
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,200
outcome of that to the list and then

627
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:31,149
when do we expect probably to have

628
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:34,289
another Rev to incorporate that it could

629
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:37,389
be this week I'll try to edit while

630
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:46,500
Michelle and I and Benoit are talking do

631
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:51,780
it live yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so

632
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:55,050
next we have Al yes okay

633
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:59,129
so a couple years ago we started on a

634
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:01,110
draft on route metrics and Carlos Pena

635
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,290
Tarot gave it a cool name the advanced

636
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:08,179
unidirectional route assessment aura

637
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:12,930
that just identifying that acronym so

638
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:15,480
we're at version 5 last time we had

639
00:33:12,930 --> 00:33:18,300
Frank bottners review which helped us

640
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,750
change the terminology instead of the

641
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:23,399
old RFC 2330 host we're using node now

642
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,920
throughout the document and but we've

643
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:28,970
retained that where it makes sense

644
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:32,400
that's a quick one there so that's cool

645
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:34,290
we've differentiated some of the

646
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,020
limitations that we were discussing in

647
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:38,790
section 3.6 about trace basically

648
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,879
they're about tracer a child methods and

649
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:44,220
getting back the same my IP address from

650
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,990
the from the host that's not going to be

651
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:49,380
true for hybrid so we fixed up a lot of

652
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:52,380
items and 3.6 to say that there's

653
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,620
differences when you use the hybrid

654
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:00,860
methods so then the formatting of the

655
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:05,250
results we decided not to update RFC 53

656
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:07,800
cents punt the future development of

657
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:10,199
that to a yang model and the working

658
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:13,529
group agreed footers comments and

659
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,270
questions were also about that resulted

660
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,460
in adding another requirement for for

661
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:19,530
the future model the original sender's

662
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,149
time stamp so we got a list of

663
00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:27,540
requirements now in Section three six so

664
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:31,168
then we said in IETF 105 back in

665
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:33,750
Montreal we said we'd like to see a

666
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:36,960
working group last call at IETF 106

667
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:39,210
started here at least and now with the

668
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,980
result resolution of those comments and

669
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:43,080
the new drafts we think we're ready for

670
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,030
that and that would help us you know

671
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:49,379
move what we believe is a very mature

672
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:54,600
draft on its way and so working group

673
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:56,730
last call please see a show of hands of

674
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,750
how many people have read Beck recent

675
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:02,800
version of this document v6 hey Carlos

676
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:08,240
put up your hand

677
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:10,790
all right yeah sounds good so I mean

678
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,919
please do take a look at this and I

679
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:16,820
think if we do a we can get a last call

680
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,420
going for that sure I mean we will send

681
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:23,810
out an email you wanna send out an email

682
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:26,750
hmm yeah give it three weeks and yeah

683
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:29,000
please do read through this and race any

684
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,770
issues you see but yeah it would be

685
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,650
great to get this moving along cool

686
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:40,550
thank you thanks everybody I think I

687
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:45,980
saved you some minutes oh geez FAA

688
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:48,980
coming up and like this was the so we we

689
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:50,450
wedged this onto the agenda at the last

690
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,280
minute and a great expense because we

691
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,879
just completely forgot about you I'm

692
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,010
sorry

693
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,890
we gave you five minutes we're actually

694
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,630
running a little bit ahead so you can

695
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:01,629
you can use a little bit more than five

696
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:12,910
okay good morning this is an update of

697
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:16,700
our multi-point alternate marking draft

698
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:18,649
just a summary about the idea we want to

699
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,899
introduce this intelligent rhyme

700
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:25,100
approach so we started you may recall

701
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,950
from our FAC 8321 that allowed unicast

702
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,080
point-to-point flows performance

703
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,000
monitoring and we moved to this

704
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,370
multi-point alternate marking approach

705
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,920
that allowed monitor of general

706
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:39,380
multi-point anycast flows without any

707
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,780
constraints so what is the motivation

708
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:43,790
the main motivation it is resource

709
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,700
consuming to monitor all the flows and

710
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:49,820
all the paths continuously so we should

711
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:53,509
figure out a way to make these in a

712
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:56,180
flexible way the solution is to put

713
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,100
intelligence into the system so to give

714
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,930
the intelligence to the controller to be

715
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,870
able to manage the performance

716
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:05,839
measurement and for example it can start

717
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:10,339
without examining in depth the network

718
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:13,850
and then go deep if the problem have to

719
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,230
be analyzed in some position so there

720
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:17,210
are two ways to act

721
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:20,869
if we go to the implementations the

722
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:24,320
first way is of course to specify the

723
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:27,230
traffic filters to find more detail it

724
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,570
flows to be monitor it or the second way

725
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,329
of course is to activate you new

726
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,760
measurement points and how we activate

727
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:36,710
two new measurement points by using the

728
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:39,890
clustering and network clusters

729
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:41,720
partition so networkers clustered

730
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:44,750
partitions allowed the division of our

731
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,480
network graph into clusters the third

732
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,220
and smallest sub networks that we can

733
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,099
identify and this class that can be also

734
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,220
combined in different way to activate of

735
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:58,400
course new measurement points the change

736
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,740
that we did from the zero to version was

737
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,050
in particular we added the reference I

738
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:07,009
remembered the comment from Jose Ignacio

739
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:09,890
and we added the reference from to a new

740
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,450
paper that is about the definition and

741
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,118
mathematical formalization of the

742
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:16,399
algorithm for cluster partition so that

743
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:20,329
it can be applied for every kind of

744
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,480
graph and you can download this paper

745
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:26,000
but also I became aware that it was

746
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:29,599
published so you can also find on I

747
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,470
Tripoli Explorer by yourself anyway is

748
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,300
also available on this website just look

749
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,169
again at the algorithm

750
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:43,099
this is the iterative approach we can if

751
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:46,670
we have a network graph we can the first

752
00:38:43,099 --> 00:38:49,060
step is to group the links with the same

753
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:52,760
starting node so for example in this

754
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:55,160
network graph in figure we have we can

755
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:57,500
identify five group with the same

756
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:01,490
starting node and then in the second

757
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:03,980
step we can join the group with the at

758
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:05,660
least one ending one node in common so

759
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:08,270
in this case for example the group

760
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:12,259
number two and group number three will

761
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:13,970
be joined to to be the cluster two so in

762
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,760
general for these Natur graph we can

763
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,339
identify for cluster this is just to

764
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,740
give you a view in this case it's very

765
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:24,380
simple but you can imagine that if you

766
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,828
have a network graph more complex we can

767
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:29,060
make this at a different level and we

768
00:39:27,829 --> 00:39:31,430
can also combine

769
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:33,650
the different clusters at different

770
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:40,040
level to activate more measurement

771
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:42,080
points so just a recap on what kind of

772
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,940
measurement we can do so this is a

773
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:46,250
complete performance measurement

774
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,480
framework so we can measure the packet

775
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:55,430
trust on multi-point on multi-point path

776
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,310
basis or we can do that for single flows

777
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:01,848
or for dual network so these give you

778
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:04,240
the flexibility to measure packet loss

779
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:06,470
at a different level such as I said and

780
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:09,229
in addition of course the delay

781
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:12,169
measurements that in same way can be

782
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,810
done can be done it at different level

783
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,330
so we can measure the delay on

784
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:20,570
multi-point but basis that this means

785
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:23,150
that the delay has the meaning and is a

786
00:40:20,570 --> 00:40:26,660
representative of the multi-point path

787
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:30,530
or we can do this in a traditional way

788
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:33,950
on single packet basis in this way we

789
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:37,609
should ask the help of the another FSC

790
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:40,640
that is the 5475 about the hashing

791
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:44,839
selection because the double marking

792
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,509
methodology of the fs8 321 does not work

793
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,440
for multi-point pot so we should use the

794
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:53,750
ashing approach to couple the samples

795
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,450
and but in this case it will be

796
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:59,359
simplified because we can use the

797
00:40:56,450 --> 00:41:01,848
clusters to couple the our samples in

798
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,580
terms of space and we used of course the

799
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:06,830
marking method to couple the samples in

800
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,440
terms of time so in this case the

801
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:14,270
decouple the coupling of the our samples

802
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:17,900
is very simple okay the next step so the

803
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:20,450
document is stable and we want to the

804
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:23,869
outers suggests to begin the path to

805
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:28,480
become erect see if you have additional

806
00:41:23,869 --> 00:41:28,480
inputs comments of course our work

807
00:41:31,109 --> 00:41:36,209
so I'd like to see a show of hands on

808
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:40,950
this one who's who's read and reviewed

809
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:45,269
this document one two three four or five

810
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:48,930
okay good so by beginning the path to

811
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:50,578
become an RFC is that a is that a

812
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:54,899
sidelong request for a working group

813
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:59,400
last call or yeah yeah I think we've

814
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:09,029
seen well let me actually have a look so

815
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:17,309
many data tracker tabs open there's

816
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:18,779
November 4th right yeah do we want to

817
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:22,079
start it go ahead and start over last

818
00:42:18,779 --> 00:42:24,479
call on this one we can do that - we can

819
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,200
pipeline it yeah okay so we will well

820
00:42:24,479 --> 00:42:29,729
we've had bad like like we've done a

821
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,989
couple of times where it's like yeah we

822
00:42:29,729 --> 00:42:32,189
have a working group last call let's

823
00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:33,479
start another working group less call

824
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,819
after that first working your close call

825
00:42:33,479 --> 00:42:37,828
and we forget about it because like the

826
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:42,180
this working group last call just

827
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:43,890
started for um to end on December 9th so

828
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,319
then we do want on December 9 that ends

829
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,848
at Christmas are we gonna do that we're

830
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:49,229
gonna remember they do that as you're

831
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:50,910
saying our track record here is not

832
00:42:49,229 --> 00:42:53,819
great okay cool

833
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,859
so okay Tommy is putting a reminder in

834
00:42:53,819 --> 00:42:57,390
his phone so we're gonna start a working

835
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:59,699
group last call on this one once the

836
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:03,449
working group last call on on Ora is

837
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,829
done which will be December 9th and then

838
00:43:03,449 --> 00:43:07,199
we'll click the buttons and make that

839
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:09,089
happen and then that will probably end

840
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:12,269
yeah like a couple of days before

841
00:43:09,089 --> 00:43:13,469
Christmas so and then yeah we'll

842
00:43:12,269 --> 00:43:14,729
definitely have it done cuz I must

843
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:18,779
present yeah exactly

844
00:43:14,729 --> 00:43:21,198
there you go okay cool alright thank you

845
00:43:18,779 --> 00:43:21,199
very much

846
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:28,799
so next up we got Frank oh you're okay I

847
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:36,989
was looking for you earlier you're

848
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:42,440
hiding back there we have loads of time

849
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:47,990
right 25 all right so um

850
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:50,839
quick update on clicker so quick update

851
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:53,169
on the three wicking group adopted IOM

852
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:56,240
graph so not the whole kind of enchilada

853
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,980
so the oldest and I think most well

854
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,279
discussed document it's the data draft

855
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:05,180
as we typically refer to it so the data

856
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,829
draft has seen two updates since the

857
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,009
last meeting and I'm going through them

858
00:44:06,829 --> 00:44:12,260
sequentially so the first one is

859
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:16,670
addressing or the zero six two zero

860
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:18,170
seven update basically adjusts well a

861
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,960
detailed review from are you

862
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:23,180
and another detailed review from Tom

863
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,589
with the additional feedback folded in

864
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,210
from the hackathon that we've done at

865
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:31,279
1:05 and so there's two types of main

866
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:33,890
updates that we received from there so

867
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,390
the first and that's I think the the

868
00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:40,759
technical real update was a

869
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:45,290
rearrangement of the flags feel that we

870
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:48,170
have for the various data fields in in

871
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:51,230
IOM and so the starting point of that

872
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:53,599
rearrangement was that out of the hacker

873
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:59,540
column hackathon came the suggestion

874
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:03,200
saying well you have 24 bits for the the

875
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:06,290
various data fields what if we ever run

876
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,720
out of that so we need to go on at least

877
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:11,690
have one field or one bit

878
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,509
dedicated to future extensibility so

879
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,450
let's reserve one of that if you reserve

880
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:20,599
one of those well make it the last bit

881
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:26,020
in the field oh the last bit was taken

882
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:28,730
so 23 was already taken so we wanted 23

883
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:32,000
means like from there you kick off

884
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:35,780
another range of additional changes that

885
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,050
roll into that so we made room for that

886
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:41,930
and then the additional thing was if you

887
00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:44,030
look at how I um data fields a structure

888
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:46,700
right now we have two types of data

889
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:49,460
fields we started off the the initial

890
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:53,859
journey with always fixed format data

891
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,570
fields were they with a defined syntax

892
00:45:53,859 --> 00:45:59,390
so all the fields like node

893
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,950
the interface identifier timestamps and

894
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:02,900
the likes they all have fixed format

895
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,580
which is good for a hardware

896
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,290
implementation but later on I think

897
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:08,150
people said well I want this and this

898
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:12,230
and that I want flexibility so we also

899
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:15,020
have to Yuri style formats which is what

900
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:18,470
we call the opaque snacks rabbit so

901
00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:22,190
opaque snapshot field a little bit of a

902
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,950
funny name for a Tod formatted content

903
00:46:22,190 --> 00:46:27,860
there and the argument out of the

904
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:29,839
hackathon was like don't really give me

905
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:31,700
a field structure if I need to go and

906
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,110
implement that that I have something

907
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:35,060
fixed format then I have something

908
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,040
flexible format followed by something

909
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,900
fixed format again so not a great idea

910
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,259
so it's much better to have something

911
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:44,510
fixed format and then well have the

912
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:46,160
flexibility later on so that from a

913
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:49,430
parsing perspective things become more

914
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:55,009
simple that meant okay you want to go

915
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:58,520
and have the opaque snapshot field after

916
00:46:55,010 --> 00:47:02,050
all the fixed fields that means opaque

917
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:07,310
snacks takes reference to opaque opaque

918
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:13,550
state snapshot especially at 3:00 a.m.

919
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:16,640
in the morning right it is now bit 22 so

920
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:19,640
that everything is fixed prior and then

921
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,980
you have opaque state snapshot I'm

922
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:24,410
getting better at it and then you have

923
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:28,220
well anything future that we don't

924
00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:31,670
really know about so bit 22 was taken

925
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:35,930
and then well we kind of move the other

926
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:38,990
stuff around to go and not end up with

927
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:41,390
any holes in the current allocation so

928
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:45,620
that's the bids rearrangement that we've

929
00:47:41,390 --> 00:47:49,009
done as part of oh seven the other thing

930
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:52,580
that really changed is and that's what

931
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:56,270
hyoh drove is when we started writing

932
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:58,069
the document it and if you looked at the

933
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:00,470
the recent version of the document it

934
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,000
would became very apparent that the

935
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,970
document had a shitload of different

936
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,890
authors and given that we did this kind

937
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:09,020
of really get hop style so everybody

938
00:48:06,890 --> 00:48:10,370
implemented something and then we ended

939
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,580
up with things like some

940
00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:15,830
times it was referred to as IOM type

941
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:19,279
some time it was called the IOM header

942
00:48:15,830 --> 00:48:21,590
some times it was called IOM option but

943
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,780
basically we all refer to the very same

944
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:26,360
thing and now the very same thing is

945
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,810
called the IOM option type again not a

946
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,550
beautiful world would but a kind of it's

947
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,230
a perfect compromise everybody is

948
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:35,320
equally unhappy about the compromise

949
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:39,320
why not the IOM option type header

950
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:41,690
header option type don't create a pull

951
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:43,850
request we're happy to hold it in but

952
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,160
make sure that you're catching all of

953
00:48:43,850 --> 00:48:51,500
them so I tried really hard to go and

954
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:54,890
catch all of them and yeah so that

955
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:58,160
cleanup happened along with so we had

956
00:48:54,890 --> 00:49:02,529
certain things that were really given a

957
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:06,170
dedicated section like nomenclature for

958
00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:07,400
the namespace section but other of

959
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:10,480
things didn't really have a dedicated

960
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:13,960
section in section 4 or a subsection

961
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:17,330
that again got cleaned up so there I

962
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:20,000
hope that I kind of made the overall

963
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:22,279
thing more digestible cleaner with the

964
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,650
same level of kind of nomenclature

965
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,290
throughout the document so that we are

966
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:29,300
really ready towards well ultimately

967
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:31,100
working group last call and then I

968
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,900
pushed that oh seven out on the mailing

969
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:35,900
list and well what typically happens

970
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,150
this there's something else that you

971
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:41,090
forgot about and that was issue 135

972
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:47,780
where one little thing that we forgot

973
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:54,980
about to specify was is what happens on

974
00:49:47,780 --> 00:49:59,060
D cap if well what should know do on D

975
00:49:54,980 --> 00:50:01,910
cap and well we believe that it should

976
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:04,400
go and get rid of all option types no

977
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:07,009
matter what for a particular namespace

978
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:09,500
that it's kind of responsible for and

979
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:10,970
that was also not said in the draft so

980
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:15,470
again a little bit of additional cleanup

981
00:50:10,970 --> 00:50:16,129
that is in there and so sent to the

982
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:18,770
mailing list

983
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,390
no comments received but well that's

984
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:23,930
usually there is one more comment you

985
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:26,330
can not do that unless you well

986
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:29,180
we're an idea and we brought up the

987
00:50:26,330 --> 00:50:31,040
question earlier on so I think at 8:30

988
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:33,259
teller was friendly enough to go and

989
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,790
share you'll a breakout meeting or a

990
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:36,980
site meeting like it's called here and

991
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:38,870
bring up the question again is there any

992
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:40,940
comments on the data graph and guess

993
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,810
what it was one and then Greg had one

994
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:47,780
and he posts the question and I want to

995
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:50,060
go and reflect it back to the room it

996
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:52,970
goes back to the earlier thing about

997
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:54,920
what data fields we have today we have

998
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:57,890
data fields that are fixed format and

999
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:01,400
then we have this kind of catch-all tle

1000
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:04,190
style for everybody else now if we look

1001
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:06,200
at the fixed format data fields there is

1002
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:08,380
a little bit of flexibility into the

1003
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:11,960
fixed built into the fixed data fields

1004
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:16,660
because we have short and long format of

1005
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:21,340
for different types of fields node ID

1006
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:25,700
interface identifier timestamp and

1007
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,890
namespace specific data and well these

1008
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,890
fields can be kind of combined even

1009
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:35,330
right so you can have short + white make

1010
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:37,520
it super white so that was us to give

1011
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:39,319
one give us fixed format fields with a

1012
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,420
little bit of additional flexibility so

1013
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:44,480
that people who are really constrained

1014
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:46,940
on space and I know that several people

1015
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,700
are because they say well I'm ready to

1016
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:52,550
go and record 60 bytes I have a diameter

1017
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,549
of say five hops in my network and how

1018
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:59,570
much information can I get really fit in

1019
00:51:54,550 --> 00:52:01,490
so people believe that there is use but

1020
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,160
the question that Greg and I think for a

1021
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,379
really good reason rice is do we need

1022
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:08,359
this kind of interim flexibility should

1023
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,030
we really have something that is really

1024
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:13,730
small and fixed and then if you want to

1025
00:52:11,030 --> 00:52:16,670
go a little wider you end up in the TLV

1026
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:21,290
land or do we want what we have right

1027
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:24,920
now which is small and fixed a little

1028
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:27,560
larger and fixed and well if you want to

1029
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:34,550
go crazy you go crazy with TVs and make

1030
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:36,950
your heart where bleed so I think the

1031
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:39,800
question two the room is do we want to

1032
00:52:36,950 --> 00:52:41,689
go with what we have and if we want to

1033
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,460
go with what we have I think we can go

1034
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,280
and consider really being ready for

1035
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:50,960
finally after 15 iterations of the

1036
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:53,510
document 7ss personal draft and and

1037
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,280
another aid as as working group document

1038
00:52:53,510 --> 00:52:59,030
that we were able to progress the

1039
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:00,380
working last call or kind of how do you

1040
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:02,630
want to go and deal about the question

1041
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:08,570
that was brought up in in the earlier in

1042
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:10,490
the early uh breakout sorry site meeting

1043
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:13,790
it doesn't matter what you call it you

1044
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:18,680
can call it an option type hitter option

1045
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:20,240
type header so uh me from the chair it

1046
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,819
looks like we've sort of lake

1047
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,410
accidentally adopted a model of

1048
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:27,260
pipelining working group last calls

1049
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:30,049
which I actually kind of like so then we

1050
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,670
are so then we're basically saying okay

1051
00:53:30,050 --> 00:53:33,560
well we're gonna we're gonna be doing a

1052
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:34,700
working group last call continually at

1053
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:37,340
this point probably till the next

1054
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:39,080
meeting can we sign you up for the third

1055
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:40,730
slot which would be a working group was

1056
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:45,410
called beginning on the 6th of January

1057
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:47,300
and ending on the 20th of January so

1058
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:50,390
this gives you time between now and

1059
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:52,310
Christmas to make the changes do we

1060
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:53,900
wouldn't start the workers comp we don't

1061
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:57,320
even need a change so maybe you can go

1062
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,570
and at least get a sense in the room for

1063
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,020
whether we need more Jesus otherwise I'm

1064
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,940
sold

1065
00:54:00,020 --> 00:54:04,250
yeah does does anyone here think that

1066
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,110
that we will not be ready to start a

1067
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:09,830
working your boss call in January on

1068
00:54:06,110 --> 00:54:12,050
this one like I you know as somebody

1069
00:54:09,830 --> 00:54:14,450
who's looked at the document and watch

1070
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:18,620
the progress you know we're now sort of

1071
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:20,180
seeing you know the the scope of of what

1072
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:21,440
we're fixing narrowing and narrowing and

1073
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:22,940
narrowing and it's like we've done the

1074
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,430
editorial changes and it's like it's

1075
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,200
it's looking kind of don't we think that

1076
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:30,350
is kind of contentious was moved out

1077
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,910
right right yes and so yeah we should

1078
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:34,100
have a stable base and I think it's

1079
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:37,100
really beneficial for everything that we

1080
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:39,410
do to have a stable base so that we can

1081
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:40,880
go and get the stable base progress to

1082
00:54:39,410 --> 00:54:44,600
working group last call and then we can

1083
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,250
go and deal with the edges right so what

1084
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,930
one question I do have about the

1085
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:48,470
stability so it definitely seems to be

1086
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:50,990
getting worse

1087
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:52,520
we did from the last hackathon and ITF

1088
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:54,500
105 get good input

1089
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:55,849
that's it can you give it update on the

1090
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:57,890
status of essentially those

1091
00:54:55,849 --> 00:55:00,800
implementations that did hackathon work

1092
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:02,750
have they updated to the new stuff do we

1093
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:08,930
have kind of like we have confirmation

1094
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:11,180
that the changes are I seem to be good

1095
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:13,160
and well so if you just be good to do

1096
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:16,368
that also potentially before do we have

1097
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:19,069
people in the room that we've done the

1098
00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:25,880
hackathon before who have been at the

1099
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:37,250
last hackathon it's just in here I don't

1100
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:40,670
seem oh no did you include the oh seven

1101
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:44,000
changes in the I um of the notation for

1102
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:46,849
the kernel not yet it's not yet

1103
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:50,030
all right would that be possible to play

1104
00:55:46,849 --> 00:55:51,950
with before January yeah okay great and

1105
00:55:50,030 --> 00:55:53,569
see whether it's breaking anything right

1106
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:55,700
so that would be helpful okay

1107
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:58,069
so you'd be appreciated to like set an

1108
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,529
update to the curtain on that so yeah we

1109
00:55:58,069 --> 00:56:02,390
will we will then start a working group

1110
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:07,310
last call on this first thing next year

1111
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:09,618
so 60 January you obviously if you have

1112
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:11,509
issues you don't have to wait for the

1113
00:56:09,619 --> 00:56:12,920
working group last call before then it

1114
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:14,690
would be neat if the working group lost

1115
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:18,740
call is just everybody saying thumbs up

1116
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:22,220
so between now and then um greet the

1117
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:24,078
draft figure out if there is anything

1118
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:28,129
that you know needs to be fixed I would

1119
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:31,130
I would say let's presume that there if

1120
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:33,760
there is going to be a new Rev of this

1121
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:37,339
that we just bang that out on like the

1122
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,869
pro KS or vi is a holiday in Germany so

1123
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:40,640
bang that out before Christmas it's not

1124
00:56:38,869 --> 00:56:42,950
a holiday in Germany it's only a holiday

1125
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,328
in Bavaria oh great I was the difference

1126
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:47,270
between these services which are

1127
00:56:44,329 --> 00:56:56,839
commonly forgotten about someone so like

1128
00:56:47,270 --> 00:57:01,880
Germany take the politics out of the

1129
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:05,960
IETF soon yeah so what

1130
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:10,880
various norman germany for you right the

1131
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:13,130
closest bit um so yeah so let's say if

1132
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,860
there is a rev that comes out of

1133
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,660
discussion let's like sort of try to get

1134
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:20,150
that done in december so that on january

1135
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:21,799
we can just hit the button and everybody

1136
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:24,530
says yeah thumbs up and then it's done

1137
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:30,290
on the 20th and then we can try our luck

1138
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:32,600
with the isg before we do this right so

1139
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:34,850
could i get a sense in the room maybe a

1140
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:38,089
voice or two or maybe we can even do a

1141
00:57:34,850 --> 00:57:41,390
hum whether people feel like we want to

1142
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:46,250
stay with the current format of what we

1143
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:48,620
have from a fixed fields rate of that

1144
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:50,480
yeah so this is this wide and short do

1145
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:54,920
we want to go and keep it or they want

1146
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,440
to go and not have white format I think

1147
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:01,070
that was the the thing that kind of

1148
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:08,480
bubbled up in the the earlier in the

1149
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:10,460
earlier site meeting I think any any any

1150
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,330
common any way would be greatly

1151
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:13,940
appreciated

1152
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:15,799
because well if we have say some sense

1153
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:19,070
in the room that people say well let's

1154
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,660
go ahead with what we have at least some

1155
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:22,070
indication right or they go and confirm

1156
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:26,000
that on the list and I'm gonna go bring

1157
00:58:22,070 --> 00:58:28,340
it up but let's any opinions are there

1158
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,130
people in the room with silicon other

1159
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:33,860
than you that would be great because

1160
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:36,920
this is that yeah so um

1161
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:39,020
hey Rach do you have an opinion yeah let

1162
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:44,750
us let us get right because this is like

1163
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:47,150
that could be you like it just I think

1164
00:58:44,750 --> 00:58:50,570
there's people on on online yeah want to

1165
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:55,570
go and rape they can't see it they also

1166
00:58:50,570 --> 00:59:00,080
can't hear you now they can see and hear

1167
00:58:55,570 --> 00:59:02,510
yeah I'm for it because 16-bits may not

1168
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:04,759
be enough for many cases so you want to

1169
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:06,590
stay with what we have yeah although far

1170
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:11,300
the cases where you don't need too much

1171
00:59:06,590 --> 00:59:12,860
telemetry they may be enough so okay

1172
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,750
we say with what we have is like what's

1173
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:15,800
here in this yours yes what's in zero

1174
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:22,970
eight is good enough

1175
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:25,790
yeah okay any other opinions just also

1176
00:59:22,970 --> 00:59:27,169
to clarify so the options that were

1177
00:59:25,790 --> 00:59:30,290
discussed is essentially sticking with

1178
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:32,330
what we have or going to just the short

1179
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:33,830
fixed correct you so some people no one

1180
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:36,080
ever talked about Lysa just doing long

1181
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:37,850
fix know that the suggestion is to go

1182
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:41,360
and well we had that as well

1183
00:59:37,850 --> 00:59:43,460
but kind of that was like we got rid of

1184
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:45,140
that in the site meeting already okay so

1185
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,670
some people said like let's use the

1186
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:48,080
lowest common denominator which means

1187
00:59:46,670 --> 00:59:52,940
the lowest common denominator would be

1188
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:55,700
48 bits for 4 node ID and then 64 for

1189
00:59:52,940 --> 01:00:02,150
interface IDs and whatever so that means

1190
00:59:55,700 --> 01:00:04,299
like packets quite large and and I think

1191
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:07,850
that was like for all kinds of reasons

1192
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:09,500
not considered so I think the option is

1193
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:15,130
to go and drop anything white format

1194
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:15,130
which I believe is fairly constraining

1195
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:22,040
as someone without a dog in this fight

1196
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:26,330
this seems like a perfectly reasonable

1197
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:28,009
compromise for it so this is let's

1198
01:00:26,330 --> 01:00:31,310
definitely confirm this on the list but

1199
01:00:28,010 --> 01:00:33,380
I think most of the people who have an

1200
01:00:31,310 --> 01:00:34,610
opinion your were are in the room or

1201
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,180
were in the room at the side meeting

1202
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:38,180
yeah

1203
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:40,640
so I mean it seems I would be surprised

1204
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,470
if this comes back up so it was there

1205
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:45,020
for a reason right it was put in for a

1206
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:48,020
reason yeah it is there for roughly

1207
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,490
three years for a reason yeah but yeah

1208
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:51,490
well some people always have a different

1209
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:53,689
opinion and I think it's worthwhile to

1210
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:56,200
confirm that we're still off the same

1211
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:58,850
okay now that we're three years further

1212
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,290
sounds like an opinion to me great and I

1213
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:01,520
would say yes this would be surprising

1214
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:05,450
to me please don't surprise your chair

1215
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:07,130
um so if yeah this is we're you know the

1216
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:08,569
working your boss call is where it is

1217
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:10,640
because we want to focus the working

1218
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:13,060
groups attention on one document in time

1219
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:16,279
to get these things out but please do

1220
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:18,680
you know speak up as soon as possible

1221
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,810
because the idea is is that like what

1222
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:23,930
either what we have right now or a tiny

1223
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:25,850
revision will be what we do working your

1224
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:27,410
boss call on based on you know

1225
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:28,400
discussion between now and the end of

1226
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:31,879
December

1227
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:37,210
okay cool all right you watch so next

1228
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:37,210
one flags

1229
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:45,470
so that's actually a draft that tell

1230
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:47,749
wrote wrote for all of us because it was

1231
01:01:45,470 --> 01:01:51,049
text that was originally in the data

1232
01:01:47,749 --> 01:01:53,299
draft was seemingly contentious and well

1233
01:01:51,049 --> 01:01:55,788
following the strategy that we just

1234
01:01:53,299 --> 01:01:57,950
discussed like create ourselves a stable

1235
01:01:55,789 --> 01:02:01,130
base let's move everything that is like

1236
01:01:57,950 --> 01:02:03,919
mm-hmm not entirely sure in to dedicate

1237
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:06,410
a document that's one of the the

1238
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,539
examples and well the the direct export

1239
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:11,269
thing is later on another example where

1240
01:02:08,539 --> 01:02:16,579
we kind of moved things away from from

1241
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:19,459
the the core so since we discussed last

1242
01:02:16,579 --> 01:02:21,349
time we working a rube adopt at the

1243
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,349
Flagstaff what they which is reasonable

1244
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:25,880
because it was in an adaptive working

1245
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:29,630
group adopted talk iam and document

1246
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:32,029
already and it even went through

1247
01:02:29,630 --> 01:02:34,160
additional revisions now that we had

1248
01:02:32,029 --> 01:02:36,109
three flags in there one was called

1249
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,239
active one was called loopback and the

1250
01:02:36,109 --> 01:02:40,249
third one was called immediate export

1251
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:44,329
given that immediate export had another

1252
01:02:40,249 --> 01:02:46,999
raft of discussions and well it has its

1253
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:49,249
own dedicated document now we removed

1254
01:02:46,999 --> 01:02:51,890
even that one out of there so that means

1255
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:52,788
by now it's only two flags in there

1256
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:58,759
loopback

1257
01:02:52,789 --> 01:03:01,670
and the reactive and we had a bit of

1258
01:02:58,759 --> 01:03:03,980
discussions last time like well what

1259
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:07,549
does that mean these flags because they

1260
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:09,259
drive a set of behavior and maybe you

1261
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:12,769
don't want that set of behavior for all

1262
01:03:09,259 --> 01:03:14,599
the packets because well it could go and

1263
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:17,029
course harm if it's really for all the

1264
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:19,160
packets so we clarified and specified

1265
01:03:17,029 --> 01:03:22,279
that well absolutely you want to go and

1266
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:26,319
put constraints in so that you only do

1267
01:03:22,279 --> 01:03:29,720
this for packets that you really want it

1268
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:31,880
in the site meeting and that makes let's

1269
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:35,238
make sure given that my brain is not

1270
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:38,779
entirely working I'm able to read I'm

1271
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:41,630
not really able to remember so that site

1272
01:03:38,779 --> 01:03:42,200
meeting today revealed another set of

1273
01:03:41,630 --> 01:03:43,910
things

1274
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:48,439
we definitely want to go and add to the

1275
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:52,399
draft on loopback and there's that

1276
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:57,590
documentation is already in issue 138

1277
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:01,370
and Barack created 138 for that so the

1278
01:03:57,590 --> 01:04:03,530
first thing is with loopback you were

1279
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:06,650
recording on the way and you're also

1280
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:09,070
recording on the way back nobody knows

1281
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:11,240
why we're recording on the way back and

1282
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:14,900
we couldn't really go and find a good

1283
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:16,790
use case for that so we're gonna go and

1284
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:20,110
I think the the suggestion from the site

1285
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:23,450
meeting is don't record on the way back

1286
01:04:20,110 --> 01:04:26,270
the second thing is loopback only makes

1287
01:04:23,450 --> 01:04:28,819
sense if the sender is also the

1288
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:30,500
encapsulating note cuz otherwise is a

1289
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,550
little funny because loopback is a

1290
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:35,930
probing mechanism it's kind of a fast

1291
01:04:33,550 --> 01:04:39,350
trace route mechanism that's what it's

1292
01:04:35,930 --> 01:04:40,940
built for and so Sandra needs to be on

1293
01:04:39,350 --> 01:04:44,360
cap node we need to go and explicitly

1294
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:47,750
state that and in addition well loop

1295
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:49,340
back only makes sense because you have a

1296
01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:53,270
node that is supposed to go and send

1297
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:57,890
traffic back to the source if there is

1298
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:59,560
indeed a source address in the packet so

1299
01:04:57,890 --> 01:05:02,620
again we want to go and specify that

1300
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:05,630
it's only making sense for

1301
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:08,660
encapsulations where the source is

1302
01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:13,670
indeed part of the encapsulation or the

1303
01:05:08,660 --> 01:05:15,560
packet for C and in addition to that

1304
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:18,050
well we want to go and have a statement

1305
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:19,460
in encapsulation graphs on how loopback

1306
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:21,140
would actually be used for a particular

1307
01:05:19,460 --> 01:05:24,260
encapsulation I think that again makes

1308
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:28,430
perfect sense and in addition to that we

1309
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:33,140
want to have a statement that well even

1310
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:35,299
add notes so a in an IMD capsule ating

1311
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:38,000
note receives a loopback packet that it

1312
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:40,400
hasn't originated it should go and drop

1313
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,830
it again I think from a security

1314
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,350
perspective makes perfect sense it

1315
01:05:42,830 --> 01:05:48,170
should not happen if it happens go get

1316
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:52,160
rid of it so that was really the

1317
01:05:48,170 --> 01:05:53,450
discussion on loopback refining what we

1318
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,890
already have in the draft which is why I

1319
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:55,848
believe I think these site meetings are

1320
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:57,558
super useful

1321
01:05:55,849 --> 01:06:00,680
you get far more active discussion

1322
01:05:57,559 --> 01:06:02,479
rather in the bigger room so things are

1323
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:06,229
more entertaining even if it's really

1324
01:06:02,479 --> 01:06:10,430
early mornings so that is something that

1325
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:13,279
we want to go and do refine on the loot

1326
01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:15,229
bag option in in flax the other thing

1327
01:06:13,279 --> 01:06:17,269
that we have as I set the second flag is

1328
01:06:15,229 --> 01:06:19,189
active active didn't really have that

1329
01:06:17,269 --> 01:06:23,118
much of a discussion but there is one

1330
01:06:19,190 --> 01:06:27,769
thing that again great mirskiy brought

1331
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:29,420
up as well a bit of a clarification and

1332
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:31,249
his question and i think his question is

1333
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:33,380
a worthwhile he said well there is

1334
01:06:31,249 --> 01:06:37,999
active OEM protocols there's many of

1335
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:41,450
them you can add iom information to an

1336
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:43,640
active or william protocol check right

1337
01:06:41,450 --> 01:06:47,749
so you could run BFD and you can add IOM

1338
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:50,629
to BFD why not what is the purpose and

1339
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:52,578
why do we need the active flag in

1340
01:06:50,630 --> 01:06:57,200
addition to adding the IOM information

1341
01:06:52,579 --> 01:06:59,960
and well we the active flag was put in

1342
01:06:57,200 --> 01:07:02,180
to basically help implementers and help

1343
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:04,670
hot where to go and tell them like with

1344
01:07:02,180 --> 01:07:07,910
a single bit you need to go and look at

1345
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:09,829
that need to look at that deeper and so

1346
01:07:07,910 --> 01:07:11,690
that that particular behavior wasn't

1347
01:07:09,829 --> 01:07:14,479
entirely clear from the text that we

1348
01:07:11,690 --> 01:07:18,410
have so we're gonna go and add a

1349
01:07:14,479 --> 01:07:20,808
paragraph that says well the active

1350
01:07:18,410 --> 01:07:24,440
thing is really to help implementers and

1351
01:07:20,809 --> 01:07:28,400
here is why and so the likes of Parag

1352
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:31,579
are gonna go and help specify further

1353
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:33,619
why this is needed in order to clarify

1354
01:07:31,579 --> 01:07:37,579
the use of this you could call it a

1355
01:07:33,619 --> 01:07:38,930
helper bit for implementers so that's

1356
01:07:37,579 --> 01:07:42,819
nothing the discussion that we had on

1357
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:45,078
the active bit in the flax draft and

1358
01:07:42,819 --> 01:07:46,969
that's pretty much if did I forget

1359
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:51,680
anything tell I think you took detailed

1360
01:07:46,969 --> 01:07:58,849
notes in the meeting today okay cool

1361
01:07:51,680 --> 01:08:00,558
so that's it on the flax draft if we're

1362
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:02,839
mature with that could we go and

1363
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:05,630
consider like want to hear anything else

1364
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:07,190
about this whole thing the original idea

1365
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:09,049
was to go and keep it in lockstep with

1366
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:09,500
the data raft because these two were

1367
01:08:09,049 --> 01:08:14,600
good

1368
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:17,299
friends question is should we go and do

1369
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:20,299
this pretty much at the same time line I

1370
01:08:17,299 --> 01:08:25,160
would love to because these guys go hand

1371
01:08:20,299 --> 01:08:28,220
in hand well but only if we are really

1372
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:30,439
kind of stable Miriah you could have

1373
01:08:28,220 --> 01:08:31,970
been so I'm still a little bit worried

1374
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:33,589
about the loopback flack because you

1375
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:35,690
designed a really nice protocol for an

1376
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:39,189
amplification attack here right and

1377
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:41,629
that's usually what we tried toroid

1378
01:08:39,189 --> 01:08:43,099
sorry what are we trying to do you

1379
01:08:41,630 --> 01:08:44,299
designed a really nice protocol that

1380
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:46,100
makes it possible to have an

1381
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:49,399
amplification attack very easy on your

1382
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:52,480
network I think actually that the flags

1383
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:56,870
draft is the is the reflection attack

1384
01:08:52,479 --> 01:09:00,858
the direct export is the amplification

1385
01:08:56,870 --> 01:09:06,649
attack rate because it's direct

1386
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:08,779
so loopback is send a message back right

1387
01:09:06,649 --> 01:09:10,519
you said well right yeah okay right this

1388
01:09:08,779 --> 01:09:16,450
is this is the amplification attack

1389
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:18,230
right and and like the only

1390
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,970
countermeasure you have in the draft is

1391
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:21,858
you should like each device should limit

1392
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:23,540
the number of packets they can send but

1393
01:09:21,859 --> 01:09:24,859
it's like on a per device basis but then

1394
01:09:23,540 --> 01:09:27,528
if you have a past you have a number of

1395
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:29,210
hops and it's still not great I think

1396
01:09:27,529 --> 01:09:30,710
this is just like not acceptable I think

1397
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:33,470
you need to do better than that you need

1398
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:34,880
some kind of you know excess control you

1399
01:09:33,470 --> 01:09:36,799
have to make sure that not everybody is

1400
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:39,109
just can select your network just

1401
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:40,759
sending one packet I think you need to

1402
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:42,799
do more work here if you want to get it

1403
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:47,149
through the whole process so do you have

1404
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:48,740
an idea of so you I mean the idea so you

1405
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,750
have a problem but no solution that's

1406
01:09:48,740 --> 01:09:52,549
always saying no okay I have many

1407
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:54,590
solutions but they might not fill your

1408
01:09:52,549 --> 01:09:56,600
requirements I mean like one is used

1409
01:09:54,590 --> 01:10:00,800
traceroute because that is not an

1410
01:09:56,600 --> 01:10:02,870
implication to take it slow that's we're

1411
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:13,370
trying to solve that trace trace route

1412
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:15,530
is slow for a reason but it has the same

1413
01:10:13,370 --> 01:10:19,460
number of peg if going in and out that's

1414
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:22,190
so so the the fact that a single input

1415
01:10:19,460 --> 01:10:24,560
packet can only

1416
01:10:22,190 --> 01:10:29,809
result in a single output packet of a

1417
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:32,060
generally smaller size is a we have come

1418
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:35,230
in the transport area to understand that

1419
01:10:32,060 --> 01:10:37,699
this is a core requirement for

1420
01:10:35,230 --> 01:10:40,489
networking at that layer if you want to

1421
01:10:37,699 --> 01:10:43,370
not kill yourself I would suggest that

1422
01:10:40,489 --> 01:10:47,540
you set up IOM Flags loopback on a

1423
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:49,190
routing loop in a hackathon and then

1424
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:50,780
this was this is this is like

1425
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:52,009
instructive right like so if you can

1426
01:10:50,780 --> 01:10:53,830
create a routing loop with a loopback

1427
01:10:52,010 --> 01:10:57,140
flag you have now melted your network

1428
01:10:53,830 --> 01:11:01,190
like and I think that's not like set it

1429
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:03,410
up and and watch it burn just it's

1430
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,940
educational it's fun right like the

1431
01:11:03,410 --> 01:11:07,370
lights they come on in and they stay on

1432
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:11,509
forever and then probably a device

1433
01:11:07,370 --> 01:11:13,280
reboots yeah I mean the other I mean

1434
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:15,080
whatever you do here it's more

1435
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,580
heavyweight right so the other option

1436
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:17,809
would be to have some more access

1437
01:11:16,580 --> 01:11:20,059
control so that you actually can

1438
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:22,610
identify the device that has send a

1439
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,870
loopback request and only reply if you

1440
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:25,880
know that this is a device that is

1441
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:28,519
actually supposed to do that so you have

1442
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,170
to add more information to your bacon so

1443
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:32,120
from a strategy standpoint the question

1444
01:11:30,170 --> 01:11:34,969
is do we want to hold up flags in IP

1445
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:36,949
p.m. while we try to make it safe or do

1446
01:11:34,969 --> 01:11:37,790
we want to send the two documents up to

1447
01:11:36,949 --> 01:11:40,820
the iesg

1448
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:42,949
and IOM data goes through and Flags gets

1449
01:11:40,820 --> 01:11:44,330
killed right like so like in the state

1450
01:11:42,949 --> 01:11:48,679
that it's in right now it's not gonna

1451
01:11:44,330 --> 01:11:51,199
pass sector yeah we have other packet

1452
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:54,980
replicators right so if yes but we

1453
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,299
shouldn't make any new ones so so that

1454
01:11:54,980 --> 01:11:58,250
is actually another thing that we could

1455
01:11:56,300 --> 01:12:01,010
do is you could take if you believe the

1456
01:11:58,250 --> 01:12:02,570
document is ready then I would I would

1457
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:08,290
say we should request an early sector

1458
01:12:02,570 --> 01:12:10,400
review and we will see what sector says

1459
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:12,890
we know what the yet we know what thing

1460
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,660
if no no wait wait no we know what one

1461
01:12:12,890 --> 01:12:17,000
of the answers will be we in this room

1462
01:12:14,660 --> 01:12:18,650
have have identified the amplification

1463
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,670
and reflection attack there may be other

1464
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:23,750
attacks wait so it might be um well yeah

1465
01:12:22,670 --> 01:12:24,980
but if you give it to sector they're

1466
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:26,030
gonna find the first hole and then

1467
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,559
they're gonna say no they're not

1468
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:28,639
actually gonna dig on it so we should do

1469
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,410
something about the amplification

1470
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:33,500
reflection attack before we send it this

1471
01:12:30,410 --> 01:12:35,349
idea good point let's do that right so I

1472
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:39,220
think this is why we brought it up

1473
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:40,450
and so let's if you have an idea on how

1474
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:43,120
we could go and deal with that by

1475
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:45,309
constraining access I'm still not sure

1476
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:47,490
how to do that I have an idea on how to

1477
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:49,900
solve the loopback thing

1478
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:56,110
the routing no problem we have solved

1479
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:57,820
that but yeah so I think the routing

1480
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:59,820
loop problem that they talk about is

1481
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:03,099
indeed severe but it's not an infinite

1482
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:05,580
because you do have TTL and when we

1483
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:07,570
restrict the loopback to collect data

1484
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:11,170
backwards then it kind of saw the

1485
01:13:07,570 --> 01:13:12,969
problem so I think it's important to

1486
01:13:11,170 --> 01:13:14,830
solve it but it's not infinite

1487
01:13:12,970 --> 01:13:17,020
now what but I think it's important to

1488
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:19,720
solve it I think that's the thing let's

1489
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:23,500
first solve it before we consider any

1490
01:13:19,720 --> 01:13:26,410
further sending a single packet will not

1491
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:30,030
melt the entire internet forever does

1492
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:30,030
not mean that the problem is you know

1493
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:42,010
that is not that is that is not an

1494
01:13:37,210 --> 01:13:43,720
acceptable um retort to just like yes

1495
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:47,590
this exists you don't want to go on a

1496
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:50,320
pylon yes okay good yeah perfect we have

1497
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:52,720
enough we have a tier we have enough

1498
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,009
foot guns so foot guns are okay or we

1499
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,900
have enough foot guns let's not make

1500
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:58,480
more very like and I'm leaning toward

1501
01:13:55,900 --> 01:14:03,429
the second one so yeah I think the next

1502
01:13:58,480 --> 01:14:05,950
step here is between now and Vancouver

1503
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:08,350
um we go off and think about this four

1504
01:14:05,950 --> 01:14:13,210
flags and we basically have a session in

1505
01:14:08,350 --> 01:14:14,710
Vancouver that is let us let us come to

1506
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:16,480
conclusion on the solution for this

1507
01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:20,560
problem let's first see whether we can

1508
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:23,139
go and converge over email and so that

1509
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,290
we we have this significant yes I think

1510
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:28,570
also we need to off this other feedback

1511
01:14:25,290 --> 01:14:31,090
in and then we can see whether we can go

1512
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:34,540
and come up with something that at least

1513
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:36,910
solves the the packet replication and

1514
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:39,130
when we talk about the process for this

1515
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:41,290
because we'd essentially agreed for the

1516
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:43,330
other one that we could kick off working

1517
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:45,370
group last call I think you know if you

1518
01:14:43,330 --> 01:14:49,000
wanted this to be aligned you would have

1519
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:52,240
to delay both of them so do the author

1520
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:54,520
prefer to do the data last call

1521
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:56,769
separately from flat I think I have a

1522
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:58,870
personal preference everybody else can

1523
01:14:56,770 --> 01:15:00,730
go and speak up but I do think we

1524
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:02,410
decouple the thing for a reason yes we

1525
01:15:00,730 --> 01:15:05,139
did and we did a couple of the thing in

1526
01:15:02,410 --> 01:15:07,000
order to have a stable base and

1527
01:15:05,140 --> 01:15:08,670
everything else can then progress at the

1528
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,780
speed that it can go and progress that

1529
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:15,760
so well let's not could put all about

1530
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:17,320
the ex back into the one basket given

1531
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,390
that we have started to own distribute

1532
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:24,460
them all right so we have Mickey and Q

1533
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:28,120
I'm gonna go ahead and be men hello can

1534
01:15:24,460 --> 01:15:30,280
you know we can we can hear you so I

1535
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:32,650
guess a couple things so one is I wonder

1536
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:37,929
why every node needs a send back so we

1537
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:40,929
do have node IDs in the in the trace

1538
01:15:37,930 --> 01:15:43,090
information it's not an IP address but

1539
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:47,230
it's something and then the other is

1540
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:50,080
there has been some interest in having

1541
01:15:47,230 --> 01:15:52,540
IOA info go back to the source for

1542
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:56,530
closed loop control or other purposes

1543
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:57,610
back to Nix and that overlaps little

1544
01:15:56,530 --> 01:15:59,139
with what we're talking about with

1545
01:15:57,610 --> 01:16:06,880
loopback and I think it's worth

1546
01:15:59,140 --> 01:16:09,160
discussing that ah afterwards yeah makes

1547
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,960
sense buck I agree that we should

1548
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,550
further discuss your second comment but

1549
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,100
the first comment has to do with the

1550
01:16:12,550 --> 01:16:16,360
whole intention of it so if you want to

1551
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,610
see where their pocket can actually

1552
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,259
traverse the whole network then you

1553
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:22,780
would have to collect it and then drop

1554
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:24,400
the packet you will not see it so it's

1555
01:16:22,780 --> 01:16:31,360
the same thing that as you have for

1556
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:33,670
trace hole if it makes sense there some

1557
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:36,400
implementations may be able to turn it

1558
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:39,820
around if they think they're dropping

1559
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:41,910
but yeah that's a lot of implementations

1560
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:48,580
and you don't rely on the implementation

1561
01:16:41,910 --> 01:16:51,630
of effective devices in the middle okay

1562
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,630
we can discuss that further

1563
01:16:52,439 --> 01:17:00,209
cool all right thanks okay one more so

1564
01:16:56,969 --> 01:17:03,119
that's the v6 options draft which is

1565
01:17:00,209 --> 01:17:07,050
basically asking for allocation off to

1566
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:10,889
v6 options again it was a draft that

1567
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:14,760
used to be an individual draft from the

1568
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:17,880
IOM team which is why it's ima and it

1569
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:21,389
all originally from a names perspective

1570
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:23,369
has been working group adopted there's

1571
01:17:21,389 --> 01:17:25,320
been nothing really new in this draft

1572
01:17:23,369 --> 01:17:28,018
other than the working group adoption

1573
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,249
thing and well a little bit of

1574
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:31,669
informational reference to the

1575
01:17:29,249 --> 01:17:35,188
deployment draft and what-have-you and

1576
01:17:31,669 --> 01:17:38,820
we basically asked for this draft to be

1577
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:43,919
adopted to go and follow what's the RFC

1578
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:46,768
number 70 120 something to go and ask

1579
01:17:43,919 --> 01:17:50,610
for early adoption of ipv6 option types

1580
01:17:46,769 --> 01:17:53,570
so that the VPP implementation and the

1581
01:17:50,610 --> 01:17:56,429
kernel implementation can start to use

1582
01:17:53,570 --> 01:17:59,340
Ayana allocated option types instead of

1583
01:17:56,429 --> 01:18:01,639
their own ones and well they're already

1584
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:04,320
diverging today these implementations

1585
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:06,809
helps other people as well

1586
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:11,009
to go and use the same numbers even if

1587
01:18:06,809 --> 01:18:12,989
it's early so I think that was one of

1588
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:15,090
the main reasons why we kind of pushed

1589
01:18:12,989 --> 01:18:17,968
for a working group adoption

1590
01:18:15,090 --> 01:18:22,889
I already send an email to the chairs to

1591
01:18:17,969 --> 01:18:28,550
kick-off that process yeah you have to

1592
01:18:22,889 --> 01:18:32,929
do that according to RFC 71 something

1593
01:18:28,550 --> 01:18:36,269
right I refer to that in that email and

1594
01:18:32,929 --> 01:18:38,039
yeah so would be good to go and get

1595
01:18:36,269 --> 01:18:41,669
additional reviews end of the day I

1596
01:18:38,039 --> 01:18:43,438
think it's it's asking for two coal

1597
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:45,419
points the draft the all the

1598
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:48,239
considerations are in the deployment

1599
01:18:45,419 --> 01:18:51,179
draft that goes hand-in-hand with a v6

1600
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:55,259
rav4 now so that the draft itself is

1601
01:18:51,179 --> 01:18:59,909
very simple sharmeen city I have a

1602
01:18:55,260 --> 01:19:04,489
question on these jobs when I read this

1603
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:06,239
chapter I found it it seems there's a

1604
01:19:04,489 --> 01:19:08,870
alignment issue

1605
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:13,968
between this chapter and ion data

1606
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:18,080
because in section 3 of this draft says

1607
01:19:13,969 --> 01:19:21,810
unless a particular interface is

1608
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:25,230
explicitly in your enabled for IOM route

1609
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:28,130
to a master job packets which contain

1610
01:19:25,230 --> 01:19:31,379
extension header carry arm data fields

1611
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:37,590
but I am data

1612
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:41,040
it says if not all nodes raising a

1613
01:19:37,590 --> 01:19:44,880
domain are I am capable I am tracing

1614
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:50,820
information the oning be collected on

1615
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:57,870
Rose knows which I am capable so it

1616
01:19:50,820 --> 01:20:01,620
seems they are not alignment I think

1617
01:19:57,870 --> 01:20:05,099
that didn't entirely catch it so so if

1618
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:08,070
you go in summarize what the discrepancy

1619
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:11,790
is that you believe is there in this

1620
01:20:08,070 --> 01:20:12,809
chapter it says if this note is not I am

1621
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:15,989
capable

1622
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:19,710
it should job any packets that you

1623
01:20:15,989 --> 01:20:22,559
received with Rio and a third option

1624
01:20:19,710 --> 01:20:29,430
data did you drop the packet or does it

1625
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:31,260
drop the option packet yeah it shouldn't

1626
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:35,900
drop the packet if that's really what it

1627
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:39,180
says then that's that's odd and wrong

1628
01:20:35,900 --> 01:20:41,219
right so that could you go and drop an

1629
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:42,450
email to the mailing list with that

1630
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:45,120
particular thing we need to go

1631
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:48,420
definitely fix that so thanks for

1632
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:51,390
catching that that's just like yeah well

1633
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:55,140
it's it's wrong yeah thanks for thank

1634
01:20:51,390 --> 01:21:04,920
you very much thank you we can even get

1635
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:06,380
a ref out real quick that fixes the

1636
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:13,880
replication problem by the way

1637
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:19,620
[Laughter]

1638
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:24,600
okay so more more reviews thank you

1639
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:27,800
thank you very much so yeah we will we

1640
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:31,290
will sit down and figure out the go read

1641
01:21:27,800 --> 01:21:32,970
7120 um we're gonna have a look at the

1642
01:21:31,290 --> 01:21:35,400
process I think the process is that we

1643
01:21:32,970 --> 01:21:37,830
need to do a call for consensus about

1644
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,599
this on the working group list and then

1645
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:41,640
we need to go we need to determine

1646
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,650
consensus right like we can determining

1647
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:45,450
consensus by Fiat but that's not really

1648
01:21:43,650 --> 01:21:47,190
how we do things here and then we need

1649
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:57,210
to go ask Miriah and then she'll say no

1650
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:58,500
I'm area but they're also a bunch of

1651
01:21:57,210 --> 01:22:03,390
experimental well you said you can't

1652
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:05,490
just use right we can do so the overall

1653
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:07,410
thing why we started doing this was that

1654
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:10,320
the two implementations that were

1655
01:22:07,410 --> 01:22:13,110
knowing in the open in open source

1656
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,240
already used different code points and

1657
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:23,339
it would be nice if the two had some

1658
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:25,290
suggestion of what a use they've chosen

1659
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:26,610
something for so you should go to the

1660
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:34,800
people and show it at them and say like

1661
01:22:26,610 --> 01:22:36,330
this is not how because this is a really

1662
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:37,920
short craft right it would be just like

1663
01:22:36,330 --> 01:22:39,420
to bring it so the process very quickly

1664
01:22:37,920 --> 01:22:42,690
and then have like this final allocation

1665
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:44,070
and sometimes we hopefully yeah we're

1666
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:49,500
hoping for what we need to go and fix

1667
01:22:44,070 --> 01:22:52,799
this one that's actually a good question

1668
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:54,990
is do which do we think will take longer

1669
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:57,870
the cheers figuring out how 7120 works

1670
01:22:54,990 --> 01:22:59,580
or doing an accelerating up the chairs

1671
01:22:57,870 --> 01:23:01,290
are very experienced with that process I

1672
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:03,690
would assume that but I've never done a

1673
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:05,640
71 point okay like it's Tetris it starts

1674
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:09,000
with a 7 that's like that's newfangled I

1675
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:11,220
don't know out to you right so we can go

1676
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,930
and try on so a the the reason that I

1677
01:23:11,220 --> 01:23:15,290
would say we should do two reasons why I

1678
01:23:12,930 --> 01:23:18,840
would say we should try the the early

1679
01:23:15,290 --> 01:23:20,250
allocation thing instead number one it's

1680
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:20,500
a new shiny thing that I've never done

1681
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,720
the

1682
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:24,670
ATF and it would be fun to try the

1683
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:27,100
actual reason is that it's a little bit

1684
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:32,200
weird to last call this document before

1685
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:38,050
we last called data check agree so let's

1686
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:49,900
do the early allocation yang do you have

1687
01:23:38,050 --> 01:23:52,900
this desert esteemed area director all

1688
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:56,379
right so that's that means we can go and

1689
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:57,910
dovetail with the thing that we haven't

1690
01:23:56,380 --> 01:24:00,670
really discussed which was immediate

1691
01:23:57,910 --> 01:24:03,130
export which ended up now in the design

1692
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:05,890
team output on we have we have we have

1693
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:07,870
like one minute and I actually would

1694
01:24:05,890 --> 01:24:11,110
like to take this time from the chair to

1695
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:14,559
start the consensus determination

1696
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:16,269
process is there anyone in this room who

1697
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:17,710
believes in an early allocation for

1698
01:24:16,270 --> 01:24:19,420
these code points so that we can stop

1699
01:24:17,710 --> 01:24:24,040
squatting on weird bits of the option

1700
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:25,600
number space is a bad idea if there's

1701
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,380
dissent in this room about doing that

1702
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,000
I'd like to hear it

1703
01:24:26,380 --> 01:24:30,160
because we're gonna start it we're gonna

1704
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,630
do a quick call on the list a quick call

1705
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:33,040
is probably three weeks because we you

1706
01:24:31,630 --> 01:24:38,740
know when people actually read it to

1707
01:24:33,040 --> 01:24:39,760
understand it um to early allocate code

1708
01:24:38,740 --> 01:24:44,760
points is there anyone here who thinks

1709
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,760
that's a bad idea please stand up now

1710
01:24:45,750 --> 01:24:52,260
okay that that's that signal um so yeah

1711
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:59,820
we'll go ahead and get that started cool

1712
01:24:52,260 --> 01:25:01,589
yeah thank you thank you so much

1713
01:24:59,820 --> 01:25:04,648
alright so that can

1714
01:25:01,589 --> 01:25:06,209
our section of working group adopted

1715
01:25:04,649 --> 01:25:08,579
documents now we're going to get into

1716
01:25:06,209 --> 01:25:10,679
the related documents such as the one

1717
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:12,209
we've been discussing the direct export

1718
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:15,269
file Thanks

1719
01:25:12,209 --> 01:25:17,909
my name is Tom Mizrahi and this draft is

1720
01:25:15,269 --> 01:25:21,209
about direct exporting is a new draft

1721
01:25:17,909 --> 01:25:23,308
but it's actually not a new idea it's

1722
01:25:21,209 --> 01:25:27,139
the product of a design team which

1723
01:25:23,309 --> 01:25:30,300
consists of the people listed here a

1724
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:31,949
little bit of history so this concept

1725
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:34,649
was actually discussed in the working

1726
01:25:31,949 --> 01:25:37,829
group a couple of times and it's based

1727
01:25:34,649 --> 01:25:41,280
on two different proposals one is called

1728
01:25:37,829 --> 01:25:44,429
postcard base telemetry and specifically

1729
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:48,449
we're talking about PB TI which is one

1730
01:25:44,429 --> 01:25:50,159
of the flavors and there was also a

1731
01:25:48,449 --> 01:25:52,919
second proposal which is called the

1732
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:56,219
immediate exporting flag which was first

1733
01:25:52,919 --> 01:25:59,339
introduced in the data draft and then

1734
01:25:56,219 --> 01:26:01,829
when we split it into a data draft and a

1735
01:25:59,339 --> 01:26:05,969
Flags draft the immediate export flag

1736
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:08,280
was part of the flag draft so an IDF 105

1737
01:26:05,969 --> 01:26:11,819
we had quite a quite a bit of discussion

1738
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:13,709
about these two proposals and the

1739
01:26:11,819 --> 01:26:16,559
working group chairs instructed us the

1740
01:26:13,709 --> 01:26:20,849
authors to work on this together and to

1741
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:23,519
come up with one a single solution and

1742
01:26:20,849 --> 01:26:24,839
this is what we did so first of all I

1743
01:26:23,519 --> 01:26:27,209
want to thank all the people who took

1744
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:29,939
part here and worked on this combined

1745
01:26:27,209 --> 01:26:31,589
solution it wasn't trivial but I think

1746
01:26:29,939 --> 01:26:35,339
we came up with something that makes

1747
01:26:31,589 --> 01:26:36,959
sense so last month in October we

1748
01:26:35,339 --> 01:26:41,879
introduced the first version of this

1749
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:44,938
draft which combines the two concepts so

1750
01:26:41,879 --> 01:26:47,399
what is direct exporting so if we look

1751
01:26:44,939 --> 01:26:49,469
at the figure here from the left side we

1752
01:26:47,399 --> 01:26:52,319
see a data packet that goes into the i/o

1753
01:26:49,469 --> 01:26:55,439
and domain and when it reaches the

1754
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:59,760
encapsulating node encapsulating node

1755
01:26:55,439 --> 01:27:03,359
can incorporate a direct exporting adex

1756
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,599
option into the data packets then when

1757
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:08,969
the packet is forwarded along the path

1758
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:12,659
the transit nodes just Ford the data

1759
01:27:08,969 --> 01:27:14,429
packet they don't modify it finally when

1760
01:27:12,659 --> 01:27:15,459
the packet reaches the decap slating

1761
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:19,449
nodes

1762
01:27:15,459 --> 01:27:21,459
the decks option can be removed so each

1763
01:27:19,449 --> 01:27:24,909
of these nodes along the path can also

1764
01:27:21,459 --> 01:27:27,010
export information to a collector but

1765
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:32,228
the transit nodes don't need to change

1766
01:27:27,010 --> 01:27:34,449
the decks option so that's the the main

1767
01:27:32,229 --> 01:27:38,860
difference here compared to what we saw

1768
01:27:34,449 --> 01:27:41,289
in in a conventional iõm so the question

1769
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:44,400
that comes up here is why why is this

1770
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:47,969
needed so the the main motivation to use

1771
01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:51,459
direct exporting is first of all since

1772
01:27:47,969 --> 01:27:53,769
transit nodes don't need to modify the

1773
01:27:51,459 --> 01:27:56,469
packets it makes processing by transit

1774
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:59,380
no it's easier simpler so that's one

1775
01:27:56,469 --> 01:28:02,550
thing and another major advantage is

1776
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:04,840
that since we're adding a constant

1777
01:28:02,550 --> 01:28:07,449
overhead it's a relatively small

1778
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:12,219
overhead so compared to the conventional

1779
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:16,978
io m which adds per hop overhead it's a

1780
01:28:12,219 --> 01:28:21,010
significant significantly easier or less

1781
01:28:16,979 --> 01:28:23,409
less overhead for each data packet so

1782
01:28:21,010 --> 01:28:27,070
there's potential improvement in terms

1783
01:28:23,409 --> 01:28:29,768
of the data plane bandwidth so these are

1784
01:28:27,070 --> 01:28:35,199
the main advantages of using the Dex

1785
01:28:29,769 --> 01:28:37,269
option so this is the Dex option format

1786
01:28:35,199 --> 01:28:40,478
we can see the different fields here

1787
01:28:37,269 --> 01:28:43,050
well some of the fields are similar to

1788
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:45,429
some of the fields in in the IOM

1789
01:28:43,050 --> 01:28:47,619
incremental and pre-allocated trace

1790
01:28:45,429 --> 01:28:50,530
options so for example we have the

1791
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:55,209
namespace ID the same as we have in the

1792
01:28:50,530 --> 01:28:58,239
trace options the i/o and trace type has

1793
01:28:55,209 --> 01:29:02,920
a good exactly the same semantics as in

1794
01:28:58,239 --> 01:29:06,369
the IOM trace options and we also have

1795
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:11,469
two optional fields here flow ID and

1796
01:29:06,369 --> 01:29:13,539
sequence ID let's see an example and in

1797
01:29:11,469 --> 01:29:17,079
this example we see a Dex option which

1798
01:29:13,539 --> 01:29:19,059
is encapsulated in an ipv6 extension

1799
01:29:17,079 --> 01:29:20,199
header which is based on the draft we

1800
01:29:19,059 --> 01:29:26,409
saw a couple of minutes ago

1801
01:29:20,199 --> 01:29:29,000
the IOM ipv6 options raft so as we can

1802
01:29:26,409 --> 01:29:31,370
see here we can see the last four

1803
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,680
which are exactly the same as we saw in

1804
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:38,050
the previous slide we see the first word

1805
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:41,510
here which is option type and length

1806
01:29:38,050 --> 01:29:44,000
which are the beginning of the ipv6

1807
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:47,060
extension header one thing to notice

1808
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:49,550
here is on the right side at the top we

1809
01:29:47,060 --> 01:29:53,630
see the IOM type this is the indication

1810
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:56,810
that this is a decks option so we're

1811
01:29:53,630 --> 01:30:01,100
allocating a specific IOM type to

1812
01:29:56,810 --> 01:30:03,500
indicate that this is a decks option the

1813
01:30:01,100 --> 01:30:06,710
other thing to notice here is the option

1814
01:30:03,500 --> 01:30:09,800
data length field indicates the length

1815
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:13,760
of this option so like we said it's a

1816
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:17,060
constant sized option but this length

1817
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:19,540
indicates whether the option includes

1818
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:21,890
the Floridian sequence number or not

1819
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:25,070
okay so that's how we know what the

1820
01:30:21,890 --> 01:30:27,290
length of the option is quick yes sorry

1821
01:30:25,070 --> 01:30:29,330
to interrupt you but I think that it's

1822
01:30:27,290 --> 01:30:33,710
convenient that we have this slide so I

1823
01:30:29,330 --> 01:30:36,580
understand that you are implicitly

1824
01:30:33,710 --> 01:30:39,710
defined by the length what's option

1825
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:43,100
included or not but I think that there

1826
01:30:39,710 --> 01:30:46,310
are possible situation when or at least

1827
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:49,250
is it possible that only flow ID or

1828
01:30:46,310 --> 01:30:53,690
sequence number included because then it

1829
01:30:49,250 --> 01:30:57,380
will my create a ambiguous situation to

1830
01:30:53,690 --> 01:30:59,839
understand what this field is the way

1831
01:30:57,380 --> 01:31:01,580
it's currently defined it's either you

1832
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,110
have both of them or you have none of

1833
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:06,320
them because we wanted to limit the

1834
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:08,540
number of possible combinations and to

1835
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:11,360
make it simpler so we only have two

1836
01:31:08,540 --> 01:31:13,130
flavors one is without these two fields

1837
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:19,889
and the other is with these two phases

1838
01:31:13,130 --> 01:31:25,650
okay thank you okay so this is the

1839
01:31:19,890 --> 01:31:27,330
format over an ipv6 extension header so

1840
01:31:25,650 --> 01:31:29,370
basically this draft is based on the

1841
01:31:27,330 --> 01:31:33,269
input we received from the working group

1842
01:31:29,370 --> 01:31:35,370
it's a combined solution and we believe

1843
01:31:33,270 --> 01:31:37,620
it addresses what we heard from the

1844
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:40,830
working group and we believe currently

1845
01:31:37,620 --> 01:31:43,140
the draft is pretty stable so we would

1846
01:31:40,830 --> 01:31:47,450
like to consider working group adoption

1847
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:47,450
and we'll be happy to hear any comments

1848
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:54,570
gregory CCT again I have a question and

1849
01:31:52,280 --> 01:31:58,139
probably it will be interesting to

1850
01:31:54,570 --> 01:32:02,639
discuss as part after my presentation

1851
01:31:58,140 --> 01:32:08,100
but this proposal is for any network or

1852
01:32:02,640 --> 01:32:11,790
only for unicast networks do you see

1853
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:14,310
there's a difference between yes I see

1854
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:17,330
the difference and I'll bringing this

1855
01:32:14,310 --> 01:32:20,970
for discussion in my presentation of

1856
01:32:17,330 --> 01:32:22,950
implication on Io a.m. and other

1857
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:26,610
telemetry collection methods in

1858
01:32:22,950 --> 01:32:29,910
multicast networks yes okay so that's

1859
01:32:26,610 --> 01:32:33,030
that's the point to think about in my

1860
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:36,450
opinion I know this this work is only

1861
01:32:33,030 --> 01:32:38,280
considered for the unicast and for the

1862
01:32:36,450 --> 01:32:43,230
mother cause the we need more extensions

1863
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:50,670
thank okay any other comments or

1864
01:32:43,230 --> 01:32:53,759
questions I think one more thing what we

1865
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:55,260
might want to go is Frank runners one

1866
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:56,880
more thing is we want to go and adopt

1867
01:32:55,260 --> 01:33:00,500
the nomenclature that we have in the

1868
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:03,480
data graph now so it's X option tied

1869
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:05,550
right so I think getting those two in

1870
01:33:03,480 --> 01:33:07,919
lockstep I would I would say that like

1871
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:10,140
so that would be a comment for the 0 0

1872
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:11,970
Rev like so you know so the feedback

1873
01:33:10,140 --> 01:33:14,520
here you know if we if we choose to

1874
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:16,470
adopt we'd say you don't take to take

1875
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:19,860
this feedback and put it into the 0 0

1876
01:33:16,470 --> 01:33:25,020
arrive at the dock the dot the I thought

1877
01:33:19,860 --> 01:33:26,429
I D fib M 0 0 F the dock box I do agree

1878
01:33:25,020 --> 01:33:28,110
with the comment on the multicast and I

1879
01:33:26,430 --> 01:33:29,550
think we have to have this discussion in

1880
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:32,730
this dress because sometimes you get

1881
01:33:29,550 --> 01:33:33,780
multicast behavior and intentionally so

1882
01:33:32,730 --> 01:33:36,089
for example

1883
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:37,349
flooding in the switch in the middle so

1884
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:39,449
I don't think we can prevent this

1885
01:33:37,349 --> 01:33:48,179
discussion and we have as part of this

1886
01:33:39,449 --> 01:33:51,829
first I have a question

1887
01:33:48,179 --> 01:33:55,079
so as an individual I'll go back to the

1888
01:33:51,829 --> 01:33:59,969
back of your architecture diagram this

1889
01:33:55,079 --> 01:34:01,139
one so this this looks like a different

1890
01:33:59,969 --> 01:34:05,880
kind of reflection and amplification

1891
01:34:01,139 --> 01:34:09,059
attack then be loop back um so I would

1892
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:10,739
say that when we bring this into working

1893
01:34:09,059 --> 01:34:16,050
group change control

1894
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:18,178
we should probably ensure that the you

1895
01:34:16,050 --> 01:34:20,639
know whatever we come up with to protect

1896
01:34:18,179 --> 01:34:23,369
flags can also protect this right like

1897
01:34:20,639 --> 01:34:24,989
so have we don't want two different sort

1898
01:34:23,369 --> 01:34:28,769
of like amplification protection

1899
01:34:24,989 --> 01:34:31,409
strategies for the two different for the

1900
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:33,210
two different strategies in in IOM for

1901
01:34:31,409 --> 01:34:35,098
the to the extent that that's possible

1902
01:34:33,210 --> 01:34:36,599
because these you know these look like

1903
01:34:35,099 --> 01:34:38,280
these look like differently sized

1904
01:34:36,599 --> 01:34:40,469
cannons pointed in different directions

1905
01:34:38,280 --> 01:34:41,460
but they're both cannons and if there's

1906
01:34:40,469 --> 01:34:43,730
an approach that we can come up with

1907
01:34:41,460 --> 01:34:47,579
that will protect us in all cases that's

1908
01:34:43,730 --> 01:34:49,919
that's worth working on right so you're

1909
01:34:47,579 --> 01:34:51,480
saying the analysis should be done for

1910
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:54,659
both even though the solution is not

1911
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:56,308
necessarily the same yeah and if it

1912
01:34:54,659 --> 01:34:58,710
comes out that like that like these are

1913
01:34:56,309 --> 01:35:00,000
different enough that you we need two

1914
01:34:58,710 --> 01:35:01,349
completely different ways but like so

1915
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,520
I'm thinking of something that basically

1916
01:35:01,349 --> 01:35:03,719
involves like a little bit of

1917
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:06,270
cryptographic protection that if you

1918
01:35:03,719 --> 01:35:07,289
don't actually pass that if like is this

1919
01:35:06,270 --> 01:35:09,750
is ripping through the network in the

1920
01:35:07,289 --> 01:35:11,070
transit node doesn't see the token where

1921
01:35:09,750 --> 01:35:13,260
the token can be something pretty

1922
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:15,929
lightweight then it basically just says

1923
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:17,130
no I'm not gonna I'm not gonna point

1924
01:35:15,929 --> 01:35:18,719
this cannon over there and I think

1925
01:35:17,130 --> 01:35:21,030
that's like a token based approach could

1926
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:22,170
work for both of these but I think we

1927
01:35:21,030 --> 01:35:23,340
need to do a little bit as a working

1928
01:35:22,170 --> 01:35:25,320
group meaning to do a little bit of

1929
01:35:23,340 --> 01:35:27,420
working around looking around and seeing

1930
01:35:25,320 --> 01:35:29,549
other places that usually in the

1931
01:35:27,420 --> 01:35:30,900
transport layer so like send cookies or

1932
01:35:29,550 --> 01:35:33,059
an example of this sort of thing right

1933
01:35:30,900 --> 01:35:35,190
like so looking at the at the approaches

1934
01:35:33,059 --> 01:35:36,599
that I'm gonna use like in higher layers

1935
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:38,129
to do this and see if we can make them

1936
01:35:36,599 --> 01:35:40,800
lightweight enough to work in these

1937
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:42,690
environments because I think that so one

1938
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:46,530
thing that I know is the same between -

1939
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:49,949
between direct export and loopback

1940
01:35:46,530 --> 01:35:51,329
is you need to apply the security at a

1941
01:35:49,949 --> 01:35:52,558
low enough layer that it needs to be

1942
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:53,969
pretty lightweight right like so the

1943
01:35:52,559 --> 01:35:55,710
constraints are the same in both

1944
01:35:53,969 --> 01:35:57,270
environments and that's going to

1945
01:35:55,710 --> 01:35:59,789
constrain the space of solution such

1946
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:04,559
that I suspect that even the solution is

1947
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:07,500
going to be unified suspect I haven't

1948
01:36:04,559 --> 01:36:13,099
done the work yet okay

1949
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:18,270
Gregory I think that this comment brings

1950
01:36:13,099 --> 01:36:19,320
another point for discussion is whether

1951
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:22,739
loopback

1952
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:25,139
and direct exporting are or whether

1953
01:36:22,739 --> 01:36:27,509
direct exporting is a more general case

1954
01:36:25,139 --> 01:36:30,150
of loopback and whether we really need

1955
01:36:27,510 --> 01:36:33,770
to loop back or we can get by with the

1956
01:36:30,150 --> 01:36:37,558
direct exporting and providing special

1957
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:40,110
encoding for loopback scenario because

1958
01:36:37,559 --> 01:36:45,869
as I understand encapsulation so there

1959
01:36:40,110 --> 01:36:48,570
is no identity of their destination for

1960
01:36:45,869 --> 01:36:51,420
the I am data to be exported in the data

1961
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:54,719
package so probably you envision that is

1962
01:36:51,420 --> 01:36:57,150
a part of their management data plane to

1963
01:36:54,719 --> 01:37:02,610
set it so something that we can discuss

1964
01:36:57,150 --> 01:37:09,179
how to extend our decks encoding so it

1965
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:11,730
can be acted as a loopback function yeah

1966
01:37:09,179 --> 01:37:13,710
I think in my opinion there's a

1967
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:15,480
distinction here between the data plane

1968
01:37:13,710 --> 01:37:17,849
and the management plane I think the

1969
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:21,539
loopback is intended for to be used by

1970
01:37:17,849 --> 01:37:24,449
the data plane but whereas right that

1971
01:37:21,539 --> 01:37:27,179
case just I'm just you know just

1972
01:37:24,449 --> 01:37:29,848
speculating why not to have a flag in

1973
01:37:27,179 --> 01:37:35,210
the Dex saying oh by the way this is a

1974
01:37:29,849 --> 01:37:37,829
loopback okay and then you don't need it

1975
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:41,039
and then you don't need it I look back

1976
01:37:37,829 --> 01:37:42,920
flag at all okay but we'll talk about it

1977
01:37:41,039 --> 01:37:45,329
later

1978
01:37:42,920 --> 01:37:47,969
so I'm gonna make an observation as the

1979
01:37:45,329 --> 01:37:49,139
chair um we're already kind of having

1980
01:37:47,969 --> 01:37:50,489
this discussion within the working group

1981
01:37:49,139 --> 01:37:52,050
so this is the factor or your backing

1982
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:53,669
announcer we should go ahead and and do

1983
01:37:52,050 --> 01:37:57,210
a call for adoption Popo kick that off

1984
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:59,519
okay let's get you bail do you envisage

1985
01:37:57,210 --> 01:38:00,460
that at some point you may have a need

1986
01:37:59,519 --> 01:38:02,080
for a filter

1987
01:38:00,460 --> 01:38:04,120
indicating what kind of data needs to be

1988
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,040
exploited or do you think that

1989
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:08,590
implicitly you always know what needs to

1990
01:38:06,040 --> 01:38:12,040
be exploited yeah so the Assumption here

1991
01:38:08,590 --> 01:38:14,500
is the encapsulating note doesn't insert

1992
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:16,420
a Dex option into all the packets it

1993
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:19,150
does that based on some kind of filter

1994
01:38:16,420 --> 01:38:20,980
which can be either a statistical say I

1995
01:38:19,150 --> 01:38:23,679
have five types of data in might know

1996
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:25,450
that I'm a report and sometimes this may

1997
01:38:23,680 --> 01:38:26,920
be important and the other time this may

1998
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:29,410
be important and maybe you want to say

1999
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:32,260
eh you guys are on this path report this

2000
01:38:29,410 --> 01:38:34,750
particular information and I see that

2001
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:36,460
you don't seem to have any filter of any

2002
01:38:34,750 --> 01:38:37,900
sort be able to indicate that sort of

2003
01:38:36,460 --> 01:38:40,989
thing what you mean is that the

2004
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:42,700
encapsulating node you're looking for

2005
01:38:40,989 --> 01:38:45,480
something for the encapsulating no to

2006
01:38:42,700 --> 01:38:49,599
indicate what kind of traffic versus no

2007
01:38:45,480 --> 01:38:52,360
can we go to the next slide yes

2008
01:38:49,600 --> 01:38:54,820
so the flags is encoding of what type of

2009
01:38:52,360 --> 01:39:09,280
information to be exported it's a part

2010
01:38:54,820 --> 01:39:11,170
of a standard IO am yes so we got one

2011
01:39:09,280 --> 01:39:13,150
more minute for this drivers on real

2012
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:15,700
quick clarification so that the trace

2013
01:39:13,150 --> 01:39:17,860
this is Frank the trace type tells you

2014
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:19,989
what is collected right so the

2015
01:39:17,860 --> 01:39:22,540
encapsulation note will put into the

2016
01:39:19,989 --> 01:39:24,400
packet what is going to be collected so

2017
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:25,719
the assumption is that you only collect

2018
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,570
what you want to go and see exported

2019
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:30,570
it's not the way that you say okay that

2020
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:32,830
you have the encapsulator

2021
01:39:30,570 --> 01:39:35,170
it's going to go decide what is going to

2022
01:39:32,830 --> 01:39:37,900
be collected and then the exporter would

2023
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:42,219
just export everything that is collected

2024
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:46,660
right as opposed to so you have the

2025
01:39:42,219 --> 01:39:49,500
encapsulating note decide on what should

2026
01:39:46,660 --> 01:39:52,780
ultimately be exported as opposed to

2027
01:39:49,500 --> 01:40:02,650
correct as opposed to the exporting note

2028
01:39:52,780 --> 01:40:05,259
will decide on add well I think

2029
01:40:02,650 --> 01:40:08,889
otherwise like if the exporting note

2030
01:40:05,260 --> 01:40:11,860
would don't decide what to export right

2031
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:13,540
then you can do that today you don't

2032
01:40:11,860 --> 01:40:14,259
need anything IOM for that you don't

2033
01:40:13,540 --> 01:40:16,240
need anything

2034
01:40:14,260 --> 01:40:18,250
signaling for that so the whole point of

2035
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:22,120
Io a.m. is that the encapsulating note

2036
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:24,880
can signal to the intermediate node this

2037
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:27,010
is what you should go and grab and send

2038
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:32,050
off otherwise I can go and implement

2039
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:33,790
like something like otherwise this is a

2040
01:40:32,050 --> 01:40:36,430
good discussion I think going into this

2041
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:38,350
on the list to discuss offline would be

2042
01:40:36,430 --> 01:40:39,580
great so I think this is a very

2043
01:40:38,350 --> 01:40:41,680
interesting topic and thank you again

2044
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:43,180
for doing all this collaboration we

2045
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:46,660
really appreciate it

2046
01:40:43,180 --> 01:40:47,830
so um tall one quick question I just

2047
01:40:46,660 --> 01:40:51,220
give me a thumbs up or thumbs down on

2048
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:56,019
this um after adoption there's no need

2049
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:58,240
for the continuing collaboration

2050
01:40:56,020 --> 01:40:59,500
infrastructure for this document as a

2051
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:05,230
design team we can go ahead and close

2052
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:08,530
the design team meetings or I think in

2053
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:11,469
my opinion it's useful to have a list a

2054
01:41:08,530 --> 01:41:13,990
mailing list a mailing list is still up

2055
01:41:11,470 --> 01:41:16,360
yeah yeah and also probably bi-weekly

2056
01:41:13,990 --> 01:41:18,070
meetings you want to keep running okay

2057
01:41:16,360 --> 01:41:21,820
it's like so keeping them running isn't

2058
01:41:18,070 --> 01:41:23,980
no op for me I'll just let them stay we

2059
01:41:21,820 --> 01:41:26,889
may want to change the scope of the list

2060
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:29,139
and meanings but I think it's important

2061
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:30,490
for us to keep it going okay good let's

2062
01:41:29,140 --> 01:41:40,540
let's take the scope change offline

2063
01:41:30,490 --> 01:41:44,679
thanks thanks get to the end hi I'm al

2064
01:41:40,540 --> 01:41:47,410
Morton and Len Chabot owned and ridiger

2065
01:41:44,680 --> 01:41:49,960
gibe who have been active members of the

2066
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:52,240
group here have been working on a draft

2067
01:41:49,960 --> 01:41:57,220
with me called metrics and methods for

2068
01:41:52,240 --> 01:42:00,150
IP capacity this is a this is a draft

2069
01:41:57,220 --> 01:42:02,260
where we're defining a metric for

2070
01:42:00,150 --> 01:42:05,950
something that we can really hang our

2071
01:42:02,260 --> 01:42:08,230
hats on this maximum it's kind of like a

2072
01:42:05,950 --> 01:42:13,210
physical capacity we should be able to

2073
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:16,259
measure this and it's a it's been kind

2074
01:42:13,210 --> 01:42:19,930
of a holy grail of this group to measure

2075
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:22,780
capacity of links and so forth it's it's

2076
01:42:19,930 --> 01:42:24,700
becoming extremely important in the part

2077
01:42:22,780 --> 01:42:26,719
of the world where we're offering a

2078
01:42:24,700 --> 01:42:28,820
gigabit access

2079
01:42:26,719 --> 01:42:32,659
to every user who can spend I don't know

2080
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:36,110
$300 a month so it's a it's an important

2081
01:42:32,659 --> 01:42:37,669
thing now it's at the IP layer that's

2082
01:42:36,110 --> 01:42:40,759
where we've defined it with header plus

2083
01:42:37,669 --> 01:42:43,639
payload and we have a word definition

2084
01:42:40,760 --> 01:42:46,249
and this equation definition in the

2085
01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:49,309
draft also a method of measurement so

2086
01:42:46,249 --> 01:42:51,050
we've got these time intervals they are

2087
01:42:49,309 --> 01:42:53,059
typically one second where we're

2088
01:42:51,050 --> 01:42:56,150
generally using 10 second measurements

2089
01:42:53,059 --> 01:42:57,769
and we try to find the maximum interval

2090
01:42:56,150 --> 01:43:00,799
that's going to be the maximum capacity

2091
01:42:57,769 --> 01:43:02,929
and we also have a search algorithm in

2092
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:04,969
the method of measurement and and so the

2093
01:43:02,929 --> 01:43:05,929
typical search kind of looks like this

2094
01:43:04,969 --> 01:43:07,820
where it converges

2095
01:43:05,929 --> 01:43:11,749
maybe overshoots a little bit at first

2096
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:14,268
but it converges on a one of these

2097
01:43:11,749 --> 01:43:17,228
intervals where we can identify the

2098
01:43:14,269 --> 01:43:19,699
maximum capacity and we've also got this

2099
01:43:17,229 --> 01:43:22,340
aside measurements of loss

2100
01:43:19,699 --> 01:43:23,659
delay delay variation and so forth these

2101
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:26,479
are the kinds of things you can't get

2102
01:43:23,659 --> 01:43:29,959
with TCP but TCP is being used

2103
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:32,300
everywhere and TCP falls short when

2104
01:43:29,959 --> 01:43:36,380
you're trying to measure gigabit access

2105
01:43:32,300 --> 01:43:37,880
even half a gigabit access there's

2106
01:43:36,380 --> 01:43:40,400
always going to be some error there and

2107
01:43:37,880 --> 01:43:43,280
and that's the problem with the current

2108
01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:46,280
methods of measurement now UDP is coming

2109
01:43:43,280 --> 01:43:49,669
quick is coming this is a simplified way

2110
01:43:46,280 --> 01:43:51,469
to measure IP layer capacity so we've

2111
01:43:49,669 --> 01:43:52,880
had an enormous amount of discussion on

2112
01:43:51,469 --> 01:43:54,860
the list and I'm not going to go through

2113
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,269
all of this with you in fact I sitting

2114
01:43:54,860 --> 01:43:58,130
in the back there I realized that this

2115
01:43:56,269 --> 01:44:00,349
is meme readable from the back so let me

2116
01:43:58,130 --> 01:44:02,539
just pick up some points bimodal

2117
01:44:00,349 --> 01:44:04,459
features are still being offered in

2118
01:44:02,539 --> 01:44:06,110
Internet access where you get a turbo

2119
01:44:04,459 --> 01:44:07,999
boost in the first couple of seconds and

2120
01:44:06,110 --> 01:44:10,009
then it drops back down we've got that

2121
01:44:07,999 --> 01:44:12,650
covered now in the in the methods of

2122
01:44:10,010 --> 01:44:14,989
measurement also I peel our capacities

2123
01:44:12,650 --> 01:44:16,938
different from goodput or throughput so

2124
01:44:14,989 --> 01:44:21,678
let's not mix those together it's a it's

2125
01:44:16,939 --> 01:44:23,599
a different metric okay and by the way

2126
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:26,300
in the in the slides which I hope you

2127
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:28,789
all take a look at the action points are

2128
01:44:26,300 --> 01:44:31,159
in the at and then the plus plus plus is

2129
01:44:28,789 --> 01:44:34,669
what we did in the draft to deal with it

2130
01:44:31,159 --> 01:44:38,598
so we've got about 15 of those just in

2131
01:44:34,669 --> 01:44:40,550
the September list points so feedback

2132
01:44:38,599 --> 01:44:43,520
from Yocum Fubini who's here

2133
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:47,060
welcome back Yocum he said formulate

2134
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:48,290
this as a statistic based on the

2135
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:50,300
singleton that's the way we've always

2136
01:44:48,290 --> 01:44:53,090
done metrics here before so we've got

2137
01:44:50,300 --> 01:44:55,610
that done now and we've also got a

2138
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:57,980
qualification measurement that we talked

2139
01:44:55,610 --> 01:44:59,630
about in the in the considerations

2140
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:02,599
methods of measurement and we're

2141
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:04,550
proposing that at a fixed 99% of

2142
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:07,460
whatever we come up with in the search

2143
01:45:04,550 --> 01:45:09,380
algorithm so that's something we can

2144
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:11,360
talk about and of course we've got the

2145
01:45:09,380 --> 01:45:14,230
with the zero zero draft we spelled the

2146
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:17,179
capacity right that's at the bottom line

2147
01:45:14,230 --> 01:45:19,610
so then the October list discussion

2148
01:45:17,180 --> 01:45:21,470
between mostly three of us and also a

2149
01:45:19,610 --> 01:45:25,580
meeting where we had five or six of us

2150
01:45:21,470 --> 01:45:27,380
together in Darmstadt basically we were

2151
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:29,360
we were looking at averaging times the

2152
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:31,790
ones that we chose seem to work very

2153
01:45:29,360 --> 01:45:35,000
well of one second and ten seconds for

2154
01:45:31,790 --> 01:45:36,710
the whole test Matt was proposing Matt

2155
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,930
Mathis was proposing something a little

2156
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:40,940
lower we did some tests with 50

2157
01:45:38,930 --> 01:45:43,400
milliseconds and didn't seem to improve

2158
01:45:40,940 --> 01:45:45,259
things actually so one of the things we

2159
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:48,110
did this time we haven't done this in

2160
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:50,660
previous drafts was to go with default

2161
01:45:48,110 --> 01:45:53,179
values for the input parameters to the

2162
01:45:50,660 --> 01:45:55,460
metric and and that's what the the

2163
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:57,500
defaults are the one second for the

2164
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:00,710
measurement short manager and intervals

2165
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:05,030
the time for the singletons and and so

2166
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:07,040
forth so that's that's new and let's say

2167
01:46:05,030 --> 01:46:09,500
the consideration for testing parallel

2168
01:46:07,040 --> 01:46:11,060
flows we've added that and the sending

2169
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:13,100
rate measurements we've we've also added

2170
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:15,620
defaults and some additional information

2171
01:46:13,100 --> 01:46:18,490
there so all of that went into the draft

2172
01:46:15,620 --> 01:46:22,910
zero one which is now the third version

2173
01:46:18,490 --> 01:46:25,280
so next steps it's good to recognize

2174
01:46:22,910 --> 01:46:26,720
that there is still an active method

2175
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:28,519
some measurement community in the

2176
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:30,650
working group among the all the protocol

2177
01:46:28,520 --> 01:46:32,660
developers that are here and I'm sure

2178
01:46:30,650 --> 01:46:38,269
you guys are all interested in a little

2179
01:46:32,660 --> 01:46:41,809
of both so let's continue this that

2180
01:46:38,270 --> 01:46:43,919
means I've got five minutes left

2181
01:46:41,809 --> 01:46:45,929
and that gives us a little time for

2182
01:46:43,919 --> 01:46:48,030
discussion so that's cool

2183
01:46:45,929 --> 01:46:50,639
so the authors believe it's worthy of a

2184
01:46:48,030 --> 01:46:52,889
working group adoption the key points

2185
01:46:50,639 --> 01:46:54,959
there are harmonization there's parallel

2186
01:46:52,889 --> 01:46:57,119
efforts going on which we tried to

2187
01:46:54,959 --> 01:46:59,249
coordinate with the liaisons but the

2188
01:46:57,119 --> 01:47:01,348
best way to do this we've found is to

2189
01:46:59,249 --> 01:47:03,389
get the spec going someplace and that

2190
01:47:01,349 --> 01:47:05,099
way we get the feedback of review of the

2191
01:47:03,389 --> 01:47:06,780
metric and the methods from the

2192
01:47:05,099 --> 01:47:08,999
community we get their unique

2193
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:10,409
perspectives and we get to the point

2194
01:47:08,999 --> 01:47:12,030
where they can do the things that they

2195
01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:14,129
want to do is a unique thing we can do

2196
01:47:12,030 --> 01:47:16,800
in AI ppm after we've got the metric to

2197
01:47:14,130 --> 01:47:18,659
point to and and our unique perspectives

2198
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:21,689
as to as to helped us out with a

2199
01:47:18,659 --> 01:47:24,030
protocol enhancements in whatever

2200
01:47:21,689 --> 01:47:26,999
protocols we choose like t WAMP like

2201
01:47:24,030 --> 01:47:29,669
stamp all of those so I think that's

2202
01:47:26,999 --> 01:47:31,889
that's the kind of second step beyond

2203
01:47:29,669 --> 01:47:35,929
adopting this and and reaching consensus

2204
01:47:31,889 --> 01:47:38,969
then we can work the protocol aspects so

2205
01:47:35,929 --> 01:47:41,280
the point is to reach consensus fast and

2206
01:47:38,969 --> 01:47:43,800
then start that protocol support I I

2207
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:45,119
would suspect that we could because

2208
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,070
we've got so much experience with

2209
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:49,679
measurements year-and-a-half of

2210
01:47:47,070 --> 01:47:51,630
measurements and this is being worked in

2211
01:47:49,679 --> 01:47:53,869
other standards bodies as well but we

2212
01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:57,209
could probably get this done by May and

2213
01:47:53,869 --> 01:47:58,768
then start the protocol stuff so but

2214
01:47:57,209 --> 01:48:01,849
that that assumes that we go for a

2215
01:47:58,769 --> 01:48:07,619
working group adoption sometime in early

2216
01:48:01,849 --> 01:48:09,649
2020 if we if we do that so I'd like to

2217
01:48:07,619 --> 01:48:13,348
open up the microphone for comments and

2218
01:48:09,649 --> 01:48:15,090
let's for I guess let me ask the

2219
01:48:13,349 --> 01:48:20,659
question who here in the room has read

2220
01:48:15,090 --> 01:48:23,669
the draft and there's two people

2221
01:48:20,659 --> 01:48:27,360
Ignacio has read it on the on the jabber

2222
01:48:23,669 --> 01:48:30,300
and there are obviously there are three

2223
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:33,889
authors and so forth out there Dave that

2224
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:33,889
was a time for you to raise your hand -

2225
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:40,289
okay comments

2226
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:42,299
Mike Ackerman al thank you this is

2227
01:48:40,289 --> 01:48:44,789
really good work I'm excited to see this

2228
01:48:42,300 --> 01:48:47,459
in action how do we move it along and

2229
01:48:44,789 --> 01:48:49,349
how can I assist if in any way I'll

2230
01:48:47,459 --> 01:48:51,419
review it on the list that would be the

2231
01:48:49,349 --> 01:48:53,489
best way okay I see a lot of potential

2232
01:48:51,419 --> 01:48:56,630
good uses and corporate networks and

2233
01:48:53,489 --> 01:48:56,629
others cool thank you

2234
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:03,510
knowing Elkins yeah I yeah I support

2235
01:49:02,340 --> 01:49:05,340
this document too because that's

2236
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:09,000
certainly a question that I get asked a

2237
01:49:05,340 --> 01:49:11,760
lot is what is the capacity of this link

2238
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:13,920
that somebody you know is px has just

2239
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:16,230
sold to me and and we're gonna be

2240
01:49:13,920 --> 01:49:19,100
getting higher and higher bandwidth all

2241
01:49:16,230 --> 01:49:21,599
the time and at more and more expense

2242
01:49:19,100 --> 01:49:24,450
and the other thing I really like is the

2243
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:27,239
harmonization part because I certainly

2244
01:49:24,450 --> 01:49:30,510
I'm sure we can all point to several

2245
01:49:27,239 --> 01:49:32,849
different groups where there is a heated

2246
01:49:30,510 --> 01:49:34,650
battle between different standard

2247
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:37,290
organizations and I really commend you

2248
01:49:34,650 --> 01:49:39,599
for doing harmonization so I support

2249
01:49:37,290 --> 01:49:44,510
this flesh-and-blood Winnick liaison

2250
01:49:39,600 --> 01:49:48,900
that was almost a tee up for my comment

2251
01:49:44,510 --> 01:49:51,200
so Dave sanic rope I'm using the IETF

2252
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:53,489
liaison manager the broadband forum hat

2253
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:55,320
this work is of interest to that

2254
01:49:53,489 --> 01:49:57,660
community they've actually taken note of

2255
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:00,719
the draft and there's some ongoing work

2256
01:49:57,660 --> 01:50:03,120
that would utilize the draft and look at

2257
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:05,280
its application within that community so

2258
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:06,570
that I'm not speaking on behalf of the

2259
01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:08,190
forum but I do know that there's

2260
01:50:06,570 --> 01:50:18,330
interest from that community in

2261
01:50:08,190 --> 01:50:20,009
heaviness draft progress thank you yeah

2262
01:50:18,330 --> 01:50:23,100
I think we're just gonna go ahead and

2263
01:50:20,010 --> 01:50:24,660
start a call for adoption now like will

2264
01:50:23,100 --> 01:50:26,100
run the we're running the working

2265
01:50:24,660 --> 01:50:27,870
request calls like in a pipeline but

2266
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:30,930
call for adoptions this seems separate

2267
01:50:27,870 --> 01:50:32,070
enough that yeah I think everybody's

2268
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:33,900
already made up their minds so we don't

2269
01:50:32,070 --> 01:50:36,509
actually have to pipeline it so we'll

2270
01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:38,099
start one oh I'll just basically copy

2271
01:50:36,510 --> 01:50:41,969
and paste the last message essentialist

2272
01:50:38,100 --> 01:50:43,620
and change the draft names um and yeah

2273
01:50:41,969 --> 01:50:47,670
and then we'll that'll end on the night

2274
01:50:43,620 --> 01:50:50,250
to December as well cool thank you thank

2275
01:50:47,670 --> 01:50:55,140
you everybody please read it and enjoy

2276
01:50:50,250 --> 01:51:02,120
it this should be fun thank you all

2277
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:02,120
right Greg yes close us out

2278
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:17,900
okay okay um ah yes of course okay so as

2279
01:51:15,260 --> 01:51:20,090
I mentioned in the comment earlier we

2280
01:51:17,900 --> 01:51:24,410
want to bring up for the discussion and

2281
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:29,300
consideration is the special specific

2282
01:51:24,410 --> 01:51:33,470
aspects of a telemetric collection on on

2283
01:51:29,300 --> 01:51:38,590
path in multicast networks if we can go

2284
01:51:33,470 --> 01:51:45,830
next slide doesn't oh okay okay

2285
01:51:38,590 --> 01:51:48,200
no okay so monitoring multicast traffic

2286
01:51:45,830 --> 01:51:52,850
is important as important as monitoring

2287
01:51:48,200 --> 01:51:55,610
unicast so that's important it helps to

2288
01:51:52,850 --> 01:51:57,410
reconstruct visualize the multicast tree

2289
01:51:55,610 --> 01:52:01,040
and performance monitoring and

2290
01:51:57,410 --> 01:52:05,540
troubleshooting so on paths telemetry

2291
01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:08,750
collection technique is a promising as a

2292
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:11,600
complement to the active om measurements

2293
01:52:08,750 --> 01:52:14,060
method so what's the problem what we see

2294
01:52:11,600 --> 01:52:16,700
the problem the currently on path

2295
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:20,410
telemetry techniques may have an issues

2296
01:52:16,700 --> 01:52:25,370
that when we are doing when they're harp

2297
01:52:20,410 --> 01:52:28,099
collection is used that means that the

2298
01:52:25,370 --> 01:52:31,280
same data collected upstream will be

2299
01:52:28,100 --> 01:52:33,950
replicated on all branches and carried

2300
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:38,179
on all branches which will lead to

2301
01:52:33,950 --> 01:52:41,300
unnecessary data being collected because

2302
01:52:38,180 --> 01:52:43,820
if you can imagine from the upstream so

2303
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:46,760
you're doing the replication in any

2304
01:52:43,820 --> 01:52:49,009
nodes that branch nodes downstream so

2305
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:51,230
all the information collected upstream

2306
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:56,660
will be replicated on each and every

2307
01:52:51,230 --> 01:53:02,598
branch okay if you agree with this

2308
01:52:56,660 --> 01:53:06,199
mental picture then what

2309
01:53:02,599 --> 01:53:10,520
objective to provide the mechanisms that

2310
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:13,070
allow optimization of telemetry on path

2311
01:53:10,520 --> 01:53:17,829
collection in the multicast network to

2312
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:17,829
avoid unnecessary replication of data

2313
01:53:18,190 --> 01:53:28,040
okay next slide please so for the

2314
01:53:23,810 --> 01:53:34,239
perhaps solution so there are postcard

2315
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:38,570
or Dex proposal the branch node

2316
01:53:34,239 --> 01:53:41,780
replicates the packet and branch node

2317
01:53:38,570 --> 01:53:45,799
needs to add the branch identifier so

2318
01:53:41,780 --> 01:53:50,659
that their collector of the telemetry

2319
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:55,280
can do Association and reconstruct their

2320
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:59,629
multicast tree so it doesn't really

2321
01:53:55,280 --> 01:54:01,759
change their method the only thing it

2322
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:04,730
introduces additional informational

2323
01:54:01,760 --> 01:54:07,400
object that needs to maybe consider it

2324
01:54:04,730 --> 01:54:10,489
to be included in an encapsulation and

2325
01:54:07,400 --> 01:54:15,079
again yes I haven't synchronised that

2326
01:54:10,489 --> 01:54:17,598
with the latest Dex proposal just a

2327
01:54:15,079 --> 01:54:20,920
question can you please explain what you

2328
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:23,570
try to optimize you try to optimize the

2329
01:54:20,920 --> 01:54:25,550
capacity on the disk that will hold this

2330
01:54:23,570 --> 01:54:26,690
territory or the okay or the network

2331
01:54:25,550 --> 01:54:30,770
okay

2332
01:54:26,690 --> 01:54:34,969
there okay there are several methods of

2333
01:54:30,770 --> 01:54:37,159
collecting telemetry information what

2334
01:54:34,969 --> 01:54:40,670
we're trying to optimize okay what's

2335
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:44,030
this points to is that if data is

2336
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:46,280
collected in the packet itself then

2337
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:49,540
aspect it get replicated down the

2338
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:51,800
branches it leads to unnecessary

2339
01:54:49,540 --> 01:54:53,750
information being collected in the

2340
01:54:51,800 --> 01:54:55,400
network or carried in the network you

2341
01:54:53,750 --> 01:54:58,250
mean that you could have dropped the

2342
01:54:55,400 --> 01:55:00,530
initial I can hear you do you mean that

2343
01:54:58,250 --> 01:55:02,210
you can you might have been able to drop

2344
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:06,199
the initial that's collected you know

2345
01:55:02,210 --> 01:55:07,909
instead of replicated I'm not saying

2346
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:10,339
what to do I'm saying that there is a

2347
01:55:07,909 --> 01:55:12,409
problem if you agree with this problem

2348
01:55:10,340 --> 01:55:14,570
then we are not sure if area

2349
01:55:12,409 --> 01:55:15,610
understandable and so okay the problem

2350
01:55:14,570 --> 01:55:18,309
is if you

2351
01:55:15,610 --> 01:55:21,309
collect our telemetry information in the

2352
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:24,040
packet itself and as you replicate the

2353
01:55:21,310 --> 01:55:26,800
packet so the information and being

2354
01:55:24,040 --> 01:55:31,420
collected upstream to the branch will be

2355
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:33,340
copied in all replicated packets okay

2356
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:36,850
would you agree with that this that's a

2357
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:38,230
problem so again I agree that you

2358
01:55:36,850 --> 01:55:42,270
replicate I'm not sure it's a problem

2359
01:55:38,230 --> 01:55:42,269
but that's fine okay thanks

2360
01:55:42,420 --> 01:55:50,639
okay so this is for a very special

2361
01:55:47,530 --> 01:55:54,849
method of doing a telemetry collection

2362
01:55:50,639 --> 01:55:58,810
using either postcard basically it's a

2363
01:55:54,850 --> 01:56:03,810
per half solution it can be said this is

2364
01:55:58,810 --> 01:56:08,469
a deck solution or post card telemetry

2365
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:13,510
so which each node exports the data and

2366
01:56:08,469 --> 01:56:16,600
the observationally of the draft was

2367
01:56:13,510 --> 01:56:18,489
that the current information then being

2368
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:21,159
proposed is not sufficient to do their

2369
01:56:18,489 --> 01:56:23,589
Association so their proposal is just

2370
01:56:21,159 --> 01:56:26,559
we're not changing their method of

2371
01:56:23,590 --> 01:56:28,449
collecting information from each half

2372
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,869
but we are just adding additional

2373
01:56:28,449 --> 01:56:35,400
information that helps to correlate

2374
01:56:31,869 --> 01:56:38,500
collected data from the transit nodes as

2375
01:56:35,400 --> 01:56:43,210
belong to the same flow through the

2376
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:46,260
multicast distribution tree yes one

2377
01:56:43,210 --> 01:56:50,530
quick question here have you considered

2378
01:56:46,260 --> 01:56:54,520
so we don't really specify the semantics

2379
01:56:50,530 --> 01:56:56,500
of the node ID today in iom data in the

2380
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:58,750
data draft right so what you can go and

2381
01:56:56,500 --> 01:57:01,980
do is you can then coat the node ID plus

2382
01:56:58,750 --> 01:57:04,119
your branch ID in the node ID field

2383
01:57:01,980 --> 01:57:09,059
right so yeah I don't believe that you

2384
01:57:04,119 --> 01:57:09,059
need an extra field for that okay again

2385
01:57:09,090 --> 01:57:13,150
we can discuss whether there is already

2386
01:57:11,590 --> 01:57:17,170
sufficient or not

2387
01:57:13,150 --> 01:57:20,830
this proposal was I believe that from

2388
01:57:17,170 --> 01:57:24,699
the same offers that are part of the

2389
01:57:20,830 --> 01:57:29,940
design team for the decks so they looked

2390
01:57:24,699 --> 01:57:29,940
at their earlier proposal with their

2391
01:57:30,659 --> 01:57:37,929
postcard and they suggested that whether

2392
01:57:35,139 --> 01:57:41,409
there is already informational element

2393
01:57:37,929 --> 01:57:50,290
that can be included into their exported

2394
01:57:41,409 --> 01:57:53,170
data how you from vitória so currently

2395
01:57:50,290 --> 01:57:56,019
we haven't if I are how you will

2396
01:57:53,170 --> 01:57:59,320
actually implement this labor branch but

2397
01:57:56,020 --> 01:58:03,159
you can use any existing mechanism in

2398
01:57:59,320 --> 01:58:05,320
the text or whatever you can use but but

2399
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:06,820
here we just point out what's actually

2400
01:58:05,320 --> 01:58:09,579
information you will need to identify

2401
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:13,230
where the branch helped you reconstruct

2402
01:58:09,579 --> 01:58:15,659
the entire multicast tree mm-hmm okay

2403
01:58:13,230 --> 01:58:19,500
okay our next one please

2404
01:58:15,659 --> 01:58:23,769
okay so another method is that

2405
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:26,829
collecting information is a person per

2406
01:58:23,770 --> 01:58:29,710
segment solution based on a hybrid 2

2407
01:58:26,829 --> 01:58:32,380
step so the hybrid 2 step is not

2408
01:58:29,710 --> 01:58:34,570
collecting data in the packet itself but

2409
01:58:32,380 --> 01:58:37,300
rather construct their similarly

2410
01:58:34,570 --> 01:58:40,630
encapsulated special packet that

2411
01:58:37,300 --> 01:58:42,909
collects data following their packet

2412
01:58:40,630 --> 01:58:46,150
that is a trigger which is a similar

2413
01:58:42,909 --> 01:58:48,429
with the postcard and Dex the only

2414
01:58:46,150 --> 01:58:51,610
difference is that postcard index

2415
01:58:48,429 --> 01:58:55,260
operate on per hop and this collects

2416
01:58:51,610 --> 01:58:59,619
from end to end all the information so

2417
01:58:55,260 --> 01:59:04,150
you can see that without any

2418
01:58:59,619 --> 01:59:06,869
modification hybrid 2 step will lead to

2419
01:59:04,150 --> 01:59:09,388
the replication of unnecessary

2420
01:59:06,869 --> 01:59:14,348
replication of collected data because

2421
01:59:09,389 --> 01:59:16,329
there HTC packet that collects data uses

2422
01:59:14,349 --> 01:59:18,849
the same encapsulation so it will be

2423
01:59:16,329 --> 01:59:22,650
replicated as a data packet and thus

2424
01:59:18,849 --> 01:59:26,500
will lead to the unnecessary the

2425
01:59:22,650 --> 01:59:28,960
multiplicity of information so instead

2426
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:32,619
to do optimization is that basically

2427
01:59:28,960 --> 01:59:34,840
it's very simple saying that the first

2428
01:59:32,619 --> 01:59:37,480
packet is being transported with all

2429
01:59:34,840 --> 01:59:40,630
information and if packet needs to be

2430
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:42,070
replicated so if this in transit node

2431
01:59:40,630 --> 01:59:45,910
happens to be a brain

2432
01:59:42,070 --> 01:59:50,139
that note generates a new HTC packet as

2433
01:59:45,910 --> 01:59:52,540
a result you can see here so that only

2434
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:55,030
information on this branch will be

2435
01:59:52,540 --> 01:59:57,700
collected then you will have all only

2436
01:59:55,030 --> 02:00:00,280
one end to end on one branch and

2437
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:06,250
everything else is per branch from the

2438
02:00:00,280 --> 02:00:15,610
branch note to the leaf and that's

2439
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:19,180
basically order that so in post card may

2440
02:00:15,610 --> 02:00:19,990
have enhancement for optimization yes oh

2441
02:00:19,180 --> 02:00:24,730
