00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:09,870
we're gonna get started in just a minute

2
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:25,919
so if you could grab your seats that'd

3
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:29,659
be great okay well um so welcome to the

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,090
the IETF hackathon welcome to Singapore

5
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,699
I see from shirts that kind of look like

6
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,250
mine many of you were here two years ago

7
00:00:35,699 --> 00:00:40,379
if so you know welcome back to the

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,600
hackathon in Singapore to those of you

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,940
who had your first time welcome to you

10
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,100
as well the hackathon just that

11
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,459
continues to grow and I think get better

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,750
and better and more productive and a big

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,270
part of that and a big supporter of the

14
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,070
hackathon is Elissa Cooper our IETF

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:01:03,780
chair I'm going to turn it over to her

16
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:07,830
to say a few words thanks Charles

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:09,150
so nice to see everyone here today can I

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,810
actually see a show hands anybody who

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:15,000
this is their first IETF hackathon oh my

20
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:16,890
goodness gracious a lot of new people

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,250
well welcome it's so good to have you

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:23,970
here everybody here is very friendly so

23
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,009
feel free to ask for help from anyone

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,600
who needs it especially this early in

25
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,119
the week people get you know cranky lady

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,589
or later in the week

27
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,939
as Charles said the hackathon continues

28
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:37,170
to grow and grow and we were in this

29
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:38,820
same venue same room two years ago we

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,409
actually only had three quarters of the

31
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,309
space like this there was a partition

32
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:46,320
here so you can visually observe how

33
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,990
much the hackathon is expanding

34
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
expecting something like 300 people so

35
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:53,789
that that's really great to see everyone

36
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,740
and feel free if anybody needs anything

37
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,530
or if you have ideas for how we can make

38
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,360
the hackathon more useful to you how we

39
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,570
can expand it how we can integrate it

40
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,640
better into the work of the IETF please

41
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,489
feel free to come and grab me or Charles

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,760
and share your ideas we're always open

43
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:14,879
to new ideas the hackathon would not be

44
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,850
possible without our sponsors and

45
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,670
supporters Cisco dev net

46
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,460
us through Charles's efforts and this

47
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,519
year we have a new ongoing hackathon

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:34,500
sponsor in I can so big thank you to I

49
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:41,640
can for for their support Paul Hoffman

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:44,550
from I can to come say a few words just

51
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,649
a few words so um I was impressed to see

52
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,650
how many new hands are up great yay

53
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:53,730
I can sponsored the last hackathon this

54
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,609
one and the next one we decided to do a

55
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,489
year's worth basically because that

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:01,140
table over there the DNS table has

57
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:02,760
already produced over the last couple

58
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,429
years a whole bunch of stuff that is

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,310
useful to the DNS just in a hackathon

60
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,620
style way and this is like wow this is

61
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,600
really good I know there are DNS people

62
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,920
who are sort of also scattered at other

63
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,170
tables because you actually care about

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,329
other topics more than the DNS but you

65
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:20,280
still care about the DNS anyone in the

66
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:23,730
room who has like DNS he questions feel

67
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,820
free to wander over towards here where

68
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:30,060
were and even though the DNS is like

69
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:32,519
this much of the Internet all y'all are

70
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,090
doing a lot of stuff on every other part

71
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:47,100
and that's really cool too so anyways

72
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:51,180
thanks okay so I know all of you are

73
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,579
anxious to to get to what you plan on

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,260
doing but just want to run through some

75
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:58,380
things especially for those of you who

76
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,149
it's your first time first of all I

77
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,760
think you all know what why we're here

78
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,420
and as Paul mentioned I think Alissa did

79
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,429
as well we're really trying to

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,119
accelerate the work that's done in the

81
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:13,440
IETF better-quality by you know

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,540
implementing things as we're

83
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,820
standardizing them and that not only

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,010
speeds up the process hopefully but that

85
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,510
results in a better standard and a

86
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,380
shorter amount of time so we have better

87
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,969
better impact I'd say and it was great

88
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,740
to see so many people who this is your

89
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:31,350
first time here because that's another

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:31,800
big part is to bring new people into the

91
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,650
IT

92
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,419
especially people who maybe have more of

93
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,429
a software development background and

94
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:40,859
wouldn't have been as interested or know

95
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,229
how best to contribute to the IETF but

96
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,330
now through code they have a mechanism

97
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:50,430
to contribute and really make a positive

98
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:52,050
impact so so that's great to see as with

99
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,409
everything at the IETF we're operating

100
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:56,940
under the the note well I'm not going to

101
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:58,469
read through it if you haven't seen the

102
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,729
note well especially if this is your

103
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:05,400
first IETF you can take a look at it

104
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:07,199
it's online if you have any questions or

105
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,780
problems finding it let me or someone

106
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,440
else around you know we can help you

107
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,359
find it and the the hackathon is a

108
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,120
little bit different from a lot of IETF

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,219
activities and that we do work on code

110
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,710
the code that you work on is not

111
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:24,629
necessarily owned by the IETF it's

112
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,388
actually governed by whatever the

113
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,400
license is associated with that code so

114
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:31,020
when you're working on code just you

115
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,120
know make sure you're aware if the terms

116
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,758
under which your you're using and

117
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,529
contributing to the code and it's

118
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,370
whatever code you're working on that's

119
00:05:37,529 --> 00:05:40,370
what's applicable here

120
00:05:40,699 --> 00:05:46,590
okay last I checked we had 38 projects

121
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,690
which is great to see and there maybe

122
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,940
even a couple more all the projects if

123
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:53,279
you haven't found the IETF wiki yet all

124
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,130
the projects are listed there as well as

125
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,990
who's running the project so if you're

126
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:59,550
haven't figured out or if you're trying

127
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,740
to figure out which project to work on

128
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:05,370
take a look and see which one best

129
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,379
matches your interests and if you're not

130
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,009
sure which project to join we were

131
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:13,620
trying something new at this ITF we have

132
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:17,190
a Lost and Found page essentially for

133
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:20,449
lack of a better name this is if you

134
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:23,250
have a project and you need some help

135
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:24,900
advertise what you need there or if

136
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,449
you're not sure which project to work on

137
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:29,340
and you want to you know a little bit

138
00:06:27,449 --> 00:06:31,770
more help to see exactly what people

139
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,448
need you can go there and see what

140
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,099
people need or you can even advertise

141
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:38,759
what the things are you're interested in

142
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:40,830
that hopefully will help us all find out

143
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,399
you know get on a team that we can

144
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,399
contribute to

145
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:51,600
so we're right at this kickoff part and

146
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,480
after this really the idea is to break

147
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,580
up into the teams so don't get worried

148
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,100
if you haven't found a team yet that's

149
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:02,219
what the morning is for is to help you

150
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,230
find a team so you can come see me if

151
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,570
you're having a problem go around to the

152
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:08,730
different table see the signs talk to

153
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:13,080
people and and find a team that it looks

154
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,820
like it'll work for you now in order to

155
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,740
make it easier for people to continue to

156
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:20,640
work on their projects we will have

157
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,500
lunch brought in and then their snacks

158
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,020
in the afternoon we'll have dinner too

159
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,150
so the idea is to make it as easy as

160
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,070
possible for you to stay here and just

161
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,299
to continue to work of course if you

162
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,620
have other things you want to do and you

163
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:37,320
want to take off in the evening we

164
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:38,760
understand and and and that's fine so

165
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,729
Sunday will start up at the same time

166
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:44,639
the room will open at 8:30 and lunch

167
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:47,520
will be brought in again one thing I

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:52,410
want to warn you of ahead of time is

169
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,479
that we do like to have people present

170
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:57,450
what they did what they accomplished

171
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,150
what they learned and give you the

172
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:02,280
opportunity to do that so these are very

173
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,159
short presentations but we do all those

174
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:07,440
starting at two o'clock tomorrow so that

175
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,410
means that really you kind of need to be

176
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,570
wrapping up your project maybe around

177
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:15,090
1:30 so you have some time to put those

178
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:17,130
slides together you don't have to

179
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,530
present but it's it's really helpful I

180
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:22,200
think to you and to the IETF if you do

181
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:24,450
because that's the best way of sharing

182
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,520
with everyone around here and people who

183
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:31,620
watch the recording later on what you

184
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:33,000
did and then we do need to clear out of

185
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,580
here because this room will be

186
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,620
repurposed for something else so the

187
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,169
hackathon will end at 4:00 so that

188
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,539
newcomers have time to go to the

189
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,850
newcomer

190
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,470
thing tomorrow and so we all have time

191
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,870
to do the rest of the things we do here

192
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,550
at the IETF and by 5 o'clock at the

193
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,290
latest we need to be cleared out of here

194
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:54,959
so if you have equipment you brought in

195
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,490
just be aware of that that we do need to

196
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,160
get out of this space so that can be

197
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:02,329
turned over for the next

198
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:08,810
setup yes you're welcome to leave

199
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:10,969
equipment here tonight okay the project

200
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:12,920
presentations as I mentioned they're

201
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:14,990
very short depending on how many we have

202
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,269
we usually need to limit them to like

203
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,759
right around three minutes so this is a

204
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,079
very brief summary of what you did what

205
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:25,790
you learned and what you're going to

206
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:31,250
bring back to your working group and to

207
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:35,740
help out with those we have a basically

208
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,839
a github repo that we load all the

209
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,029
project presentations into so there's

210
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,269
something called this is the the IETF

211
00:09:41,029 --> 00:09:49,310
hackathon github and within it we have a

212
00:09:44,269 --> 00:09:51,110
repo for ITF project presentations if

213
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:54,069
you go into that there are some

214
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:56,269
instructions about how that works

215
00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:00,649
including an important thing about you

216
00:09:56,269 --> 00:10:02,750
need to be a member of the ITF hackathon

217
00:10:00,649 --> 00:10:05,689
github org in order for you to be able

218
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:07,850
to have the privileges or a write

219
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:10,370
permissions so if you're going to be

220
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:12,410
uploading a presentation make sure you

221
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:16,579
send your github ID to me and I'll add

222
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:18,469
you to that also in there you don't have

223
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:20,388
to use this template but if it's useful

224
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,639
for you there is a template it's in

225
00:10:20,389 --> 00:10:24,110
PowerPoint format if someone wants to

226
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:25,910
create it in another format and upload

227
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,610
it that'd be great

228
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:31,189
but that's just to help you with you

229
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,170
know creating a short presentation it's

230
00:10:31,189 --> 00:10:35,959
a template that you can you can leverage

231
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:39,949
if it's useful it is best when you

232
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:42,109
upload into github if you do so with a

233
00:10:39,949 --> 00:10:43,880
PDF format because that will be

234
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:48,709
presenting from a shared Chromebook and

235
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:52,339
it just presents best from that okay so

236
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:55,430
when the hackathon is over it's not

237
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:58,819
really over on Monday we still have what

238
00:10:55,430 --> 00:11:00,560
we call a hack demo happy hour and the

239
00:10:58,819 --> 00:11:02,389
presentations were really short only

240
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,699
three minutes as I mentioned this is a

241
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:07,040
more extended period of time for you to

242
00:11:04,699 --> 00:11:11,630
share what you did with the IHF

243
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:15,500
community so if you're interested

244
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:19,100
and I highly recommend this from 18th

245
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:21,770
from 610 to 740 on Monday we have a

246
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:24,220
space it's a subset of this room like a

247
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:26,960
portion I think this side of this room

248
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,420
where we'll be having the hack demo

249
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,610
happy hour and basically you'll get a

250
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:33,140
table you can set up you can do a demo

251
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:36,020
for people and just have that more

252
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,530
in-depth conversation with them if you

253
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,750
want to do that though sign up as soon

254
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:46,060
as possible and definitely before the

255
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:48,410
the deadline on at noon on Monday and

256
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:53,900
there's links to all these and the wiki

257
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:55,760
plus these slides are uploaded to then

258
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:57,650
throughout the week we have the code

259
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,569
lounge and again that's just right here

260
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:02,540
in this room or at least this part of it

261
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,340
and you're welcome to use that area to

262
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:06,260
continue to work on your projects and to

263
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,860
meet with each other

264
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:13,130
there is a board where you can sign up

265
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:14,690
and say what times you're going to be

266
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,580
here that's just for your convenience

267
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,140
you don't have to do that you're welcome

268
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:20,330
to come here even if you don't sign up

269
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:22,730
there that's just to help teams you know

270
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:26,450
agree on slots and and know when they

271
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:33,260
want to meet here any questions on any

272
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:35,600
of that okay so as we covered earlier

273
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:37,490
and as Alissa mentioned I really want to

274
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
thank our sponsors we wouldn't be here

275
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:41,300
and be able to afford the space and the

276
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,230
food and all that if we didn't have that

277
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:47,270
and so please consider if you're at a

278
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,560
place that may be able to sponsor us in

279
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:53,900
the future we would greatly appreciate

280
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,000
that if you do have any questions and

281
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:57,920
you didn't want to ask them right now in

282
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,360
front of the group feel free to see me

283

284
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,040
