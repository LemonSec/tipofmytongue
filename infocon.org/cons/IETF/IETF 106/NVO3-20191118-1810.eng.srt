2
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,610
your favorite component sponsor

3
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:52,059
okay welcome to mvo three stop we have

4
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:54,280
quite a busy meeting today so this is

5
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:55,989
the the note well I'll just leave that

6
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,150
on the screen for a couple minutes

7
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,580
basically it says anything any statement

8
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:04,110
to make here is a contribution to the

9
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,110
ITF so please bear that in mind

10
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,979
okay blue sheets there's one set going

11
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:17,200
down each side of the room please sign

12
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:23,820
those also have issued in doing the the

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:26,350
minutes thank you so here is the agenda

14
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,320
six items on the agenda including the

15
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:38,979
working group status summary any

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:40,389
comments on the agenda we only have an

17
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:42,190
hour and we have six items to get

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,200
through so we'll have to keep fairly

19
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:47,410
very closely to our time slots thank you

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,440
okay

21
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:52,210
milestones so I I pushed back the dates

22
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:55,690
of all of the milestones that we still

23
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,940
had open on the on the Charter but we

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,649
probably need to have a discussion on

25
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:03,550
whether or not we need to add any any

26
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:04,810
new ones or remove anything we'll

27
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,630
probably take that to list but if

28
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,209
anybody has any any any quick comments

29
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:12,690
on on the milestones please please so it

30
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:12,690
comes to Mike

31
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:25,018
okay so document status so the new RFC

32
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:29,849
since the last ITF we have one two three

33
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:32,129
four you have six RFC's in total the

34
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:35,089
data plane encapsulation so our

35
00:02:32,129 --> 00:02:39,359
standards chosen standards track so

36
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,920
encapsulation document genève is now

37
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,480
with the is G it's I think it's just

38
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,480
completed IETF last call

39
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:51,899
I think the authors are just stressing

40
00:02:47,129 --> 00:02:57,870
there was an ayah and a comment on where

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:03:00,709
to create the the genève registry we

42
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,879
also have the MV oh three design team

43
00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:07,290
encapsulation design team output so we

44
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:09,268
think this is probably ready for working

45
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,548
group last call we if you recall way

46
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:15,000
back a few years ago for who went into

47
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:18,299
this process we kind of decided that it

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,099
would be valuable to publish the output

49
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,680
of the design team which was choosing

50
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:24,750
between various tasks to choose between

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,630
or make a recommendation on which

52
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,030
encapsulation to take forward as as a

53
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:32,069
standard track encapsulation and I had

54
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,349
quite a lot of useful experience in

55
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,230
since many many working groups have to

56
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,940
grapple with this problem of picking

57
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:44,730
making an encapsulation amongst a number

58
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:48,450
of proposals so we will probably last

59
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,590
call that shortly after this idea if

60
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,780
there's anybody actually read the latest

61
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:58,440
version of this this draft you have put

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,030
your hands up okay one hopefully running

63
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,209
through working group rascal will cause

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,470
some small folks to to review it we also

65
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:09,239
in addition to our standard script track

66
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,280
encapsulation we had some informational

67
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,440
encapsulation drafts so these were kind

68
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,419
of some of the other options that were

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,728
considered by the working group the only

70
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:20,789
one that's actually alive at the moment

71
00:04:16,728 --> 00:04:23,490
is V X LAN GPA and that's on the agenda

72
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:30,539
today so what we originally said was

73
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:33,470
once we had sent genève to the ISJ we

74
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,210
to consider last calling as

75
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:40,080
informational documents the other

76
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:42,510
encapsulations so like I said that's on

77
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,340
the agenda today our distributed control

78
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:51,810
plane so we have an e VPN draft that

79
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:59,070
describes how to apply evpn with with

80
00:04:51,810 --> 00:05:02,190
genève that's now with with Martin the

81
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,870
virtual machine mobility draft so this

82
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:08,250
has been through working group last call

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,350
a while ago I owe it's a document

84
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,760
Shepard write-up though I found when I

85
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:14,700
read it I found there was some editorial

86
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,530
kind of nets that editors are now

87
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:20,909
working on so I'd rather wait till they

88
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:23,400
fix fix that and then I'll I'll post a

89
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,540
review of it hopefully we can move

90
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:35,460
forward quite quickly with the vmm draft

91
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:40,080
after that we have a lot of security

92
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,609
drafts that Daniel was editing is a

93
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,050
currently individual drafts that

94
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:45,060
presented some of them have been

95
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:47,550
presented a few times particularly the

96
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,680
journey of security requirements we did

97
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:54,110
try to try to adopt the journey of

98
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,920
security requirements a couple of times

99
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:59,570
unfortunate has been afraid to reach

100
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:01,590
consensus for working group adoption I

101
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,530
think we need to have a discussion about

102
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,880
how to proceed with these drafts I if I

103
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,299
can characterize I think one of the

104
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:13,590
concerns for the cause the problem with

105
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,450
adoption was appearing to put and put

106
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:19,380
unrealistic requirements onto an

107
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:23,909
encapsulation security requirements that

108
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,130
weren't necessarily implementable that

109
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,230
was one of at least one of the issues so

110
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:31,380
does anyone have any comments on how how

111
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,270
to proceed with these drafts I think we

112
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,560
know that security is a C is a major

113
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:36,419
requirement and it's something that we

114
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,980
do need to address properly and one of

115
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:41,520
the reasons we went into this exercise

116
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:43,240
of developing a set of security

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:49,120
requirements and architecture

118
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:51,370
and some proposals for protocol

119
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,470
enhancements for that was because the

120
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,349
security area does require us the

121
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,060
security IDs do requires to come up with

122
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,650
some security solutions to address all

123
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:05,280
the security potential security issues

124
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:09,539
with our encapsulations any comments

125
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,539
should we just let this die then

126
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:15,580
are there any operators in the room who

127
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,860
are concerned about security in their in

128
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:34,000
their data centers that would like to

129
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:40,360
see this this addressed ok Martin matter

130
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,949
you know I would prefer not to let this

131
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:48,240
die I know that's easy to say not

132
00:07:44,949 --> 00:07:52,780
necessarily easy to make it to reality

133
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:55,780
but I would I need to pity that Daniel

134
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:00,609
is not here but I think we need to find

135
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:06,400
a solution for that work to pocket we

136
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:11,139
need that's part of our the commitments

137
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:15,669
of that group and genève is about to

138
00:08:11,139 --> 00:08:20,110
entire ESG and if I promise the yes tree

139
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:21,969
that there will be some security aspects

140
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:30,880
of Geneva coming after and that nothing

141
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:34,208
comes I'm kind of lying so maybe ways to

142
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:39,849
loosen some of those requirements maybe

143
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:44,439
is to make them keep them having them

144
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:48,730
not optional but optional to implement

145
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,320
I don't know we know I don't know the

146
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,850
solution right now but I would really

147
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:56,750
like the working group to give it

148
00:08:51,850 --> 00:09:00,709
another try so Martin this

149
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,139
we have tried I think this is a second

150
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:07,040
time we went through the requirements

151
00:09:03,139 --> 00:09:10,990
security requirements effort right I

152
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:16,790
think one of the major concerns is that

153
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:18,769
if the the the folks who wanted the

154
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,410
security requirements or security

155
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:23,959
aspects or very few in this working

156
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:26,810
group I mean I believe it's across the

157
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,719
routing area itself it's not just this

158
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,060
working group so it's getting hard to

159
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:37,279
really get the expertise of the security

160
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:39,829
aspects to really come up with good

161
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,819
requirements and solutions related to

162
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:50,149
that so it's a problem at large but I

163
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:51,920
don't know how to really tackle this so

164
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:57,050
maybe I can reach out to my fellow

165
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,589
security changes to bring new blood more

166
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:02,439
blood

167
00:09:57,589 --> 00:10:02,439
I don't know has Daniele expressed any

168
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:16,899
opinion on whether you would continue or

169
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:19,670
leave that as is no no I think I mean it

170
00:10:16,899 --> 00:10:23,500
is try twice to get this through yeah I

171
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:23,500
know I know I got this adopted so um

172
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:34,689
okay well let's take it offline I have

173
00:10:29,449 --> 00:10:44,389
an action point if we can find some

174
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:46,819
someone on top of Danielle - okay MV o3o

175
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:50,480
a.m. so we've had a number of drafts in

176
00:10:46,819 --> 00:10:54,620
the working group over the years and for

177
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,720
various OEM tools and for encapsulations

178
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:59,870
based on the outfit of the routing area

179
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,540
OEM design team none of which have been

180
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,500
adopted in working group unfortunately

181
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:07,099
and we haven't reached any kind of

182
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:09,850
consensus so far on a common

183
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:11,680
encapsulation for OEM

184
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:15,670
we have one draft on the agenda today

185
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,079
the BFD genève and i think the authors

186
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:20,170
are going to ask for probably ask for

187
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:22,330
adoption for that that draft has an i

188
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:27,130
think a number of encapsulations

189
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:31,510
proposed in it Greg so actually I'm not

190
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:36,100
to interrupt you and just work or no if

191
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:38,319
I just wanna point is that there is a

192
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:41,560
draft that will present it in Montreal

193
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,340
it's a result of collaboration for

194
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:49,810
authors and it lists I think that even

195
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:52,090
for possible encapsulations and their

196
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:54,219
purpose of this draft is not to be

197
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:58,720
published or not necessarily probably

198
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:00,390
published but to initiate the discussion

199
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,820
and the working group and select

200
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,580
preferably single encapsulation because

201
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,650
multiplicity of encapsulations in OAM

202
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:11,470
it's a headache and we should avoid it

203
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:16,840
so we should agree on one encapsulation

204
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:19,150
for active om in Geneva and then all

205
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:21,940
other documents will just follow and

206
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,709
document it and then their document that

207
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:26,670
triggers the discussion can just

208
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,670
disappear

209
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:37,950
okay and finally on our young models we

210
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,890
have a common Oh am i sorry common a

211
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:43,860
young model configured for configuration

212
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:50,280
it's on the agenda for this meeting as

213
00:12:43,860 --> 00:13:06,030
well okay so first up I think we have

214
00:12:50,280 --> 00:13:13,160
the GPA okay have you mind not

215
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:16,920
presenting an update on fixed on GP so

216
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:19,680
these are the changes since version 6

217
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,660
we had version o eight there were some

218
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,089
minor changes done between seven and

219
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:29,790
eight so this is the most significant so

220
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:33,120
what we introduced it here is the

221
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:37,290
concept of she matters basically we'll

222
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,950
serve in number of protocol values just

223
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,079
to give the context I mean I think the

224
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,330
group here is aware but this is way to

225
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,030
extend the week's learning capsulation

226
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:52,400
basically the protocol type that allows

227
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:58,410
to include additional header after the

228
00:13:52,400 --> 00:14:00,840
after the the week's planet in a sense

229
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:04,829
is similar to Geneva force as you guys

230
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:08,370
know well so we basically have a certain

231
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:11,820
number of protocol values from h0 to FF

232
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,910
to protocol that I'll define she matters

233
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:17,100
this protocol has a fixed format and the

234
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:20,640
idea is that there are some functions

235
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:23,130
that can be added to the protocol itself

236
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,600
that may be relatively simple and can be

237
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:30,180
stacked right one after the other and

238
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,420
for simplifying the parsing of these

239
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:37,829
particular headers and to allow

240
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:41,189
basically intermediate node to parse

241
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:43,050
options that may not be known when the

242
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:45,960
our world is designed for those

243
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:50,910
particular nodes is a

244
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,980
is designed these headers have a fixed

245
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:57,600
that structure and can be easily skipped

246
00:14:52,980 --> 00:15:00,000
even if they are not completely known so

247
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,150
this is the text that is in the in the

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,670
in the actual draft in inversion oh wait

249
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:11,040
there were a few comments on the list

250
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:14,180
suggesting to you know make a little

251
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,699
more clear and this one and this is the

252
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:24,540
changes that we will put in version

253
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:29,100
online specifying that I mean this is

254
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,079
basically this the reason why we want to

255
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:40,470
introduce the concept of she matters

256
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:49,920
here the draft is referring to a number

257
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:51,090
of protocol type the tower the define up

258
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,740
to now

259
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:58,140
as you see the non she matters until 7f

260
00:15:55,740 --> 00:16:02,550
a traditional and well-defined protocol

261
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:06,689
and the draft refers to GBP group based

262
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:14,370
policy and IO am as protocols that are

263
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:18,860
defined as she matters I think that in

264
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:23,940
the final version of the draft the new

265
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:26,610
this table should only report protocol

266
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,470
types that are already assigned so

267
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,660
probably this table will will be in the

268
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:36,120
actual corresponding draft but I mean at

269
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:41,370
this point is in there and one comment

270
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:46,200
in terms of applications that make use

271
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:52,070
of these similar capability my

272
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:54,120
experience is that I have seen some

273
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,370
people that are designing next

274
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:01,660
generation of Essex and basically

275
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:04,990
to application that are well known and

276
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:07,000
that have a chance to be in the in the

277
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:10,270
next generation Isaac so at least in my

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:17,079
experience the group by is policy and

279
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:19,000
the IOM so I'm not sure if this is the

280
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,908
right working group where this

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,949
conversation could happen but certainly

282
00:17:21,909 --> 00:17:26,049
one question that I hear is okay so

283
00:17:23,949 --> 00:17:27,400
while we are designing and I guess

284
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:29,168
jean-yves is probably going through the

285
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,179
same process why we are designing the

286
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:36,880
next generation of aphasics that support

287
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:39,159
jean-yves or via an GP which options

288
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,830
should I include and typically the

289
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:45,880
comment that I hear is that I mean there

290
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:49,418
is a cost in allocating buffer for

291
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,580
particular feature of the protocol so if

292
00:17:49,419 --> 00:17:53,679
the feature is specified and

293
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:56,949
standardized then there is a better

294
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,429
chance that whoever designed this

295
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:04,210
component decides to allocate cost to to

296
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:07,870
basically support those features so in

297
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:09,580
my opinion it would help if in some

298
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,750
group I don't know if it is this one or

299
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,449
what it is there will be some

300
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:15,010
conversation on how to basically use

301
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:21,460
this option this I think could be

302
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:22,929
helpful as well for for for genève and I

303
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:32,200
don't know if you have a question I can

304
00:18:22,929 --> 00:18:35,140
take it now or later okay so the next

305
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,460
version there are these comments that I

306
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,210
have mentioned here there needs to be

307
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,130
addressed there is a companion graph of

308
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:44,679
this one we have a similar feature to

309
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,460
fix LAN GP in the least working group

310
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,539
and is called GP to no surprise and I've

311
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:56,230
got a few comments from the transport

312
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:58,450
area reviewers that I think should be

313
00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:02,559
reflected in this draft as well is

314
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:06,950
basically about transport implications

315
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:10,668
and how to be compliant with RFC 885

316
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:14,119
about UDP encapsulated packet so I think

317
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:17,029
I should we should basically do those

318
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:21,259
updates and then I don't know I think

319
00:19:17,029 --> 00:19:24,289
one of the question for today is does it

320
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:27,049
make sense to advance to this draft

321
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:29,600
information you know go through Laska

322
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:31,580
let's call and and do the due process

323
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:35,928
and these I guess is a question that we

324
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:40,428
will discuss later and that's it thank

325
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:45,169
you Greg mercy City two questions first

326
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:48,200
is that how active I am to be

327
00:19:45,169 --> 00:19:50,690
encapsulated in the excellent GP because

328
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,970
I think that it's a similar situation

329
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:56,169
that there might be multiple ways to do

330
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,609
it you can use IP and then use

331
00:19:56,169 --> 00:20:02,749
destination port number two the

332
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:06,590
multiplex known active protocols

333
00:20:02,749 --> 00:20:12,619
it could be MPLS and use Gale label and

334
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:19,340
then have a CH and channel type to the

335
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:22,988
multiplex so you want to be a

336
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:26,178
multiplicity or you will basically

337
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:29,389
instruct implementers that you should

338
00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:31,070
use particular encapsulation method so

339
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:32,689
what we define here is just the

340
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:34,879
capability to identify your next

341
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:37,220
protocol and then you know we define

342
00:20:34,879 --> 00:20:41,090
these she matters with a fixed structure

343
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:43,970
so when you pass the packet you will

344
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,759
find the type the length and basically

345
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:48,619
the next protocol so if you know about a

346
00:20:46,759 --> 00:20:51,889
particular protocol you can go and and

347
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:53,178
you know pass further deeper if not you

348
00:20:51,889 --> 00:20:55,729
know you just skip to the next header

349
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:58,940
and do it for encapsulation of i/o I am

350
00:20:55,730 --> 00:21:02,869
in particular I mean from the Vic's LAN

351
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:05,869
GPE point of view it's just one either I

352
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:09,259
mean then as long as the she matters

353
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:11,299
respect this format of having a type a

354
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:14,090
length and the next protocol field in

355
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,859
the right position then it's up to the

356
00:21:14,090 --> 00:21:18,090
document I believe that is the author of

357
00:21:15,859 --> 00:21:21,270
Mike my question was different

358
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:27,168
question was not about I am but active I

359
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:32,340
am so it's a protocols like stamp BFD

360
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:36,120
pink traceroute so those are I am

361
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,189
protocols yes okay I think that there is

362
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,760
a bit right and that is will be will be

363
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:44,159
the there isn't a further protocol

364
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,900
further down in the stock right it will

365
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,779
be the last protocol carried it and if

366
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,480
in the reason I am draft for OMB for

367
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:54,570
that that is used to identify that the

368
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:58,260
payload of the actual Vic's LAN packet

369
00:21:54,570 --> 00:22:01,620
is an OEM packet what's the value of

370
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,270
this bit what it helps with if for

371
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:12,270
example the multiplexing is done by the

372
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:15,360
UDP port or channel type in ACH I really

373
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:19,289
don't understand the value of this obut

374
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,689
for active or am use case okay I think

375
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:26,340
it was supposed to you know to leave it

376
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:29,039
to the to this layer the capability to

377
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,320
use this for for OAM capabilities I

378
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,140
don't think that has been particularly

379
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,408
developed I think that the document will

380
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:40,230
our specification will benefit if it

381
00:22:37,409 --> 00:22:42,960
will be more deterministic and clear

382
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,600
about what's the use case for albeit

383
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,789
because otherwise it's kind of confusing

384
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:54,418
okay another thing is that you have a

385
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:57,120
protocol type v BN g yeah so i can

386
00:22:54,419 --> 00:23:00,120
assume that it's for control and user

387
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:04,020
plain separation use case so I would

388
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:06,360
probably name it for cups or something

389
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,610
like that because control user play

390
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:14,668
separation not necessarily specific to

391
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:18,449
VB M G and V B and G again it's more

392
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:21,179
accurately will be this desegregated bng

393
00:23:18,450 --> 00:23:23,880
that uses it because part of it can be a

394
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:29,270
physical entities and part of it could

395
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:31,850
be virtualized so either it's DB ng or

396
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:35,570
our cups because cups is more generic

397
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:39,050
yeah in general I mean what week's LAN

398
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:42,919
GP does define defines the wrap-up right

399
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:46,129
then what goes inside it it depends from

400
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,700
from the particular extension that one

401
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:51,620
wants to define so yeah and as I say

402
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:56,180
probably all those reference will

403
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:59,000
disappear because I mean the they should

404
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:02,540
be defined in the actual draft that is

405
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:07,280
specifying what VM BG's or what GBP is

406
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:11,780
or what whatever particular extension

407
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:14,690
one wants to define Sam Waldron one

408
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,760
quick question I'm not security expert

409
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:20,390
by any means this one I understand

410
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,490
because your draft doesn't address this

411
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:28,250
like how do you secure the payload like

412
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:30,920
how exactly carry the keys and so I mean

413
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,230
traditionally what what is done in

414
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:35,840
practice is using some form of IPSec

415
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,930
whenever you know Vic's LAN GP is

416
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:40,520
carried typically outside of the data

417
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:42,770
center if you want to secure the Vics

418
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,810
LAN GP layer what you could do is define

419
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:47,690
one extension it is probably similar to

420
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:50,600
the work you guys were doing for genève

421
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,960
that could provide authentication or

422
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:58,189
could provide encryption of the rest of

423
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:04,180
the payload that is not okay it will

424
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:04,180
actually help to understand yeah thanks

425
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:11,990
front workers I just want to go and echo

426
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:15,260
it would be a big help for implementers

427
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:17,750
to go and see us allocating code points

428
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,090
in some shape and form so that we can go

429
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:21,470
and have at least harmonization across

430
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:25,639
the current implementations whether we

431
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:28,160
we have this as an IETF work or not I

432
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:30,650
think if we have harmonization in some

433
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:34,100
means and the way to go and progress

434
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:37,240
this either as a kind of working group

435
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:39,800
blast informational or an ad blessed

436
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,080
information all forward maybe agnostic

437
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,010
and go and guides and give us some

438
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,040
guidance from

439
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,920
of his isg perspective I think it would

440
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:50,420
be of benefit to us so that we at least

441
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,130
get the implementations that are out

442
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,480
there to use the same code points and

443
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:56,600
help harmonization and and

444
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,250
interoperability so I think it's it's a

445
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,010
good approach I think you're referring

446
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:03,380
to this life it helps my document for

447
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:08,000
sure yeah and I think it adds

448
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:13,310
implementers yeah from Hawaii go back to

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:17,570
the modifications yeah so here you mean

450
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:20,960
that the tunnel and points which is

451
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:24,980
declared to be to support weeks on T P

452
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,930
is that at least it should know there's

453
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,000
a tab and there's a list of the shim

454
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:33,700
header so that it can skip it

455
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:37,730
so if our tunnel endpoint which does not

456
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:40,100
recognize the type Orleans should not be

457
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,720
declared to support a big sign TP at all

458
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,000
yes okay okay

459
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:45,920
another format is fixed right so

460
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,080
basically you know that even if you

461
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:50,720
don't know what the actual she made her

462
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,760
contains you know that the first byte is

463
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,620
the type the second is the length and

464
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,440
the fourth bite is the next protocol so

465
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:59,780
you can skip what you guys so the second

466
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,710
question is do you think the order of

467
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,129
the shim headers matter because there is

468
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:07,070
one draft

469
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,610
I think Sammy is it was craft I don't

470
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:14,990
know its current statue it is basically

471
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:17,750
it is extension of the evpn which is

472
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:20,270
used to negotiate the the order of the

473
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:24,500
different theories in Geneva I do think

474
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:31,879
it is a firm requirement to fix ntp or

475
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:36,950
not so I mean I think there is more

476
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:39,740
flexibility today in the way hardware is

477
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:41,870
working in terms of having some more

478
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:44,780
flexibility in terms of parsing a header

479
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:46,340
like this one the more structure you can

480
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:53,510
give to the other the better it is for

481
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:54,800
sure I mean it's hard to and it's the

482
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:56,940
same conversation we're having before

483
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:59,430
right when you go and design some Isaac

484
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,800
you allocate some cost to support some

485
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:06,200
of this feature which one do you support

486
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:10,919
so that is and is really you know the

487
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,260
the aspect that is is relevant here

488
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:14,970
[Applause]

489
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:18,090
that's why I mean having the she matters

490
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,970
in front one of the motivation is it

491
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:23,449
helps you know designing and locating

492
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:26,370
buffer to to handle those use case

493
00:28:23,450 --> 00:28:28,260
ordering might be helpful the problem is

494
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:31,260
which is the order and what do you do

495
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:33,510
when when when you don't support in a

496
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:39,300
certain order if you have suggestion

497
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:43,530
yeah that I mean can help it's it's hard

498
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:47,000
to to say that a B C and D should should

499
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:47,000
happen and then right

500
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:52,830
I think it would be beneficial if we

501
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,840
would be able to agree on an order I

502
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,000
don't think that we are ready to agree

503
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,980
on an order if you look at the lengthy

504
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,350
discussions were having for roughly 20

505
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,710
years yeah on extension header ordering

506
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:08,639
in v6 and where it's still like could I

507
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:10,170
go prior to your header please you're

508
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,250
not sure well that's a useful discussion

509
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:19,130
to go and do it again here agree and I

510
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:23,040
mean I will just be brief

511
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:25,770
my personal comment would be is that it

512
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:29,220
used to be very nice white weight fixed

513
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:43,070
header protocol and now you are like

514
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:43,070
Genevan GUI that hurts I know thank you

515
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,789
so let's talk about the best pcr model

516
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:22,949
of anvil sorry

517
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:26,850
so just a brief introduction of this

518
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:30,789
this draft first of all the motivation

519
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:33,070
this draft is aimed to a fury in the

520
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:39,190
graph of the ITF and we ascertain what

521
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:41,710
happened the IDF will Surya and it is

522
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:45,640
called a base Jung is that it is focused

523
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:48,990
on a common and useful part of the three

524
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:52,690
technologies such as excellent imagery

525
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:56,169
generics Lassiter and it is designed to

526
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,770
be complained to the unwary architecture

527
00:30:56,169 --> 00:31:02,520
and for the current status this draft is

528
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:06,750
adopted is working group documents as

529
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:11,460
September and the version 0 0 is just

530
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:15,100
rewrote we search hinge of the title and

531
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:20,140
for vision zr1 there's just some

532
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:25,809
cleaning of the grammar errors and you

533
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:29,230
know okay so here is just a overview of

534
00:31:25,809 --> 00:31:31,870
the very base young for people who are

535
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:35,190
new to this draft the basic idea is that

536
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:39,129
we firstly define the via instances and

537
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:43,270
we indicate which interface which ve

538
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:45,700
that this via instances is attached to

539
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:49,720
and multiple via instances can be

540
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:54,309
attached to the same every interface and

541
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,799
the interface Steve is defined in a way

542
00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:01,690
that we augment the interface young and

543
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,418
there are other features like the BGP

544
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:08,500
controlling enabler and disappear in the

545
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:12,970
east and multicasts and I won't go into

546
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:16,390
more details here so here is the results

547
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:19,780
from the young validator now and we have

548
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:23,020
six hours and the two earnings and forth

549
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:25,389
burnings the not hearts handle and the

550
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:28,990
father errors there are two errors about

551
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:31,450
the keywords I just realized that we

552
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,150
have put it at the wrong place and I

553
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:37,750
will update that means in the next

554
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:40,090
version and the other versions are all

555
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:43,690
related to the same to the same thing

556
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:47,409
which is the IETF BGP as will be n

557
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:51,130
because this draft is not an RC yet but

558
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:54,340
we augment this young in our draft to

559
00:32:51,130 --> 00:33:00,880
indicate which VI instance is used i

560
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:03,418
style our 3 VPN and the ITF bgp else

561
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,290
will be in this draft itself has

562
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:12,669
appeared for now and so for the next

563
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:14,820
step I don't know how to I don't know

564
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:18,580
exactly how to handle this situation

565
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:22,120
probably we should contact the ITF BGP

566
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:27,360
as we repeal sirs to verify if they will

567
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:33,129
keep working on the draft if now because

568
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:38,290
this is the the only Australian young in

569
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:42,510
ITF so I think we are not it is not easy

570
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:46,270
to decouple from it so I would like to

571
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:51,070
to the working group in this situation

572
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:54,940
if we go faster than this ITF pgpr a VPN

573
00:33:51,070 --> 00:34:05,530
will this cause a miss Roffe situation

574
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:06,730
or something like that and it's

575
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:08,949
motive reference I mean by definition

576
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:14,440
it's going to cause a miss Roth yeah

577
00:34:08,949 --> 00:34:17,259
okay okay which is not really a problem

578
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,630
it so it can be a problem if things end

579
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:21,520
up if there's a such a dependency that

580
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,380
there is some inaccuracy at the end of

581
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,020
the day and your draft first is still

582
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:31,510
the l3 VP 1 at the L 3 ppm one

583
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:33,219
eventually ends up being published we

584
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,700
can hold I mean we can hold the draft

585
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:38,830
and waiting for the l3 VPN one before

586
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:41,049
before sending it to the is J is usually

587
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:43,960
the best waiter yeah okay I'm sorry in

588
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:48,190
this draft away justice simply augments

589
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:50,800
like just one one container of two

590
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,590
attitudes this draft actually so it is

591
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,340
not that complicated in terms of

592
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:59,250
technology here okay yeah so to have

593
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:07,510
have their comments we got into the

594
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:08,740
toaster these are here whose red gives

595
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:15,700
you to raise your hand if you if you

596
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:18,790
read this latest version of the draft no

597
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:21,549
okay I think it would be really useful

598
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:25,270
to have some more review of this young

599
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:27,130
model so please if you could review the

600
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,380
draft and and send comments to list I'll

601
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:31,980
be great thank you

602
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,980
thank you guys

603
00:35:53,140 --> 00:36:00,770
hello this is Eagle I'm going to give

604
00:35:57,319 --> 00:36:03,829
brief introduction on this loops which

605
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,410
is an ongoing effort happened in

606
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:08,780
transport area but what kind of thing is

607
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,859
relevant to a Maori working group

608
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:15,829
especially when we talks about how to

609
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:25,279
binding how to bind the functionality to

610
00:36:15,829 --> 00:36:28,670
their to the certain protocols okay

611
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,579
there are a couple of use cases but here

612
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:35,599
I'm going to only talk about er the the

613
00:36:31,579 --> 00:36:38,510
most typical one thinking about we are

614
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,230
trying to use we call it cloud Internet

615
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:46,819
overlay Network trying to use the

616
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:48,260
cloud-based rather than the public

617
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:53,630
Annette based OH

618
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:55,550
when pass to build a better pass via the

619
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:57,950
overlay nodes the overlay nodes here

620
00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:01,490
means some possibly some virtual

621
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:04,460
machines created from the cloud

622
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:07,129
providers over different geographical

623
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:11,060
sites possibly in multiple or single

624
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:14,060
cloud we did some experiments based on

625
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,549
37 such cloud we call cloud routers

626
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:19,430
globally then eventually in fact we

627
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:23,000
found we found there basically have 71

628
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:26,328
percent chances of finding a better path

629
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:29,329
in terms of the latency I'm not going to

630
00:37:26,329 --> 00:37:31,819
give order data here this is just to

631
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:34,160
give a very brief introduction so that

632
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:37,160
we found out there are still that the

633
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,690
problems of the laws still exist even

634
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,540
with the selected path so loops the

635
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:47,510
local optimization of path segments and

636
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:49,369
the goal of it is trying to provide so

637
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:53,060
called the local in-network loss

638
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:55,940
recovery over specific segments or

639
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,660
segments to optimize the packet delivery

640
00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:03,190
so here the segments actually means the

641
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:04,649
valet hub the in local means over a

642
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:07,780
single

643
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:10,420
overlay hub so the in network loss

644
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,940
recovery can be done either by the real

645
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,940
transmission or by the forward error

646
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:18,640
correction FEC so there are basically

647
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:21,010
three fundamental elements of loops

648
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,900
the first one is their local recovery

649
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:28,660
the generic information model and it can

650
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:33,580
be encapsulated in a variety of formats

651
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:35,680
so this is where genève jumping here so

652
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:38,170
genève could be a protocol that can

653
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:42,569
embed the loops functionality there

654
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:45,370
possibly some others like gie which

655
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:47,350
giant natively has already the sequence

656
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:49,750
number which is which is a little bit

657
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:52,150
different from ginny of course there are

658
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,630
some other elements of loops like the in

659
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:57,580
order to make sure the retransmission

660
00:38:54,630 --> 00:39:00,760
happens in time there might be some

661
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:06,569
local measurement and also in in order

662
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:08,590
to not interfere with the end-to-end TCP

663
00:39:06,570 --> 00:39:11,710
retransmission there must be some

664
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:14,830
congestion feedback so easy and possibly

665
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:18,490
can be used here so how it relates to

666
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:21,220
Geneva and the there there is a solution

667
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:24,310
sketch it gives the whole picture of

668
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,399
loops function for example like the

669
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:29,529
sequence space and how to determine the

670
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:32,050
initial sequence number and how to

671
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,510
generate the acknowledgments whether the

672
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:37,180
neck or positive action be used whether

673
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:39,220
the selecting actually be used and if

674
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,379
the forward error correction is used

675
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:45,700
what's the structure of it and how to

676
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:47,710
how to detect loss how persistent the

677
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:50,319
retransmission should be only reference

678
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,330
me for once or retransmits for a certain

679
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,230
amount of time all these are actually

680
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:59,860
more like transport technology related

681
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:02,920
that so that's why this work is in

682
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:05,500
transport area if you're interested you

683
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:07,540
can look at the draft here but of course

684
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:10,270
there it comes to the encapsulation

685
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:11,890
eventually so de genève binding should

686
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:14,259
define the format when

687
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,808
if we're embedding the loops to Geneva

688
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:19,390
so basically it tries to map the

689
00:40:16,809 --> 00:40:22,079
functions to Geneva define the data plan

690
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:24,640
format also there possibly some Geneva

691
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,559
specifics that need to be taken care of

692
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,549
for example the Geneva has a mandatory

693
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:33,720
field the code vni how to set this value

694
00:40:30,549 --> 00:40:36,849
there possibly that's I remember

695
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:40,089
remember there is a CC bit which will

696
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:42,339
control bit to indicate it's more like a

697
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:44,140
control message with our payload in

698
00:40:42,339 --> 00:40:48,640
Geneva so there are possibly some

699
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:51,190
specifics so there is a there is a draft

700
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,859
which can be served as a starting point

701
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,289
for this mapping but the function

702
00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:58,269
mapping this is a proposed that looks

703
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:00,700
option I mean oh good I'm I don't think

704
00:40:58,269 --> 00:41:03,129
we should go to too much details here

705
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:07,230
because it's very initial version and we

706
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:09,609
haven't reach the stage that we have a

707
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,609
broad consensus or what kind of

708
00:41:09,609 --> 00:41:16,029
functionality the loop should achieve so

709
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:19,660
but this is just to show that in order

710
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:22,960
to embed the function of loops there we

711
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:26,710
possibly need a namespace for it and we

712
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:31,539
need tags to indicate like like the

713
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:34,299
packet sequence number and also the some

714
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:37,809
flags to indicate whether times then be

715
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:39,730
there or act number or in the and the

716
00:41:37,809 --> 00:41:42,640
the the different information fault

717
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:48,640
knowledge meant the things like that it

718
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:51,578
has to be defined eventually so just for

719
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,700
your information loops had above in last

720
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:56,710
ITF meeting in transport area there was

721
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:59,710
a some feedback showing that the

722
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,799
standard standardization was required so

723
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:05,829
if you're interested you can see the

724
00:42:01,799 --> 00:42:09,069
slice deck from last meeting so we are

725
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:11,529
going to discuss in more details for the

726
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:14,558
design issue which including the

727
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:16,269
encapsulation and possibly some some

728
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,940
other issues but I guess the

729
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:24,189
encapsulation it might be of interest to

730
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:25,300
email three attendees here so they're

731
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,950
the people

732
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,630
might have interested including the

733
00:42:26,950 --> 00:42:30,970
transport protocol designers and the

734
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:34,840
tunnel protocol designers and of course

735
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:36,430
FEC experts so if you are interested in

736
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:40,450
this you are welcome to join us tomorrow

737
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:44,020
morning at Rome orchard and there are

738
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:45,939
some drafts available specific to Geneva

739
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:49,660
there is an encapsulation

740
00:42:45,940 --> 00:43:05,250
so if yeah you are welcome to to review

741
00:42:49,660 --> 00:43:05,250
it that's all any comments ok thanks

742
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:29,310
hello everyone i'm sami from city yes

743
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:34,460
presentation is on PFD Fotini we have a

744
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,460
update this chapter to the Roman version

745
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:43,799
in the latest version we use MB of three

746
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:45,089
of visual terms to substituted some

747
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,300
official terms

748
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:53,279
this figure specifies the relationship

749
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:56,310
between this we are defined terms and

750
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,960
the evenings virtual new network of

751
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:05,640
virtualization age it really represents

752
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:09,690
the Geneva no endpoint at PS means 10 in

753
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:12,420
the system it represents the physical or

754
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:17,640
virtual device attached to a Geneva

755
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:21,720
tunnel endpoint minute he means virtual

756
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:24,328
access point it represents the in the

757
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:32,730
east side of the interface between the a

758
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:36,869
million and the TS three options for PFD

759
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:40,950
over Geneva is artifacting in this chart

760
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:45,329
this is the first one when Geneva tano

761
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:52,250
is used to carry is Annette frames this

762
00:44:45,329 --> 00:44:56,280
a packet format will be used we can see

763
00:44:52,250 --> 00:45:00,510
within the outer UDP header the random

764
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:04,410
destination part 1681 is used to

765
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:07,050
indicate the Geneva header and the

766
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,980
reason the Geneva header the prototype

767
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:14,150
is set to the value 2 indicating but to

768
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:17,839
indicate the Ethernet frame

769
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:22,549
the beanies the Jem'Hadar they're in the

770
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:26,210
Ethernet header in the IP UDP header all

771
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:30,160
the fields in East the genome header we

772
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:35,109
are follow the format and the value said

773
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:40,690
that's in chapter ITF PFD they sent

774
00:45:35,109 --> 00:45:40,690
which he is already in is G processing

775
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:50,779
this is the second encapsulation for our

776
00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:54,470
PFD fortune Eve when a pivot on o is

777
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:59,930
used to carry IP packets this packet

778
00:45:54,470 --> 00:46:03,680
from it will be used we can see within

779
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:05,000
the UDP outer UDP header destination

780
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:08,440
powder is the same always approved

781
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:12,529
previous one and the reason a new header

782
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:17,809
the prototype will be set to the value

783
00:46:12,529 --> 00:46:20,930
of ipv4 or ipv6 and immediately fall

784
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:25,549
follows a to new header there is the

785
00:46:20,930 --> 00:46:28,038
inner IP header the source I peeled off

786
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:31,579
the in the IP header will be the IP

787
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:35,450
address of the VAP of the originating

788
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:39,020
MBE and destination IP will be the IP

789
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:43,538
address of a IP of the terminating Vee

790
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:49,609
and under the IP TTL must be set to 1

791
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:51,710
for the inner IP header and the beneath

792
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:54,529
of the IP header there's a you'd be

793
00:46:51,710 --> 00:47:00,680
higher in the UDP header there's a well

794
00:46:54,529 --> 00:47:07,450
known destination port 3784 used to

795
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:12,100
indicate the PFD control message this is

796
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:15,460
the third one twenty new handle is used

797
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:19,569
to carry amperes packets this packet

798
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:20,710
format will be used we've seen the outer

799
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:22,650
OTP header

800
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:25,720
it's the same with the previous two

801
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:28,170
within the genève header the product

802
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:32,770
petticoat ID will be you will be said to

803
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:37,000
the value of MPs and there beneath the

804
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:40,570
Geneva header the emperor's interface

805
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:45,990
contacts label ampere scale and amperes

806
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:49,330
the GAC edge ampere scale is a

807
00:47:45,990 --> 00:47:52,990
special-purpose label certain label and

808
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:58,060
the ampere the GIC edge should be said

809
00:47:52,990 --> 00:48:07,359
to the value 0 X 0 0 at 22 that's

810
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:10,960
requested by of c64 28 and a mountain

811
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:13,710
amperes interface context label would be

812
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:17,290
used to identify a VAP of the

813
00:48:13,710 --> 00:48:25,380
originating we ve and the VAP of the

814
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:29,830
timidity and ve during a discussion our

815
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:33,100
PFD for vex LAN on a meaningless a

816
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:37,560
question was raised she will allow

817
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:42,100
multiple PFD sessions for one being I

818
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:44,920
this figure is derived from a me

819
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:50,529
reference model of a MV of three

820
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:53,170
architecture obviously a t14 I think

821
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:56,710
from the Emil 3 architecture point of

822
00:48:53,170 --> 00:49:06,210
view we should allow multiple we have

823
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:09,540
the sessions for one being I as we know

824
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:14,369
base-10 GPE is also a data plane

825
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:19,259
solution that's developed adopted in a

826
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:20,040
BOC working group so a question raised

827
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:22,950
here

828
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:27,170
do we need to and some notes saying it's

829
00:49:22,950 --> 00:49:31,379
applicability to extend GPE because

830
00:49:27,170 --> 00:49:36,089
comparing the Geneva encapsulation with

831
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:38,970
vexxt ntp encapsulation we believe that

832
00:49:36,089 --> 00:49:46,730
the mechanism described in this chapter

833
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:46,730
can also be applied to phase 10 GbE so

834
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:54,839
wasting this chapter is already stable

835
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:02,760
so we as for working could without

836
00:49:54,839 --> 00:50:05,150
option Sam Waldron I have question like

837
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:10,619
why do you need those three types

838
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:14,430
this is genève VFD for Geneva right the

839
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:16,609
second option is good enough why do you

840
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:19,290
have to come up with none of the either

841
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:22,710
you're not clear what is the right one

842
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:23,070
or is it something a classic of your

843
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:27,660
mind

844
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:31,260
Geneva is a multi protocol it came a

845
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:32,098
carry multi-protocol payload so what

846
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:35,339
you're talking about

847
00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:38,460
VFP for genève yes it's not about

848
00:50:35,339 --> 00:50:42,259
payload it is about for Geneva but you

849
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:46,260
know instructor PFD sessions are

850
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:49,740
originated and terminated via P where P

851
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:54,080
is a the AMIA side of the interface

852
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:58,890
between ma e and the TS so for different

853
00:50:54,080 --> 00:51:04,619
payload the VIP we use different

854
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:05,140
encapsulation for the PFD there's a

855
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:10,750
different

856
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:16,328
kinds of VIP you know Gregg mercy City

857
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:23,309
I'm confer on this draft and III think

858
00:51:16,329 --> 00:51:27,180
that yes it might be that some

859
00:51:23,309 --> 00:51:28,559
implementations on of genève will do

860
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,269
[Music]

861
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:36,099
world balancing based on the payload

862
00:51:31,269 --> 00:51:40,259
though I think it's not likely when we

863
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:44,849
started this work there was no draft on

864
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:51,549
possible encapsulations of active om and

865
00:51:44,849 --> 00:51:53,710
I think that probably the better outcome

866
00:51:51,549 --> 00:51:57,910
would be is that if working group

867
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:00,309
decides that active om should use one

868
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:03,430
particular encapsulation across all

869
00:52:00,309 --> 00:52:06,400
active protocols so and that as I

870
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:10,019
mentioned earlier at the Mike is the

871
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:14,400
purpose of draft that we have now on

872
00:52:10,019 --> 00:52:20,558
listing all possible om encapsulations

873
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:26,250
but my my personal opinion is that for

874
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:31,660
different kinds of VIP you know the

875
00:52:26,250 --> 00:52:32,470
different payload will be carried in

876
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,250
Geneva know

877
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:38,890
so for PFD we also need to test

878
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:45,869
different kinds of payload of genome

879
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:45,868
tunnel well again

880
00:52:47,190 --> 00:52:56,470
BFD specifies RFC 58 eighty that it

881
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:59,558
monitors the path between two systems

882
00:52:56,470 --> 00:53:03,069
and to certain extend the forwarding

883
00:52:59,559 --> 00:53:09,910
engine on insist on on the systems that

884
00:53:03,069 --> 00:53:13,210
host be of the application so yes if we

885
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:16,868
use different encapsulation we will have

886
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:20,289
some benefit of verifying that this

887
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:24,700
particular encapsulation is working

888
00:53:20,289 --> 00:53:27,690
somewhat but at the same time the

889
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:31,000
problem would be is that how to

890
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:34,299
endpoints agree on which encapsulation

891
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,779
use if multiple encapsulations

892
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:40,750
can be supported so they're assessing it

893
00:53:37,779 --> 00:53:44,890
there is something to discuss I I'm not

894
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:46,809
aware of any dependency between the

895
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:49,089
encapsulation for BFD you know in other

896
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,990
areas where we will use BFD over tunnel

897
00:53:49,089 --> 00:53:52,569
some kind of tunnel

898
00:53:49,990 --> 00:53:55,359
I can tell Erin pseudo are not aware of

899
00:53:52,569 --> 00:53:57,430
a dependency between how you encapsulate

900
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:00,369
a PFD and how you encapsulate the

901
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:03,700
payload so I think in the interest of

902
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:05,890
time right what we need to do if for

903
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:08,169
example take and peel that the solution

904
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,759
number two if you are saying that that

905
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:11,980
is not going to solve the problem the

906
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:13,569
respective payload type I think that is

907
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:16,660
fundamentally something wrong in how you

908
00:54:13,569 --> 00:54:18,460
are actually designing yes I think that

909
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:20,558
the solution right so we need to really

910
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,039
think through it's it's not going to be

911
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,349
payload type there's a protocol for the

912
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:30,220
data plane header yeah I want to suggest

913
00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:33,460
one point at one point the PFD over

914
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:37,209
Geneva is different from the underlie

915
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:40,990
PFD so if we run PFD between the MBE

916
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:44,259
just for underlay test we can use just a

917
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:47,589
one kind of encapsulation because it has

918
00:54:44,259 --> 00:54:48,509
to underlie but if we want to use PFD

919
00:54:47,589 --> 00:54:53,230
for Geneva

920
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:54,849
actually we want to test the overlay you

921
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:59,430
know you suggest it's a tunnel

922
00:54:54,849 --> 00:55:03,400
so the different tunnel appeal out maybe

923
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:06,308
should use different PFD encapsulation

924
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:08,920
so that's the point so maybe I think you

925
00:55:06,309 --> 00:55:12,430
should really come up clearly like why

926
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:15,339
do you need different types of BFP in

927
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,140
different use cases I think and we're

928
00:55:15,339 --> 00:55:19,150
talking purely about the orderly and

929
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:21,609
we're not talking about underlay okay

930
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:24,130
why do we need that I think if you can

931
00:55:21,609 --> 00:55:27,788
make really good call on that then we

932
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:30,200
can discuss I think the thing is another

933
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:32,450
you know that another cases where

934
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,310
we have another VPN technologists a

935
00:55:32,450 --> 00:55:37,368
pseudo eyes if you have an Ethernet

936
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:38,660
pseudo eye or if you have an ATM suit

937
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:41,119
away you don't have a different bfdi

938
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:42,140
encapsulation for VCC v b FD for those

939
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:48,079
different types but they're completely

940
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:50,629
different technologists for the for the

941
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:53,000
for the you know for the what that case

942
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:56,930
is the virtual connectivity right

943
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:59,349
basically because we are monitoring the

944
00:55:56,930 --> 00:56:04,578
pseudo wire itself not the service

945
00:55:59,349 --> 00:56:09,079
correct right so I agree if we are

946
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:12,800
monitoring Geneva tano then we need to

947
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:16,900
be clear that we are monitoring Geneva

948
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:19,550
no not there any extension to their

949
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,770
tenant well we are we monitoring the

950
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:24,500
Geneva tunnel or we munching the vni the

951
00:56:21,770 --> 00:56:25,759
connectivity for the VN I I think I

952
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:27,680
think one of the issues here is maybe

953
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:30,470
that the the layering here is not very

954
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:31,069
clear the OEM architecture is not really

955
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,328
that clear

956
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:34,430
and maybe that needs to be clarified

957
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:37,010
somewhere either this draft or and in

958
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:41,779
the OEM requirements we've got or some

959
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:43,310
sort of om architecture draft so it so

960
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:45,920
we'll meet when we say we're monitoring

961
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:51,799
Geneva what are we what we mean and

962
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:54,680
which layers do we inject OEM okay we

963
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:59,180
had very good discussion about what

964
00:56:54,680 --> 00:57:03,290
we're monitoring in course of working

965
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:05,799
through PFD over VX LAN and actually

966
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:11,779
what we agreed is that in most cases

967
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:14,420
monitoring VX LAN on one of VN eyes may

968
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:17,240
be sufficient but at the same time there

969
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:23,089
is an clear interest of being able to

970
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:26,089
monitor separate vni so but again at the

971
00:57:23,089 --> 00:57:29,270
same time it's orthogonal to the

972
00:57:26,089 --> 00:57:33,980
question of how we encapsulate BFD

973
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:37,040
packet into their overlaid channel so

974
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:40,339
it's only was the discussion of whether

975
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:44,920
we allow multiple leave these sessions

976
00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:44,920
between two endpoints

977
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:51,870
but the difference is that for Pakistan

978
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,870
we have just eaten and frame/s rappel

979
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:59,069
out but fortune if we have different

980
00:57:54,870 --> 00:58:03,020
kinds of payload yes we may have

981
00:57:59,070 --> 00:58:06,720
different kinds of payload but again

982
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:09,140
unless we know of the cases where some

983
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:15,270
implementations will look at their

984
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:19,580
genève payload to do ecmp I think that

985
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:22,530
there might be a little value of

986
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:29,390
documenting and standardizing multiple

987
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:29,390
encapsulations for active OAM because if

988
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:44,160
like in IP so there will be done on

989
00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:48,540
outer encapsulation then there oh my be

990
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:52,109
sharing fate with their payload with the

991
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:56,610
data traffic so regardless of how active

992
00:58:52,110 --> 00:59:00,420
I am is encapsulated so and again their

993
00:58:56,610 --> 00:59:05,760
validation of their the capsule aiding

994
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:10,170
side of their tunnel is really limited

995
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:14,370
if we use specific transport

996
00:59:10,170 --> 00:59:15,840
encapsulation for BFD packet we are

997
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,069
technically out of time now on this this

998
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:29,480
one maybe you can move on to the next

999
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:32,340
raft and take you to the list okay okay

1000
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:37,230
this presentation is about performance

1001
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:40,010
moment 14 Eve so mechanism is similar is

1002
00:59:37,230 --> 00:59:40,010
the previous one

1003
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:49,660
we disgusted BFD for genève we realize

1004
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:52,420
that we need to do performance

1005
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:54,129
measurement also for tune of tano so

1006
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:56,560
this job to specify the performance

1007
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:58,840
performance measurement method of genève

1008
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,820
tunnel and the performance measurement

1009
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:07,450
Croods a packet loss management that

1010
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:10,810
delay measurement so you can see this

1011
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:13,810
encapsulation is a similar with the PFD

1012
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:19,090
for our genève but the difference is

1013
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:20,950
that funnel in the UDP header within the

1014
01:00:19,090 --> 01:00:25,870
Union UDP header we use the destination

1015
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:29,379
port 862 to indicate to the stamp test

1016
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:32,170
packet stamp is a IP performance

1017
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:37,390
management protocol that's developed in

1018
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:40,780
IP p.m. working group so we use stamp to

1019
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:42,940
achieve performance measurement when the

1020
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:48,190
chin with handle is used to carry easily

1021
01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:52,030
at the frames this is the second

1022
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:57,160
encapsulation it's also similar with the

1023
01:00:52,030 --> 01:00:59,410
PFD 14 Eve and we use stamp to achieve

1024
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:05,799
the performance moment when the GT

1025
01:00:59,410 --> 01:01:12,060
Macondo is used to carry IP packet and

1026
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:13,990
this is the third one because for MPS

1027
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:17,620
loss management and the delay

1028
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:23,680
measurement they use different test

1029
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:27,450
message with IP p.m. so in this

1030
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:35,549
encapsulation we use test messages

1031
01:01:27,450 --> 01:01:42,660
defined in RFC 63 74 that's four anchors

1032
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:48,529
lost delay measurement so beneath the

1033
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:50,368
encapsulation there is a tested method

1034
01:01:48,529 --> 01:01:52,079
it can be lost

1035
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:54,329
management message dilemma human a

1036
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:57,839
message or combined loss delayed

1037
01:01:54,329 --> 01:02:01,230
measurement message and it's

1038
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:07,950
differentiated by different MPEG ACH

1039
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:15,089
value his values zero eggs the reserve

1040
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:19,828
the a/c D were requested by the FC 63 74

1041
01:02:15,089 --> 01:02:23,640
and among the amperes encapsulation

1042
01:02:19,829 --> 01:02:26,519
amperes interface context label will be

1043
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:29,250
used to I did identify a VAP of the

1044
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:31,529
originating MBE and the VAP of the

1045
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:39,180
terminating IDE so it's also similar

1046
01:02:31,529 --> 01:02:41,579
with a PFD over genève so next steps we

1047
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:46,669
want to ask more review and the comments

1048
01:02:41,579 --> 01:02:50,119
and the revisers dropped to improve it

1049
01:02:46,670 --> 01:02:50,119
any questions

1050
01:02:58,339 --> 01:03:04,480
so yeah I should have

1051
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:07,839
for Martin on charter and scope of the

1052
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,250
working group so it seems that in the

1053
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:11,670
context of these REM drafts you're

1054
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:14,920
you're trying to monitor the service

1055
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:19,289
almost almost an almost tenon systems

1056
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:21,460
tenant system connectivity no oh yeah

1057
01:03:19,289 --> 01:03:22,829
otherwise why do you care about how

1058
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:24,069
you're in Canada that's the tunnel

1059
01:03:22,829 --> 01:03:26,740
tunnel

1060
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:29,319
no you said you're monitoring a service

1061
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:31,029
no no no in this case it we're not

1062
01:03:29,319 --> 01:03:34,058
monitoring the service in this case

1063
01:03:31,029 --> 01:03:38,349
we're just monitoring the tunnel and it

1064
01:03:34,059 --> 01:03:42,039
helps to basically understand how for

1065
01:03:38,349 --> 01:03:45,880
operators it's useful because then they

1066
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:48,339
can understand which part of overall

1067
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:51,819
path to the tenon system contributes

1068
01:03:48,339 --> 01:03:54,549
most to certain if they experience you

1069
01:03:51,819 --> 01:03:57,279
know service degradation or something

1070
01:03:54,549 --> 01:04:00,099
that they can separate what's

1071
01:03:57,279 --> 01:04:04,000
contributing by their performance in a

1072
01:04:00,099 --> 01:04:06,400
tenant system versus their tunnel so no

1073
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:11,680
performance is clearly for their tunnel

1074
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:15,970
ok so the previous draft was service

1075
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:18,480
monitoring no it's not service per se

1076
01:04:15,970 --> 01:04:22,450
because it's not behave this session

1077
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,420
between tenant systems because if this

1078
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:28,689
session between tenant system is

1079
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:31,539
undistinguishable for their genève

1080
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:36,160
endpoints for Geneva it doesn't

1081
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:37,930
differentiate between tenant data and B

1082
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:41,710
if this session between tenant systems

1083
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:48,058
so again the previous draft again it

1084
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:53,529
monitors their tunnel and if there is a

1085
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:57,099
multi path in underlay then they can run

1086
01:04:53,529 --> 01:05:00,369
and if they know how the Vienna is being

1087
01:04:57,099 --> 01:05:04,029
placed on different underlay pests they

1088
01:05:00,369 --> 01:05:08,380
can use some intelligence to monitor

1089
01:05:04,029 --> 01:05:12,579
particular paths through very nice but

1090
01:05:08,380 --> 01:05:15,269
idea is that the D monitors continuity

1091
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:19,709
of genève tunnel between

1092
01:05:15,269 --> 01:05:23,879
endpoints of the tunnel so I mean like

1093
01:05:19,709 --> 01:05:25,859
maybe I'm not clear if you're monitoring

1094
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,499
the nve's in this case right the edge

1095
01:05:25,859 --> 01:05:30,779
where the the inner end cap is going to

1096
01:05:28,499 --> 01:05:32,908
happen our D cap is going to happen so

1097
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:38,519
why do you care about what kind of

1098
01:05:32,909 --> 01:05:43,079
payload will be scurrying after genève

1099
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:45,629
header right if you can pop the B of the

1100
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:49,549
packet pipe or so why do you really care

1101
01:05:45,630 --> 01:05:51,959
about what the payload is gonna be as

1102
01:05:49,549 --> 01:05:57,479
yes I think it's a legitimate question

1103
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:59,519
and again as I mentioned and probably

1104
01:05:57,479 --> 01:06:07,069
that's something that we need to talk

1105
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:09,988
with sham in f1 again if we know that

1106
01:06:07,069 --> 01:06:15,209
under Lane network doesn't use the

1107
01:06:09,989 --> 01:06:19,169
payload to do hashing and world

1108
01:06:15,209 --> 01:06:24,089
balancing then it's absolutely

1109
01:06:19,169 --> 01:06:28,129
irrelevant if it does use payload for

1110
01:06:24,089 --> 01:06:31,139
the load balancing then there is some

1111
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:35,059
value in using the same encapsulation

1112
01:06:31,139 --> 01:06:37,819
because then you can use certain

1113
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:43,499
algorithms and certain methods to try to

1114
01:06:37,819 --> 01:06:47,788
monitor a particular path it's again

1115
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:52,589
it's a similar how you do B of D over IP

1116
01:06:47,789 --> 01:06:56,039
MPLS Network okay so if there are

1117
01:06:52,589 --> 01:06:59,038
underlay so if you use their IP

1118
01:06:56,039 --> 01:07:03,959
encapsulation IP information from the

1119
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:06,959
LSP payload to do load balancing then

1120
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:10,408
you can use the combination of methods

1121
01:07:06,959 --> 01:07:13,618
to run your beef this session and more

1122
01:07:10,409 --> 01:07:16,709
inter-party q ler path in your multipath

1123
01:07:13,619 --> 01:07:18,359
environment I mean at least in the

1124
01:07:16,709 --> 01:07:20,609
virtual world right

1125
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:23,189
none of the transit devices know

1126
01:07:20,609 --> 01:07:25,160
anything about the enough payload so the

1127
01:07:23,189 --> 01:07:29,420
load balancing

1128
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:33,319
who doesn't arise based on the payload I

1129
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:35,900
think that is given at least annuity

1130
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:42,670
architecture document if you can well

1131
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:46,039
again I think that if we use definite

1132
01:07:42,670 --> 01:07:48,349
normative language saying that you must

1133
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:50,720
use this information for the world

1134
01:07:48,349 --> 01:07:54,349
balancing in underlay and it will be

1135
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:57,020
outer encapsulation I think that will be

1136
01:07:54,349 --> 01:08:03,349
very beneficial because it will make

1137
01:07:57,020 --> 01:08:09,109
certain that inner encapsulation has no

1138
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:18,589
any impact on choosing their path in the

1139
01:08:09,109 --> 01:08:20,000
multipath environment so if at least the

1140
01:08:18,589 --> 01:08:22,698
architecture document doesn't talk

1141
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:25,810
anything about the the transit devices

1142
01:08:22,698 --> 01:08:29,719
maybe that's a choice we have taken

1143
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:33,170
beyond me to answer that but I think at

1144
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:35,480
least from what we have is that the

1145
01:08:33,170 --> 01:08:38,949
transit devices do not play a role in

1146
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:42,559
terms of what they exist the inner

1147
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:44,660
payload is gonna be I think the benefit

1148
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,969
is as simple as this if I secure my

1149
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:48,349
inner payload there is no way they can

1150
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:50,960
actually look it up it doesn't matter

1151
01:08:48,350 --> 01:08:52,880
what kind of payload it is and by the

1152
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:55,310
way like by default everyone actually

1153
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:58,549
secures the packet in the back I think

1154
01:08:55,310 --> 01:09:00,699
the benefit is that we can use this to

1155
01:08:58,549 --> 01:09:04,009
test the encapsulation and decapsulation

1156
01:09:00,698 --> 01:09:06,219
of different kinds of payloads of Geneva

1157
01:09:04,009 --> 01:09:06,219
No

1158
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:30,380
BFD session do me a solid me is talking

1159
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:34,490
I pee right I said as I said just the

1160
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:39,140
underlay PFT is different from the PFD

1161
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:40,608
for panel yeah so all I'm saying is

1162
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:43,520
you're running beer recession from

1163
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:52,240
tunnel endpoints not dependent that

1164
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:52,240
points you may just need underlay PFD

1165
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:06,740
yeah so didn't the decisions just this

1166
01:10:03,410 --> 01:10:08,059
chapter describes that's correct

1167
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,059
so what I'm saying is you don't need

1168
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:13,220
those three different types rather you

1169
01:10:11,060 --> 01:10:16,160
can achieve with just one type which is

1170
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,470
IP which is type two you know in

1171
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:24,139
previous meeting we also have suggestion

1172
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:28,850
to just amperes actually to the point of

1173
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:35,560
IP I think that in the meeting for

1174
01:10:28,850 --> 01:10:41,950
Montreal we had a discussion and use of

1175
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:45,590
IP is probably sub optimal for

1176
01:10:41,950 --> 01:10:48,950
encapsulation because it creates a

1177
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:52,810
significant overhead and moves the PFD

1178
01:10:48,950 --> 01:10:58,360
packet out and possibly out of there

1179
01:10:52,810 --> 01:11:01,520
fast memory so that's why effectively

1180
01:10:58,360 --> 01:11:07,309
probably NPOs encapsulation is most

1181
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:09,320
efficient for the Janine I mean answered

1182
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:11,120
a bit of a generic statement to say

1183
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:14,349
moves out of the out of the fast path

1184
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:16,880
when saw somewhere the vast majority of

1185
01:11:14,350 --> 01:11:19,310
RSPB after day implementations are just

1186
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:23,320
encapsulating it in a you know and well

1187
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:26,360
LSP doesn't have their overhead of

1188
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:29,780
imagine that we have ipv6 then we have

1189
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:33,190
Geneva and then we use ipv6 in

1190
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:37,070
encapsulation for PFD okay

1191
01:11:33,190 --> 01:11:43,460
LSP doesn't have any of it not all

1192
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:45,710
virtual stacks big MPLS they all speak

1193
01:11:43,460 --> 01:11:48,739
IP okay that's that's a good point and

1194
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:51,619
that's why we have the draft which leads

1195
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:54,230
of options and we really appreciate

1196
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:55,579
their discussion about it right so I

1197
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:57,320
think we're really good to have some

1198
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:58,940
more discussion on the list general and

1199
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:03,380
some feedback from the working group in

1200
01:11:58,940 --> 01:12:09,019
general I think that if Sam will share

1201
01:12:03,380 --> 01:12:11,719
his views as expert not as well here as

1202
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:14,900
explicit as possible so I think you

1203
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:17,270
should know but yes let's do it on the

1204
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:19,308
list because if you post it in the list

1205
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:22,789
it will trigger discussion and people

1206
01:12:19,309 --> 01:12:24,739
will think okay but thanks for your

1207
01:12:22,789 --> 01:12:28,159
input I'm gonna close amazing there

1208
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:31,209
thanks very much Chevron thank you

1209
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,210
