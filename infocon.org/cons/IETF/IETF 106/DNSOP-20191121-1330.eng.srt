30 seconds please find a seat welcome to

9
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:17,320
the DNS up working groups session - I'm

10
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:22,320
Bello Bello alpha Niner Suzanne

11
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,320
sitting here Tim in the room over there

12
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:30,370
our scribe is Tim Tim Battenberg he is

13
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,620
also presenting at the at the end of the

14
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,870
meeting so who is the backup who wants

15
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:38,770
to be the backup scribe for this

16
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:44,560
afternoon what everyone should I point

17
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:46,720
someone jabber scribe yeah only as a

18
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:57,930
backup only as a backup only when Tim is

19
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:57,930
presenting let's find a usual suspect

20
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:06,369
thank you thank you sure it Stewart is

21
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:13,720
the backup slide Paul Hoffman our minute

22
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:16,630
taker next everybody is familiar with

23
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,779
the note well here the blue sheets

24
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:22,120
please fill them in because we want well

25
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:25,000
we have a very large room now but we

26
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,750
want to keep these large rooms it's very

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,750
comfortable to hear the echo

28
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:32,919
well the agenda for this afternoon is

29
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:35,590
current working group business two

30
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:41,229
presentations two drafts updates and

31
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:43,900
some new working group business our work

32
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:46,450
as previously mentioned is on of course

33
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,239
data tracker and our github so if you

34
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:52,240
want to look at that or we or want to

35
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:56,020
use that use github current working

36
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,240
group business TCP requirements Duane

37
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:05,560
and the DNS server cookies by willem and

38
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:07,120
some five new working group business so

39
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,919
of them have been presented already

40
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,110
earlier but not adopted yet good I think

41
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,260
we can get started I want to ask drain

42
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:38,680
first to kick off wax here the generic

43
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:41,590
slides for you so I'm doing this uh this

44
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,740
is a little update about the DNS over

45
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:46,690
TCP operational requirements draft that

46
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:49,930
myself and John Christopher had been

47
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,210
working on just a few sort of minor

48
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:56,710
updates since the last time we talked

49
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:59,500
about this draft we now mentioned DNS

50
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:02,109
over TLS in the abstract so to give it a

51
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,110
little more prominence there

52
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:08,640
we added some some paragraphs about

53
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,830
recent work on avoiding fragmentation

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:15,340
and and and cite those references now in

55
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,830
the at the end the last time this was

56
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:22,119
presented we got some feedback that we

57
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,159
had in the draft that clients of server

58
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,930
should use TCP fast open if available

59
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,150
and we got feedback that that was maybe

60
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:30,820
not a good idea so that is dropped down

61
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:35,289
to sort of may level suggestion instead

62
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,060
of should there's there's a couple

63
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,130
paragraphs in the document about the KSK

64
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:40,450
rollover and since that is happened

65
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,760
quite a while ago that is all now been

66
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:47,650
updated to be the past-tense instead of

67
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:49,659
present present tense and we added

68
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,460
section on our addison text to the

69
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:55,270
privacy considerations section it's

70
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:58,780
pretty it's pretty innocuous partly to

71
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,760
note that you know DNS over TCP and UDP

72
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:02,020
itself does not provide any privacy but

73
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,610
if that's what you're actually you can

74
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:08,820
use you can use TLS or DTLS and then

75
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:10,990
generally updated some of the references

76
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:12,280
so that's that's really all that's

77
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,370
changed since the last version

78
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:17,770
it's now at zero five and we think it's

79
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,389
ready for last call I was given 15

80
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:22,150
minutes up here I think I used me

81
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:25,629
- so hopefully hopeful there's lots of

82
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:30,400
questions or discussion if not that's

83
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:35,259
all I have how many people have read the

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:38,739
recent version of this document and I

85
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:42,490
comment it looks like some of you it

86
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:44,650
might be good to read it and have any

87
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:47,620
feedback but yeah if people are

88
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,870
comfortable with it we can certainly do

89
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,849
yeah I mean the colonists the the meat

90
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,819
of the document really hasn't changed in

91
00:07:51,849 --> 00:07:56,710
quite a while it's just sort of been the

92
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:04,779
supporting supporting data and anecdotes

93
00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:09,400
and stuff that's this change so okay

94
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:10,870
thank you I think we will senton have

95
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,758
any of the implementers in the room

96
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,860
tried to use this document as guidance

97
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:21,250
to their conformance or non conformance

98
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:22,449
of their own implementations okay I see

99
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,400
one

100
00:08:22,449 --> 00:08:27,219
that would probably be the other the

101
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,888
other document maybe more the the

102
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:31,719
protocol requirements document is

103
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:32,919
separate but but they are very related

104
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:35,919
what they have a lot of similar things

105
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:37,510
what I'm trying to determine is is has

106
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,708
this document been how much is this

107
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:43,569
document been tested against real-world

108
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:47,050
activities and assumptions so this is

109
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,060
Paul Hoffman um I got the feeling that

110
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:52,060
and correct me if I'm wrong Duane that

111
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:54,339
you really stayed away from requirements

112
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,000
and such in this document it really was

113
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:01,480
if you are doing this don't forget about

114
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,000
these other things in fact don't hint

115
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:05,470
don't wait until you've implemented to

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,930
think about these other things think

117
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:10,089
about them ahead of time so that might

118
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:12,519
be I mean so Suzanne another sort of way

119
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:14,290
to ask it is has this been useful to

120
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,360
anybody reading through as they were

121
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:17,290
doing their implementation to go oh

122
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,690
woops

123
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,699
thank you and that to me that's actually

124
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:23,769
thank you you would be the best parts of

125
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:26,329
this that's actually a better question

126
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:30,290
thanks Andre

127
00:09:26,329 --> 00:09:33,229
see let me clarify we we just put it

128
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,809
completely new on it working stay

129
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,319
combined and will be differently using

130
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:44,679
this document as a base of tuning it

131
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:46,519
into like well-behaved DNS server again

132
00:09:44,679 --> 00:09:54,049
okay that's exactly what I was looking

133
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:56,660
for thank you very much Brian Dixon

134
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:59,149
GoDaddy we haven't but we will

135
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,299
I mean we're gonna look over and check

136
00:09:59,149 --> 00:10:10,850
it against our implementations we expect

137
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:14,989
it to be useful thank you okay sorry

138
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:18,739
one question is it Ryan thank you for

139
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:22,939
that offer do you have an idea of a

140
00:10:18,739 --> 00:10:24,079
timeline can you do that in some time

141
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:28,939
between now in the end of the year

142
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:31,819
probably probably sooner than that yeah

143
00:10:28,939 --> 00:10:35,959
thank you for the practical when do we

144
00:10:31,819 --> 00:10:37,669
go group last call yeah I can we can

145
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,859
wait for you if it's before the end of

146
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:40,910
the year yeah feel free to ping me if I

147
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,369
have responded

148
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:47,269
I'm sure yeah and again it's for

149
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:52,639
authoritative DNS that we have our own

150
00:10:47,269 --> 00:10:55,129
implementation on thank you relaying for

151
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:58,910
peter sobota check from jabber we plan

152
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,919
to extend TCP TLS testing or not

153
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:09,019
resolver so we will have some feedback

154
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:13,309
next year that's pretty vague wait that

155
00:11:09,019 --> 00:11:15,559
long maybe we needed this them okay but

156
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:19,040
I think everything between now and next

157
00:11:15,559 --> 00:11:21,230
well a four to six weeks before the end

158
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:25,219
of the year I think is acceptable but

159
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:27,619
then we have to make progress yeah okay

160
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,600
that sounds like we can go ahead and get

161
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:31,629
after working for Blasco thank you thank

162
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,629
you

163
00:11:54,019 --> 00:12:00,539
yes sir this is about the draft that

164
00:11:57,359 --> 00:12:03,089
gives the recite that for the Neshoba

165
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:09,539
coupe ish that caters for other

166
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:12,169
different vendors so our UDP services

167
00:12:09,539 --> 00:12:15,629
that reply with a bigger response than

168
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:19,049
they request like it's possible

169
00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:22,829
readiness they are susceptible to be

170
00:12:19,049 --> 00:12:25,379
misused for amplification denial of

171
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:35,628
service attacks and this is the kind of

172
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:41,159
attack closer to the microphone yeah

173
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:45,689
that's better so it's the DNS cookies

174
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:48,509
are for to protect against reflexive

175
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:52,019
amplification attacks this is the attack

176
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:55,499
where the attackers pushed IP address of

177
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:58,799
the victim and sends a lot of small DNS

178
00:12:55,499 --> 00:13:00,839
queries which will be result in a large

179
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:05,519
answer that which the victim will be

180
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:09,779
flooded and Dena's cookies are a dienes

181
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:11,789
native mechanism to deal with this kind

182
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:15,299
of text

183
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:18,359
now that teach be the inner self at HP

184
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:20,399
would also be a solution because it has

185
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:23,669
a handshake shock spoofing is not

186
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:27,419
possible but teach PE requires quite a

187
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:29,999
lot of state at server and Dena's

188
00:13:27,419 --> 00:13:32,609
cookies are very lightweight they do not

189
00:13:29,999 --> 00:13:36,029
require a lot of state that server

190
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:38,339
actually just a single secret for all

191
00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,549
the relationships with all the clients a

192
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:45,389
server has so it is like a handshake

193
00:13:41,549 --> 00:13:46,529
though so a client this is how it works

194
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:48,619
clients that creates

195
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:51,419
clients cookie which is basically nonce

196
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:54,089
the sheriff er generates the sheriff a

197
00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:58,289
cookie based on the client cookie in the

198
00:13:54,089 --> 00:14:00,629
client IP address and returns the server

199
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:05,119
cookie alongside the client cookie in

200
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:08,659
the DNS response and in subsequent

201
00:14:05,119 --> 00:14:12,329
requests from the client the server will

202
00:14:08,659 --> 00:14:14,909
recognize yes I'm the only one that

203
00:14:12,329 --> 00:14:17,819
could have created the server cookie

204
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:21,299
show this I've seen this client before I

205
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:23,488
will provide larger answers for it if it

206
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:26,519
wants to I will not trunky get these

207
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:30,449
answers and also this client does not

208
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:34,949
need to be response late rate limited

209
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:38,069
anymore so what was the problem

210
00:14:34,949 --> 00:14:40,919
our fee seven eight seven three the DNS

211
00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:43,949
cookies are she did a great job at

212
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:47,279
defining this mechanism except that it

213
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:50,549
was sort of liberal in how the server

214
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,539
cookies would be created so the cookies

215
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:59,909
were cooked by or baked by one vendor

216
00:14:54,539 --> 00:15:04,379
were not appetizer or well received by

217
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:07,949
another partner this draft is to deal

218
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,779
with that and create reshape that all

219
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:14,848
the vendors will use sure they're all

220
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:17,329
recognize each other's cookies this

221
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:20,509
started to do implementation for all the

222
00:15:17,329 --> 00:15:24,748
well-known Upshaw's Dina's vendor

223
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:28,529
implementations at a hackathon in Prague

224
00:15:24,749 --> 00:15:31,529
at the ITF 104 and that was a big

225
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:34,019
success we had a working interoperable

226
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:38,939
server cookies for those implementations

227
00:15:34,019 --> 00:15:41,189
so we thought okay we are almost done we

228
00:15:38,939 --> 00:15:45,209
just have to do the client cookie and

229
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:47,459
then interoperable tests each other's

230
00:15:45,209 --> 00:15:50,459
implementations had resolved us to the

231
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,469
authoritative etc and then we done this

232
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:58,030
can go to law school and we finished

233
00:15:53,470 --> 00:16:00,340
except that didn't happen so we focused

234
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:02,350
on the client cookies in Montreal and we

235
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:05,710
discovered that there's a problem and to

236
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,460
explain to you why there's a problem I

237
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:11,470
have I've given here the v-shape for

238
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:14,410
client cookie that we no longer use it's

239
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,960
no longer in Commonwealth but it was

240
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:20,260
based on the clients IP address the

241
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:23,050
server IP address and a secret and we

242
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,600
need to include the server IP address

243
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:27,760
for minimal authentication but it needs

244
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,700
to have a different cookie for its

245
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:32,590
different relationships and clients IP

246
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,700
address needed to be in there for

247
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,150
privacy

248
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,820
if a client would move from one network

249
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:44,829
to another its IP address would change

250
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,700
and if it would have kept sending the

251
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:51,220
same cookie

252
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:55,420
it would have been trackable by the DNS

253
00:16:51,220 --> 00:17:00,130
server such an order if observers so

254
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:03,490
also ipv6 privacy extensions I think

255
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:06,069
that so that the cookie should be based

256
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:10,709
on client IP address for privacy we this

257
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:15,188
to not be trackable so he has a piece of

258
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:20,140
cedar seek out that does that exactly

259
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:24,100
that mechanism and this so this is

260
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:27,280
replacing basically sent to so

261
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,990
everything up to the path to send to at

262
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,220
the bottom of the function is what we

263
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:37,540
need to do for client cookies so you

264
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:39,520
might ask why is not simply a if we have

265
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:42,520
a server cookie for the server assented

266
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,500
and otherwise create a new client cookie

267
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:48,280
because that's obviously the more heavy

268
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:51,820
operation here that's because we need to

269
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:54,910
know that client IP address of to create

270
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,879
a client cookie and if we sent it an old

271
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:02,370
cookie then it might have the old might

272
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,370
be based on the old client IP address

273
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:10,020
so that so how this works is first as

274
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:13,260
you users get shocked name to get the

275
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:17,120
client IP address of cookie creates new

276
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:20,790
client cookie it's a cookie the same as

277
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,979
what we had stored for the server

278
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,639
already then we are fine if it also has

279
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:29,360
a server cookie if not then we said all

280
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,790
the cookies are new ones are calculated

281
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,000
so by the way besides not dealing with

282
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:39,180
all the error codes this piece of pita

283
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,970
card has another major flaw I think some

284
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:44,070
of you might know what it is that are

285
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:47,370
familiar with socket programming so you

286
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:50,250
cannot get the client IP address from a

287
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,560
unconnected UDP sockets right so get

288
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:55,170
shocked name doesn't actually give you

289
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,350
the client IP address so there's a trick

290
00:18:55,170 --> 00:19:08,850
to do this you create a trial socket

291
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:11,399
then connect it and sort of fake

292
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:15,570
connected to the server and then get IP

293
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:19,760
address and in classifieds so then when

294
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:22,169
we discovered that we had to do this the

295
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,980
implementers thought well this is the

296
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:31,710
straw that breaks the camel's back right

297
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:35,490
so even though if so the the draft was

298
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:38,460
adopted by the working group and we

299
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:41,100
adopted the text that said well you know

300
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:45,480
if privacy is concerned and just don't

301
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:48,750
use cookies and then on the list

302
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:51,690
people Phillip Humber mainly said well

303
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:55,140
that's a real pity and I think there

304
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:57,720
might be a way to deal with this and so

305
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,880
there was a lot of discussion both on

306
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,980
the list and off the list because we

307
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:04,050
don't want to bother the working group

308
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:08,220
with all the technical details

309
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,440
but this is where we've ended up and we

310
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,270
think this actually works preserves

311
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,030
privacy and it also has a short path

312
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:21,960
towards channeling out client cookies

313
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:24,870
and so it's completely leaving out the

314
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,380
both the server IP address and client IP

315
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:32,040
address of the client cookie generation

316
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:36,380
it's just a 64-bit nonce

317
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:40,470
it's if a client sees a new server it

318
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:43,320
creates a random cookie for it and then

319
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,170
only if the server returns yourself a

320
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,530
cookie it will store this client cookie

321
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:53,450
for that server alongside the server

322
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:57,240
cookie and also its client IP address

323
00:20:53,450 --> 00:21:02,340
then the next time the client will

324
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:07,230
connect to the server it will bind and

325
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,970
it has this chef cookie or it connects

326
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:12,240
to a server which has a server cookie as

327
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,540
well bind to the IP address and which

328
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,360
will now cause failure if IP address

329
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:21,690
changed and so it can then create a new

330
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:35,070
client cookie so this was tested

331
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:37,530
it's a hackathon and sort of works so

332
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,870
I'm a little confused so you don't want

333
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:42,570
to put the client IP address through a

334
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,399
hash function for privacy reasons but

335
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:48,480
you still keep the client up here as in

336
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,270
memory with the cookies or I if you see

337
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,880
if you gain that's not clear to me the

338
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,930
privacy is that you would not send out

339
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,860
the same client cookie while your IP

340
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:05,750
address has changed so cookies can be

341
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,159
used to track a client unless it's

342
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:13,860
different every time the client IP

343
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:15,390
address changes as well but that cookie

344
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:17,229
would be invalid right because would be

345
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,360
rejected that's fine

346
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:22,000
in fellas cookie is fine it's just the

347
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,000
client cookie so a new handshake will be

348
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:34,570
set up with the server okay I'll take it

349
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:37,360
offline Vertica ASI so I agree with all

350
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:38,710
that that I understand that if the

351
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,129
cookie never changed that would be a

352
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:44,909
problem but why can't the the client

353
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:52,470
just change its secret all the time and

354
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:58,029
yes so indeed so that cannot be done

355
00:22:52,470 --> 00:23:02,200
because that would mean that if a server

356
00:22:58,029 --> 00:23:05,649
does not support the cookies or pretends

357
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,120
not to support cookies the same cookie

358
00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:12,370
would be sent to that same server even

359
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:24,760
though the client IP address had changed

360
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:27,689
I think what I'm what I'm saying is that

361
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,029
if a client wants to manage its privacy

362
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,799
it can dictate how often it creates a

363
00:23:31,029 --> 00:23:35,169
new cookie with a new secret that it

364
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,639
randomly generates it could do it on a

365
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:41,049
regular basis or I could keep it

366
00:23:36,639 --> 00:23:46,658
long-lived yes yes sir we also do not

367
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:49,899
want to we want to introduce as little

368
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:53,080
operations as possible on the path to

369
00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:54,639
Shinto right so what we now proportion

370
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:59,379
the draft it's actually not on this

371
00:23:54,639 --> 00:24:01,719
slide is that if a server does not

372
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,029
support cookies or seems not to support

373
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,909
cookies and the client should just

374
00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:08,710
remember that and not try to send a

375
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:11,620
client cookie to that server for a

376
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:14,620
certain period before it creates a new

377
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:17,049
client cookie which is key and therefore

378
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:20,529
just a secret and chauffeur IP is not

379
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:25,269
enough to that non cookie supporting

380
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:28,740
server so it took us a little while to

381
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:28,740
get this right with

382
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:37,120
yes no well I will on Jarrod's separate

383
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:38,919
comments in the draft that talks about

384
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:44,919
it not having to change the self that

385
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:48,190
the cookie often how often is often so

386
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:53,830
if you if your client IP address does

387
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:57,160
not change then you should not you do

388
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:01,000
not need to claim change the client

389
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:03,040
cookie often so this a year but you know

390
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,380
how often is often is every five

391
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:08,260
transactions every five minutes is a

392
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,929
half three five days I think it may be

393
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:12,250
better to have some guidance maybe one

394
00:25:10,929 --> 00:25:15,010
of the trade-offs could be about how

395
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:16,510
often is but document just is often

396
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:19,330
without giving any kind of indicative

397
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:20,200
values that seem quite pleased I get

398
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,340
these a little bit more clarification

399
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,309
Jim there's one year in in the draft so

400
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:31,059
yeah there used to be one year but maybe

401
00:25:27,309 --> 00:25:34,210
I left it out in the last off I don't

402
00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:35,950
remember precisely thing it's still

403
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,929
there it's still there it's tell them I

404
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:40,270
think it's today and says it doesn't

405
00:25:37,929 --> 00:25:42,190
have to be changed often at least one

406
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:44,500
year or something but the thing is that

407
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:47,260
use your best cryptographic knowledge

408
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:49,210
and yeah if the secret is not

409
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:51,460
compromised you don't have to change it

410
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,610
at all because unless the cryptographic

411
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:58,660
function is compromised then why change

412
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:02,830
it it just got its face and also you

413
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:05,790
should not do any effort to remember the

414
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:10,960
client cookie right so it should not

415
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:14,530
live or it should not be kept between

416
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,000
server restarts yes implementation

417
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:18,610
guidelines may be helpful for people

418
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,720
just but Livia's often just seems to be

419
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:29,709
use a little bit too vague / - fuzzy

420
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:31,270
okay Paul Hoffman I'm seeing that

421
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,460
there's been a couple of questions I

422
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:35,889
think your decision to have the

423
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,679
discussion happen offline for this

424
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:42,040
change might not have been that great so

425
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:42,750
can you bring things back to the list

426
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,600
for this

427
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,430
just so that questions can get resolved

428
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,699
not just by reading the document but

429
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:53,130
also by seeing the logic and also to Jim

430
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,990
it does I I just did a quick search on

431
00:26:53,130 --> 00:27:00,290
is right it does a one-year yeah so I've

432
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:04,070
we've done this because the document

433
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:06,600
besides a modified construction the

434
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:09,929
constructing the client cookie section

435
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,980
also now has a new security and privacy

436
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,050
considerations section elaborating on

437
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:19,200
you know the the new method and why it

438
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:25,050
needs what the precise reasons are for

439
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:26,520
this method so it sounds like where

440
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:29,730
we're at is more implementation

441
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:34,129
experience and more discussion on the

442
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:38,640
working group list yeah next call before

443
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:41,280
so indeed so the new draft has been

444
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,290
perfect to the list on Monday though so

445
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:47,910
I invite you all to review it carefully

446
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:53,190
especially the security and privacy

447
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:56,460
considerations and yeah then once that

448
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:58,890
settled them we can do a implementation

449
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:03,480
or get implementation experience with

450
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:07,950
the software vendors and get it over

451
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:12,090
with I suppose excellent thank you any

452
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,380
other comments questions or good that

453
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,970
means people are gonna go forth in code

454
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,270
and see how that works

455
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:17,270
thank you

456
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,620
hi

457
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:59,169
so this is our DBD draft we mentioned

458
00:28:53,620 --> 00:29:01,239
last time the mechanism in zero 3 which

459
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,500
we've updated recently is pretty much

460
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,570
the same as a lot of editorial changes

461
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,080
some clarifications based on discussion

462
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,490
last time implemented it more there was

463
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,370
a bit of code before it is a bit more

464
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:15,700
now and deployed it on a small set of

465
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:17,320
domains or mine there's code there it's

466
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,290
a bunch of Python code and some bash

467
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,870
scripts to create zone file fragments

468
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:24,879
and a bash script it's come a wrapper

469
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,219
around dig just to make it look a little

470
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,810
bit less horrible and the signature

471
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:31,540
verification creation stuff which is the

472
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,300
most complicated bit of this is included

473
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:37,139
in our implementation kind of works

474
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,139
looks like that's lovely

475
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:42,040
yeah I think that kind of has older

476
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,900
pretty much all the features to the

477
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:45,970
draft nearly there's another domain that

478
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:50,980
uses a two five five one nine sig as

479
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:54,070
well and that's kind of it our goal I

480
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,860
guess is to progress a flavor of this if

481
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,120
somebody would want it and take

482
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,310
questions to come and so I think it's

483
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,389
kind of it's at the point where it's

484
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:08,740
ready to either kill adopt pause

485
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:09,880
whatever so I haven't called more slides

486
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,160
explaining it if somebody needs but if

487
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:17,910
you did those last time hey you won't go

488
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,910
to the microphone

489
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:27,690
oran Kumari Google no hats can you

490
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,668
remind me again what exactly the use

491
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,960
cases I mean I've shredded a few times

492
00:30:29,669 --> 00:30:35,879
but can I do stuff like can you publish

493
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,509
a record saying that you're related

494
00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:41,070
domain is Apple calm like it feels as

495
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:43,080
though unless you have them pointing in

496
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:46,049
both directions the semantics gets a

497
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,779
little odd this could get a little odd

498
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:50,279
for some use cases like that yes ok but

499
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,179
you can you know both sides could do it

500
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,039
if you're obviously you're gonna say

501
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,759
unrelated that's kind of not gonna be by

502
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,230
direction there are some cases where if

503
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,980
you use the signature mechanism it

504
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,600
doesn't need to be bi-directional

505
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:03,480
because the signature can I get to that

506
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,070
whether that is something it would make

507
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,389
sense in something like a membership

508
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:10,799
organization if you wanted to do it that

509
00:31:06,389 --> 00:31:12,899
way yes seems great to me the other I

510
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,720
just don't fully understand how I would

511
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,979
use it or when I would trust it but the

512
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,750
unrelated really useful

513
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:20,340
we're unhappy just for that yeah again I

514
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,960
mean the idea here is to do a kind of

515
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,668
really minimal semantic and then if you

516
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,960
have an additional semantic that does

517
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:27,899
require bi-dimensional then there's

518
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:30,509
tagging thing there hey pre name for

519
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:32,580
Peter spot check out of curiosity did

520
00:31:30,509 --> 00:31:34,409
someone outside DNS up indicate your

521
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,710
interest in this mechanism besides

522
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:40,230
theoretical use cases I mean I'm looking

523
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:42,409
for practical use cases not just the

524
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:46,679
theory just wrapped in the draft I

525
00:31:42,409 --> 00:31:50,730
didn't quite catch that could so viewers

526
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,889
asking for real-world use cases which

527
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:56,009
are not just theoretical and asks if

528
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:57,809
somebody explained interest in this sure

529
00:31:56,009 --> 00:32:00,779
I mean that's that's a great question

530
00:31:57,809 --> 00:32:02,820
that's a question I have Alex from

531
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:05,519
Comcast has what he thinks are real real

532
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,460
use cases personally I don't really

533
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,500
other than for research if I want to do

534
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,480
zone surveys and so on but orin orin

535
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,740
Kumari just a quick clarification I

536
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,899
support the draft I was just more

537
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,940
confused about the thing doesn't mean to

538
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:24,539
be taken as sorry for confusing you yeah

539
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:28,019
so Daniel amigo Ericsson the question I

540
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:30,990
had is do you have it evaluate how how

541
00:32:28,019 --> 00:32:33,100
it's going to impact order responses the

542
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:37,029
size of the responses

543
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:38,379
on the real traffic or but if you add

544
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:39,789
signatures you get bigger responses

545
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:43,049
obviously but but other than that so

546
00:32:39,789 --> 00:32:46,179
they're pretty tiny okay

547
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:48,789
John you've been converted and now you

548
00:32:46,179 --> 00:32:50,919
love us high on the beam with two

549
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:52,389
separate comments sure um one is for the

550
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:54,190
record I'm still not thrilled with the

551
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:56,258
justification for inventing a mutant

552
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,429
form of DNS SEC signing here rather than

553
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:02,019
using DNS SEC yeah because I find the

554
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:04,539
arguments that persuasive but the more

555
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:06,250
my more serious concern is that I don't

556
00:33:04,539 --> 00:33:07,990
see how this is useful without something

557
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:09,399
along the lines of the Mozilla PSL to

558
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,179
say like all the stuff under these two

559
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:14,918
names are parallel and given that we've

560
00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,460
kind of given up on standardizing

561
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:19,779
anything on the PSL I'm thinking that I

562
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:21,519
would put this on the shelf until we go

563
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:23,490
until we come back and see if we can

564
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,590
take another whack at the D ban problem

565
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:29,440
okay so this is this is very much on my

566
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:31,600
part an attempt to try and see is there

567
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,309
a small subset that's the smaller than

568
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,689
PS LD bound problem that is worth doing

569
00:33:33,309 --> 00:33:37,658
and the answer might be yes or might be

570
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:40,269
no well this is sort of the same part of

571
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:41,590
the problem that Andrews SOPA proposal

572
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:43,570
attack you me you did it in a different

573
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,418
way but it's yeah this mean you can

574
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:48,370
imagine just barely you know sort of

575
00:33:46,419 --> 00:33:50,559
papering the trees with with parallel

576
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:52,299
things which would be you know I could

577
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,440
write a Python script to do that but it

578
00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,590
would make things look pretty ugly but

579
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,779
I'm just I guess I would like better

580
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:00,519
worked out examples that don't say and

581
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:02,080
of course somehow you know that the sub

582
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:10,599
names are the same because at this point

583
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:13,149
you don't okay Tim Tim and what since

584
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,129
Kenny speaking for myself we actually do

585
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:16,949
have a real legitimate use case with my

586
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:19,239
employer trying to solve this problem

587
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:21,399
across organizations across domains

588
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:24,848
across sort of custom organizations sort

589
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:26,319
of thing so this is like step one and we

590
00:34:24,849 --> 00:34:28,089
have a step two idea in our head but we

591
00:34:26,319 --> 00:34:36,310
like to see something like this sort of

592
00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:38,710
start to happen so thanks so again just

593
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:41,679
to clarify if we could somehow deal with

594
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:43,418
the parallel with booth this the subtree

595
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,550
boundary problems I totally agree the

596
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:46,960
same two subtrees belong to the same

597
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:48,070
people as a useful statement

598
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,179
make I mean it's not sure that this is

599
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:56,800
the right way to say it okay so I guess

600
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,630
it's kind of up to you why is chairs to

601
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,690
figure out what you all do yeah I was

602
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:03,790
just thinking about that

603
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:11,339
thank you for summarizing that no but I

604
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:19,690
do hear mixed opinions here in the room

605
00:35:11,339 --> 00:35:23,080
you want soda so we yeah so but that how

606
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:27,430
many people did read the documents okay

607
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:29,049
quite a few excellent and I like well as

608
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:31,180
you stated at the start of your

609
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,190
presentation is what do we do with the

610
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:37,240
document do we continue do we kill it or

611
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,270
something else yeah so I want to also

612
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,319
from the room a little bit mixed in

613
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:47,980
impression pro or con I want to take it

614
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,040
to the mailing list and and I think some

615
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,830
people do see the use case oh please

616
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,240
also no mailing lists reiterate that

617
00:35:52,830 --> 00:35:57,098
because that might convince the other

618
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:02,529
people that it is useful to pursue this

619
00:35:57,099 --> 00:36:09,310
work in the working group Paul Hoffman

620
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:11,800
so we had a vocabulary problem in ABCD

621
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:16,750
yesterday which has just come up here

622
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:19,510
which is the word this like yesterday in

623
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:21,670
ABCD or two days ago and ABCD there was

624
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,530
the how many people want to work on this

625
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,180
and a lot of people raised their hand

626
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:26,500
and then when there was a discussion it

627
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:30,190
was very clear that they had a different

628
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:32,640
this this is it is a great example of a

629
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:36,520
different with death of this between

630
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,270
this document and John Levine's D bound

631
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,460
I'll be very blithe here and say what

632
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:44,200
what is proposed in this document are a

633
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:47,080
couple of things which Stephen has said

634
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,598
are extractable and he might be happy

635
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:51,848
with just one of them D bound you know

636
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,280
John's D bound is somewhat boiling the

637
00:36:51,849 --> 00:36:56,950
ocean but in a way where everyone would

638
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:59,080
then be happy if we could get there so

639
00:36:56,950 --> 00:37:00,700
I'm a little bit hesitant if you go to

640
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:03,250
the list and say do we

641
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:06,040
to do this because I believe some people

642
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:08,619
would agree with what Stephen just said

643
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:10,180
which is even a little bit you know

644
00:37:08,619 --> 00:37:12,339
starting with just a little bit of this

645
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,490
would be good and there's a practical

646
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:16,990
reason for this one little thing

647
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:19,078
other people are course are going to be

648
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:25,359
happy to boil the ocean this is DNS off

649
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:27,099
but I think we need to you know the

650
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,290
question needs to be much more narrow

651
00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,119
and you might even say how many people

652
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:33,009
would support adopting this document if

653
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,790
it was just section 3 just you know

654
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:39,490
something like that so I can make a

655
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:41,680
suggestion I mean I think there is it's

656
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:43,149
a valid point to try and distinguish you

657
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,759
know what we've put in this document

658
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:47,650
versus the bigger problem mm-hmm so

659
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,839
maybe the question would be do people

660
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,960
want to adopt this document or bit

661
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:59,619
service and try and distinguish that

662
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:03,040
from the bigger question perhaps thank

663
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:04,510
you I think I think the chairs need to

664
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,910
sort of consult in what's the most

665
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,349
useful way to form the question so we

666
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,348
will take it to the list - thanks Steven

667
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Danyelle

668
00:38:41,029 --> 00:38:50,700
not at Stough lest even take the mic so

669
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,390
DNS SEC resolvers operator

670
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:57,240
recommendations so it's a draft three so

671
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:59,279
a little bit of history we already

672
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,189
presented some version previous version

673
00:38:59,279 --> 00:39:05,490
of that draft but we just handled it a

674
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:08,849
bad way so I think now we are achieving

675
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:11,299
the initial goal which is to provide

676
00:39:08,849 --> 00:39:14,670
some recommendations for the operator

677
00:39:11,299 --> 00:39:21,569
and the main thing is to encourage them

678
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:29,700
to deploy the in a sec okay oh okay

679
00:39:21,569 --> 00:39:33,950
so the the motivations so a little recap

680
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:39,109
how much time do I have 20 minutes okay

681
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:41,788
so motivation the trust in DNS

682
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:44,640
validation relies on the signature and

683
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:47,970
the trust which is the owner of the

684
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:53,788
private key associated to the DNS key is

685
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:55,828
the legitimate owner of the sign are so

686
00:39:53,789 --> 00:39:59,970
you have a trust anchor and then you

687
00:39:55,829 --> 00:40:03,359
have a chain of a chain of trust where

688
00:39:59,970 --> 00:40:06,990
multiple DNS key are validating each

689
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,440
each others and each of those keys can't

690
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:15,959
be okay each of those keys can rotate

691
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:19,740
the over time so the real threat model

692
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,410
for DNS SEC resolver operator is them to

693
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:26,339
consider well what should I do and what

694
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:31,109
happens if there is a malicious DNS key

695
00:40:26,339 --> 00:40:33,480
that is being introduced so the

696
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:37,490
operational recommendations we we talk

697
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:41,130
we're we have are basically encouraging

698
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:44,399
those dro to enable DNS SEC validations

699
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:47,940
and to provide them sufficient trust

700
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,930
into the DNS SEC validations the rigor

701
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,430
so we have a some categories which is we

702
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:56,580
address the provisioning

703
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:59,100
the monitoring and the management and I

704
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:00,930
think maybe an important part of that

705
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,630
document is to clarify what is the

706
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:06,960
actually the responsibility of a

707
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:12,630
resolver when when DNS SEC is being

708
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:15,780
enabled so to demystify that is well

709
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:17,940
when you ask can you can you enable DNS

710
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,770
SEC validation well if something goes

711
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:22,680
wrong on the internet I'm gonna be hold

712
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:26,850
responsible for that and where we would

713
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,940
like to go against this myth and say no

714
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:31,620
it's not you

715
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:34,650
so even though we have 20 minutes I

716
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:38,400
don't think we're gonna explain it here

717
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:41,220
what is a validator but I'm we the

718
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:44,940
document has a clear I mean as a recap

719
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:47,089
of what's the validation process what

720
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,340
are the different modules that have been

721
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:53,070
involved into that so you have the time

722
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:57,390
the Crypt will capture graphic libraries

723
00:41:53,070 --> 00:42:00,390
you have the DNS cache and then well the

724
00:41:57,390 --> 00:42:02,549
DNS SEC validation and genes with DNS

725
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:09,569
SEC message that are also being used to

726
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:13,940
manage the trust anchors so what are

727
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:20,120
these recommendations intended to do so

728
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:26,130
we first like to minimize how those

729
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:29,130
operators do in to interact with with

730
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:33,960
evaluations the main principle is to let

731
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:37,920
the NSA go on we don't want to to tweak

732
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:42,720
the protocol note that they require some

733
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,400
expert in DNS X so they just the

734
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,799
expectation is that they just be

735
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,400
sufficiently confident that enabling

736
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,970
should be sufficient we also focus

737
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,980
stress on the importance of having

738
00:42:52,970 --> 00:43:00,230
automated operations to minimize the

739
00:42:55,980 --> 00:43:04,080
operational errors and to focus on

740
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:06,940
preventing the configurations error as

741
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:12,910
well as provide some early

742
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:15,730
detection mechanisms so the categories

743
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:18,220
we defined our into three you have

744
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:21,839
recommendations for startup so when you

745
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:23,799
start up resolver you have runtime

746
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,849
recommendations so what should be done

747
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,740
on a running resolver and there's some

748
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:34,540
more specific actions that are

749
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:38,078
classified as on demand so in some cases

750
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:40,210
we expect that those operators may want

751
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:46,089
to check some specific things so that's

752
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:47,920
part of the on demand so so time well

753
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:51,180
time is important for the signature

754
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,740
checks so basically what we ask first is

755
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,649
that a validator should not be start

756
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,660
before the time being synced and if

757
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:03,069
there is an error they should not be

758
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:06,069
started and over over time I mean so the

759
00:44:03,069 --> 00:44:08,369
run time requirement recommendations is

760
00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:11,230
that you regularly check the time and

761
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:13,780
eventually you can ask for the time of

762
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:19,930
your platform that are running the

763
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:21,369
resolvers so I mean the thing with time

764
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:24,910
is just to make the difference between

765
00:44:21,369 --> 00:44:28,270
the the categories of the recommendation

766
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,940
so startup run time and on demand then

767
00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:35,050
we have a list of recommendations that

768
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:37,810
are based on that are targeting the the

769
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:41,619
genus key record so in the I'm gonna

770
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:44,380
start with the ta trust anchor so we

771
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:46,510
have positive translators and we have

772
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:55,440
negative stress anchors and all of those

773
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:58,150
belong to a trust anchor store yeah so

774
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:03,040
when we're talking about management of

775
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:05,349
those trackers well you should consider

776
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,040
that they are being configured it's a

777
00:45:05,349 --> 00:45:11,109
configuration thing so well the Dro

778
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,770
should be able to have their own

779
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:16,960
configuration and to ensure that the

780
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:20,650
dynastic resolver when it started they

781
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,279
start with the appropriate ta or an ta

782
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:26,140
and when we are thinking about ta the TA

783
00:45:24,279 --> 00:45:29,770
with the right value I mean the

784
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:32,348
up-to-date value then those ta I mean

785
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:37,599
there are not - then they must not be

786
00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:40,180
hard-coded somewhere so they should be

787
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:43,750
able to to be updated so within the

788
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:47,430
resolver at that point so and it should

789
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:52,059
be also possible to check and to report

790
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:55,180
what is the TA being used so what it

791
00:45:52,059 --> 00:46:02,799
what are the TA considered by this DNS

792
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:06,759
SEC resolver so because ta get updated

793
00:46:02,799 --> 00:46:08,890
over time it's it's it's quite pretty

794
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:12,420
important to prevent that the DNS SEC

795
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:17,848
resolver starts with an old ta in them

796
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:20,200
and so the configuration of the TA is it

797
00:46:17,849 --> 00:46:23,230
really has to see as a two-step process

798
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,169
you defined which entry point you're

799
00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:28,950
gonna trust and the other thing that

800
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:33,190
corresponds to the trust model and then

801
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:36,009
what is the actual value of that TA it's

802
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:38,200
a it's it's it does not belong to the

803
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:41,049
trust model but it's more related to the

804
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:42,879
configurations so there is a provisional

805
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:45,880
step at that point and we would like to

806
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,400
split those two because the trust model

807
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:52,779
is now is likely not to evolve so much

808
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:58,630
but those value associated to the TA are

809
00:46:52,779 --> 00:47:01,390
likely to evolve over time so the M this

810
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,450
theoretical process for configuration

811
00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:06,788
the TA is that the D redefines the

812
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:09,640
domain name is trust so it is really the

813
00:47:06,789 --> 00:47:11,770
entry point and that's corresponds to

814
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:16,960
the trust model and it's expected not to

815
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:19,839
change over time or I mean during a long

816
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,329
long long time and then once you know

817
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,660
which entry points so if it's a root

818
00:47:22,329 --> 00:47:28,930
zone or if it's a some of the TL DS or

819
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:31,899
whatever once you know that you should

820
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:34,180
have a third party mechanisms that is

821
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,540
going to retrieve the appropriate value

822
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:38,620
for

823
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:40,570
HTA and once you have your TA you can

824
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:43,810
and NTA you can generate the

825
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:47,230
configuration file so while I'm saying

826
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:50,529
possibly young but it's to have a single

827
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:54,240
process and then once that's done the

828
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:56,470
resolver can be configured and started

829
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:58,120
so but it

830
00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:04,180
they should not be started without

831
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:07,810
having the step a to be defined so with

832
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:09,640
that model only the the dear I mean only

833
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:12,660
the trust model is defined by the D Rho

834
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:15,580
and everything is being automated and

835
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,859
the tiara ta are always being

836
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:22,170
provisioned with the latest values so

837
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:23,770
the the main advantage is that you by

838
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:26,050
doing so

839
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:29,050
when you reboot a machine when you

840
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:31,180
reboot your resolver you you don't have

841
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:33,880
to try that the TA have been recorded

842
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:36,480
into the file system that is only right

843
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:42,850
only that is only read-only for example

844
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:44,170
so once you reboot your always while you

845
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:46,740
always will have the latest in the

846
00:48:44,170 --> 00:49:01,600
appropriate values for the for the TA

847
00:48:46,740 --> 00:49:04,990
now the other thing is um so okay so one

848
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:07,210
recommendation is that when you start up

849
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:12,040
you should rely on a boost traffic

850
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:14,410
mechanisms for 2 or 3 of GTA and well

851
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,890
the DNA tech resolve must validate the

852
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:21,009
TA before starting the DNS resolver and

853
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:27,870
of course if if you have a failure it

854
00:49:21,010 --> 00:49:30,790
should not start so now that we have

855
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:33,670
multiple steps to configure those ta we

856
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:37,480
want them to be deployable and realistic

857
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:39,070
so how possible way to and I think a

858
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,520
simple way to implement those

859
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:44,740
recommendations is actually you have a

860
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:47,770
DNS SEC resolvers that is already

861
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:53,439
configured with the right trust anchor

862
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:58,840
and so it's likely to to fit the trust

863
00:49:53,440 --> 00:50:01,240
model for 99% of the ISPs so in which

864
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:07,030
case I mean the trust model is agreed by

865
00:50:01,240 --> 00:50:11,529
the the provider of the DNS the resolver

866
00:50:07,030 --> 00:50:14,770
software and the value is checked by

867
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:17,590
that software provider and so the only

868
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:20,500
thing it I mean an ISP an operator has

869
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:23,950
to do is download the up-to-date code

870
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:26,680
and start to start the code and that I

871
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:28,540
mean that code need to check that it's

872
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:32,230
the right value with the appropriate

873
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:34,360
mechanisms but that's fine if you want

874
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:37,750
something a trust model is more complex

875
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:39,430
then yeah you may have you may need the

876
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:42,340
infrastructure to have the different

877
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:44,379
steps but what I'd like to emphasize is

878
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:47,200
that even though we decompose those

879
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:50,020
steps to deployment for the vast

880
00:50:47,200 --> 00:51:00,040
majority of operator should be quite

881
00:50:50,020 --> 00:51:03,460
simple so is it meaningful to expose

882
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:06,910
that choice of how you establish root or

883
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:08,530
bootstrap trust to the outside world I

884
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:10,779
mean the fact that you're essentially

885
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:14,050
relying on the software signature key or

886
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:15,700
of the of the distribution right or

887
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:17,080
whatever software distribution you're

888
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:19,689
using that's essentially what you're

889
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:23,259
saying right yeah so the question is

890
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:25,180
whether we should whether whether

891
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:28,060
whether that choice right you're

892
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:30,370
choosing right if you what you're saying

893
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:33,160
is probably true right 99% of the world

894
00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:36,250
will use sort of you know trustor the

895
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:40,299
the DBM signing key right and can that

896
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:43,090
that signature is how you anchor trust

897
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,100
in the initial configuration right so

898
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,480
but others may choose to do other things

899
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:50,860
to bootstrap trust so is that choice

900
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:56,110
something you want to expose if you're

901
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:59,790
talking about sort of making trust like

902
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,790
auditable from the outside

903
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:08,069
so the way I understand is that the the

904
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:10,890
D arrow should mention which ways is

905
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,780
gonna bootstrap exactly how if I'm

906
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:14,190
looking at a d arrow right and I'm

907
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,950
trying to figure out whether I want to

908
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:20,310
trust that resolver should this be

909
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:22,470
information like and get at right okay

910
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:24,779
so that should there be a field

911
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,810
somewhere in a in a you know you know

912
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,120
you know public like file or something

913
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:32,460
that says I here's here's how I

914
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:36,180
establish trust when I boot my resolver

915
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:39,200
I do this right okay so that I don't

916
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:42,210
know I I don't think it's in the draft

917
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:45,770
we haven't thought of it but it looks to

918
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:47,880
mediate more legal perspective then

919
00:52:45,770 --> 00:52:50,160
right I mean I'm just saying this

920
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:52,020
because trust management is all turtles

921
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,140
all the way down on fundamentally right

922
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:59,160
and what you said essentially amounts to

923
00:52:55,140 --> 00:53:03,839
saying that we trusts software signing

924
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:05,609
keys okay so now you have moved sort of

925
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:07,980
trust in the roots on signing key into

926
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:11,970
trust in the software signing key okay

927
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:15,120
right yeah so Daniel as a point of order

928
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:17,220
yeah you have seven to ten minutes left

929
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,569
and I just looked in several more slides

930
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:21,330
so do you want to finish going through

931
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:24,210
the slides and then okay how do you want

932
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:27,720
to do that okay well well I think well

933
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:30,390
we can stop whenever whenever time is

934
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:32,790
off so I'm fine answering the question

935
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:33,930
on there so just to make sure we didn't

936
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:37,110
run off the end okay

937
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:39,529
no no otherwise I mean I'm fine if you

938
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:43,320
only see a half of the presentation okay

939
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:47,520
so yeah it's an it's actually a good

940
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:49,140
point and I think it's window specified

941
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:52,110
in the current version and I think we

942
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:57,120
should add text on that yeah so thank

943
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:59,940
you for the comment yeah so for the

944
00:53:57,120 --> 00:54:02,220
update and what we'd like to emphasize

945
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:04,230
is that the update should not be

946
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:06,450
manually provided by the Dro

947
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:10,650
so it should be mostly transferred for

948
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:12,660
him and and another thing is that we

949
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:14,160
would like that the resolver have this

950
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:22,078
signaling trust anchor

951
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:25,140
knowledge being enabled so that I mean a

952
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:31,289
gyro can request this resolver to check

953
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:34,859
which is the TA being used so that's a

954
00:54:31,289 --> 00:54:37,410
one recommendation to keep an eye on it

955
00:54:34,859 --> 00:54:40,529
and not well the reason we recommend

956
00:54:37,410 --> 00:54:42,509
this mechanism is that so the the

957
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:46,829
operator does not open the configuration

958
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:49,859
interface runtime well you should

959
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:51,390
regularly maybe so it's a should it's

960
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:53,339
not necessary but its richest

961
00:54:51,390 --> 00:54:58,288
recommended that it checks the health of

962
00:54:53,339 --> 00:55:00,328
the TA and so one important thing is

963
00:54:58,289 --> 00:55:03,900
that it's only to cache ta we don't have

964
00:55:00,329 --> 00:55:06,329
to check well did he act when the update

965
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:08,670
has been performed is the update the new

966
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:11,670
the new key actually stored into the

967
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:14,210
configuration file on the system so in

968
00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:17,250
case of reboots and so and so on no

969
00:55:14,210 --> 00:55:23,549
because we have a first way to provision

970
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:25,470
I mean the the resolver so and on demand

971
00:55:23,549 --> 00:55:28,170
recommendation is that well you should

972
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:31,950
have the tool to say well are the key

973
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:34,260
being used by my resolvers so the way I

974
00:55:31,950 --> 00:55:39,319
foresee that is that when a clear

975
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:42,240
rollover fail the Dro should not try to

976
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:47,069
to repair it it should reboot the

977
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:49,618
resolver that's basically the line in in

978
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:55,380
our recommendation it's a bag it's not

979
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:57,450
in the Giro is not expect to to to

980
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:00,539
address those concern it's considered as

981
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:05,730
a bag and so it should restart the

982
00:56:00,539 --> 00:56:07,380
resolver so we exposed some specific

983
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:11,390
requirements for the ta now we go

984
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:17,000
through the zsk KS k so the runtime

985
00:56:11,390 --> 00:56:21,660
recommendation is that limit the TTL of

986
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:27,630
the records under that zone to the one

987
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:28,740
of the does SK KSK to avoid in currency

988
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:34,410
between the cash

989
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:37,890
ours and and the Zetas kask so some sort

990
00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:45,180
of generic recommendations to all kind

991
00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:50,038
of DNS aqui so ta that sk k sk and ta so

992
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:53,549
a raining recommendation is to have a to

993
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:56,339
automate the reporting and so that's the

994
00:56:53,549 --> 00:56:58,109
one where we recommend that the

995
00:56:56,339 --> 00:57:02,038
resolution proposed to the authoritative

996
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:04,680
server which key is being used so that

997
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:07,890
this authoritative server that is sort

998
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:12,930
of responsible of the right validation

999
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:15,690
for for its domain is likely the first

1000
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:20,730
one to move and to maybe contact the

1001
00:57:15,690 --> 00:57:25,680
resolver ECS with for example a nun

1002
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:28,740
updated key and so for negative trust

1003
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:31,680
anchor most of the recommendation is to

1004
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:34,140
well to make that feasible and to follow

1005
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:41,819
the recommendations in a in another

1006
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:43,890
document and so runtime well we should

1007
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:46,500
monitor the failed signature associate

1008
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:48,538
to each key it's it's a shoot so it's a

1009
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,529
nice thing to have but it's not

1010
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:55,829
necessary and maybe if you want to be

1011
00:57:52,529 --> 00:57:59,160
able to dining died well to find out

1012
00:57:55,829 --> 00:58:01,589
well if ever something goes wrong why it

1013
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,960
goes wrong then you may collect also

1014
00:58:01,589 --> 00:58:07,430
some status of the key or other

1015
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:07,430
informations but that's really optional

1016
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:14,940
yeah you should be able to if something

1017
00:58:12,839 --> 00:58:17,519
goes wrong i mean an emergency cash

1018
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:22,440
rollover key case k roll over to flush

1019
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:25,379
the cache so initially we were i mean it

1020
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:29,730
would be nice to be able to only flush

1021
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:32,789
the midi arse associate to the case k I

1022
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:36,509
mean suppose you have a corrupted KSK

1023
00:58:32,789 --> 00:58:39,059
and you want only flush the ours that

1024
00:58:36,509 --> 00:58:41,789
has been validated by that case k but I

1025
00:58:39,059 --> 00:58:42,160
mean flushing the food cache is also

1026
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:46,830
something

1027
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:51,100
possible pre-field deprecation so it's

1028
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:55,710
it's we want to be able to move the

1029
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:58,870
crypto and be able to update the crypto

1030
00:58:55,710 --> 00:59:01,530
and not having a software that's carries

1031
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:04,569
all the legacy crypto so we would like

1032
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:07,360
that DeRose are confident to say yeah

1033
00:59:04,570 --> 00:59:10,840
this type of crypto is never used so I

1034
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:13,450
can decently remove the crypto library

1035
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:17,200
as associate to that signature scheme or

1036
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:19,480
whatever so that's a recommendation we

1037
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:22,680
recommend to check what is actually

1038
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:22,680
being used in the software

1039
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:28,360
yeah invalid recommendation is when

1040
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,280
something is invalid it would be good to

1041
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:34,450
have a system to be able to report that

1042
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:38,650
to the maybe to the author if thought of

1043
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:41,430
that it's basically to help to take the

1044
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:44,020
right actions if something goes wrong or

1045
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:49,600
it's anyway an interesting information

1046
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:53,650
for to share so these are basically the

1047
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:56,640
recommendations I well the the real hope

1048
00:59:53,650 --> 00:59:59,790
is so we would like to get feedbacks and

1049
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:02,920
again the real the real goal is that

1050
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:11,230
operators could easily enable and feel

1051
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:13,360
confident to enable the NSA so yeah we

1052
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:17,860
do have a few minutes so go ahead okay

1053
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:20,220
so Chris box bTW I just wanted to say

1054
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:23,080
thank you for creating this document

1055
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,450
because well thank you to you and all

1056
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:27,640
the contributors to it because we're at

1057
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:30,220
the point of just working on enabling

1058
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:33,580
dinesat validation so you know it's

1059
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:35,589
really useful to have this available so

1060
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:37,600
looking at the history it looks like

1061
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:40,180
it's been in draft status for the past

1062
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:44,110
five years so it's an ongoing thing so

1063
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:46,210
is from this you intending to publish it

1064
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:49,200
or is or is this something that you

1065
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:53,200
expect will continue to need ongoing

1066
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:55,310
additions we're now I guess we're pretty

1067
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:59,180
matter now there is

1068
01:00:55,310 --> 01:01:01,690
it has been for a long time in the draft

1069
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:06,040
state especially we had issues to

1070
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:10,090
position correctly so but so we were I

1071
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:13,880
mean the previous versions are mostly at

1072
01:01:10,090 --> 01:01:17,450
having some mechanisms mandatory

1073
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:19,550
mechanism for the DNS resolvers which is

1074
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:21,980
not the right way to so we figure out

1075
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:24,800
how to do that but I think now we we

1076
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:28,580
have the right path to and I'd like that

1077
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:34,970
document to be adopted that's okay thank

1078
01:01:28,580 --> 01:01:37,400
you yes Ryanair from GPRS I I support

1079
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:41,689
this document and I have one comment

1080
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:45,770
regarding to unity a operations the

1081
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:49,790
importance of MTA operations is to have

1082
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:54,110
a deep contact with the customer support

1083
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:56,320
center because users cream comes to the

1084
01:01:54,110 --> 01:02:00,860
customer support center so that it

1085
01:01:56,320 --> 01:02:04,070
operated have to have channel with them

1086
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:06,320
to know the something strange happened

1087
01:02:04,070 --> 01:02:11,080
and also customer support serve to know

1088
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:13,880
when the the arrow

1089
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:17,710
enables the NTA for a certain domain

1090
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:20,810
name same customer support center would

1091
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:23,360
have claimed from the users this domain

1092
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:27,380
name is not validated so such kind of

1093
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:30,380
the interaction between the operation in

1094
01:02:27,380 --> 01:02:33,940
the server and the customers side very

1095
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:37,420
important so that I my comment is to

1096
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:41,720
light such kind of duration

1097
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:45,530
okay so but I think what you're asking

1098
01:02:41,720 --> 01:02:47,959
is already in the ante a document so

1099
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:52,700
maybe we should emphasize on that in the

1100
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:55,010
current draft that we can do but I think

1101
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:59,060
the the ante a document is pretty clear

1102
01:02:55,010 --> 01:03:01,340
that there is an having a another

1103
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:04,160
channel and this is has to be advertised

1104
01:03:01,340 --> 01:03:07,410
through websites or this kind of it but

1105
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:11,819
yeah I'm taking that comment

1106
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:13,078
so before you step down I don't think we

1107
01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:17,630
did this before although my mind is

1108
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:21,059
going um who here has read this document

1109
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:24,779
who is more likely to read it having

1110
01:03:21,059 --> 01:03:28,049
seen the presentation today good that

1111
01:03:24,779 --> 01:03:30,359
looks like a lot of reviewers so I think

1112
01:03:28,049 --> 01:03:32,309
it'd be good to for the folks that are

1113
01:03:30,359 --> 01:03:34,710
interested in doing this I admit the

1114
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:36,839
sounds it useful to me if you are

1115
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,339
interested in the topic please go ahead

1116
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:41,490
and read the document provide feedback

1117
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:43,619
to the authors and we look at the level

1118
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:47,868
of interest in progress and consider

1119
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:47,869
adopting it okay thank you

1120
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:32,270
hello I'm Cosmo jihad and today I will

1121
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:33,950
talk about dr. Jordan it's about a boy

1122
01:04:32,270 --> 01:04:37,610
who dimensions are the avoid

1123
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:43,069
augmentation through one avoid

1124
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:51,340
fragmentation eat in deenis again you

1125
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:57,020
see 80-85 UDP usage guidelines BCP 145

1126
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:58,840
published in March 2017 section three

1127
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:02,360

1129
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:10,250
send the UDP Datagram dot resulting IP

1130
01:05:06,230 --> 01:05:13,940

1134
01:05:21,260 --> 01:05:29,660
either use the path MTU information

1135
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:33,770
provided by the IP layer or implement

1136

the possibility discovery PMDD itself to

1137

determine whether the pass to detonation

1138
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:45,310
will support its desired missile sites

fragmentation in UDP is effective after

November 2008 and I checked

1147
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:23,150

buzz using TCP or UDP transport / local

1195
01:10:18,949 --> 01:10:26,989

1205

the operator should consider small size

Posse annuity bar you it

1229
01:12:55,550 --> 01:13:06,770
laughter youth who or under please

1230
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:09,469
consider adopting hi Andre I see I'm

1231
01:13:06,770 --> 01:13:13,040
sorry but there's a draft in in the area

1232
01:13:09,469 --> 01:13:15,860
that tackles the exactly same topic from

1233
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:20,119
its name GDP fragmentation she

1234
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:24,530
considered fragile or IP fragmentation

1235
01:13:20,119 --> 01:13:26,360
fragile by bubonic Baker you have here

1236
01:13:24,530 --> 01:13:29,449
another two people I too remember

1237
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:30,860
sorry and I don't think we did this

1238
01:13:29,449 --> 01:13:33,919
working group should adopt this work

1239
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:36,348
until that work is finished and I would

1240
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:38,750
suggest you to because none of the

1241
01:13:36,349 --> 01:13:41,630
things you talked about is is Deanna

1242
01:13:38,750 --> 01:13:43,760
specific it's UDP specific so I don't

1243
01:13:41,630 --> 01:13:45,500
think we should add up this work until

1244
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,460
they'd work in the end arrives finished

1245
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:51,949
I think that you should go compared to

1246
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:54,739
do two drafts and and provide a useful

1247
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:57,650
feedback to them and and finish there

1248
01:13:54,739 --> 01:14:01,339
and only then we should have a we might

1249
01:13:57,650 --> 01:14:06,469
have a draft in the DNS op they will say

1250
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:09,889
look there do that with the DNS specific

1251
01:14:06,469 --> 01:14:12,590
things because none of this is DNS

1252
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:15,500
specific it's it's it's IP and UDP

1253
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:16,280
specific and it should be tackled at

1254
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:24,500
that level

1255
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:26,719
thanks Warren Kumari Google following up

1256
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:30,409
from that I'm assuming that you meaning

1257
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:34,510
IP int area frag fragile that's actually

1258
01:14:30,409 --> 01:14:38,509
with the RFC editor so at post is G evil

1259
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:44,300
yeah there was some controversy let's

1260
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:47,380
say on the third doctor that doesn't say

1261
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:54,110
avoid oh but I do

1262
01:14:47,380 --> 01:14:56,090
really I will identify in UDP I'm John

1263
01:14:54,110 --> 01:14:58,159
Levine I think we actually do have DNS

1264
01:14:56,090 --> 01:15:00,829
specific stuff that is useful to say in

1265
01:14:58,159 --> 01:15:03,320
a particular the traffic from a resolver

1266
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:04,579
to an authoritative server like you

1267
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,808
can't tell what network it's going to go

1268
01:15:04,579 --> 01:15:07,130
over so you need you

1269
01:15:05,809 --> 01:15:08,869
so all this advice about being

1270
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:09,110
conservative about what sort of packets

1271
01:15:08,869 --> 01:15:11,269
I

1272
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:13,610
to use is relevant you know on the other

1273
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:15,320
hand I have a resolver on on on a

1274
01:15:13,610 --> 01:15:17,269
network that I completely control and

1275
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:18,769
there's lots of resolver it's like on

1276
01:15:17,270 --> 01:15:21,889
isp networks where they know a lot about

1277
01:15:18,770 --> 01:15:24,320
the topology of the network below it so

1278
01:15:21,889 --> 01:15:27,500
i think we should we should adopt it

1279
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,489
mean i have no opinion about you know i

1280
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:30,350
think we should make sure we don't

1281
01:15:28,489 --> 01:15:33,409
contradict anything that the transport

1282
01:15:30,350 --> 01:15:35,360
people say but i think there are some

1283
01:15:33,409 --> 01:15:36,888
useful things to be said like if you

1284
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:38,869
know all your clients are on the same

1285
01:15:36,889 --> 01:15:41,540
network and you know a lot about that

1286
01:15:38,869 --> 01:15:42,860
network then you can reasonably use

1287
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:44,480
sizes that are appropriate for that

1288
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:51,320
network you know and I think that's

1289
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:53,629
actually a pretty common case Brian

1290
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:56,780
Dixon de GoDaddy sorry but you my

1291
01:15:53,630 --> 01:16:00,650
following up with what the for those non

1292
01:15:56,780 --> 01:16:03,050
following that other graft or what what

1293
01:16:00,650 --> 01:16:04,670
exactly it's talking about I think

1294
01:16:03,050 --> 01:16:06,400
there's definitely useful

1295
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:10,869
recommendations it might need some

1296
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:13,820
embellishment and just this draft I mean

1297
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:16,929
and the recommendations might need to be

1298
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:20,179
split out on the recursive to off versus

1299
01:16:16,929 --> 01:16:22,159
client or recursive as well as whether

1300
01:16:20,179 --> 01:16:24,290
you know more about your immediate

1301
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:26,809
environment versus not in terms of the

1302
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:29,119
selection but have it having a sensible

1303
01:16:26,810 --> 01:16:30,409
default for implementations I think

1304
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:34,219
makes a lot more

1305
01:16:30,409 --> 01:16:36,469
is very valuable and I think

1306
01:16:34,219 --> 01:16:39,889
highlighting the specific general

1307
01:16:36,469 --> 01:16:41,330
default of 1,400 maybe to make it more

1308
01:16:39,889 --> 01:16:44,060
readable and easy for somebody to look

1309
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:48,699
at it and say the actual recommendation

1310
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:48,699
up front saying 1400 and here's why

1311
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:00,570
I am the author of that but I was gonna

1312
01:16:58,010 --> 01:17:02,820
head down a subtly different direction I

1313
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:04,559
think you're being too prescriptive and

1314
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:08,250
I think you're jumping to a solution

1315
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,350
from a minority case when you actually

1316
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,750
start looking at the survival mechanisms

1317
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:15,330
for large fragmented UDP responses

1318
01:17:12,750 --> 01:17:17,460
they're actually higher than most folks

1319
01:17:15,330 --> 01:17:18,059
think they're not 100% there's nowhere

1320
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:20,850
near it

1321
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:24,719
but the problem really is is that

1322
01:17:20,850 --> 01:17:27,840
resolvers tend to rely on timeout to

1323
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:30,179
detect failure because how do you know

1324
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:32,790
to go to TCP you need a TC equals one

1325
01:17:30,179 --> 01:17:34,350
response which means the server has to

1326
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:35,910
go hunting and we said on Flag Day

1327
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,890
that's a really bad idea

1328
01:17:35,910 --> 01:17:40,019
so you're jumping straight to a solution

1329
01:17:37,890 --> 01:17:41,880
you should set the end to you for this

1330
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:44,820
and that will solve all our problems

1331
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:48,330
it won't is probably the wrong approach

1332
01:17:44,820 --> 01:17:50,009
in general now there wasn't piece of

1333
01:17:48,330 --> 01:17:51,510
work that was looked at briefly and

1334
01:17:50,010 --> 01:17:52,860
discarded which was actually quite

1335
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:54,570
interesting

1336
01:17:52,860 --> 01:17:58,259
Davy song came up with a thing called

1337
01:17:54,570 --> 01:18:00,719
ATR which sent back a big UDP response

1338
01:17:58,260 --> 01:18:02,550
including fragmentation waited 10

1339
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,530
milliseconds and sent back explicit

1340
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:06,960
truncation it set back the query with

1341
01:18:04,530 --> 01:18:09,780
the truncate bit set if you lost the

1342
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,969
fragmented UDP there was a packet saying

1343
01:18:09,780 --> 01:18:16,349
try TCP immediately it got rid of the

1344
01:18:11,969 --> 01:18:19,140
time-out your problem in performance is

1345
01:18:16,350 --> 01:18:22,170
actually the timeout and what you want

1346
01:18:19,140 --> 01:18:25,650
to avoid is two things you want to avoid

1347
01:18:22,170 --> 01:18:28,650
a lost TCP packet too big timeout as

1348
01:18:25,650 --> 01:18:30,900
much as you want to avoid a UDP timeout

1349
01:18:28,650 --> 01:18:35,429
and so what you've really got to think

1350
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:38,790
about in the DNS is for UDP you actually

1351
01:18:35,429 --> 01:18:40,860
want to run with quite high empty use as

1352
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:43,710
high as you can because when you go to

1353
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:45,690
TCP when you finally get there that's

1354
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:48,600
the last resort and there you need to

1355
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:50,129
run with low msss and you're kind of

1356
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:51,330
saying well I'm going to solve the UDP

1357
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:53,850
problem and that's the end of it that's

1358
01:18:51,330 --> 01:18:55,890
not true there's a much deeper set of

1359
01:18:53,850 --> 01:18:58,650
interactions and the thing I think we

1360
01:18:55,890 --> 01:19:00,330
have to realize is that if you want that

1361
01:18:58,650 --> 01:19:02,759
switch to be fast

1362
01:19:00,330 --> 01:19:05,850
you actually have to encourage a TC

1363
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:09,510
equals one setting one way is this muted

1364
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:12,840
flag day that says no large UDP forever

1365
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:16,050
now like I said that's kind of solving

1366
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:17,850
the six to twelve percent problem for

1367
01:19:16,050 --> 01:19:20,580
everyone so we're all part of the

1368
01:19:17,850 --> 01:19:23,220
problem now even though large UDP

1369
01:19:20,580 --> 01:19:25,559
packets make it for a lot of folk this

1370
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:27,780
is a minority case and it's sort of

1371
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:30,300
imposing the worst possible solution ie

1372
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:32,580
everyone goes small simply because some

1373
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:35,300
folk don't make it on the lifeboat so I

1374
01:19:32,580 --> 01:19:37,309
actually think deeper problems here

1375
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:41,340
interior is looking at it right now

1376
01:19:37,310 --> 01:19:43,080
there is no hurry most of the time most

1377
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,180
responses are quite small except for

1378
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:47,370
dorg and that's their problem

1379
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:49,200
we can wait for a while and think about

1380
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:56,970
this a bit more I don't think this is

1381
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:59,670
ready for adoption Brian Dixon code Adi

1382
01:19:56,970 --> 01:20:02,640
there's there's another use case not

1383
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:05,190
addressed or identified within this

1384
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:09,510
draft which is the fragmentation

1385
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:13,280
considered harmful that was published

1386
01:20:09,510 --> 01:20:15,750
several years ago about the

1387
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:18,989
vulnerability to cache poisoning caused

1388
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:20,520
by fragmentation I've done follow-on

1389
01:20:18,989 --> 01:20:23,759
research on that I haven't published it

1390
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:25,470
if I think I've asked before if folks

1391
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,710
are interested in that I think that

1392
01:20:25,470 --> 01:20:31,880
would help justify one of two

1393
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:37,500
recommendations either doing the smaller

1394
01:20:31,880 --> 01:20:39,000
below MTU as far as like this draft is

1395
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:43,320
concerned and the other of which is

1396
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:45,030
doing the the DNS cookies and one of

1397
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:48,110
those two would be adequate for

1398
01:20:45,030 --> 01:20:51,960
addressing the cache poisoning attack

1399
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:59,639
caused by fragmentation and I'm not sure

1400
01:20:51,960 --> 01:21:02,480
do we want to take that to the list what

1401
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:05,580
I think we're hearing here I'm sorry we

1402
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:10,700
did you want to respond to did you have

1403
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:10,700
a response a reply to become

1404
01:21:14,070 --> 01:21:17,219
so it sounds like that should go to go

1405
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:18,780
ahead to the list and sort of the larger

1406
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:21,450
point what I think we're hearing here is

1407
01:21:18,780 --> 01:21:22,830
that this does record this does

1408
01:21:21,450 --> 01:21:27,510
represent a significant amount of effort

1409
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:30,780
and thank you but there is a related

1410
01:21:27,510 --> 01:21:32,040
work going on in int area to the general

1411
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:34,050
problem to the general issues around

1412
01:21:32,040 --> 01:21:35,730
fragmentation we should wait and see the

1413
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:39,240
status on that we should take take a

1414
01:21:35,730 --> 01:21:41,669
look at what's going on there and figure

1415
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:44,730
out what of this work that is perhaps

1416
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:47,400
still useful as advice to dns

1417
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:50,700
implementers and its DNS specific so I

1418
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:51,780
think I think that the what those what

1419
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:53,580
folks who are interested in this work

1420
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:55,500
need to do is review what's going on in

1421
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:57,269
int area and then further develop

1422
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,400
perhaps any aspect of this that is

1423
01:21:57,270 --> 01:22:01,950
specific to DNS and the implementation

1424
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:05,339
of DNS so that that sounds like a

1425
01:22:01,950 --> 01:22:07,740
reasonable way forward and I see our

1426
01:22:05,340 --> 01:22:10,470
jabber scribe at the mic yes relaying

1427
01:22:07,740 --> 01:22:16,800
for Ted lemon Suzanne the interior work

1428
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:21,510
is done okay then well for some value

1429
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:24,710
have done so Paul Hoffman so I know that

1430
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:27,510
one the one draft that Warren said is in

1431
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:29,670
RFC iturra cubed I thought there was

1432
01:22:27,510 --> 01:22:32,250
other work that was sort of following

1433
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:34,920
along that in int area or was that yet

1434
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:37,530
all right if it's a nice hue that makes

1435
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:40,200
the task easier okay so Warren said that

1436
01:22:37,530 --> 01:22:40,730
it was just that one documents okay I'm

1437
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:43,050
sorry

1438
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:44,700
okay he thinks that it so I think we

1439
01:22:43,050 --> 01:22:47,040
should check because I seem to remember

1440
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:49,650
that there was work that was gonna

1441
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:51,900
happen in int area after that finished

1442
01:22:49,650 --> 01:22:54,719
hmm at which point then we would wait to

1443
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:56,339
be beyond all of it but if not once some

1444
01:22:54,720 --> 01:22:58,500
things in the our theater Q we can read

1445
01:22:56,340 --> 01:23:01,650
it and then do the determination you

1446
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:04,350
just said of therefore what is left okay

1447
01:23:01,650 --> 01:23:06,629
Warren could you do the chairs a favor

1448
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:10,920
and send the pointer to that document to

1449
01:23:06,630 --> 01:23:13,610
the list and then you and the chairs can

1450
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:16,800
get together and make sure that we've

1451
01:23:13,610 --> 01:23:19,500
putting out all of the related work and

1452
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,110
proceed from there I have another

1453
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:24,869
comment from Mark Andrews cookie isn't

1454
01:23:22,110 --> 01:23:27,839
perfect for defeating fragmentation

1455
01:23:24,869 --> 01:23:30,809
we'll know T SiC heat and then some

1456
01:23:27,840 --> 01:23:33,360
draft name draft Andrews DNS up defeat

1457
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:34,050
frack attack zero zero can defeat the

1458
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:37,860
attack

1459
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:42,420
so basically mark wrote draft on this as

1460
01:23:37,860 --> 01:23:44,699
well so we'll review the working int

1461
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:46,290
area whatever however much there is

1462
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:49,440
there is of that and in whatever state

1463
01:23:46,290 --> 01:23:49,949
and we can further discuss I'm not on

1464
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,730
the list

1465
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:52,730
thank you very much

1466
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:24,559
next up Roy Roy yards hi everyone and

1467
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:32,190
perfect my name is Ray Ahrens I work for

1468
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:34,550
I can all opinions expressed here on my

1469
01:24:32,190 --> 01:24:37,019
own and the facts speak for themselves

1470
01:24:34,550 --> 01:24:38,400
but the opinions do not are not

1471
01:24:37,020 --> 01:24:39,960
necessarily shared with my employer I

1472
01:24:38,400 --> 01:24:42,239
wanna I want to say that beforehand

1473
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,070
before I start and the reason I say this

1474
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:47,489
is because this topic is a little bit

1475
01:24:44,070 --> 01:24:49,530
controversial so I would like you to

1476
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:51,360
keep an open mind and I'm wearing my

1477
01:24:49,530 --> 01:24:54,929
good shirt so careful with the tomatoes

1478
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:59,130
um I'm gonna talk about private space

1479
01:24:54,929 --> 01:25:01,409
names and the problem is there are no

1480
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:04,650
private space names there is no such

1481
01:25:01,409 --> 01:25:07,049
thing there's no documents no RFC that

1482
01:25:04,650 --> 01:25:10,080
tells you how you can use private names

1483
01:25:07,050 --> 01:25:15,510
in the DNS I'm talking about something

1484
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:18,210
similar to X headers in mime types SRC

1485
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:20,699
1918 address base um except tech and

1486
01:25:18,210 --> 01:25:22,739
private use language text etc etc even

1487
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:23,610
in the DNS we have private types we have

1488
01:25:22,739 --> 01:25:29,040
private our codes

1489
01:25:23,610 --> 01:25:31,110
we don't have private user names so if

1490
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:32,969
you then look at the solution space I

1491
01:25:31,110 --> 01:25:35,489
mean in absence of a standard document

1492
01:25:32,969 --> 01:25:37,699
of how to do things people think of

1493
01:25:35,489 --> 01:25:39,830
their own way of doing things

1494
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:42,110
for instance advice that I sometimes

1495
01:25:39,830 --> 01:25:44,210
hear well why don't you just register a

1496
01:25:42,110 --> 01:25:47,630
name and do everything you want to do

1497
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:48,949
under that registered name well that's

1498
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:52,630
not really private there's not really

1499
01:25:48,949 --> 01:25:55,040
internal another one I hear often is

1500
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:56,570
don't do it well that's that's that's

1501
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:59,269
not really helpful because people are

1502
01:25:56,570 --> 01:26:02,000
going to do it anyway or pick something

1503
01:25:59,270 --> 01:26:03,320
easy to remember not used elsewhere and

1504
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:06,380
I'll show you that in a minute what

1505
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:08,120
happens then we have a draft and the

1506
01:26:06,380 --> 01:26:10,730
internal drafts from work from Warren

1507
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:14,000
and also the altered drafts sorry also

1508
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:15,769
the author from Warren and there is dot

1509
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:18,230
local everywhere and got local stems

1510
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:21,290
from an old microsoft technet article it

1511
01:26:18,230 --> 01:26:23,718
had to be put through RC 67 61 in order

1512
01:26:21,290 --> 01:26:26,420
to protect it and then of course we have

1513
01:26:23,719 --> 01:26:30,620
home DARPA which is also kind of a

1514
01:26:26,420 --> 01:26:36,410
private view space and this is the

1515
01:26:30,620 --> 01:26:38,090
result of looking at i thi data I thi is

1516
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:42,500
the identifier technology health

1517
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:45,370
indicators Byam published by ICANN and

1518
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:47,570
what you see here is the top 13 of

1519
01:26:45,370 --> 01:26:49,210
domains that do not like a table for the

1520
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:52,130
range that do not exist on the internet

1521
01:26:49,210 --> 01:26:54,500
that people are querying for they might

1522
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:58,520
they might exist in private spaces but

1523
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,870
not in public spaces so if you didn't

1524
01:26:58,520 --> 01:27:04,190
think about what the solution should be

1525
01:26:59,870 --> 01:27:06,730
and I think personally what would be

1526
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:08,629
useful it's a simple and concise BCP

1527
01:27:06,730 --> 01:27:12,620
something that says if you want to do

1528
01:27:08,630 --> 01:27:14,840
this do it like this and choose the

1529
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:16,519
label without a semantic meaning and

1530
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:18,949
this is actually the core of my

1531
01:27:16,520 --> 01:27:21,440
presentation it does not need to have a

1532
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:23,210
semantic meaning every firmly it needs

1533
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:25,370
to be short so what's the problem with

1534
01:27:23,210 --> 01:27:27,949
the semantic meaning is because internal

1535
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:30,530
is not exactly the same as private it's

1536
01:27:27,949 --> 01:27:33,440
not exactly the same as local home that

1537
01:27:30,530 --> 01:27:36,679
ARPA or neighbor or global or whatever

1538
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:38,989
string you want to use and all of these

1539
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:43,190
strings are to end or phonic they don't

1540
01:27:38,989 --> 01:27:45,589
work in different languages and also

1541
01:27:43,190 --> 01:27:47,780
please use a name or it's very useful

1542
01:27:45,590 --> 01:27:49,099
label that is defined as never to

1543
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:50,929
collide

1544
01:27:49,099 --> 01:27:55,239
now you want to prevent collision with

1545
01:27:50,929 --> 01:27:57,199
anything expected in the future so

1546
01:27:55,239 --> 01:28:00,500
initially I had a bullet point that says

1547
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:02,540
maybe a one-character a ski domain well

1548
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:05,150
I that's never gonna happen I can tell

1549
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:07,369
you that and that will be a policy

1550
01:28:05,150 --> 01:28:08,780
development the hell let alone all the

1551
01:28:07,369 --> 01:28:11,360
things you need to test in order to get

1552
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:14,300
it working and so maybe you can use a

1553
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:16,130
two-character a ski domain now this is

1554
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:18,020
also a bit of controversial part because

1555
01:28:16,130 --> 01:28:23,270
the two-character a ski domains sorry

1556
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:25,099
they are governed by RFC 1591 what is

1557
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:27,889
RFC 1591 states

1558
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:30,020
it says IANA is not in the business of

1559
01:28:27,889 --> 01:28:33,260
deciding what is and what is not a

1560
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:36,500
country the two character codes are

1561
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:37,790
country code domains right and there's

1562
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:39,739
nothing the business of deciding what is

1563
01:28:37,790 --> 01:28:42,889
what is not a country and so it leaves

1564
01:28:39,739 --> 01:28:46,489
it to the ISO three one six if lists now

1565
01:28:42,889 --> 01:28:47,869
between you and I ISO 3166 is also not

1566
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:51,409
in the business of deciding what is the

1567
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:55,250
country code or not what they do is they

1568
01:28:51,409 --> 01:28:58,429
map official country names to two letter

1569
01:28:55,250 --> 01:29:03,040
codes and I'll show you the list this is

1570
01:28:58,429 --> 01:29:06,500
it and there are 676 or 26 squared and

1571
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:09,739
and they have colors now what I mean is

1572
01:29:06,500 --> 01:29:11,630
they fall into categories I'll start

1573
01:29:09,739 --> 01:29:12,500
with them with with a simple one the

1574
01:29:11,630 --> 01:29:14,239
white background

1575
01:29:12,500 --> 01:29:16,460
those are codes that can be assigned

1576
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:19,250
they haven't been designed yet but it

1577
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:21,860
can be in the future so that's a no-go

1578
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:24,230
we can't use any of those the green ones

1579
01:29:21,860 --> 01:29:28,489
are those that have been assigned like

1580
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:32,509
be4 Belgium or D for Germany then we

1581
01:29:28,489 --> 01:29:35,150
have the yellow ones the yellow ones

1582
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:37,550
they are exceptionally reserves those

1583
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:39,879
are actually quite interesting UK for

1584
01:29:37,550 --> 01:29:43,610
instance is exceptionally reserved and

1585
01:29:39,880 --> 01:29:46,010
UK in the context of ISO 3166 does not

1586
01:29:43,610 --> 01:29:49,339
mean the United Kingdom UK in the

1587
01:29:46,010 --> 01:29:53,510
context of of 366 and has been

1588
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:55,730
exceptionally reserved for to make sure

1589
01:29:53,510 --> 01:29:58,369
it doesn't get allocated for any other

1590
01:29:55,730 --> 01:29:59,480
country so the official code for the

1591
01:29:58,369 --> 01:30:02,269
other Kingdom and Great Britain and

1592
01:29:59,480 --> 01:30:05,690
northern islands is GB

1593
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:10,970
and why is that because if you are going

1594
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:13,969
to get acronyms or not acronyms initials

1595
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:17,420
for the first two words for the first

1596
01:30:13,970 --> 01:30:20,690
one worth of a country you quickly run

1597
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:23,300
out of United of republics of kingdoms

1598
01:30:20,690 --> 01:30:24,620
ii quickly ran out of urs in case so

1599
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:26,960
that's why they decided to take this

1600
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:28,519
first a string that's uniquely

1601
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,550
identifying the country in this case

1602
01:30:28,520 --> 01:30:32,990
great britain sorry for the detour and

1603
01:30:30,550 --> 01:30:34,670
you is another one that's research you

1604
01:30:32,990 --> 01:30:37,550
know what EU is not a country at all

1605
01:30:34,670 --> 01:30:41,360
well you know that right but what i mean

1606
01:30:37,550 --> 01:30:43,430
in the context of iso 3166 he you is not

1607
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:45,530
considered the region and i'll get to

1608
01:30:43,430 --> 01:30:47,330
that in a minute why that is i'm not

1609
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:51,860
talking about the top-level domains i'm

1610
01:30:47,330 --> 01:30:55,610
talking about the context of iso 3166 so

1611
01:30:51,860 --> 01:30:58,759
i want to talk about these these are the

1612
01:30:55,610 --> 01:31:01,160
user assigned codes they're 42 of them

1613
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:04,070
AAA and zedzee on the top left on the

1614
01:31:01,160 --> 01:31:08,150
bottom right and then qm 2 qs s XA to

1615
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:10,910
exit now what does the iso 3166

1616
01:31:08,150 --> 01:31:12,769
standards say about this range you can

1617
01:31:10,910 --> 01:31:14,650
just do a grep on the user sign and then

1618
01:31:12,770 --> 01:31:17,150
you get these three things and

1619
01:31:14,650 --> 01:31:18,650
construction of the alpha-2 code how's

1620
01:31:17,150 --> 01:31:22,219
it done how is it used

1621
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:25,580
how are these two codes used it says

1622
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:28,130
here the iso 3166 standard uses

1623
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:32,360
combinations in the range of a b2 ql are

1624
01:31:28,130 --> 01:31:34,100
a 2 WCS and why a to Zed why death is

1625
01:31:32,360 --> 01:31:36,670
what the standard uses Doge are

1626
01:31:34,100 --> 01:31:42,530
available to the ISO 3166 maintenance

1627
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:46,400
agency in addition 42 alpha-2 code

1628
01:31:42,530 --> 01:31:49,130
elements are not used in ISO 3166 so

1629
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:50,809
they are not used in ISO 3166 and in the

1630
01:31:49,130 --> 01:31:52,700
context of three one six six means they

1631
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:57,410
will never be assigned they will never

1632
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:59,570
be reserved and they go on to explain

1633
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:01,190
why special provisions usually sometimes

1634
01:31:59,570 --> 01:32:02,750
need to extend throughout the use of

1635
01:32:01,190 --> 01:32:06,009
country code elements for special

1636
01:32:02,750 --> 01:32:08,660
purposes and it then gives some guidance

1637
01:32:06,010 --> 01:32:10,580
the guidance for instance if you need a

1638
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:13,099
code element to represent country names

1639
01:32:10,580 --> 01:32:15,860
not included in this part of iso 3166

1640
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:17,720
these 42 are available

1641
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:21,700
now I know it says country names here

1642
01:32:17,720 --> 01:32:26,140
we'll keep in mind this is guidance so

1643
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:29,090
how are these code used elsewhere and

1644
01:32:26,140 --> 01:32:31,790
let's start with the ISO codes I'm sorry

1645
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:35,300
I reserved standards 3 901 that's the

1646
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:38,090
recording code equivalent to ISBN it

1647
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:40,400
reserves etc strands independent of any

1648
01:32:38,090 --> 01:32:41,630
country now the interesting one here is

1649
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:45,860
4 - 1 7

1650
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:48,860
that's currency codes like let's say

1651
01:32:45,860 --> 01:32:52,519
Singapore dollar SGD right that's an

1652
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:57,320
official currency codes the SG in SGD

1653
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:59,800
comes from ISO 3166 Swiss franc CHF the

1654
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:03,830
CH come from ISO 3166

1655
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:06,470
GBP remember not UK but GB GBP the GB

1656
01:33:03,830 --> 01:33:10,220
comes from iso 3166 so how are they

1657
01:33:06,470 --> 01:33:12,170
using these user ranges if you want to

1658
01:33:10,220 --> 01:33:14,870
pay in gold because you can pay someone

1659
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:18,770
in gold and it's a transaction in that

1660
01:33:14,870 --> 01:33:23,420
includes gold right you use the code x

1661
01:33:18,770 --> 01:33:26,360
au if you want to paint silver it's XA g

1662
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:28,670
now you can think twice what what AG and

1663
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,349
a you stand for but if you want to pay

1664
01:33:28,670 --> 01:33:32,300
in Bitcoin this is this is true if you

1665
01:33:30,350 --> 01:33:35,870
want to pay in Bitcoin you can use X bTW

1666
01:33:32,300 --> 01:33:39,410
I think it's pretty cute but the X a

1667
01:33:35,870 --> 01:33:41,450
then refers to the UM three one six six

1668
01:33:39,410 --> 01:33:43,010
code because it always refers back to

1669
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:45,740
the three one six six code for the first

1670
01:33:43,010 --> 01:33:48,740
two characters so now I can tell you why

1671
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:50,090
EU is actually in the ISO 3166 list

1672
01:33:48,740 --> 01:33:51,530
remember it's not a country and his

1673
01:33:50,090 --> 01:33:54,890
exceptionally reserved it doesn't map

1674
01:33:51,530 --> 01:33:56,719
through any official name the reason

1675
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:59,330
it's in there is the euro was introduced

1676
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:03,460
in 99 and when the euro was introduced

1677
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:07,040
in 99 and you refer back to ISO 3166

1678
01:34:03,460 --> 01:34:08,270
there isn't anything there for EU now of

1679
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:10,460
course you might have a risk in the

1680
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:12,830
future that EU will actually be assigned

1681
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:15,320
to an official country why that may have

1682
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:17,930
I don't know rupee or ruble and then you

1683
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:20,599
have EU are so there's a coalition so

1684
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:22,640
that's why in ISO 3166 this is

1685
01:34:20,600 --> 01:34:24,810
exceptionally reserved that's where I

1686
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:27,130
use them from

1687
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:29,020
there are a lot more I quickly skip over

1688
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:31,150
them International Civil Aviation

1689
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:33,010
Organization is that set for you in

1690
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:34,719
travel documents the Aeons I have them

1691
01:34:33,010 --> 01:34:36,700
scores XK for Kosovo you see there's a

1692
01:34:34,720 --> 01:34:38,770
lot and wiper World Intellectual

1693
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:42,220
Property Organization they use these

1694
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:44,530
codes all over the place you and law

1695
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:46,540
code used a lot in a lot of

1696
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:48,670
organizations using them and reserves

1697
01:34:46,540 --> 01:34:50,260
except for international waters a few

1698
01:34:48,670 --> 01:34:51,550
more but exit is for international Wars

1699
01:34:50,260 --> 01:34:54,130
I think the kind of stands out it's

1700
01:34:51,550 --> 01:34:55,450
another country a World Bank exceed for

1701
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:56,400
the euro area actually you for North

1702
01:34:55,450 --> 01:34:58,809
America

1703
01:34:56,400 --> 01:35:01,089
Interpol uses that when Interpol sends

1704
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:03,730
the document out to all of its agencies

1705
01:35:01,090 --> 01:35:06,480
worldwide it can basically say all this

1706
01:35:03,730 --> 01:35:08,290
from this country because in Interpol is

1707
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:09,849
not on the country level

1708
01:35:08,290 --> 01:35:11,050
it's an international organization so

1709
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:14,860
when they sent the document there's a

1710
01:35:11,050 --> 01:35:16,800
jet set to all sets that mean being from

1711
01:35:14,860 --> 01:35:20,230
that is so three one six six list a

1712
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:22,630
little closer to home the cat form right

1713
01:35:20,230 --> 01:35:25,360
there's difficulty in browser forum they

1714
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:28,680
use xxxx to signify a country that's not

1715
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:34,530
covered by ice or three one six six

1716
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:37,180
Unicode uses these things a lot RC 5646

1717
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:42,360
these are the text for identifying

1718
01:35:37,180 --> 01:35:45,430
languages and you can have your own um

1719
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:47,650
user code in there your own user sign

1720
01:35:45,430 --> 01:35:50,500
code in there and as an example here's a

1721
01:35:47,650 --> 01:35:53,110
here's Kosovo again and there's sq dash

1722
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:56,740
XK this for the Albanian language in

1723
01:35:53,110 --> 01:35:59,950
Kosovo or SR Cyril XK that's the Serbian

1724
01:35:56,740 --> 01:36:01,330
language in Cyrillic scripts in Kosovo I

1725
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:03,370
mean these are currently on your

1726
01:36:01,330 --> 01:36:06,309
laptop's right in some libraries

1727
01:36:03,370 --> 01:36:07,830
somewhere and even closer to home and I

1728
01:36:06,310 --> 01:36:12,100
think this is this one is pretty cute

1729
01:36:07,830 --> 01:36:13,900
remember X and - - that's the M I think

1730
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:17,710
you see where you called ace the ace

1731
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:22,030
prefix and how is it chosen

1732
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:24,280
why not pp - - why not ll - - and it

1733
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:27,250
turns out that the IAS G or sorry the

1734
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:29,320
IANA has in 2003 a little protocol for

1735
01:36:27,250 --> 01:36:30,730
that it's published the link is under

1736
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,219
that list it's a little bit of secure to

1737
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:34,780
find but it's there it says the

1738
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:38,050
following steps will be used to select

1739
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:38,530
the two character code and here is that

1740
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:41,650
is

1741
01:36:38,530 --> 01:36:45,160
three one six six mesh again is they

1742
01:36:41,650 --> 01:36:46,690
actually using 18 of the 42 coats but it

1743
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:49,930
literally says here and I think this is

1744
01:36:46,690 --> 01:36:52,750
important to mention the use of ISO 3166

1745
01:36:49,930 --> 01:36:55,090
- one users and elements removes the

1746
01:36:52,750 --> 01:37:02,260
possibility that the code will duplicate

1747
01:36:55,090 --> 01:37:03,730
a present or future ccTLD code so um I'm

1748
01:37:02,260 --> 01:37:07,450
trying to build a case here that is

1749
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:10,540
actually safe to use these codes these

1750
01:37:07,450 --> 01:37:13,179
codes are used as intended in various

1751
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:16,900
standards not just our C's but also ISO

1752
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:18,550
standards itself uses these so we also

1753
01:37:16,900 --> 01:37:21,820
know that these will then never be

1754
01:37:18,550 --> 01:37:23,650
assigned or reserved by the IHL if they

1755
01:37:21,820 --> 01:37:25,330
would do so and all of these standards

1756
01:37:23,650 --> 01:37:28,360
that uses these private code need to be

1757
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:31,750
changed so it's highly unlikely that

1758
01:37:28,360 --> 01:37:33,940
that will happen we also know that these

1759
01:37:31,750 --> 01:37:37,090
because of that these codes may never be

1760
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:41,950
delegated this country codes right

1761
01:37:37,090 --> 01:37:44,050
because IANA follows RFC 1591 we also

1762
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:46,870
don't know that these UA coats are

1763
01:37:44,050 --> 01:37:50,680
collision-free because you will never be

1764
01:37:46,870 --> 01:37:53,500
delegated and lastly one important point

1765
01:37:50,680 --> 01:37:56,890
and the you a codes user assigned codes

1766
01:37:53,500 --> 01:38:01,510
they have no semantic meaning great

1767
01:37:56,890 --> 01:38:02,800
that's five out of five so in fact you

1768
01:38:01,510 --> 01:38:03,460
can have different code for different

1769
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,260
uses

1770
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:07,300
remember your 42 codes I'm not

1771
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:09,040
suggesting you just do whatever you like

1772
01:38:07,300 --> 01:38:11,350
you're gonna get that same message and

1773
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:14,250
they need some procedure around it but I

1774
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:17,230
had a conversation with a colleague the

1775
01:38:14,250 --> 01:38:20,020
other night and this person basically

1776
01:38:17,230 --> 01:38:22,780
said if this was done 10 years ago then

1777
01:38:20,020 --> 01:38:24,970
maybe as an example we could have zest

1778
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:27,940
set for private use names or X age for

1779
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:31,150
homeless names or XM for M DNS names now

1780
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:32,679
I kind of kind of put this quickly under

1781
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:35,019
here in slides just an example I'm not

1782
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:38,230
suggesting we should use it that way but

1783
01:38:35,020 --> 01:38:41,380
if we've known this 10 years ago this

1784
01:38:38,230 --> 01:38:42,610
would have been a possibility so then

1785
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:45,970
there's the question if this should be

1786
01:38:42,610 --> 01:38:48,639
delegated or not now personally I think

1787
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:51,760
it shouldn't be and if you delegate it

1788
01:38:48,640 --> 01:38:55,999
so if you don't delegate is an evaluator

1789
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:58,159
behind a resolver and will validate that

1790
01:38:55,999 --> 01:39:00,829
these things do not exist that road

1791
01:38:58,159 --> 01:39:03,409
negates any inserted private private

1792
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:05,329
space data and so a validating stub

1793
01:39:03,409 --> 01:39:09,228
resolver now needs a negative trust

1794
01:39:05,329 --> 01:39:12,228
anchor for these to work so that's a

1795
01:39:09,229 --> 01:39:14,269
whole lot of configuration so on the

1796
01:39:12,229 --> 01:39:16,670
other side if it's delegated as an

1797
01:39:14,269 --> 01:39:18,019
unsigned delegation and you avoid

1798
01:39:16,670 --> 01:39:19,550
configuring each individual stub

1799
01:39:18,019 --> 01:39:23,959
validates with a negative trust anchor

1800
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:27,409
plus a negative side you basically allow

1801
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:30,979
anyone in the world and to insert this

1802
01:39:27,409 --> 01:39:32,598
private data in your device ID keep in

1803
01:39:30,979 --> 01:39:34,670
mind you've done everything you can on a

1804
01:39:32,599 --> 01:39:36,800
stub resolver right under stop validate

1805
01:39:34,670 --> 01:39:38,570
it's secure as possible your SSH is on

1806
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:41,059
the latest version your certificates

1807
01:39:38,570 --> 01:39:44,749
have been carefully selected etc etc and

1808
01:39:41,059 --> 01:39:48,050
now without your knowledge people can

1809
01:39:44,749 --> 01:39:49,489
use can insert private space data so a

1810
01:39:48,050 --> 01:39:51,079
way around that is to actually have a

1811
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:53,539
positive trust anchor for a sign to

1812
01:39:51,079 --> 01:39:55,639
private space top-level domain but

1813
01:39:53,539 --> 01:39:56,809
anyway that's that's that's a there's

1814
01:39:55,639 --> 01:39:59,659
got to be an interesting discussion I'm

1815
01:39:56,809 --> 01:40:02,239
sure and so just to paint the back shed

1816
01:39:59,659 --> 01:40:05,058
a little bit I'm gonna use suggest set

1817
01:40:02,239 --> 01:40:07,909
set for private use names it can be any

1818
01:40:05,059 --> 01:40:11,920
of these 42 but I thought that set was

1819
01:40:07,909 --> 01:40:15,499
the cutest we had a at home a little

1820
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,900
little contest and I just have some

1821
01:40:15,499 --> 01:40:23,630
names ending with Zed Zed and they stood

1822
01:40:17,900 --> 01:40:26,929
out the best um but this is not set in

1823
01:40:23,630 --> 01:40:29,570
stone it's just a suggestion here

1824
01:40:26,929 --> 01:40:30,619
what are my next steps now I'm sure

1825
01:40:29,570 --> 01:40:32,179
there's going to be very controversial

1826
01:40:30,619 --> 01:40:34,209
here and I'm sure a lot of people are

1827
01:40:32,179 --> 01:40:36,650
going to say a lot of things about this

1828
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:38,119
so if this takes too long and we run out

1829
01:40:36,650 --> 01:40:42,920
of time quickly I'm not sure how much

1830
01:40:38,119 --> 01:40:45,530
time we have zero quick okay we can give

1831
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:46,999
you a couple minutes all right and I'll

1832
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:49,699
finish this one up is my last slide so

1833
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:50,989
um let's move the discussion if it's

1834
01:40:49,699 --> 01:40:53,989
takes too long to be e to the mailing

1835
01:40:50,989 --> 01:40:56,209
list and if but only if there are

1836
01:40:53,989 --> 01:40:59,928
sufficient interest and then hopefully

1837
01:40:56,209 --> 01:41:01,789
by the next ITF I uh I can ask the

1838
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:03,320
working group chairs because that's

1839
01:41:01,789 --> 01:41:04,759
that's the process I'll actually work

1840
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:05,539
working your chairs to see if there's

1841
01:41:04,760 --> 01:41:07,429
enough consensus

1842
01:41:05,539 --> 01:41:11,480
to adopt this as a working group item

1843
01:41:07,429 --> 01:41:14,030
and if that's the case if it's a working

1844
01:41:11,480 --> 01:41:15,768
group item then the real work starts we

1845
01:41:14,030 --> 01:41:18,679
need to engage early with the IHG the

1846
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:21,940
imei Anna and I can communities to make

1847
01:41:18,679 --> 01:41:23,320
sure we develop a path of least surprise

1848
01:41:21,940 --> 01:41:27,428
thank you

1849
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:31,250
you keep in mind of my clean shirt um

1850
01:41:27,429 --> 01:41:33,739
Brian Dixon GoDaddy this is great I'm

1851
01:41:31,250 --> 01:41:36,230
highly in favor of this I have a use

1852
01:41:33,739 --> 01:41:41,169
case that would specifically fit very

1853
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:44,709
very well into the delegated unsigned

1854
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:48,639
for dealing with some of the the

1855
01:41:44,710 --> 01:41:52,159
implementation issues and architecting a

1856
01:41:48,639 --> 01:41:56,480
locally scoped global unique naming for

1857
01:41:52,159 --> 01:41:59,329
doing the DNS trace Roche and naming of

1858
01:41:56,480 --> 01:42:01,308
unnamed and on addressed not not

1859
01:41:59,329 --> 01:42:03,500
addressed globally and not at not named

1860
01:42:01,309 --> 01:42:06,559
globally anyway

1861
01:42:03,500 --> 01:42:08,239
I'm definitely interested in this and

1862
01:42:06,559 --> 01:42:10,849
would be willing to review and maybe

1863
01:42:08,239 --> 01:42:13,759
even contribute if necessary also I

1864
01:42:10,849 --> 01:42:17,260
think it's an interesting to point out

1865
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:19,159
that the apex of this would be ZZ Top

1866
01:42:17,260 --> 01:42:22,159
well thank you for your support

1867
01:42:19,159 --> 01:42:23,449
Warren so Warren Kumari Google I've got

1868
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,429
lots of thoughts on this I'll try and

1869
01:42:23,449 --> 01:42:30,469
keep them short so I definitely I'm just

1870
01:42:27,429 --> 01:42:31,670
I'm half-deaf sure there's something in

1871
01:42:30,469 --> 01:42:33,530
the back here sure I'll try to talk

1872
01:42:31,670 --> 01:42:36,019
better yes so I mean I definitely

1873
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:38,570
understand and agree that we need some

1874
01:42:36,019 --> 01:42:41,150
sort of internal namespace a way to

1875
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:42,679
carve a foot set of name space enough

1876
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:44,299
that back in 2017

1877
01:42:42,679 --> 01:42:46,340
I wrote a document suggesting we do

1878
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:48,650
something like this and I called it taut

1879
01:42:46,340 --> 01:42:50,570
internal the I brought along two DNS up

1880
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:52,518
and DNS up largely stood up and said

1881
01:42:50,570 --> 01:42:54,110
sounds like a finite but this is my

1882
01:42:52,519 --> 01:42:57,079
recollection sounds like a fine idea

1883
01:42:54,110 --> 01:42:59,360
don't do it here this is not a special

1884
01:42:57,079 --> 01:43:01,909
use domain name it does not require

1885
01:42:59,360 --> 01:43:05,570
special use handling this should go to I

1886
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:06,980
can and so I took it to I can not it

1887
01:43:05,570 --> 01:43:09,289
hasn't really progressed progressed

1888
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:11,539
there yet but you know the last time

1889
01:43:09,289 --> 01:43:14,659
this came up DNS table said sounds

1890
01:43:11,539 --> 01:43:17,449
interesting not here I'm gonna name I

1891
01:43:14,659 --> 01:43:19,379
respond to that sure all right otherwise

1892
01:43:17,449 --> 01:43:24,629
I need to remember all the point

1893
01:43:19,380 --> 01:43:26,730
so I'm I'm I'm very well aware of of the

1894
01:43:24,630 --> 01:43:29,880
dolls internal documents and them and

1895
01:43:26,730 --> 01:43:32,549
I'm in favor of having something private

1896
01:43:29,880 --> 01:43:34,230
spacey that then there's a fundamental

1897
01:43:32,550 --> 01:43:35,850
difference right and be and that's what

1898
01:43:34,230 --> 01:43:37,379
I'm trying to make here is the

1899
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:40,380
fundamental difference is the semantic

1900
01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:42,180
meaning in a very long internal plus the

1901
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:43,890
other thing is I think the document

1902
01:43:42,180 --> 01:43:47,010
requires currently to have it delegate

1903
01:43:43,890 --> 01:43:49,530
it and I'm not sure and this sure this

1904
01:43:47,010 --> 01:43:52,470
is slightly different but go ahead

1905
01:43:49,530 --> 01:43:54,330
next point yeah on the specific string I

1906
01:43:52,470 --> 01:43:58,080
think that a semantically meaningful

1907
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:59,670
string is sadly important you know it

1908
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:01,640
doesn't really matter what the semantics

1909
01:43:59,670 --> 01:44:04,880
string is maybe actually having a couple

1910
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:07,080
but the reason that people have chosen

1911
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:08,340
whatever names they have chosen is

1912
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:11,970
because they want it to be somewhat

1913
01:44:08,340 --> 01:44:14,010
descriptive okay I think that that's a

1914
01:44:11,970 --> 01:44:18,240
place where we're going to disagree yeah

1915
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:20,430
if people would use you know the reason

1916
01:44:18,240 --> 01:44:21,929
people have used blah blah blah Corp is

1917
01:44:20,430 --> 01:44:24,870
because they wanted to describe

1918
01:44:21,930 --> 01:44:26,250
something blah blah blah Zizi I think

1919
01:44:24,870 --> 01:44:29,400
it's just going to be confusing to the

1920
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:32,520
average user I also think that this does

1921
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:34,650
require a in some sort of delegation and

1922
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,790
it needs to be an insecure delegation we

1923
01:44:34,650 --> 01:44:38,790
can have a long a discussion on the

1924
01:44:35,790 --> 01:44:43,170
mailing list about why basically I want

1925
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:45,360
something to go forward last time I

1926
01:44:43,170 --> 01:44:47,400
heard not here I'm fine with it here I

1927
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:48,809
just wanted to go somewhere I'd also

1928
01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:53,009
encourage people to please read

1929
01:44:48,810 --> 01:44:54,810
Suzanne's document on 67 STW I can't

1930
01:44:53,010 --> 01:44:59,130
remember the actual name it's been

1931
01:44:54,810 --> 01:45:02,880
pushed on the list if you tired alright

1932
01:44:59,130 --> 01:45:05,640
I want to respond to that so first of

1933
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:07,770
all to close the line okay having said

1934
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:09,480
that all right we kind of need to keep

1935
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:12,000
moving but also I would like to clarify

1936
01:45:09,480 --> 01:45:14,759
up front that at least is I believe as

1937
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,280
far as the chairs are concerned the IETF

1938
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:18,960
does not have the ability to declare

1939
01:45:17,280 --> 01:45:21,330
what will or will not go into the root

1940
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:23,820
zone and any further discussion of this

1941
01:45:21,330 --> 01:45:25,500
document and its purpose in the IETF has

1942
01:45:23,820 --> 01:45:27,540
to take into account the fact that the

1943
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:30,120
IETF does not decide what goes into or

1944
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:32,460
does not go into the root zone so that

1945
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:32,849
division of I think I think what is

1946
01:45:32,460 --> 01:45:34,560
saying

1947
01:45:32,849 --> 01:45:36,510
what is hung us up before on the point

1948
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:38,119
that Warren just made about where do you

1949
01:45:36,510 --> 01:45:40,530
talk and where do you do these things I

1950
01:45:38,119 --> 01:45:42,269
think Roy makes a very important point

1951
01:45:40,530 --> 01:45:45,659
on its last slide about coordination

1952
01:45:42,270 --> 01:45:47,520
among the assorted activities and bodies

1953
01:45:45,659 --> 01:45:49,348
and the important dividing line is that

1954
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,230
the IETF does not decide what goes into

1955
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:54,179
the root zone or not I'm I'm acutely

1956
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:57,570
aware of that thank you for making this

1957
01:45:54,179 --> 01:46:01,349
clear yeah it's time limited so if you

1958
01:45:57,570 --> 01:46:03,989
can keep your questions short yeah and

1959
01:46:01,349 --> 01:46:07,290
mainly speak out support non support oh

1960
01:46:03,989 --> 01:46:08,030
and we have one remote okay yeah thank

1961
01:46:07,290 --> 01:46:11,369
you

1962
01:46:08,030 --> 01:46:13,829
yeah Seward and then Jim and then we go

1963
01:46:11,369 --> 01:46:15,839
further with Terry Stewart sure sure

1964
01:46:13,829 --> 01:46:17,420
from Apple I'll talk fast because I know

1965
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,010
we're short of time

1966
01:46:17,420 --> 01:46:24,679
firstly I think this is an inspired idea

1967
01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:29,520
I would thought of this 10-15 years ago

1968
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:31,260
as Suzanne says I honor IETF doesn't

1969
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:35,670
control what I can puts in the red zone

1970
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:37,639
that's true ICANN has made decisions

1971
01:46:35,670 --> 01:46:41,880
about what goes in the root zone

1972
01:46:37,639 --> 01:46:43,619
specifically following ISO 3166 which

1973
01:46:41,880 --> 01:46:46,560
means that these two letter codes will

1974
01:46:43,619 --> 01:46:49,110
never go in the root zone now if we can

1975
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,750
have a discussion with ICANN and clarify

1976
01:46:49,110 --> 01:46:56,210
that that really is the position I can

1977
01:46:51,750 --> 01:46:58,860
hold then that creates some to letter

1978
01:46:56,210 --> 01:47:02,190
codes that we know will not cause a

1979
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:05,400
conflict and that is a wonderful

1980
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:06,989
observation and and would avoid would

1981
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,848
have avoided not a lot of fighting so

1982
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:12,119
first let me thank you for that

1983
01:47:08,849 --> 01:47:14,429
one quick terminology suggestion where

1984
01:47:12,119 --> 01:47:16,860
you talk about private DNS there's a lot

1985
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:21,119
of talk here at ITF about DNS privacy

1986
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:23,579
DNS over TLS DNS over HTTPS the term

1987
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:25,909
private DNS has kind of got overloaded

1988
01:47:23,579 --> 01:47:28,079
to mean that so I would say internal DNS

1989
01:47:25,909 --> 01:47:30,750
for what your talk might we're a school

1990
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:33,750
or university or company has an internal

1991
01:47:30,750 --> 01:47:35,969
name server I try to call that internal

1992
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:37,619
DNS to distinguish it from private DNS

1993
01:47:35,969 --> 01:47:42,619
so that's just a terminology thing to

1994
01:47:37,619 --> 01:47:46,549
avoid confusion moving forwards and then

1995
01:47:42,619 --> 01:47:48,650
the final comment I'll make is

1996
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:50,180
where it's tempting when you think about

1997
01:47:48,650 --> 01:47:54,589
declaring something for internal use

1998
01:47:50,180 --> 01:47:56,120
like RFC 1918 addresses that you say you

1999
01:47:54,590 --> 01:47:59,300
are free to do whatever you want with

2000
01:47:56,120 --> 01:48:02,000
this but the U in that sentence is not

2001
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:03,710
defined there's the vendor of the

2002
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,380
operating system the vendor of the

2003
01:48:03,710 --> 01:48:08,120
application the person who purchased the

2004
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:10,010
phone the person who runs the network is

2005
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:13,340
running on and though all those use may

2006
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:17,870
have different opinions which was at

2007
01:48:13,340 --> 01:48:22,400
least the intention in RC sixty three

2008
01:48:17,870 --> 01:48:24,590
sixty seven sixty one was those seven

2009
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:26,120
questions were not supposed to be the

2010
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:29,140
rules but they were supposed to be a

2011
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:31,880
framework for which of these different

2012
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:33,830
communities of people may need to know

2013
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:36,890
something about this in order to handle

2014
01:48:33,830 --> 01:48:41,870
it and bring it back to the example you

2015
01:48:36,890 --> 01:48:44,960
made with with occurrences ISO 3166 says

2016
01:48:41,870 --> 01:48:47,000
these codes are unused so individual

2017
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:49,010
groups can use them for private use like

2018
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,200
currencies that's not the same as saying

2019
01:48:49,010 --> 01:48:52,850
that every individual can make up their

2020
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:59,240
own currency codes and I can go to the

2021
01:48:52,850 --> 01:49:01,160
bank and make a deposit in zzq so so

2022
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,260
it's not that anybody can do what they

2023
01:49:01,160 --> 01:49:05,389
want it is that the banking industry is

2024
01:49:03,260 --> 01:49:07,160
free to define their own standards for

2025
01:49:05,390 --> 01:49:08,990
those codes means and the analog he

2026
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:11,389
wrote is that the IETF has the

2027
01:49:08,990 --> 01:49:15,230
responsibility for giving meaning to

2028
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:18,050
those values not to say that it's a

2029
01:49:15,230 --> 01:49:20,360
free-for-all and because saying do what

2030
01:49:18,050 --> 01:49:22,700
you want and I'll give one final example

2031
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:26,330
of this draft I've been working on with

2032
01:49:22,700 --> 01:49:28,010
Warren ipv4 only to Harper if you send

2033
01:49:26,330 --> 01:49:31,220
that over your dns over TLS connection

2034
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:34,850
to quad 8 it doesn't know your local

2035
01:49:31,220 --> 01:49:37,670
networks nat64 prefix so in order for

2036
01:49:34,850 --> 01:49:40,190
that to work the software has to know to

2037
01:49:37,670 --> 01:49:43,480
treat it specially and similar things

2038
01:49:40,190 --> 01:49:45,860
apply here that saying do what you like

2039
01:49:43,480 --> 01:49:47,450
doesn't work when the different people

2040
01:49:45,860 --> 01:49:51,710
writing software have different opinions

2041
01:49:47,450 --> 01:49:55,750
about what they'd like Thank You Jen

2042
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:57,969
reads RTFM Roy's very provocative

2043
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:59,650
I think we're going to into what's the

2044
01:49:57,969 --> 01:50:02,020
problems we had with the discussion

2045
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:03,879
round all the internal and all the rest

2046
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:05,920
of it and potentially we'll have even

2047
01:50:03,880 --> 01:50:07,870
more problems if we were in this case in

2048
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,580
front of ICANN and we're trying to have

2049
01:50:07,870 --> 01:50:11,559
some discussion around whether something

2050
01:50:09,580 --> 01:50:14,320
you should go in some kind of magic list

2051
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:16,960
of names which are set aside but not

2052
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:18,340
allocated or no delegated or having a

2053
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,290
process for that I think the whole thing

2054
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:22,000
could get very very horrible very very

2055
01:50:20,290 --> 01:50:24,100
quickly and we can also in the same

2056
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,900
situation think very very horrible very

2057
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:27,969
very quickly about whether this name

2058
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:29,710
 or shouldn't be delegated whether

2059
01:50:27,969 --> 01:50:31,090
it should or shouldn't be signed and I

2060
01:50:29,710 --> 01:50:33,250
think all those problems will just come

2061
01:50:31,090 --> 01:50:35,440
back and recur over and over again if

2062
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:37,060
this is to go forward I think the most

2063
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:39,639
simplest thing the simplest thing to do

2064
01:50:37,060 --> 01:50:41,140
with this is Venus unless these are some

2065
01:50:39,640 --> 01:50:43,810
country codes perhaps not even less than

2066
01:50:41,140 --> 01:50:47,140
we see there is a set of codes in the

2067
01:50:43,810 --> 01:50:49,660
ISO 3166 list which are set aside for

2068
01:50:47,140 --> 01:50:52,840
sort of private use if you want to use a

2069
01:50:49,660 --> 01:50:56,230
private use label for DNS purposes go to

2070
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,880
that list and pick one and then you

2071
01:50:56,230 --> 01:50:59,500
piece of consequence of that yourself if

2072
01:50:57,880 --> 01:51:01,390
you want to say that you figure out the

2073
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:03,160
trust thank you for it if you're then

2074
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:04,390
going to plug your network into somebody

2075
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:06,219
else's network there's a chance that

2076
01:51:04,390 --> 01:51:08,890
both of those networks are using the

2077
01:51:06,219 --> 01:51:11,320
same internal private use label in which

2078
01:51:08,890 --> 01:51:13,180
case tough I think something like that

2079
01:51:11,320 --> 01:51:14,769
is poor the best we can do but trying to

2080
01:51:13,180 --> 01:51:16,330
come up to see an informational document

2081
01:51:14,770 --> 01:51:18,160
or even watch the stand abstract

2082
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:19,960
document this year I think is ultimately

2083
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:21,219
going to have the same problems we had

2084
01:51:19,960 --> 01:51:23,800
before and we're gonna go further

2085
01:51:21,219 --> 01:51:26,680
forward I think also make a reference

2086
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:29,620
and see to the 3166 thing don't list the

2087
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:32,680
country codes in an RFC document because

2088
01:51:29,620 --> 01:51:34,300
the 3166 list isn't necessarily fixed

2089
01:51:32,680 --> 01:51:35,800
that may change at some point in the

2090
01:51:34,300 --> 01:51:40,180
future for reasons that we can't

2091
01:51:35,800 --> 01:51:47,699
possibly comprehend or anticipate thank

2092
01:51:40,180 --> 01:51:47,699
you Jonathan go ahead

2093
01:52:06,469 --> 01:52:14,280
okay all right yeah okay oh okay

2094
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:15,690
so Terry Madison and god I have no idea

2095
01:52:14,280 --> 01:52:18,630
what had to wear on this so let's say no

2096
01:52:15,690 --> 01:52:22,169
hats as the the the person in the hot

2097
01:52:18,630 --> 01:52:25,980
seat around the dot home skirmish I

2098
01:52:22,170 --> 01:52:28,199
really like this this this is a void and

2099
01:52:25,980 --> 01:52:29,968
I when you introduce this you said this

2100
01:52:28,199 --> 01:52:31,259
might be a sensitive political topic I

2101
01:52:29,969 --> 01:52:34,230
actually think this is really good

2102
01:52:31,260 --> 01:52:36,179
because it actually avoids political

2103
01:52:34,230 --> 01:52:38,369
skirmishes I think this is great it is

2104
01:52:36,179 --> 01:52:40,889
pragmatic thinking it is inherently

2105
01:52:38,369 --> 01:52:44,509
pragmatic and I love it it is sensible

2106
01:52:40,889 --> 01:52:47,280
it makes sense to me so I'm happy to

2107
01:52:44,510 --> 01:52:49,500
read review contribute text as necessary

2108
01:52:47,280 --> 01:52:52,530
thank you thank you thanks Terry

2109
01:52:49,500 --> 01:52:54,060
I was hurt occur I say in order to make

2110
01:52:52,530 --> 01:52:56,159
sure that everybody hates me I'd like

2111
01:52:54,060 --> 01:53:00,420
you to actually do both one unsigned

2112
01:52:56,159 --> 01:53:06,629
delegation and one on deleg nation may I

2113
01:53:00,420 --> 01:53:11,340
suggest something I'm I'm happy for dish

2114
01:53:06,630 --> 01:53:14,900
documents to be and delegated and then

2115
01:53:11,340 --> 01:53:17,550
we can have the internal those internal

2116
01:53:14,900 --> 01:53:19,589
documents that basically says delegates

2117
01:53:17,550 --> 01:53:22,139
and we have two approaches to the

2118
01:53:19,590 --> 01:53:25,500
problem one shines sorry one one

2119
01:53:22,139 --> 01:53:27,060
delegates at one time delegated and Ella

2120
01:53:25,500 --> 01:53:32,579
gated will take significantly less

2121
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:34,829
effort hi okay first comment from Peter

2122
01:53:32,579 --> 01:53:37,170
spot-check it's not correct to claim

2123
01:53:34,829 --> 01:53:39,389
that there's no risk of no risk of

2124
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:41,579
collision collisions will happen when

2125
01:53:39,389 --> 01:53:43,230
two organizations using dot that set are

2126
01:53:41,579 --> 01:53:46,710
being merged with each other

2127
01:53:43,230 --> 01:53:48,598
similar to RFC 1918 main way of this

2128
01:53:46,710 --> 01:53:50,880
document is documenting what terrible

2129
01:53:48,599 --> 01:53:55,230
things will happen if you use dot that

2130
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:58,679
said for long enough and the second

2131
01:53:55,230 --> 01:54:00,480
comment form cleansing I don't know

2132
01:53:58,679 --> 01:54:03,690
this presentation is somewhat miss

2133
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:05,699
resenting RFC 1591 and the

2134
01:54:03,690 --> 01:54:09,389
in behind it in the context and

2135
01:54:05,699 --> 01:54:11,610
background of 3166 including the status

2136
01:54:09,390 --> 01:54:14,940
of the reservation space including the

2137
01:54:11,610 --> 01:54:17,790
meaning of never not worth taking up a

2138
01:54:14,940 --> 01:54:19,679
gig a working group time but the authors

2139
01:54:17,790 --> 01:54:22,019
are welcome to discuss with me offline

2140
01:54:19,680 --> 01:54:26,280
and either of my capacity as major

2141
01:54:22,020 --> 01:54:34,140
complete contributor to 41 1591 or

2142
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:36,599
liaison to i iso / TC 46 and also it

2143
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:40,290
also misunderstands the relationship

2144
01:54:36,600 --> 01:54:43,770
between what iso 3166/ma

2145
01:54:40,290 --> 01:54:47,699
can do and what is l / TC 46 can do

2146
01:54:43,770 --> 01:54:50,580
reserved has a funny meaning here all

2147
01:54:47,699 --> 01:54:51,870
right I want to respond to them first of

2148
01:54:50,580 --> 01:54:53,430
all if there's two organizations that

2149
01:54:51,870 --> 01:54:55,650
both use that says they're probably two

2150
01:54:53,430 --> 01:54:57,330
organizations that have to have an HR

2151
01:54:55,650 --> 01:54:59,129
department two organizations that have a

2152
01:54:57,330 --> 01:55:00,900
financial department they will merge and

2153
01:54:59,130 --> 01:55:03,120
they will figure this out I think when

2154
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:04,500
they do that a internal top-level domain

2155
01:55:03,120 --> 01:55:09,510
like said that is the least of their

2156
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:10,980
problems so sorry to be blunt but I

2157
01:55:09,510 --> 01:55:12,840
don't think that's that's that's a real

2158
01:55:10,980 --> 01:55:15,120
problems and the whole idea is that

2159
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:17,130
these are locally unique but globally

2160
01:55:15,120 --> 01:55:19,199
not unique that's that's the whole point

2161
01:55:17,130 --> 01:55:20,940
it's the same way with RC 1918 address

2162
01:55:19,199 --> 01:55:22,290
space if you use in one organization and

2163
01:55:20,940 --> 01:55:24,440
in the other organization you merge the

2164
01:55:22,290 --> 01:55:27,870
organization's you have that problem

2165
01:55:24,440 --> 01:55:29,280
but thank you for your comments John

2166
01:55:27,870 --> 01:55:32,309
Clemson thank you for your for your

2167
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:35,070
response looking forward to to engage

2168
01:55:32,310 --> 01:55:37,440
with you off list but would work with

2169
01:55:35,070 --> 01:55:38,880
very much your engagement on the working

2170
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:47,580
Lister's working group list as well

2171
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:48,989
thank you hi Sanjeev Gupta um first

2172
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:52,110
thank you for a very well-written

2173
01:55:48,989 --> 01:55:53,549
readable draft it clarifies lots of

2174
01:55:52,110 --> 01:55:56,900
issues and covers the background

2175
01:55:53,550 --> 01:55:59,190
my concern is actually who would since

2176
01:55:56,900 --> 01:56:02,549
enterprise users have shown an

2177
01:55:59,190 --> 01:56:03,929
unwillingness to use dot local and as

2178
01:56:02,550 --> 01:56:07,380
you have shown this a lot of

2179
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:09,420
fragmentation dot home dot private who

2180
01:56:07,380 --> 01:56:11,460
would actually use this since most

2181
01:56:09,420 --> 01:56:13,800
enterprise administrators I know and I

2182
01:56:11,460 --> 01:56:15,510
come from an end-user organization don't

2183
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:17,820
wait don't care

2184
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:19,770
and further Microsoft's

2185
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:21,540
which is the largest deployed Enterprise

2186
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:23,250
after Microsoft's own guidance on

2187
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:25,500
whether to use dot local and not to use

2188
01:56:23,250 --> 01:56:29,580
dot local has flip-flopped over the

2189
01:56:25,500 --> 01:56:31,080
years so who would actually I'm not

2190
01:56:29,580 --> 01:56:33,320
going to the merits of this proposal I'm

2191
01:56:31,080 --> 01:56:35,970
just wondering would anybody actually

2192
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:41,219
read it and implement it or care about

2193
01:56:35,970 --> 01:56:42,900
it well first off the reason that people

2194
01:56:41,220 --> 01:56:44,850
use different things now is because

2195
01:56:42,900 --> 01:56:46,530
there's never been a standard that

2196
01:56:44,850 --> 01:56:48,150
explains how to use this does never be

2197
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:49,769
the best current practice that says how

2198
01:56:48,150 --> 01:56:51,599
to use this now the only thing that we

2199
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:54,990
can do going forward if there is such a

2200
01:56:51,600 --> 01:56:57,840
documents is appoint a listening ear to

2201
01:56:54,990 --> 01:56:59,969
this new documents and we will see what

2202
01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,560
the future brings but at least when

2203
01:56:59,970 --> 01:57:03,200
people make their own things and

2204
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:05,850
basically say there is no other thing

2205
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,160
now we would have of in the future we

2206
01:57:05,850 --> 01:57:09,960
would have this document so that would

2207
01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:15,630
be my point I don't think there's any

2208
01:57:09,960 --> 01:57:17,250
value in trying to trying to force

2209
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:17,910
people to move over I think that's

2210
01:57:17,250 --> 01:57:21,900
impossible

2211
01:57:17,910 --> 01:57:24,000
not necessary eventually using this you

2212
01:57:21,900 --> 01:57:26,610
kind of have some guarantees about less

2213
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,530
collisions for instance dot Corp for

2214
01:57:26,610 --> 01:57:33,240
instance dot home we all know that these

2215
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:35,340
have a few collisions in the ICANN G&S

2216
01:57:33,240 --> 01:57:37,110
oh sorry I can new gTLD space or a

2217
01:57:35,340 --> 01:57:41,640
couple of organizations I've applied for

2218
01:57:37,110 --> 01:57:44,190
these a lot of companies have these

2219
01:57:41,640 --> 01:57:46,170
local eco figures and these will bring

2220
01:57:44,190 --> 01:57:46,799
issues and you want to do the collision

2221
01:57:46,170 --> 01:57:49,560
avoidance

2222
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:51,720
hence the documents for this will be

2223
01:57:49,560 --> 01:57:53,040
very helpful I think I ran into the

2224
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:57,480
microphone because I wanted to have a

2225
01:57:53,040 --> 01:58:01,230
good answering that question as things

2226
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:04,500
evolve in DNS like DNS over TLS Android

2227
01:58:01,230 --> 01:58:06,599
provides a setting that you can turn on

2228
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:09,690
strict DNS over TLS and if the user

2229
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:11,760
enters quad 8 as that DNS server and you

2230
01:58:09,690 --> 01:58:15,059
look at your company mail server mail

2231
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:16,710
dot internal you fail because quad 8

2232
01:58:15,060 --> 01:58:19,320
doesn't know your internal address of

2233
01:58:16,710 --> 01:58:22,550
your internal mail server if we have an

2234
01:58:19,320 --> 01:58:26,549
RFC that says names ending indoors easy

2235
01:58:22,550 --> 01:58:28,770
do not go over your TLS public resolver

2236
01:58:26,550 --> 01:58:31,590
they have to go to the resolver that you

2237
01:58:28,770 --> 01:58:34,739
learned via DHCP or I

2238
01:58:31,590 --> 01:58:37,190
six router advertisements then your mail

2239
01:58:34,739 --> 01:58:39,480
server does work so the incentive for

2240
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:42,509
corporations to use these names is

2241
01:58:39,480 --> 01:58:44,549
because these names work and picking a

2242
01:58:42,510 --> 01:58:46,679
random thing and sending it to quad 8

2243
01:58:44,550 --> 01:58:48,300
doesn't work so they all find out pretty

2244
01:58:46,679 --> 01:58:50,099
quickly the benefit of using something

2245
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:54,060
that has a document that defines how it

2246
01:58:50,099 --> 01:58:56,010
works thanks everyone for your comments

2247
01:58:54,060 --> 01:58:59,310
yeah thank you very much for the

2248
01:58:56,010 --> 01:59:01,139
comments please yeah we're done now

2249
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:02,550
please continue the discussion on the

2250
01:59:01,139 --> 01:59:05,820
mailing list I think we had a very good

2251
01:59:02,550 --> 01:59:09,449
discussions the chairs very Navy only

2252
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:12,719
reserves 50 minutes for this stupid but

2253
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:17,369
apologies to Tim Tim Burton Barrack his

2254
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:19,650
presentation drops but Paul Paul made a

2255
01:59:17,369 --> 01:59:24,269
funny comment who said my time out draft

2256
01:59:19,650 --> 01:59:26,610
times out so I guess yeah so as a

2257
01:59:24,270 --> 01:59:28,679
courtesy we would like to ask you

2258
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:30,540
everybody reads Tim's draft

2259
01:59:28,679 --> 01:59:34,230
Diamond Dogs draft and gif comment on

2260
01:59:30,540 --> 01:59:37,469
the mailing list it has value please

2261
01:59:34,230 --> 01:59:39,959
okay thank you and we're done yeah final

2262

comments thanks very much everybody

2263
01:59:39,960 --> 01:59:43,710
I think we got some good work done here

2264
01:59:41,520 --> 01:59:47,820
in where the heck are we

2265
