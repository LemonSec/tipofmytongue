1
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:18,210
who is song oh hey we have another no no

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:48,359
help

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:50,609
look do that now Peter also supposed to

4
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,819
be a person right so he can jump over

5
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:52,819
this

6
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:58,170
sure alright so let's start I think it's

7
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:02,759
past the times of charting so this is

8
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:06,860
IPSec am a working group I'm Tara giving

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:09,630
inland and David Wolter

10
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,270
so I now take our chair is going to be

11
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:19,560
changing David is going to be taking to

12
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:21,510
be job what should right okay here's the

13
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,640
note well I think everybody has noted

14
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:28,019
dish already so so we have a blue seat

15
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,839
somewhere we have only one blue suit

16
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,350
going around so if you if it's not if

17
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,570
it's a soft summer wave it up and and

18
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:40,200
same people can actually it's coming to

19
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:44,190
forint the other side now we have a one

20
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:46,140
note taker also already anybody would be

21
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,459
willing to do the other if you're doing

22
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,670
either part so you can actually just

23
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,290
fill in stuff and actually it's a very

24
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,760
good thing to go there yourself after

25
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,560
you have asked questions you can code

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,100
fix that you know what sore spot you

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,390
actually asked and who you are

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,400
that's quite often very hard and so when

29
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,510
you are going to Mike please say your

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,030
name so a note-taker so dull and poor

31
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:12,760
promise to be a chopper scribe so he can

32
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,030
chop the cue by adding some questions

33
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,440
[Music]

34
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:27,540
yeah so any of anybody else to be a

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:31,609
second note-taker Dan now all right I

36
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,609
think we can punish each one

37
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:42,080
and if anybody complains that this room

38
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,000
is cold it's not that was a little bit

39
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,550
more colder than this but we had the

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:52,819
blankets AMS blankets help start all

41
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,800
right so here's an agenda so these we

42
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,890
are doing the passion now and then the

43
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:59,630
clock is tickin zone so any comments on

44
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:05,238
this attend anybody wants to change

45
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:07,700
anything I guess not

46
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,410
so there we go first have a draft at the

47
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,869
center we have some work items and some

48
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,640
other presentations some of the other

49
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:17,030
presentations actually are something

50
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,909
that might be the work in the items also

51
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:22,849
but they just put a bit arbiter at the

52
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:24,470
split there so the first one is the

53
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,330
working group status report so we have

54
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,310
already published that one of the RFC is

55
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:30,169
this split TNS was published as an RFC

56
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,690
that actually happened before the

57
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:34,430
previous meeting I think butter and we

58
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:38,450
have one document implicit IV that is in

59
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,729
RFC editor Q now we have requested

60
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:42,770
publication for quantum restaurant

61
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:45,440
hikers a to stuff I don't know when it's

62
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,109
going to be in tell us what or when it's

63
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,210
going to be forward but we have finished

64
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,080
working group last roll call

65
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:55,280
a very long one for ipv4 ipv6 codes and

66
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,650
I think it should be ready for

67
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,200
publication we are getting ready for the

68
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,359
little Gator we need to have a separate

69
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,979
write up and then then we can post that

70
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,080
forward we have two documents at a t'car

71
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:10,490
Oh actually one documented is quite

72
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,080
ready I think they I create an

73
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:15,140
intermediate it should be quite ready

74
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:17,390
for working coop last call and so on for

75
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:19,820
the labels IPSec I heard there has been

76
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:23,270
some complications going back and forth

77
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,250
and an old or and back again I have a

78
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:28,000
different design critters I think it's

79
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:30,889
mostly because we don't know what's a

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,120
what kind of a use is for it is going to

81
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:33,440
be so it's very hard to design a

82
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,350
protocol when you don't know how to do

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,580
it and then we have a three new

84
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:42,039
documents that were stood up to test

85
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,800
work across so we have an this IP

86
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:46,889
traffic flow

87
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:51,419
security and then we have a hybrid us K

88
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:53,939
and then GI question to those are still

89
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,558
you know I think there should be quite

90
00:05:53,939 --> 00:06:01,139
ready for us most of them actually could

91
00:05:55,559 --> 00:06:04,110
work in coop last go and let me have a

92
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:07,649
here's our work items so we have hybrid

93
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:10,139
USDA interrupt stuff then we have IP

94
00:06:07,649 --> 00:06:13,169
traffic folk security and then we have a

95
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:15,029
level IV that what those IPSec those are

96
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,188
the items and then we have other

97
00:06:15,029 --> 00:06:19,769
presentations in the end so I think

98
00:06:17,189 --> 00:06:21,839
that's all we have for that so we start

99
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:32,759
with the first presentation with Valerie

100
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:35,879
with interrupts tough so onion weaker

101
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:42,149
Erickson the last draft it is mentioned

102
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:45,149
not posted yet it is so so previous

103
00:06:42,149 --> 00:06:47,429
slide there is my draft saying it not

104
00:06:45,149 --> 00:07:06,479
posted yet and it's it's it's it's

105
00:06:47,429 --> 00:07:10,289
posted okay okay good good hello a very

106
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:16,039
small information message for the intra

107
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:18,659
prevent that we had on November the 7th

108
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,619
twisting hybrid quantum safe key

109
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:26,489
exchange it was organized but sick net

110
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:30,689
and there were three active participants

111
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:33,989
with running code it was first it

112
00:07:30,689 --> 00:07:38,610
strands one then with modem and with

113
00:07:33,989 --> 00:07:40,078
plus and we tested well all

114
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,349
implementations have implemented Ike

115
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:46,829
intermediate draft and one

116
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:49,139
implementation fully supported quiz key

117
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:52,079
the latest version and two

118
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:55,110
implementations put it partially but

119
00:07:52,079 --> 00:08:02,099
instead support real post quantum key

120
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:07,110
exchange methods so question no Stefan

121
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:11,159
no okay so the results we achieved

122
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,889
interoperability with hybrid exchange

123
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:16,050
but using only classical method between

124
00:08:13,889 --> 00:08:17,969
others plus since transform and Kojima

125
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:20,689
dense turns one also performed some post

126
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:23,610
quantum key exchange method but say

127
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:25,199
wasn't just kicks change was successful

128
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:27,240
they say was an established because of

129
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,990
the some parks and I codes company

130
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,610
accommodation well and we also had some

131
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:38,009
discussion about all this stuff and so

132
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:42,419
the conclusion well first conclusion is

133
00:08:38,009 --> 00:08:45,179
that or it works so I agreed exchange

134
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:49,740
works and implementers Bradley need

135
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:51,480
stable codepoints we spent quite a lot

136
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:53,970
of time compiling our code because we

137
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,339
had to set of temporary code the poet's

138
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:58,980
are compatible of course so I feel that

139
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:01,889
at least for I can't immediate and I

140
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,410
think that the draft is old enough so

141
00:09:01,889 --> 00:09:07,139
I've just a few minutes ago I requested

142
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:10,699
an early call upon assignment so we are

143
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:12,870
waiting for Tara as our iron expert

144
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:16,069
actually I haven't received a request

145
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:22,400
yet from Vienna it was done to me

146
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:26,890
go check your email well and there was

147
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:31,640
some discussion too and if you winders

148
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:34,610
expressed this is I complement hybrid

149
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,580
exchange once the specification is

150
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:43,210
stable enough so I sense that many

151
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:50,980
people want RFC and once they FC

152
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:50,980
particularly so is it all any questions

153
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:57,920
hi Sean Turner D plan to submit this

154
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,050
implementation report to the

155
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,800
implementation report repository that

156
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,479
the isg maintains would button so

157
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,640
there's an ihe there's an int there's an

158
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:09,050
implementation report you used to use it

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:11,449
back in the day to progress things from

160
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,709
like ps2 internet standard I don't know

161
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,270
you need to do that anymore but it's a

162
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,500
place where you wrote down all the

163
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,030
things you tested the names of the

164
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,620
implementations you kind of put it up

165
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,420
there that's another place to kind of

166
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,010
like advertise the fact that you did get

167
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,760
an operability so it's maybe something

168
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,860
to consider

169
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:35,120
okay all right Jonathan hey moe

170
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:37,580
did you test child Ricky no because he

171
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,180
was implemented only in one

172
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:45,050
implementation so we we doesn't have

173
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,349
enough participants to test against on

174
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,800
the initial I guess a set up with

175
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:55,580
multiple key exchanges with hybrid key

176
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:57,949
exchanged now Ricky it is their plan

177
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,420
well we have a discussion some

178
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,770
discussion with strands one because

179
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:08,060
transform well we all this plus has

180
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:11,150
implemented the draft completely but

181
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:16,390
other one does have some well strands

182
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:19,370
one mostly implemented to the quite well

183
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:21,430
not completely but quite a lot and I

184
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:26,990
sense some and they have some concerns

185
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:29,160
about how routine is specified in the

186
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,140
specification so we had some

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,510
discussion is a sense that they probably

188
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,110
will sink a little bit and if we get rid

189
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:39,180
of nonsense and they use a dedicated

190
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:42,030
exchange type for for follow-up regime

191
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,250
they they will probably it is ok with

192
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,069
them so I will check with my co-authors

193
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,520
because well we have some discussion

194
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:51,990
with cause before I achieve meeting but

195
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:53,850
we decided to postpone any change

196
00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,340
because the draft was in the adoption

197
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,820
state and we didn't want to compute to

198
00:11:56,340 --> 00:12:01,830
confuse people who reads draft with some

199
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,720
latest changes or a new version you know

200
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:06,570
that once the draft is adopted I sends

201
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:08,580
that well I think that there's no big

202
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:10,680
objection and there is a consensus month

203
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,940
calls is that a new dedicated exchange

204
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,099
type with pages in your using

205
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,470
information exchange so it will

206
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,900
definitely be done and I think I will

207
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:20,760
check again with Scotland with some

208
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:23,790
cartographer so whether we could get rid

209
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,380
of all additional exchanges I chose it

210
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,520
with simplify that's responses from

211
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,500
initial exchange

212
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,900
well after Zeta since its transform

213
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,510
agrees it it's it's a way to go if

214
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:35,910
anyway well I think the draft must be

215
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:39,030
discussed on saliste so I solicit any

216
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:42,569
review in discussion because it was not

217
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:44,430
very many comments on the draft and

218
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,970
unfortunately so most and most

219
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,770
discussion among the causes so just if

220
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,150
you have some opinion please bring to

221
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,590
the list right into that point it would

222
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,500
be useful to post the feedback that

223
00:12:52,590 --> 00:13:03,800
you're just talking about to the okay

224
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:14,970
okay all right so then we call the next

225
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:18,439
presentation which for that was the IP

226
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:18,440
traffic flow so the greatest

227
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:37,040
did I miss this in the last presentation

228
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:40,699
could did the early allocation of code

229
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,849
points was that raised okay sorry all

230
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,720
right

231
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:48,560
so not to me this is an update we did

232
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:54,440
the adoption call and recently for this

233
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,779
draft and we also during that same time

234
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,130
we also had some suggested new charter

235
00:13:56,779 --> 00:14:02,120
text because we need to do that to

236
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,800
officially adopt the work so that the

237
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,160
text seemed to be okay with everybody

238
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,859
and the adoption call was issued to sort

239
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,750
of reduce the amount of process time

240
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,600
overhead right so just run it in

241
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:19,579
parallel and make them contingent that's

242
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:23,810
what the star is about anyway the the we

243
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:25,849
got we had good support and yeah so past

244
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,989
the adoption call we did get some

245
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,730
comments so that's what this

246
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:33,260
presentation is going to be is covering

247
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:36,940
those comments so one set of comments we

248
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,439
got was it was a good starting point

249
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:42,230
would like to see more analysis on

250
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,320
fragmentation that's act we're actively

251
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:49,070
doing that right now so hoping to have

252
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:52,420
something before the next IETF you know

253
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:55,640
some analysis on that I've coded this

254
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:58,250
with it you know even with an option to

255
00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:00,949
turn fragmentation on and off you know

256
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,140
in configuration so you know there's

257
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:07,459
real you know we plan to do this

258
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:09,290
analysis there's also some static

259
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:11,689
analysis we can do just based on you

260
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:14,959
know what kind of line utilization based

261
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:18,610
on I mix you know if we're having to pad

262
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:22,609
out and rather than split across

263
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:25,010
payloads has the effect of congestion

264
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:28,699
control on the tunnel with CC traffic I

265
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:32,750
talked to David black and I also went to

266
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:35,410
a side meeting this time where this the

267
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:37,750
idea of whether there is any sort of

268
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:40,660
feedback loops or oscillations when you

269
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:44,740
have congestion controlled traffic ie

270
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:46,329
TCP inside a congestion control the

271
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,649
tunnel

272
00:15:46,329 --> 00:15:52,660
I believe we're okay David you know he's

273
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:55,000
very cautious and he wants you know us

274
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,040
to think about it

275
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,170
I think we're okay because the whole

276
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:05,649
point of this tunnel is to decouple the

277
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,959
offered load from the tunnel right like

278
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:11,769
that that's where the leakage goes is if

279
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:15,550
your traffic rates change based on the

280
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:17,939
offered load anyway we we need to at

281
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,319
least show that we thought about it

282
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:23,019
there is a common case of this right

283
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:25,500
which is open VPN or something right

284
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,750
where you're running a tunnel and TCP

285
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:33,459
where your tunnel is TCP and the traffic

286
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:36,939
inside is TCP that case is not as

287
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:39,758
decoupled as ours so it's not deadly but

288
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:43,980
I don't know how good the Open VPN cases

289
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,839
so whatever we don't like Open VPN here

290
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:49,120
also be aware of how this lines with

291
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,920
quick I when I first read this I thought

292
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,709
it was talking about packet alignments

293
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,540
and colleague of mine Lou Berger

294
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:56,349
mentioned no that's probably not what

295
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,480
they meant

296
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,889
they probably meant pay more you know

297
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,529
just pay attention to what's going on

298
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:04,539
and quick to make sure that III don't

299
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:07,679
know so I would like some clarification

300
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:12,099
on what what that was particularly about

301
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:16,720
moving forward okay so the next comment

302
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:19,030
was a good starting point and that it

303
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,289
was IP number allocation was scary this

304
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:23,589
was from Paul but there was a

305
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,230
misunderstanding um I thought we were

306
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:27,730
actually trying to replace ESP so we

307
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,980
were trying to allocate a whole new IP

308
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:32,650
payload that isn't the case it's just

309
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:36,250
the the scope of the ESP payload type is

310
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:38,500
the IP number right so we're just we're

311
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:42,159
just we need a new number for that to

312
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:45,399
say that the inner payload is not ipv4

313
00:17:42,159 --> 00:17:49,779
it's not I P v6 it's this TFS payload

314
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:51,518
right but even given that right I

315
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:52,809
there's not you know it is a small set

316
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:56,469
of numbers but we think this is a

317
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:59,469
manageable issue because we you know we

318
00:17:56,469 --> 00:18:03,190
reserved the first bits of the of our

319
00:17:59,469 --> 00:18:05,489
header as as reserved and if if SEC you

320
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:10,269
know if we needed to

321
00:18:05,489 --> 00:18:12,429
if IB SEC needed to to reuse the the

322
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:14,729
format we could reuse the number and by

323
00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:19,899
just taking another bit from the first

324
00:18:14,729 --> 00:18:22,619
byte of the matter the final comment was

325
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:25,299
that this says you know this is good and

326
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:27,879
that it has potential for addressing the

327
00:18:25,299 --> 00:18:31,119
path MTU issues with traditional IPSec

328
00:18:27,879 --> 00:18:35,799
tunnels that is in fact the case if you

329
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:37,988
use the the TFS header you know you

330
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,479
don't actually have and we're we've

331
00:18:37,989 --> 00:18:42,399
written the draft in a way such that you

332
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:44,649
don't actually have to send things at a

333
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:46,389
constant rate you don't you could send

334
00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:48,820
them on demand if you want right there's

335
00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:52,570
nothing that requires the constant rate

336
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:56,918
send so so basically if you were just to

337
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,330
send these TFS payloads on demand you

338
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:01,830
don't get much security and traffic

339
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,389
analysis but you do get the ability to

340
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:06,759
you know the MTU doesn't matter

341
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:09,369
so the MTU is whatever you set to your

342
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,749
tunnel to be and the payloads can be

343
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:16,029
larger than that because they can

344
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:18,700
fragment across so what do what do we

345
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:20,649
have what are we updated we've up where

346
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:24,219
are what are we looking to update we're

347
00:19:20,649 --> 00:19:25,718
looking at interpet inter packet

348
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:29,729
alignment you know when you have

349
00:19:25,719 --> 00:19:32,739
aggregated packets inside a payload I

350
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:34,899
coding this personally you know looking

351
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:37,029
at some white box code and stuff there's

352
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:38,498
a lot of assumptions about header

353
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:40,119
alignment

354
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:43,690
you know because typically device

355
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:46,299
drivers will move the into bytes so that

356
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,149
the IP header is you know 32 bit aligned

357
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,969
right and then based on that fact a lot

358
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:53,830
of code is written so that when it looks

359
00:19:51,969 --> 00:19:55,869
up a length that it's just grabbing it

360
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:59,019
as you and 16 which of course is going

361
00:19:55,869 --> 00:20:02,228
to cause an exception on the processor

362
00:19:59,019 --> 00:20:03,640
if that's odd byte aligned so you know I

363
00:20:02,229 --> 00:20:07,690
don't know if we should be

364
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:10,990
changing wire formats to compensate for

365
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:12,720
you know questionable code practices but

366
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,220
you know it's worth thinking about

367
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:18,550
Asics don't care about this right I mean

368
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,930
Asics they don't care so it you know so

369
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:24,520
that's something that it's an open issue

370
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:26,440
to think about and yeah and then the

371
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,480
only other thing is that we we do we are

372
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,010
planning to open sources we want to get

373
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,980
the full implementation written

374
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:38,980
including the congestion control and an

375
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,600
IQ moment ation and then as soon as

376
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,510
that's done which you know should be in

377
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,780
2020 we're hoping early 2020 will push

378
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,730
this out and we're totally open to

379
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:54,940
collaborating and doing interoperability

380
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:58,840
testing the folks modernist Muslim

381
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,510
Felice Blas first question well you seem

382
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,629
to leave out transport more to tell

383
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:07,690
is there any reason so you're supporting

384
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:11,860
eternal mod essays and not a transfer

385
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:17,890
mode are you saying we only do tunnel

386
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:22,840
yes yes because because the transport

387
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:27,060
mode is reusing the the the offered load

388
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:29,169
header right but we need to actually be

389
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:31,120
encapsulating that so that we can pad it

390
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:32,950
out and and shrink it and grow it and

391
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,649
you know so it's always fixed constant

392
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:39,400
size well my question is don't you see a

393
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,640
use case for traffic flow

394
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,440
confidentiality for transport mode so it

395
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,390
seems that it is not important more to

396
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:52,300
support so we have a sort of this sort

397
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:53,740
of analogy to like security modes where

398
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,840
we have if you think about them like a

399
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:57,790
knob right like of how secure things are

400
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,980
right transport mode is like the least

401
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:01,500
secure right and then because you're

402
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,090
giving away the source and destination

403
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,610
then you like turn the knob to like one

404
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,199
right and that's tunnel mode we're now

405
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:10,179
at least you're hiding the source and

406
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,100
destination and then then you start

407
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:15,130
talking about traffic analysis right so

408
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,990
then you turn the mode to to so it was

409
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,590
seen it's not see you're already giving

410
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,419
away so

411
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:21,610
much information by using transport mode

412
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:23,320
yeah you know why even worry about like

413
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,289
an analysis based on you know you don't

414
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:27,760
need to analyze traffic so I I'm not so

415
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:29,740
sure but probably well my second

416
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,760
question are you you want to allocate

417
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:39,059
and you IP protocol number does to use

418
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:41,950
well just to use to distinguish IP TFS

419
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:45,279
SP from the usual TSP

420
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:47,260
so is it used only on SP trailer as an

421
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,799
expert oh cool yeah exactly

422
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:53,950
it will it will an official at people to

423
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,408
call number so you need it's quite so

424
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,299
yeah right that's why we called it out

425
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,980
it's not it's not impact you know it's

426
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,510
it's not like we can just walk - Ayanna

427
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,190
and say give us a number and you know

428
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:04,779
it's first-come first-serve you know the

429
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,640
spaces is small but we have a

430
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:09,190
justification it's a it's a major

431
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:13,450
application but do you really need it

432
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:17,440
because from your draft your SPSA is a

433
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,380
dedicated PDF as you can't mix normal

434
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,409
tuna let's say and ipfs is BSA so it's

435
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,960
probably you don't need an IP protocol

436
00:23:23,409 --> 00:23:28,480
nom but just to know that this is BSA

437
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,899
it's um maybe that first it related yeah

438
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,820
correct

439
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:34,629
it's the scope I mean that's how the

440
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:37,299
next header field is defined in ESP you

441
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:39,460
know it's probably honestly easier to

442
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,408
get an IP number than it would be to go

443
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,909
back and create a new registry for es

444
00:23:41,409 --> 00:23:45,970
problem I don't know it's a question

445
00:23:42,909 --> 00:23:48,700
because IP number is you know if we can

446
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,230
look at this going forward I don't think

447
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,880
it'll be that hard actually there are a

448
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,100
lot of IP numbers available we're not

449
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:56,919
looking for a slew of them and we can

450
00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:00,039
reuse the one we got okay thank you

451
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,929
yeah in fact to do a nut ESP registry

452
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:03,520
going forward we could even be saying oh

453
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:08,260
we can reuse this number you're gonna

454
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:11,049
give us right benkei duck I guess I have

455
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:14,500
two points now so I mean I think an IP

456
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:17,440
number is like kind of a big deal we do

457
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:19,090
inside the isg say hey guys we got this

458
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,750
draft that wants to allocate a ipv4

459
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:24,209
number and then like it's kind of

460
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,850
something that that could be a big deal

461
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:30,730
in terms of you know people think it's

462
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,379
yeah yeah we are aware it's not a small

463
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:35,789
out yeah

464
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:37,770
we think we can just write people

465
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:42,090
heads-up and then the other one was

466
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:43,710
relating to the alignment question which

467
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:45,510
I have to apologize for having not worth

468
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:48,510
the draft but I think the sort of

469
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:51,390
general sense I get from the the general

470
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,539
around the ITF as a whole is that like

471
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,130
if we have to be adding new protocol

472
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:57,690
machinery to our stuff to like add a

473
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,039
variable length padding just so we can

474
00:24:57,690 --> 00:25:03,179
alignment like there's not a whole lot

475
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:05,760
of desire to be able to do that but if

476
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:08,730
it's just a matter of well do we have an

477
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,740
octave of padding in here so that all of

478
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,409
the fields have the same alignment and

479
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:15,539
and it's not like I have one field

480
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,010
that's alignment once it even and

481
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:20,100
another field let's line the odd and

482
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,299
like screw you implementers like if we

483
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,070
can just make up something very simple

484
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,900
yeah I think it would just literally

485
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:26,639
just replicate what's already there

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,250
which is 32 bit alignment on the headers

487
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,390
I'm yeah yeah that's the only thing I

488
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:32,360
think we should think about it like that

489
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:34,590
that's a reasonable thing to consider

490
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:41,850
but you we don't have to do it if we

491
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:44,010
need extra space thanks doc you said for

492
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:47,129
the protocol number as we need it only

493
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,110
into the ESP trailer we can actually

494
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:51,299
there's a couple of ways to do without

495
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,770
it one of the things is that we can I

496
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,860
think there is currently there's

497
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,809
protocol number zero which is used for

498
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:59,039
all kind of weird purposes meaning no

499
00:25:57,809 --> 00:26:01,080
prophet are gonna be actually using it

500
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:04,620
Ike we say that there is no protocol

501
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:06,689
number it's any and and if you negotiate

502
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,039
you know protocol operator number is

503
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:10,020
zero it means that there is no practical

504
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:12,510
number it's any practical it's okay

505
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:14,760
and I think ipv6 uses its first up for

506
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:17,429
some similar uses where it's actually

507
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,960
never in the real you know protocol

508
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,370
field but it's used for internal

509
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,260
purposes so we could have just say okay

510
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,639
we don't have any real protocol number

511
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,770
there because there are these multiple

512
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,390
pockets inside and then you can have the

513
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:28,590
real protocol number is because you have

514
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,270
your header there it's half the length

515
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:32,490
of the payload and you have to have you

516
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,929
know it's it's pocket inside has to have

517
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,299
a you know real protocol number anyway

518
00:26:33,929 --> 00:26:37,650
so you could have you know just you know

519
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,750
you don't need to have anything in the

520
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:42,780
trailer the other option is to use

521
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,790
wrapped ESP which is we haven't program

522
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:50,460
embroidery for ESP for the property

523
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:53,280
PVCs ESP with four octet extra header in

524
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,930
the ESP before the payload which tells

525
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:56,820
at least the pocket encrypted how long

526
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:58,440
the 10 trailer is how long the header is

527
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,879
and so on and there's a couple of

528
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,980
research-based which we could have just

529
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,020
used one bits and say oh this is this is

530
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,450
pocket that has multiple pockets inside

531
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,740
so the format is going to be different

532
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,510
and of course the third option is to say

533
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,050
that okay because we negotiate we always

534
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:15,090
negotiate these use of these in Ike

535
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,190
we can always say that these for this

536
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:20,399
essay the traffic is always going to be

537
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:22,350
this kind of you know multiplex

538
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,600
traffic's which means that we have we

539
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,149
actually just can you know say that okay

540
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,860
that protocol number if the first final

541
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:32,310
protocol number is ignored because it

542
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,219
doesn't have any meaning you know we

543
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:36,929
have to anyway code true to the protocol

544
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,370
number is usually mean poor for checking

545
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:39,810
the police and so on and here we don't

546
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:41,729
we actually have to do policy checking

547
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:45,360
for his payload they are not caring

548
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:47,550
about the applier stuff okay

549
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,340
thank you yeah I mean we definitely you

550
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:55,200
don't need to go around once before we

551
00:27:50,340 --> 00:28:00,629
ask for it but yeah Michael I just want

552
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:03,870
to clarify in question taro so if we

553
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:10,320
used wrapped ESP that would be the

554
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:19,949
protocol number of the outer thing or

555
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:21,330
the next header within the ESP if he put

556
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:24,120
that when I would put that as an outer

557
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:26,040
so the real IP header there would have

558
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:29,129
entrapped ESP and if we have actually

559
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,780
you know the extra you know header of

560
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,520
the wrapped yet V and if there's four

561
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:34,350
bytes of header in there

562
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,820
so that would actually have a bit saying

563
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:38,730
that we got actually shared one more bit

564
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:40,980
there saying that oh there's three bits

565
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,280
used on a file four bits well or

566
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:46,710
actually I think for you stand for left

567
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:49,649
just would one reserved bit to say that

568
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:54,820
though this is to this you know traffic

569
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:58,450
flow controversy fall right so

570
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:02,409
correct me if I'm wrong and rusty but

571
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:05,680
when we do ESP over UDP the outer IP

572
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:08,200
header says UDP and we know it's ESP

573
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:11,350
only because we negotiated the port

574
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:16,750
number in Ike so we wouldn't actually be

575
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:21,429
able to put wrapped ESP there we don't

576
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:24,310
so I'd like to make a suggestion so rep

577
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,780
ESB RFC actually has this it actually

578
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:27,190
defines how to do that's in UDP

579
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:29,470
etiquette so see what it does it

580
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:32,260
actually used one of the magic spi

581
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,240
numbers so instead of having all zeros

582
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,460
like you have like traffic or we have a

583
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,200
realized VI number it has I think SP

584
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,570
number 2 means that oh it's a wrapper

585
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,670
DSP and the next four bytes is the

586
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,840
header so so it actually ordered that's

587
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,430
actually one of the things I was think

588
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,689
about drop ESP is that because notary

589
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:51,580
supports you know UDP encapsulation and

590
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:53,380
so on because it it's working with that

591
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:54,879
of course you know I don't know if

592
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:58,000
anybody actually has implement it for a

593
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:01,960
PSP so that might be a paragraph you

594
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,760
know reason not to use it because so I

595
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,940
mentioned earlier coming up that you

596
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:09,970
know that we so first of all IPSec is a

597
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:11,950
pretty big deal right so we shouldn't

598
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:15,790
necessarily be so scared about asking

599
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:17,830
for a single IP number and and also we

600
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:19,510
do have the ability to once this you

601
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:21,250
know once we get the Charter text in it

602
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,590
and we and we have an official working

603
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:26,050
group document we are allowed to ask for

604
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,030
early allocation so we can float a trial

605
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,860
balloon here right I mean we're able to

606
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,050
go at once it's a working of document

607
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:33,550
and ask I Ana for early allocation and

608
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:36,460
part of that early allocation can be an

609
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:39,220
IP number so that that can you know that

610
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:41,140
we need to we need to move on yet so I

611
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,430
don't say that I'm supportive of what

612
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,320
you just said and I'm also really

613
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,900
supportive of making good use of the

614
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,669
wrapped ESP allocation which I don't

615
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,740
think is which I think has gone to waste

616
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,850
so the the consensus I'm hearing in the

617
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:54,280
room is that we should at least

618
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:55,929
investigate some options before we we

619
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,120
make the allocation request

620
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,720
zero maybe it would be useful if you

621
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,010
could send some examples to the list

622
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,500
being a chair that's stepping down I can

623
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:08,779
assign work and then that doesn't come

624
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:11,179
but it would be it would actually I

625
00:31:08,779 --> 00:31:11,830
think be useful for that okay thank you

626
00:31:11,179 --> 00:31:15,020
thank you

627

[Music]

628
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:22,850
the next person dresser is labeled to

629
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:35,870
IPSec which is also some kind of back

630
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:39,740
and forth stuff okay next night Stone

631
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:42,199
Age okay so just a quick reminder one

632
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:45,409
slide and this is an example a speedy

633
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,210
entry that shows the security label this

634
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:50,090
is the one we want to put in the traffic

635
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:51,289
selectors for a system and the question

636
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:55,418
is how to convey this information

637
00:31:51,289 --> 00:31:59,379
between two ike points to I can points

638
00:31:55,419 --> 00:32:05,230
so this was the very original proposal

639
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:05,230
from Sahana me we decided to just use

640
00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:14,570
this actually the second proposal

641
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:16,340
already no okay sorry so no this is the

642
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,439
first proposal it's a it's a TS type

643
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,939
it's a traffic sector type where we just

644
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,770
put in the security label and the length

645
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,450
and it was very simple and was a new

646
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,120
traffic selector in addition to the

647
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,440
existing ones and then problems came up

648
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,178
because people said well this really

649
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,700
changes the core ahrefs you know how we

650
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:35,690
select these these traffic selector

651
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:37,940
types so then

652
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:39,200
Tero came up with a brilliant idea like

653
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,399
oh let's just merge them into new

654
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,740
traffic selector so instead of adding

655
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:45,350
one new one we'll add one new one 5pv

656
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,850
401 u1 556 and if there's ever a new

657
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,370
type of traffic slack to add one more

658
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:51,770
type so you would basically copy all the

659
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:54,879
traffic's like the types we have but add

660
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,889
ones with and without the security level

661
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,480
and so some people like it some people

662
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:01,480
didn't and that change over time as well

663
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,190
so the question really is like like how

664
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:08,690
can we best move this forward because

665
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:10,640
like like everybody has now changed

666
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:14,180
their opinion except I think Valerie

667
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,870
who's always hated all the options

668
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:20,390
so how does this new Koshien really

669
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,399
happen and do we really need a traffic

670
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:25,310
selector so one of the issues is also

671
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,050
with the narrowing you can do if someone

672
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,790
requests something and puts in a traffic

673
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,440
selector off a security label and then

674
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,629
the other end eater doesn't support it

675
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,720
or the other and doesn't want to use it

676
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:38,090
they'll return a narrow down proposal

677
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,680
without the traffic selector but they

678
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:41,270
have installed the SI and now the other

679
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,070
end might have say oh I actually really

680
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:44,510
didn't like this so the initiator then

681
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,460
goes like I don't like this narrowed set

682
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:48,080
so now I have to send it delete and then

683
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,850
try without the label and maybe see if

684
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,889
they like that or like so so it really

685
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:54,469
complicates how this negotiation is done

686
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:56,360
and then we got thinking well we could

687
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:58,970
we could send and notify to at least say

688
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,010
hey we'd like to use this this security

689
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,600
label and then of course next question

690
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,100
quickly became well if we're sending a

691
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,780
notify we might as well put the label in

692
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,850
and notify not use a traffic select and

693
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,550
avoid all these issues because we also

694
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:13,009
did a quick check on on the code bases

695
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,050
that we could look at do people actually

696
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:16,490
properly narrow down traffic slack too

697
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:18,980
so if you see an unknown on do you

698
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:21,469
actually just drop it from the from the

699
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:23,449
set and continue to negotiate the SI

700
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:25,189
without that traffic's like the type and

701
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:27,049
the answer is I haven't seen a single

702
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:28,399
implementation a does that's the old the

703
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:33,020
old returned in error like I didn't

704
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:36,230
notice error so the question remains how

705
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,639
to do it is so I am now back to thinking

706
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:42,280
that notifies would actually be easier

707
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,279
and better than traffic selector types

708
00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:50,659
so the question is what do other people

709
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:52,520
think because it's hard to see what

710
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:57,920
people like because it has been changing

711
00:34:52,520 --> 00:35:00,920
a quite a lot well it is mostly for this

712
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,350
plus I think that well a second object

713
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,650
second bullet is definitely not an

714
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:09,620
option because it's a well traffic

715
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,870
selectors individual selectors in

716
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:16,609
traffic selectors interpret it as a

717
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:20,420
logical or so that if you knew these

718
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:23,570
types it will it will express only

719
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:27,700
security label it you cannot combine

720
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:31,570
this right right so either you know

721
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:35,049
don't or a new witch before plus the

722
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:38,500
Clara v6 plastic label and I think that

723
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:41,170
the third option is most most I don't

724
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,990
know right from formal point of view

725
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:46,500
from not from practical but from

726
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:49,660
theoretical point of view but from

727
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,599
practical point of view I agree that it

728
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:59,649
leads to explosion of traffic selector

729
00:35:52,599 --> 00:36:00,940
you just you just copy all the current

730
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,829
current selectors that are too tight

731
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:05,530
there before hundred six and add them

732
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,960
security label and if you later want to

733
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:10,900
add some something else we need to

734
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,900
multiply it but so so probably in unity

735
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,349
fiber load is some kind of compromise in

736
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:24,690
this situation I think it's probably way

737
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:28,770
to go hojoon for Nokia I think the I

738
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:32,260
don't like the third one because 95

739
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:35,349
implies that you find this security

740
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:37,210
label to a particular tunnel but my

741
00:36:35,349 --> 00:36:39,490
views case to bind a circle able to

742
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:39,910
actually tried so more grander than that

743
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,939
tunnel

744
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,740
sir sorry I didn't fully hear you to tie

745
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:46,300
the label to securely so if you have

746
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:48,359
this

747
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,890
basically you have a notify right notify

748
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,279
essentially it means that's you tie this

749
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:56,348
label to a tunnel not I try to say it's

750
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,849
so do you know you can actually if you

751
00:36:56,349 --> 00:37:00,250
think of the use transport and use

752
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:02,020
compress notifies they also are specific

753
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:04,180
for a childhood say not for an ICO say

754
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,329
so this notify would also be specific

755
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:09,160
for the child I say okay so when you do

756
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:11,950
a like Cree try to say you couldn't go

757
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,270
included this notify correct yeah if you

758
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:18,328
do create child say you would also send

759
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:20,920
to notify okay so works and got for me I

760
00:37:18,329 --> 00:37:23,589
think this really should bind to a try

761
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,369
to say correct yeah they need a must

762
00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:27,880
they must bind to a child a say Michael

763
00:37:27,369 --> 00:37:30,609
Richardson

764
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,650
so I I I'm gonna say that I don't

765
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:36,009
haven't formed an opinion as to which is

766
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:37,599
the the best choice here but my opinion

767
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:39,670
would be formed by considering two

768
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:41,440
things and I have a question as a result

769
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:44,110
which is

770
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,610
how would a an implementation which

771
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:51,820
doesn't implement labeling respond to

772
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:57,540
these three things and that leads to my

773
00:37:51,820 --> 00:38:00,370
question which is is it useful for

774
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:02,920
accept in a transition upgrade period is

775
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:06,310
it useful or do you expect that an

776
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,950
endpoint having desiring security labels

777
00:38:06,310 --> 00:38:12,279
will negotiate with endpoints that don't

778
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:15,730
have them and don't implement them and

779
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,380
expect to just create an essay that

780
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:19,930
doesn't have labels and just proceed

781
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,090
along as if with that so the answer that

782
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:24,310
I don't put it for a specific further

783
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:25,900
security labels that I need to distort

784
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:28,180
effort this will not be the case so if

785
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:30,130
they they did not get a confirmation of

786
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,870
the notify in the reply they would like

787
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,340
consider this a failure a failure and

788
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,670
they wouldn't set up any tunnel correct

789
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:39,580
right so then I would say that it really

790
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:43,180
doesn't matter that much because the end

791
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:45,819
in the end requesting the label is going

792
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:51,040
to have to deal with whatever a failure

793
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:53,530
comes back as opposed to you know saying

794
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,410
oh you picked the TS without the label

795
00:38:53,530 --> 00:39:00,520
are all to go that way then if you like

796
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:01,960
okay and and and all I can see the

797
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,000
situation where you might you know

798
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,590
upgrade things incrementally and you

799
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,020
want to turn on the policy and as soon

800
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:10,060
as it's all there everyone's happy I

801
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,610
don't know if that if your use case

802
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:14,470
really supports that scenario I think

803
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:16,360
you turn it on the whole network once

804
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:18,040
the network's ready you you go to label

805
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:22,720
and until then the network's not labeled

806
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:25,090
right right yeah that's what I think is

807
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,709
the case it's not like you know other I

808
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:29,680
think other things where you want to go

809
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:32,050
oh let's go for go to aes-256 next week

810
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:34,149
but you know 128 will be good enough for

811
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:35,890
the next week right it's okay right we

812
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:38,620
still want transmit so that's my take on

813
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,540
it is is what will be easier for you to

814
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,810
determine if the other end doesn't

815
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:45,850
doesn't agree and pick that right but

816
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:48,279
but do take into code that so I have a

817
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,930
very specific use of the security label

818
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:51,370
other people might have other users for

819
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:53,529
the security label where where they

820
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,690
might decide that something incremental

821
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,720
is valid for its

822
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,190
period of time so so it's not a use case

823
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,180
we should discard just because I don't

824
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,500
need it I I think you should probably

825
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,089
unless those people are quite loud I

826
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:12,480
think you should just go ahead with what

827
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:15,420
suits you their communion I think

828
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,400
actually if we actually use the traffic

829
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:19,500
selector you traffic sector type that

830
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:21,960
allows both of these because one of the

831
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:28,170
things you can if you only allow gonna

832
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:30,030
be secondary lab both cases very okay if

833
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:33,270
you have a checker if you propose

834
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:36,030
something that normal ipv4 and I believe

835
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:38,040
for PostSecret label that gives an

836
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:39,540
option for the other and to speak which

837
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:42,060
one of Anna can you allowing that for

838
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:44,250
your policy if you only propose ipv4

839
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,990
plus sec ylabel that means that you only

840
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:47,670
allow that in your policy and eat that

841
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:49,259
will actually be better proposed it the

842
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,760
other one will immediately feel that if

843
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:52,410
he doesn't support actually say clay

844
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:54,750
plus because he doesn't have any traffic

845
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:57,270
lights selector it could be it would say

846
00:40:54,750 --> 00:41:00,569
traction traffic second unavailable or

847
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,009
unacceptable exotic so so that way

848
00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:05,130
actually gives you immediate error

849
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,900
instead of you getting back essay that

850
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,650
you have to immediately delete because

851
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,440
it didn't have to notify so that's also

852
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:15,420
I write right this guy right like this

853
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,980
kind of explicit you know cases where

854
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,619
you actually get them you can propose

855
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:21,750
either with the traffic selector it

856
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:24,690
select with sick libel or without or

857
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:27,900
both and you you know the other one can

858
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:29,250
decide what you propose to tell us what

859
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:31,170
you want and what the other one

860
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:33,000
responses tell us what he wants and

861
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:34,550
there is you know either get an error or

862
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,750
you get an essay that you're gonna use

863
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:39,599
notifies the problem is a feed we don't

864
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:40,589
get that C so you're advertising for the

865
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:43,230
third options though

866
00:41:40,589 --> 00:41:44,759
yeah the one that we saw I believe four

867
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:46,020
plus sec ylabel and I don't think we are

868
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,720
going to be adding that many of those

869
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:50,609
new things intersect later the other

870
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:52,410
things we had earlier discussion was to

871
00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,390
how to secular political to be used how

872
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:56,460
is it strain is it number or is it

873
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:58,200
software that can be can it be narrowed

874
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,460
down and that's something that we need

875
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:01,470
to decide and that's actually one of the

876
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,369
things also that affect these things

877
00:42:01,470 --> 00:42:08,009
because I mean it affects how the code

878
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:08,549
it's encoded but although the narrowing

879
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,199
can be

880
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:11,939
like you can have a whole complicated

881
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,259
Turing machine inside your security

882
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,578
level if you really want that like

883
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:16,109
that's all look for everybody else to

884
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:17,910
define like you just send it over the

885
00:42:16,109 --> 00:42:20,009
network so that that's why actually I

886
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:22,558
think it might be what the current draft

887
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:25,109
I think says is that the security label

888
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,239
is just one label there's no range there

889
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:29,549
and you can narrow it you have to accept

890
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:31,289
it completely right but that doesn't

891
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:34,709
mean that you cannot accept everything

892
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:36,449
that starts with letter a yeah but do

893
00:42:34,709 --> 00:42:38,160
you have returned whatever that means

894
00:42:36,449 --> 00:42:39,929
something else and whatever it means is

895
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,839
outside of the AI complementation yeah

896
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:44,099
yeah yeah that's that's possible yes but

897
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:46,709
you still return actually the whole

898
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:49,799
thing right your god franca it says it's

899
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:52,828
the same thing with the you know like we

900
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:54,779
have a protocol field you have to accept

901
00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:56,579
if the protocol field is anything else

902
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:58,019
and zero you have the accept X that

903
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:00,809
exact protocol number you can't do

904
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:04,038
anything else yeah I'm gonna have to cut

905
00:43:00,809 --> 00:43:06,839
the line you're good

906
00:43:04,039 --> 00:43:08,759
benkei doc you have notes on jabber that

907
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,578
the notify payload could be better

908
00:43:08,759 --> 00:43:13,439
because nobody has ever really defined

909
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,059
new traffic selector types and we know

910
00:43:13,439 --> 00:43:18,390
that implementations can handle unknown

911
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,959
notification types but they might choke

912
00:43:18,390 --> 00:43:26,999
on an unknown traffic electric-types

913
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:29,279
right that's true I'm just wondering

914
00:43:26,999 --> 00:43:31,439
word this label is gonna be are you

915
00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:34,890
gonna put it into the yesterday can you

916
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:36,348
speak into the mic are you worried yeah

917
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:39,029
I'm not speaking in the mic

918
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:43,709
no no then they asked you for your name

919
00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:45,599
oh my name Daniel me go Ericsson so I'm

920
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:48,808
wondering how this level is going to be

921
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,309
used is it expected to be placed into

922
00:43:48,809 --> 00:43:52,309
the SAS ad

923
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:03,078
is actually the output of the Linux

924
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,119
access forum policy database okay so

925
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:06,440
it's actually it's a real traffic cycle

926
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,089
so if you sent a packet with these

927
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,559
sources nation's address but it's not

928
00:44:08,089 --> 00:44:13,700
labeled with that label it will not

929
00:44:09,559 --> 00:44:17,359
match mmm okay thanks so it sounds like

930
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,749
the third option is probably the one to

931
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,680
look at are there any concerns well

932
00:44:19,749 --> 00:44:23,118
that's not what I got from this

933
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,609
discussion I got from the discussion

934
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,609
that in theory the third option is

935
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:33,920
nicest but in practice the first option

936
00:44:28,609 --> 00:44:35,839
is nicest so if we go so if we go with

937
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:43,509
the first option is there anyone that

938
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:46,369
has any concern with that approach yeah

939
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:50,210
I think that it must be discussed on the

940
00:44:46,369 --> 00:44:56,690
least because I think there are not many

941
00:44:50,210 --> 00:45:02,410
people here to decide right now they're

942
00:44:56,690 --> 00:45:05,539
given it I think the bad idea about the

943
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:08,328
bad thing about the notifies is that you

944
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:11,269
get an essay created even if you don't

945
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:12,559
want it and you have to delete it and

946
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:14,390
there's all kind of race conditions

947
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,099
because oh oh I have an essay up I have

948
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:18,019
a traffic cone oh no no no I can't use

949
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:19,940
that I said even if it's created I need

950
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:21,470
to delete it immediately but I can

951
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,210
delete it before I get response back and

952
00:45:21,470 --> 00:45:25,848
you have to block manually block you

953
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:29,239
know things so that doesn't leak out in

954
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:32,329
the essay that it's not allowing it and

955
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,309
another thing in all of the cases you

956
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,489
need to have a new cone in your traffic

957
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:40,279
selector you know code if you are going

958
00:45:37,489 --> 00:45:41,690
to be implementing it I mean everybody

959
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:43,460
who's going to be plus label odd cycles

960
00:45:41,690 --> 00:45:45,829
are going to be modifying their you know

961
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:48,380
code anyway so adding the code for

962
00:45:45,829 --> 00:45:50,329
traffic selector support theories to be

963
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:52,549
smart is something that you should be

964
00:45:50,329 --> 00:45:54,739
doing anyway and you shouldn't be

965
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:56,390
proposing these to anybody who is it not

966
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:58,309
really most of the case you don't

967
00:45:56,390 --> 00:46:01,578
propose this to anybody who doesn't

968
00:45:58,309 --> 00:46:03,230
agree or earlier in your you usually put

969
00:46:01,579 --> 00:46:05,749
in their policy to say oh for this I

970
00:46:03,230 --> 00:46:07,609
proposed these labels so I'm not hearing

971
00:46:05,749 --> 00:46:09,439
that there's enough consensus around an

972
00:46:07,609 --> 00:46:10,340
option so maybe we need to take this to

973
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,880
the list and

974
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:15,170
options 1 & 3 a little bit more could

975
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:18,260
you drive some discussion on the list

976
00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:19,820
for that sure I can try but but we've

977
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,070
been going around in circles for a bit

978
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,560
so I didn't know how how to steer this

979
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:26,270
to an end yeah so I mean my suggestion I

980
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,279
thought I kind of agree with what Paul

981
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:30,560
said was like three it's like what you

982
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,360
would do if you were gonna like do it

983
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,830
super correct but in the reality of the

984
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,720
world the practicality I should want is

985
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,610
to do it and I agree that we have to

986
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:40,040
take it to the list but like maybe we

987
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:41,540
could do a home on that and then confirm

988
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:45,700
it on the list and the home you're

989
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:49,130
asking for is well option 1 okay so um

990
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:51,310
so if you I don't care what the answer

991
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:54,530
is I just want to help you get to done

992
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:56,299
things that the option one is also that

993
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:58,120
we don't have that in any of the crafts

994
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:01,760
so I would actually propose that we

995
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:03,410
postpone that harm until it's actually

996
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:05,300
written somewhere where what what about

997
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,080
notify is good to be looking at how do

998
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:11,330
behave when you receive or send it yeah

999
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:13,310
may I may I suggest to all that's a good

1000
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:18,500
idea may I suggest that you simply ask

1001
00:47:13,310 --> 00:47:20,299
for a hum of objection objectors right

1002
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:25,820
if you don't understand it you probably

1003
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:29,960
shouldn't object sorry alright how about

1004
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:32,030
this way so it do you understand if you

1005
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:40,690
understand what we're asking for an

1006
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:40,690
option one please hum that's pretty weak

1007
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:53,930
if you have any concerns with option one

1008
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:55,340
please hum definitely weaker so it

1009
00:47:53,930 --> 00:47:58,009
sounds like maybe what we should do is

1010
00:47:55,340 --> 00:48:00,140
write up an example of what option one

1011
00:47:58,010 --> 00:48:05,770
would look like and then we can consider

1012
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,770
that Thanks I think you're up next

1013
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:15,819
[Music]

1014
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:15,820
no it's vacant

1015
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:28,500
so so the next one is traffic separate

1016
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:31,830
logs and hello everyone my name is

1017
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:35,580
weapon from Huawei today I'm going to

1018
00:48:31,830 --> 00:48:51,060
talk about the updates of our eye cavers

1019
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:53,910
into a routine optimization draft first

1020
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:56,400
day is a quick recap our purpose is to

1021
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:58,859
optimize unnecessary pillows at every

1022
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,130
King essays including two or meet essay

1023
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:04,800
payloads at every King I KSA's and to

1024
00:49:02,130 --> 00:49:07,680
omit essay mps pillows at a routine

1025
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:10,470
child essays why we can do that is

1026
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:13,859
because configurations may not change a

1027
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:16,080
frequent frequently and the SI NTS

1028
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:18,330
pillows at every King essays will be the

1029
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:23,670
same and add the ones that create

1030
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:26,670
creating essays so as the pillows are

1031
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:29,580
the same so we can just use a previous

1032
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,760
as ints pillows instead of instead of

1033
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:35,490
sending them again at a routine why we

1034
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,490
want to this is because repeated

1035
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:42,359
repeatedly sending here sa NTS pillows

1036
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:44,939
is a redundant operation and it's Eddy

1037
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:50,120
it unnecessary consumers consume its

1038
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:53,910
resources such as bandwidth NS CPU and

1039
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:57,740
you and the wicking happens happen

1040
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:00,270
periodically so this will mean periodic

1041
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:04,859
redundancies and the burdens especially

1042
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:07,920
for the constrained devices and for the

1043
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:11,550
ipsec essays when you set the lifetime

1044
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,250
based on the transported traffic and as

1045
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:16,920
you know the bandwidth now is increasing

1046
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:19,800
so the routine pure the wrecking

1047
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,870
interval will be shot become shorter so

1048
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:26,610
the routine happens will become more

1049
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:30,299
frequently and maybe even less than 20

1050
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:33,270
minutes in some in some products and

1051
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,210
in 5g networks there will be more than

1052
00:50:33,270 --> 00:50:39,960
100,000 IT sector nose will be

1053
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:42,830
established in in one local network so

1054
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:47,280
the situation's will become severe and

1055
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:49,529
so our some of our products has already

1056
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,780
have already implemented this

1057
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:59,220
optimization and next is updates or our

1058
00:50:53,780 --> 00:51:03,690
draft based according to the opinions

1059
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:06,810
last meeting we make the draft the

1060
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:09,810
optimization some simple simpler so

1061
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:11,850
first we make the IKS a working

1062
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:14,970
optimization and the child I say working

1063
00:51:11,850 --> 00:51:17,700
optimization optional it means that it's

1064
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:20,700
up to the implementer to optimize IPSS

1065
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:25,529
routing or just child I say a king or

1066
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:27,330
both these cases and if you don't think

1067
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:29,240
I can say weekends

1068
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:34,680
optimization is insane sure you can just

1069
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:37,080
don't talk to my debt and for the

1070
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:43,230
optimization processes we also

1071
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:46,590
simplified it and before there are three

1072
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:50,130
sub cases and now we discarded it

1073
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:53,430
discard the third one and the rest

1074
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:56,370
remain two sub cases are first in the

1075
00:51:53,430 --> 00:52:00,330
initiator optimizer sends the optimized

1076
00:51:56,370 --> 00:52:05,720
rican request and the responder can

1077
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:05,720
accept it or just to refuse it rejected

1078
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:14,460
finally here is a whole overview our the

1079
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:17,430
overview of our whole solution first in

1080
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:20,870
the negotiate negotiate of the support

1081
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:24,330
of this optimization between the

1082
00:52:20,870 --> 00:52:27,839
initiator and the responder by sending

1083
00:52:24,330 --> 00:52:31,259
the new notification at a Keo message

1084
00:52:27,840 --> 00:52:34,580
exchange after negotiation there are two

1085
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:37,340
optional implementation is the

1086
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:40,799
optimizing the IKS a working and

1087
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:43,170
optimizing the child sa routines and for

1088
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,770
each cases they are all they are all

1089
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:47,720
both

1090
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:51,840
contains two sub cases and as I just

1091
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:56,368
described it it before so this is a

1092
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:58,470
whore overview about the future plan

1093
00:52:56,369 --> 00:53:02,010
we want more feedbacks comments and

1094
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:05,759
reviews and as it is very simple and is

1095
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:08,040
used for in in the 5g network so we are

1096
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,940
looking for adoption and

1097
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:16,830
question can you go back one slide

1098
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:18,840
because that's okay everything right so

1099
00:53:16,830 --> 00:53:20,880
what I don't like sorry pal I'll just

1100
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:22,560
read it what I don't like about this

1101
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,200
proposal is the part where you initiate

1102
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:27,150
a consent the unchanged as a notify

1103
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,549
saying it's doing the one without the

1104
00:53:27,150 --> 00:53:32,070
traffic selectors and the responder can

1105
00:53:29,550 --> 00:53:33,630
decide based on whatever reasons that I

1106
00:53:32,070 --> 00:53:35,700
don't I don't like there's no proposal

1107
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:38,460
chosen because now I've got a failed

1108
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:40,319
Ricky and I would much rather have to

1109
00:53:38,460 --> 00:53:42,720
know beforehand where I can do this

1110
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:44,670
proposal or not before doing it so is

1111
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,580
there any reason did

1112
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:49,530
does your responder dynamically decide

1113
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:52,740
that now it can do this and maybe five

1114
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:54,330
minutes from now it cannot do this or do

1115
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:56,669
you all the or is it just a matter of

1116
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,200
like it doesn't support it or doesn't

1117
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,760
want it's not configured for this

1118
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:01,980
connection because if it's purely

1119
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,869
configuration then this should not

1120
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,369
happen if it's based on load and I can

1121
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:08,780
see why you might want to do that and

1122
00:54:05,369 --> 00:54:12,390
maybe I'll like it a little less but

1123
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:15,119
actually the second you mean the second

1124
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:18,029
case why the responder we are rejected

1125
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:21,750
this optimization is we think that you

1126
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:23,910
are for some products we usually well if

1127
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:26,220
the configuration changes on the

1128
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:29,250
responder side usually the responder

1129
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:32,609
will initiate the Rakeem process

1130
00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:37,530
immediately but as this is not a

1131
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:40,980
mastered in the RFC so for some products

1132
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:44,910
they may not do this immediately they

1133
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:49,470
will wait for the Rakeem period when the

1134
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:53,190
time when the routine times out they the

1135
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:57,580
responders just initiated Larry King so

1136
00:54:53,190 --> 00:55:00,840
when in this in a second a case

1137
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:03,940
when the responder receives such our

1138
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,700
optimizer routine request but it's

1139
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:10,570
configuration has changed so it wants to

1140
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:13,689
use a new like cryptographic suite so it

1141
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:15,700
will send rejected the optimization yeah

1142
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:17,800
so that's kinda weird because now what

1143
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,870
you're saying is in the initial I guess

1144
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:21,610
a you you negotiate with this notifies

1145
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:23,770
what you're willing to do yeah and then

1146
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:25,990
halfway through without without telling

1147
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:32,380
anyone you decided not to follow up on

1148
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:34,060
that promise take the case where my

1149
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:37,630
clear so take the case that the initial

1150
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:42,160
policy on the initiator was AES 128 or

1151
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:45,850
AES 256 and they agreed and the

1152
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:50,259
responders and configuration was 128 so

1153
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:52,420
they agreed okay life went on but now on

1154
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:54,850
the responder they've now changed the

1155
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,030
configuration to AES 256 which would

1156
00:55:54,850 --> 00:56:00,400
still be acceptable to the initiator

1157
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:02,470
okay so the initiator then said oh let's

1158
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:06,220
do a TAS 128 again and the responder

1159
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:09,029
says no no I need to do 256 so if he'd

1160
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:11,470
sent his whole list so it both of them

1161
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:12,940
yeah the other one I understand what

1162
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,259
you're saying but first of all all of

1163
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:15,760
these things are not allowed you have to

1164
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:16,870
use the same in rekeying you're not

1165
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,340
allowed to just change the entire

1166
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:21,670
protocol you have to do the exact same

1167
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:27,030
parameters so this is actually a bad

1168
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:30,330
example so like you cannot actually say

1169
00:56:27,030 --> 00:56:33,670
host has to always be the same in a Riki

1170
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:35,799
correct and and if you want to split

1171
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:37,750
this and say I want one for two to show

1172
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:41,110
support for Ike and I won't want to

1173
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:43,150
suppose to support the child I say and

1174
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:45,910
that's probably better so that you can

1175
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:46,990
decide what you want to do but I don't

1176
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,580
like this like like you have this

1177
00:56:46,990 --> 00:56:50,020
configuration and I understand you're

1178
00:56:48,580 --> 00:56:51,700
reloading the confirmation and you don't

1179
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:54,790
want to kill a hundred thousand tunnels

1180
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:56,319
but but you can't just like change all

1181
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:58,740
the parameters and accept initiator to

1182
00:56:56,320 --> 00:56:58,740
continue

1183
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:06,529
well it's been slow for this plus well

1184
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:10,370
for I could say keen I don't see that

1185
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:13,160
disease draught gives us a lot of

1186
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:17,029
optimization because if you put if you

1187
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:19,520
do it just usually like a Saluki and put

1188
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:21,170
in a safe below just the same algorithms

1189
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:25,910
that are used for I could say it will be

1190
00:57:21,170 --> 00:57:28,010
a dozen of whites and probably thirty

1191
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:30,830
twenty bytes and you replace this twenty

1192
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,350
but who is eight bite of a dental

1193
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:37,730
notification so it's very small wing and

1194
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:40,130
die Casa Liki happens very seldom so

1195
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:42,320
it's it's it's not well I don't think a

1196
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:45,530
big optimization for childís Araki's

1197
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:47,960
it's probably slightly different

1198
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:50,330
situation because you need to move the

1199
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:52,940
traffic selector and traffic selector

1200
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:55,490
can be quite complex and very long and

1201
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:00,410
if you immediately it probably it will

1202
00:57:55,490 --> 00:58:04,330
probably give you some save in size but

1203
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:05,600
I think that for I Kosair kids it's not

1204
00:58:04,330 --> 00:58:10,880
worse

1205
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:15,830
to complicate so please think was it's

1206
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:18,020
possible to simplify IQ drop just meet

1207
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:20,930
you like a say Ricky probably a meeting

1208
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:23,540
well at least a meeting like you say

1209
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:29,120
Ricky something like that for childish a

1210
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:33,050
keys probably make sense yeah and

1211
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:35,810
because you know I KSA's Ricky Mamie

1212
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:38,690
just happens not very frequent

1213
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:41,660
frequently and but it's it is also our

1214
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:43,700
an optimization that we have implemented

1215
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:46,549
it's very small optimization where is

1216
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:48,819
quantization because you save just ten

1217
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:52,400
bytes yeah

1218
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:56,060
compared to competitive bytes of like

1219
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:57,440
message size so we made it optional it's

1220
00:58:56,060 --> 00:59:02,210
not required

1221
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:03,740
yeah well right so I you know thinking

1222
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:05,810
about this it and what with the

1223
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:07,490
discussion that just happened isn't it

1224
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:08,900
just possible that this is over

1225
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:11,240
engineered like you can still get this

1226
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:14,210
optimization but why why try to make it

1227
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:15,339
so fancy right like it just tear the

1228
00:59:14,210 --> 00:59:17,710
essays down

1229
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:19,510
if you have a configuration change right

1230
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:21,940
so then you don't have to have all these

1231
00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:23,890
different moving parts you know the

1232
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:25,930
optimization if it's really cheap to

1233
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:28,509
implement then it's nice right I mean

1234
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:31,299
you're talking about 83 things a second

1235
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:33,160
and in the whole network right so how

1236
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:34,600
much how many chances of putting new

1237
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:38,080
bugs into the code do you want to

1238
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,610
optimize in 83 times a second thing you

1239
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,560
know but if you make it simple it might

1240
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:44,980
be easier to swallow this right

1241
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,670
just simple cram it way down maybe yeah

1242
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:47,670
yeah okay

1243
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:52,960
I know the once a thing just like I said

1244
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:54,430
it last time I do think for the child

1245
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,930
let's say it's really useful because not

1246
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:58,149
only are you saving a number of bytes

1247
00:59:55,930 --> 00:59:59,290
you also save processing all the traffic

1248
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,180
slackers because you have them already

1249
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:02,560
you don't have to verify that the

1250
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,720
selectors are the same as once you had

1251
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,070
installed before so actually I really

1252
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:08,020
like it from the child's day because

1253
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:09,820
like we could all use this per default

1254
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:13,720
to make our code easier it's not just on

1255
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:15,430
some high-performance server and and I

1256
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:17,500
think I also said last time that I don't

1257
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:20,230
see as much a unique version but the

1258
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:24,910
child is a version Delta C where C is a

1259
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:26,740
good case for it they're equivalent

1260
01:00:24,910 --> 01:00:29,350
I don't like to get because it says

1261
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:31,149
options this adds more options that to

1262
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:32,740
be doing and and options are always bad

1263
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:34,570
because we get said if this would have

1264
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,759
been proposed when we were making guy

1265
01:00:34,570 --> 01:00:38,500
question two we could have we could have

1266
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,210
said in that version 2 you never ever

1267
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,090
sent s a pellet or traffic splat

1268
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:45,040
selectors ever in Ricki's and that would

1269
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:47,830
be very simple and would solve the

1270
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:49,450
problem now I don't want to have all we

1271
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,279
have to write this code and we have this

1272
01:00:49,450 --> 01:00:53,620
you know we stuff always say unchanged

1273
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,660
oh do we have to do that and if it's at

1274
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:58,029
its new option so there has to be tested

1275
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:00,430
and that's why I mean we have way too

1276
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:02,020
many options already there we have a

1277
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:03,730
resumption we have all kind of we have

1278
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:05,200
lots of things that have text that I

1279
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:06,880
just want to have you know extra thing

1280
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:09,310
especially even you will say oh it can

1281
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,900
happen every 20 minutes but it has when

1282
01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:12,670
did that every 20 minutes means it

1283
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:15,820
happens every 4 gigabytes

1284
01:01:12,670 --> 01:01:17,950
we are saving 20 bytes or 30 bytes every

1285
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:20,470
4 gigabytes I think it's like waste less

1286
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:23,350
effort it actually takes more time for

1287
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:25,419
us to you know discuss it here than we

1288
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:29,100
are saving the whole time of the you

1289
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:29,100
know lifetime of this protocol poster

1290
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:37,329
Yoav near why are there two separate

1291
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:39,339
notifications for as i undecide changed

1292
01:01:37,329 --> 01:01:41,140
the first is only used in phase one and

1293
01:01:39,339 --> 01:01:48,519
the second is in phase two so there's no

1294
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:50,469
ambiguity you could just have one so so

1295
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:54,758
for my understanding there's also some

1296
01:01:50,469 --> 01:01:59,289
IPR configurations related to this do

1297
01:01:54,759 --> 01:02:03,579
you want to comment on yeah

1298
01:01:59,289 --> 01:02:07,209
before after last the meeting and the

1299
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:13,719
IPR has disclosed clammed on this draft

1300
01:02:07,209 --> 01:02:16,989
and I think there are many drafts many

1301
01:02:13,719 --> 01:02:21,789
are pcs in ITF that they have the same

1302
01:02:16,989 --> 01:02:26,559
IPR come so I don't think it's very a

1303
01:02:21,789 --> 01:02:30,819
big big problem for considering IP ours

1304
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:33,759
and but I don't know what people will

1305
01:02:30,819 --> 01:02:35,679
think about it yeah I mean I don't

1306
01:02:33,759 --> 01:02:36,189
really I don't think it's a big deal

1307
01:02:35,679 --> 01:02:37,899
yeah

1308
01:02:36,189 --> 01:02:39,759
so if we were to adopt this draft that's

1309
01:02:37,899 --> 01:02:41,999
one of the things that the working group

1310
01:02:39,759 --> 01:02:46,709
would have to have some consensus on

1311
01:02:41,999 --> 01:02:49,118
unaccepting who's read the IPR

1312
01:02:46,709 --> 01:02:55,479
notification on this can I see a show of

1313
01:02:49,119 --> 01:03:00,519
hands or the posting of or the hasn't

1314
01:02:55,479 --> 01:03:03,158
there been a the IPR disclosure I mean

1315
01:03:00,519 --> 01:03:19,569
can we just is it the the free one or is

1316
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:21,369
it a royalty based one so reading from

1317
01:03:19,569 --> 01:03:22,959
the disclosure it says reasonable and

1318
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:25,959
non-discriminatory license to haul

1319
01:03:22,959 --> 01:03:28,509
employers with possible royalty-free so

1320
01:03:25,959 --> 01:03:29,919
as you pointed out Dave like if there's

1321
01:03:28,509 --> 01:03:32,049
one there that's great the work you just

1322
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:36,669
has to decide what that they're happy

1323
01:03:32,049 --> 01:03:38,739
with it or not so most of the other IPRs

1324
01:03:36,669 --> 01:03:40,629
we have our actually don't require to

1325
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:42,939
conduct contact they usually say that we

1326
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:46,479
are defensively if if you sue us then we

1327
01:03:42,939 --> 01:03:48,189
can use this to against you but this set

1328
01:03:46,479 --> 01:03:50,468
where you require them to you know the

1329
01:03:48,189 --> 01:03:52,089
talk to the you know IPR owners before

1330
01:03:50,469 --> 01:04:07,719
you can implement or use it in the code

1331
01:03:52,089 --> 01:04:12,489
that's actually is annoying first for

1332
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:14,969
the eighties eighties wake up so so

1333
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:18,039
question is that I think this might be

1334
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:19,599
part of our Charter or Mike not the

1335
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:21,429
question there is that because we have

1336
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:25,169
in the Charter we have text saying that

1337
01:04:21,429 --> 01:04:27,459
we are doing optimizations for you know

1338
01:04:25,169 --> 01:04:30,399
something like that I think it's like

1339
01:04:27,459 --> 01:04:32,049
generic stuff and these could be part of

1340
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:33,429
that or it could be separate so that's

1341
01:04:32,049 --> 01:04:35,349
actually first I think we need to decide

1342
01:04:33,429 --> 01:04:37,389
I remember last time we were think about

1343
01:04:35,349 --> 01:04:38,949
this enemies actually I don't think we

1344
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:41,289
actually get an offer for a DS at that

1345
01:04:38,949 --> 01:04:43,630
point either and actually what's the

1346
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:50,229
status of the ad you know charter

1347
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:53,019
updates bank attack yeah I I have some

1348
01:04:50,229 --> 01:04:56,198
draft new charter text I need to put in

1349
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:57,939
the data tracker and kick out the review

1350
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:03,789
process for so that should happen the

1351
01:04:57,939 --> 01:05:05,339
next week or two so but you can't salute

1352
01:05:03,789 --> 01:05:07,329
you don't know if this is actually part

1353
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:12,839
we don't think that this would be a

1354
01:05:07,329 --> 01:05:16,569
thing that a charter college charter I

1355
01:05:12,839 --> 01:05:18,819
would be unhappy to assume that it is in

1356
01:05:16,569 --> 01:05:20,349
the current charter okay so you you

1357
01:05:18,819 --> 01:05:23,739
would say that we need to operate the

1358
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:25,359
Charter anyway so so before we do the

1359
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:26,819
working group adoption we have to you

1360
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:30,630
know work on the chart

1361
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:32,579
anyway that's actually pushes till you

1362
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:34,859
know we don't there's no point of doing

1363
01:05:32,579 --> 01:05:36,749
harm to be up adoptees if if we are you

1364
01:05:34,859 --> 01:05:39,989
know have to do charter update enemy

1365
01:05:36,749 --> 01:05:45,689
right right I will tell check today but

1366
01:05:39,989 --> 01:05:46,890
I think Paul about us I'm we've gone

1367
01:05:45,689 --> 01:05:49,259
back and forth about whether we should

1368
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:51,660
do all these minor charter updates all

1369
01:05:49,259 --> 01:05:54,419
the time I want to remind it share that

1370
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:56,279
this is IPSec minor extensions and I

1371
01:05:54,419 --> 01:05:59,038
think this is a pretty minor extension

1372
01:05:56,279 --> 01:06:00,630
III know that but we had also we have

1373
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,329
also in the Charter texted saying that

1374
01:06:00,630 --> 01:06:05,130
we actually try to charge we I think we

1375
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:06,989
have texture settings that we always try

1376
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:08,759
to charter everything or thing we

1377
01:06:06,989 --> 01:06:09,959
actually do you don't adopt anything

1378
01:06:08,759 --> 01:06:12,989
that this is not in charge

1379
01:06:09,959 --> 01:06:14,999
but anyway so so but we can actually do

1380
01:06:12,989 --> 01:06:16,169
the adoption call anyway in the we have

1381
01:06:14,999 --> 01:06:18,569
to do it anyway in the working group

1382
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:20,189
banging is so there is no part of 200

1383
01:06:18,569 --> 01:06:22,079
every we will discuss about the

1384
01:06:20,189 --> 01:06:24,509
chartering issues first and you know

1385
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,329
then have the discussion later about

1386
01:06:24,509 --> 01:06:32,419
this adopting this way the next

1387
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:35,159
presentation problem is that Paul again

1388
01:06:32,419 --> 01:06:37,618
and we are running out of time a little

1389
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:40,140
bit or behind the schedule so try to be

1390
01:06:37,619 --> 01:06:42,749
first I know you want to talk about that

1391
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:46,979
sure fine fine I'll also do only do this

1392
01:06:42,749 --> 01:06:49,229
one slide so grave yet so we talked

1393
01:06:46,979 --> 01:06:51,959
about about doing what about killing up

1394
01:06:49,229 --> 01:06:54,749
some things so just a reminder we have

1395
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:56,428
two RFC's one for Ike and one for IPSec

1396
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,348
where we sort of once in a while update

1397
01:06:56,429 --> 01:07:00,390
all the algorithms but then we only

1398
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:03,150
really obsolete the algorithms that are

1399
01:07:00,390 --> 01:07:05,219
really bad order for some reasons are

1400
01:07:03,150 --> 01:07:06,239
like like strongly discouraged but just

1401
01:07:05,219 --> 01:07:08,609
a lot of these things that sort of

1402
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,979
linger around that are may that we don't

1403
01:07:08,609 --> 01:07:13,558
touch and so the proposal here is to do

1404
01:07:10,979 --> 01:07:14,968
a few things kill all those old may

1405
01:07:13,559 --> 01:07:17,640
things that we don't really use anymore

1406
01:07:14,969 --> 01:07:21,390
that are kind of deprecated and then

1407
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,359
also trying to nail down another not a

1408
01:07:21,390 --> 01:07:26,400
bit in the in the IPSec and so in Ike v1

1409
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:29,749
coffin because we really want people to

1410
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:33,119
to not use this anymore

1411
01:07:29,749 --> 01:07:34,738
so the changes to the draft from 0 0 is

1412
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,529
that I was a little too aggressive

1413
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:39,179
I added some things like HTML 5 and D H

1414
01:07:37,529 --> 01:07:40,869
groups that I really wanted to not be

1415
01:07:39,179 --> 01:07:42,130
used anymore but

1416
01:07:40,869 --> 01:07:46,269
those should go through the regular

1417
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:49,210
updates of the brca2 182 one and A two

1418
01:07:46,269 --> 01:07:50,799
four first seven his documents so I've

1419
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:53,890
removed that from the document

1420
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:56,079
I let the references to the documents in

1421
01:07:53,890 --> 01:07:57,700
everything we do so if it said something

1422
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,130
like you know we're obsoleting this and

1423
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:03,069
then it instructs Ayana to actually say

1424
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:05,980
to clarify whether this was obsolete it

1425
01:08:03,069 --> 01:08:09,130
or deprecated and the existing RFC's or

1426
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:11,349
in this new this new document and I

1427
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:13,269
spoke to taro a couple of days ago so we

1428
01:08:11,349 --> 01:08:15,670
quickly made another change and I

1429
01:08:13,269 --> 01:08:17,710
submitted that yesterday is that we're

1430
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:20,859
actually formally asking to close those

1431
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:23,350
two old IQ unrelated registries so that

1432
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:25,330
no one can ever do that now informally

1433
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:26,980
we've already you know acted like this

1434
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:29,259
for many years that we don't add

1435
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:30,968
anything new there but if we're doing an

1436
01:08:29,259 --> 01:08:39,429
RFC damn you might as well officially

1437
01:08:30,969 --> 01:08:41,639
close these registries dan Harkins I

1438
01:08:39,429 --> 01:08:45,339
noticed in the draft it says you know I

1439
01:08:41,639 --> 01:08:47,049
v1 must not be deployed and I'm not

1440
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:49,000
really sure that we can say that any

1441
01:08:47,049 --> 01:08:50,889
more than we could say like you know you

1442
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,750
must reduce your carbon footprint or you

1443
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:55,600
you must not take drugs or something

1444
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:58,560
like that it we don't really have the

1445
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:01,750
authority to well we all we can say is

1446
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:04,150
we really don't like this and which

1447
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:05,710
means deprecated and it's already dead

1448
01:09:04,149 --> 01:09:08,170
great it's been deprecated for 15 years

1449
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:10,120
so you know unless we're gonna do like

1450
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:13,029
the you know double secret probation

1451
01:09:10,120 --> 01:09:16,179
thing so so then it's it's it's

1452
01:09:13,029 --> 01:09:18,100
deprecated so we and we want to make

1453
01:09:16,179 --> 01:09:19,719
sure that we're that people really

1454
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:22,960
understand because it's been deprecated

1455
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:24,009
so I even have some free text I agree

1456
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:27,790
with all the other stuff because it says

1457
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:29,109
if you if you don't get rid of likely

1458
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,420
one you'll have all of these problems

1459
01:09:29,109 --> 01:09:32,440
that's exactly what we should say if you

1460
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:34,060
don't do it you'll have all of these

1461
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,799
problems but we can't mandate that

1462
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:36,460
somebody not deploy a protocol that's

1463
01:09:35,799 --> 01:09:40,389
just ridiculous

1464
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:42,279
and furthermore I'm not sure if we well

1465
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:44,080
maybe we can close the registries but

1466
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:46,480
there are other standards organizations

1467
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,908
that use the Ike v1 registries and if

1468
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:51,849
you look at the last update to the oq1

1469
01:09:48,908 --> 01:09:53,710
registries there's actually a new column

1470
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:54,250
added to one of them that says not for

1471
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:58,060
RSU

1472
01:09:54,250 --> 01:10:00,340
409 because the these entries were added

1473
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:02,200
for somebody else and and at that time

1474
01:10:00,340 --> 01:10:04,600
we also agreed that there's going to be

1475
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:07,720
never ever going to I did not need stuff

1476
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:12,340
to that registry and who's we

1477
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:13,720
I working to open RISD and yes we can

1478
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,070
close the registers there is actually

1479
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:16,780
lots of clothes druggist reason I and I

1480
01:10:15,070 --> 01:10:18,219
was talking about this earlier I know

1481
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:19,690
that there's closed registries I'm not

1482
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:21,070
I'm originally you cannot never close

1483
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:22,690
the registry I'm saying that somebody

1484
01:10:21,070 --> 01:10:24,490
else is using this registry okay she's

1485
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:26,290
not going to be disappear it's going to

1486
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:27,969
be there it's going to be closed which

1487
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,920
means that it's no it's going to be have

1488
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:31,150
allocations and I understand what you're

1489
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,060
talking about but I'm saying that

1490
01:10:31,150 --> 01:10:36,070
somebody else is using this registry

1491
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:38,650
then they don't they may not understand

1492
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:41,710
what's going on and you know maybe you

1493
01:10:38,650 --> 01:10:43,809
want to send a yeah maybe you want to

1494
01:10:41,710 --> 01:10:52,360
sell Atari I used to suck to yourself

1495
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:55,060
maybe you want to send a registry change

1496
01:10:52,360 --> 01:10:57,009
your spirit change respect to refer to

1497
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:57,700
the to a different registry and not this

1498
01:10:57,010 --> 01:11:04,270
one anymore

1499
01:10:57,700 --> 01:11:05,639
because this one is dead hmm right so

1500
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:09,490
what happens if they want to add another

1501
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:11,290
curve yeah not going to that if if they

1502
01:11:09,490 --> 01:11:14,380
want to add another curve than that they

1503
01:11:11,290 --> 01:11:15,910
can't right but it but what I'm saying

1504
01:11:14,380 --> 01:11:18,580
is that if if we'd told them that this

1505
01:11:15,910 --> 01:11:19,330
is happening then they can change their

1506
01:11:18,580 --> 01:11:24,070
there

1507
01:11:19,330 --> 01:11:27,580
we don't them who did you tell we sent

1508
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:29,380
be sent an email when this was happening

1509
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:31,330
you know I triple I Triple E Center as a

1510
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:35,110
requester that'd be neat glad that we

1511
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:37,600
have access and is the order I her

1512
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:39,009
statement was sent back telling that the

1513
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,190
disease registry that is not for this

1514
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:44,170
use and but I'd really answer that oh we

1515
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:46,030
can say is our document anymore because

1516
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:48,870
it's so late it was because you

1517
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:51,910
could change it and then because of that

1518
01:11:48,870 --> 01:11:54,940
you know is they allowed them to

1519
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:56,710
allocate this number and then I I Triple

1520
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:58,960
E said oh oh good

1521
01:11:56,710 --> 01:12:00,700
it's we could get the number so we don't

1522
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:02,140
need to change the document it's we have

1523
01:12:00,700 --> 01:12:03,519
already rained earlier that they can't

1524
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:06,580
change the document now they said all we

1525
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:09,870
need don't say that sounds like a really

1526
01:12:06,580 --> 01:12:13,120
crazy history and I don't believe it

1527
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:16,030
but but but so dan Denton just in reply

1528
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:17,860
to dan by saying it is close to ers we

1529
01:12:16,030 --> 01:12:20,230
are sickening to all the people we don't

1530
01:12:17,860 --> 01:12:21,969
know that they shouldn't be relying on

1531
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:23,559
this feature anymore we have a liaison

1532
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,910
we should send a liaison request that

1533
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:26,470
I'm saying this is what we're doing

1534
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:29,349
these are the implications of what we're

1535
01:12:26,470 --> 01:12:31,780
doing you're you're forewarned that this

1536
01:12:29,350 --> 01:12:33,520
is what we're doing sure we can do that

1537
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:35,800
so am i hearing there that you're you're

1538
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,870
not against closing those registries

1539
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,610
you're talking about the notification

1540
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:42,070
mechanism yeah

1541
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:44,170
benedict as responsible ad totally right

1542
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:47,559
we should send liaison before we just by

1543
01:12:44,170 --> 01:12:50,080
close the registries also relating to

1544
01:12:47,560 --> 01:12:51,550
Dan's point about you know we can't say

1545
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,990
you must not use this protocol it

1546
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,060
doesn't actually have binding force I

1547
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:57,849
mean yes that's true but we put that in

1548
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:59,280
our documents all the time as I ATF and

1549
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:02,020
the implication is sort of if you are

1550
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:03,219
adhering to this document and you're

1551
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,590
complying to this document then you're

1552
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:12,850
not using iq1 but you can ignore this

1553
01:13:05,590 --> 01:13:15,040
document and your own peril so Danny

1554
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:17,710
amigo Erickson it's it's really good

1555
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:20,710
sean is behind me because we had the

1556
01:13:17,710 --> 01:13:23,530
same kind of discussion in TLS we said

1557
01:13:20,710 --> 01:13:28,060
well if weif why don't we duplicate TLS

1558
01:13:23,530 --> 01:13:31,150
1.2 and some argue is that because 1.3

1559
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:35,410
is obsoleting in the header today that's

1560
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:37,750
1.2 it was not necessary so I I'm not

1561
01:13:35,410 --> 01:13:40,530
against the draft but I just like we

1562
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:44,320
acquired with other working group maybe

1563
01:13:40,530 --> 01:13:46,840
so so to clarify that a little bit so so

1564
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:49,090
in my view is when we say you know use

1565
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:50,530
Ike V - not Ike v1 we are technically

1566
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:52,450
talking to implementers like don't

1567
01:13:50,530 --> 01:13:54,519
implement Ike v1 like we're not saying

1568
01:13:52,450 --> 01:13:56,290
don't run actually one and this RFC is

1569
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:57,580
more or less saying it's been so long

1570
01:13:56,290 --> 01:14:02,470
now you should really also not be

1571
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:05,130
running this anymore don't necessarily

1572
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:05,130
disagree with you

1573
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:10,630
hi this is Sean Turner just a minor word

1574
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:12,790
suggestion I think technically what

1575
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:14,440
we're trying to do here is you're trying

1576
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:16,420
to say don't use it but you're also

1577
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,400
trying to add solution does not make the

1578
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:20,920
document historic so what you really

1579
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,089
want to do is in the words I think it

1580
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,970
was like must is you

1581
01:14:22,090 --> 01:14:26,170
this document is been off sleet it must

1582
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:28,000
not be deployed I think you actually

1583
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:30,730
want to say you want to move the draft

1584
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:32,320
to historic there's that there's a right

1585
01:14:30,730 --> 01:14:33,490
there's a process for that and that's

1586
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,500
really what you want to do is you're

1587
01:14:33,490 --> 01:14:37,090
taking it off standards track and then

1588
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:41,830
the additional statement is don't employ

1589
01:14:37,090 --> 01:14:43,270
it so I can send you suggested text and

1590
01:14:41,830 --> 01:14:48,720
also we won't be doing any maintenance

1591
01:14:43,270 --> 01:14:51,520
on it so div clear guidance on how to

1592
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:59,170
run updates to make if you have good

1593
01:14:51,520 --> 01:15:00,790
minutes yes Shani so just a note who's

1594
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:03,120
gonna send the leaves on request and

1595
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:06,220
there's to come out of from you guys I

1596
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:08,050
think this comes from Japan I'd you know

1597
01:15:06,220 --> 01:15:14,100
how I Triple E or some person who is

1598
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:14,100
actually sent that so maybe with IDs so

1599
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:19,929
I think we have five minutes left

1600
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:23,370
Valerie is that enough time for yours or

1601
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:26,580
should we okay um

1602
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:26,580
Daniel sorry

1603
01:15:39,019 --> 01:15:47,519
I'll be I gotta be quick so it's an

1604
01:15:45,539 --> 01:15:49,619
alternative an alternative approach for

1605
01:15:47,519 --> 01:15:54,360
most want impartiality in I quit ooh

1606
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:56,759
so bikini for a quitter defined in the

1607
01:15:54,360 --> 01:16:04,799
drug de Jesus already in publication

1608
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:09,269
request instated just online so we sent

1609
01:16:04,800 --> 01:16:11,999
inside ksanych we negotiate that became

1610
01:16:09,269 --> 01:16:16,110
is used in the next change and and I

1611
01:16:11,999 --> 01:16:21,539
quote the PPK is barricaded identity is

1612
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:22,348
sent and it begins used stilt into the

1613
01:16:21,539 --> 01:16:26,699
SKG

1614
01:16:22,349 --> 01:16:32,090
and escapee computation so that initial

1615
01:16:26,699 --> 01:16:35,610
I guess I isn't protected by PPK wiki so

1616
01:16:32,090 --> 01:16:37,679
it was a wardrobe decision at the time

1617
01:16:35,610 --> 01:16:40,829
it was assumed that nothing nothing

1618
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:44,249
interest nothing really sensitive is

1619
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:47,159
exchanged in I could say itself so and

1620
01:16:44,249 --> 01:16:49,978
if and I charge this a are protected of

1621
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:51,539
course and if someone someone needs I

1622
01:16:49,979 --> 01:16:57,499
could say to be protected it will

1623
01:16:51,539 --> 01:17:01,409
immediately in shade Ricky ikazuchi

1624
01:16:57,499 --> 01:17:04,409
so the problem the problem is that now

1625
01:17:01,409 --> 01:17:09,749
we have group I quit to GI Cueto and

1626
01:17:04,409 --> 01:17:13,619
draft adopted and in GI cui to the

1627
01:17:09,749 --> 01:17:17,670
session keys are immediately transferred

1628
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:20,339
from group to group members in the

1629
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:22,679
initial I guess a so they these keys are

1630
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:25,309
not practices keys are really sensitive

1631
01:17:22,679 --> 01:17:31,979
information it they are not protected by

1632
01:17:25,309 --> 01:17:34,079
both quantum shared key so current GIP

1633
01:17:31,979 --> 01:17:36,959
to draft suggests a very long sequence

1634
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,739
of exchanges that can work around this

1635
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:44,369
issue so we first the from I guess I

1636
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:46,888
need then we perform GSA også else is

1637
01:17:44,369 --> 01:17:50,699
equivalent to five cows for J equal to

1638
01:17:46,889 --> 01:17:51,630
but in DC else we don't transfer key

1639
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:54,388
stand with

1640
01:17:51,630 --> 01:17:57,120
and defecation Araki's needed some of

1641
01:17:54,389 --> 01:17:59,760
then group members initiate like a

1642
01:17:57,120 --> 01:18:02,670
sailor key initiate the registration

1643
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:04,800
exchange deletes initial like saying so

1644
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:08,010
it's a total of five exchanges and for

1645
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:10,860
around tips so an eternity of approach

1646
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:17,790
would be to use I continue to to

1647
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:20,429
exchange that just becomes well there

1648
01:18:17,790 --> 01:18:22,199
was a popular not popular but it's that

1649
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:25,590
it is implemented but even some vendors

1650
01:18:22,199 --> 01:18:28,919
and to exchange to send appliquéd entity

1651
01:18:25,590 --> 01:18:31,050
in the ikat immediate exchange even we

1652
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:33,810
can even send we can even send several

1653
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:36,719
public identity that is not the case

1654
01:18:33,810 --> 01:18:40,530
with the original approach I and in this

1655
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:42,780
case the I call against and GSA always

1656
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:44,759
exchange will be protected to respect

1657
01:18:42,780 --> 01:18:46,530
the gate because we will still be key we

1658
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:48,750
were already negotiate which perfectly I

1659
01:18:46,530 --> 01:18:50,969
did which propagate to use I can will

1660
01:18:48,750 --> 01:18:55,699
steer it into the competition for the

1661
01:18:50,969 --> 01:18:59,219
SKT keys so if I compare this approaches

1662
01:18:55,699 --> 01:19:01,500
I mean the approach of traditional

1663
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:02,100
approach an attorney for Porsche fusion

1664
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,650
PPK

1665
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:09,389
there are clear wins for GI quitter case

1666
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:13,379
because three exchange it is tenth of 5

1667
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:16,310
1 th computation stand of two one

1668
01:19:13,380 --> 01:19:21,420
computation of hours exchange in in case

1669
01:19:16,310 --> 01:19:25,620
is optional instant of two and multiple

1670
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:27,719
public key can be sent so it is possible

1671
01:19:25,620 --> 01:19:32,190
to reload the beacons by easy ways and

1672
01:19:27,719 --> 01:19:34,620
further for I could say for like we do

1673
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:38,159
not 4G I quit you just for tradition

1674
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:40,019
like we - there is a more mixed

1675
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:42,420
situation because we need three

1676
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:44,010
exchanges a stand of two but if you

1677
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:46,350
psyche intermediate of for some other

1678
01:19:44,010 --> 01:19:48,719
purposes - we can piggyback replicate

1679
01:19:46,350 --> 01:19:50,730
identity into each so it's probably not

1680
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,610
we may not lose it something in the

1681
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:56,489
middle and it's still less complication

1682
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:59,938
for ICO's if you need protection for for

1683
01:19:56,489 --> 01:20:03,388
for is a so what

1684
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:05,010
proposal is not to replace it's just an

1685
01:20:03,389 --> 01:20:06,659
alternative approach that can be used

1686
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:10,919
it's rather simple it's a very

1687
01:20:06,659 --> 01:20:14,159
straightforward so it can coexist with

1688
01:20:10,919 --> 01:20:16,229
the traditional approach that I defined

1689
01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:18,360
in the drug that is already in the

1690
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:21,239
publication requested States and Fuji

1691
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,978
Ike reduces this approach can become the

1692
01:20:21,239 --> 01:20:28,499
primary one not so intelligent but the

1693
01:20:22,979 --> 01:20:31,669
primary so what's your opinion comments

1694
01:20:28,499 --> 01:20:34,320
questions probably adoption I think it's

1695
01:20:31,669 --> 01:20:47,519
unwise for adoption if there is enough

1696
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:49,199
interest yeah we can bring that to the

1697
01:20:47,519 --> 01:20:50,280
list but these drafts and relevance to

1698
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:52,860
Mike please

1699
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:56,579
so Daniel may give Erikson these drafts

1700
01:20:52,860 --> 01:21:03,389
has been presented many time and I think

1701
01:20:56,579 --> 01:21:05,070
we can bring that to the list I don't

1702
01:21:03,389 --> 01:21:06,840
think this actually this is the

1703
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:08,610
alternate it went metal this is that it

1704
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:14,039
has been prestigious first time is

1705
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:20,909
presented so ask how many has actually

1706
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:26,849
read the draft one and if somebody has

1707
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:29,820
written it so there's two way Pam from

1708
01:21:26,849 --> 01:21:31,829
how way I've read this draft and I think

1709
01:21:29,820 --> 01:21:35,459
it's very easy to understand and it's a

1710
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:38,820
good idea I think yeah so so I think

1711
01:21:35,459 --> 01:21:40,229
it's the the I don't think everybody

1712
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:42,840
people have we'll have a quick posters

1713
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:44,789
here if you haven't read it but okay

1714
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,919
well I encourage people to read it and

1715
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:47,999
think about and sender comments to email

1716
01:21:46,919 --> 01:21:52,469
list because we are running out of the

1717
01:21:47,999 --> 01:21:54,360
time anyway so can I can we get some

1718
01:21:52,469 --> 01:21:55,709
volunteers to read the draft and provide

1719
01:21:54,360 --> 01:22:00,539
feedback Daniel

1720
01:21:55,709 --> 01:22:02,599
Paul thank you yes you can add that to

1721
01:22:00,539 --> 01:22:05,639
the notes

1722
01:22:02,599 --> 01:22:08,150
all right so Daniel we have a time if

1723
01:22:05,639 --> 01:22:08,150
you want to come up

1724
01:22:13,079 --> 01:22:18,340
hi

1725
01:22:14,489 --> 01:22:21,129
so this draft is basically explaining

1726
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:24,520
how introducing a method to negotiate

1727
01:22:21,130 --> 01:22:25,960
multiple I tried they say at one one

1728
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:36,550
time so next slide

1729
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:38,139
oh yeah so as I mentioned before usually

1730
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:40,900
the create charges that result in

1731
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:42,880
creating only one try let's say and what

1732
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:48,070
we'd like is to improve that from one to

1733
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:51,520
n so this requires basically you propose

1734
01:22:48,070 --> 01:22:53,710
a number and you provide another number

1735
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:56,739
saying I will not go above this number

1736
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:58,090
and you provide some arguments so that

1737
01:22:56,739 --> 01:23:01,900
you can generate all the necessary

1738
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:05,260
parameters for that in this case that's

1739
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:07,570
going to be the SPI nones that's going

1740
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:12,099
to be used to generate the different SP

1741
01:23:07,570 --> 01:23:15,070
is for each child let's say and you have

1742
01:23:12,099 --> 01:23:18,219
a response with the same parameters but

1743
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:21,790
in here the end child s a is the number

1744
01:23:18,219 --> 01:23:22,210
agreed max charlie say is sort of

1745
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:24,210
useless

1746
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:28,809
it's just repeating the previous one and

1747
01:23:24,210 --> 01:23:33,579
s PR announced is just a hint to derive

1748
01:23:28,809 --> 01:23:35,610
all the different SBI's so this is how

1749
01:23:33,579 --> 01:23:38,949
the key maths is generated for all the

1750
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:45,699
different charlie essays this is how you

1751
01:23:38,949 --> 01:23:47,678
generate you different SPI and this is

1752
01:23:45,699 --> 01:23:52,089
the payload exchange and you can

1753
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:53,500
populate your SH Turki Vanessa says I

1754
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:55,030
don't think you actually can do that

1755
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:57,159
with SPI numbers because they see our

1756
01:23:55,030 --> 01:24:00,040
numbers need to be unique and now if

1757
01:23:57,159 --> 01:24:03,098
using hashing there is no of course yes

1758
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:04,840
you could generate non-si so long that

1759
01:24:03,099 --> 01:24:07,000
you actually get all their you know

1760
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:08,230
SPI numbers you generate are going to be

1761
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,989
unique but it's got to be a little bit

1762
01:24:08,230 --> 01:24:12,369
annoying we had this feature in a person

1763
01:24:10,989 --> 01:24:14,530
one Mike or someone you would actually

1764
01:24:12,369 --> 01:24:16,808
propose multiple I say you send you know

1765
01:24:14,530 --> 01:24:20,619
multiple SPI numbers and no credit and I

1766
01:24:16,809 --> 01:24:22,980
think we were the only implementers ever

1767
01:24:20,619 --> 01:24:24,790
who implemented it and in our case we

1768
01:24:22,980 --> 01:24:27,669
implemented it but they were

1769
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:29,380
no way to configure it so I think it's

1770
01:24:27,670 --> 01:24:31,690
actually a little bit you know I would

1771
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:34,600
really invite like to see first that

1772
01:24:31,690 --> 01:24:36,339
people who actually what is the use case

1773
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:41,290
for this before we actually want to

1774
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:43,210
implement it so the use case so well one

1775
01:24:41,290 --> 01:24:46,480
question is about the SPI so you can

1776
01:24:43,210 --> 01:24:48,970
extend this as long as you wish so maybe

1777
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:50,679
there are other ways to do but I'm you

1778
01:24:48,970 --> 01:24:54,250
can choose the nodes so that you don't

1779
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:57,130
have collisions the use case is clearly

1780
01:24:54,250 --> 01:25:00,760
when you have multiple calls it's better

1781
01:24:57,130 --> 01:25:04,450
to to have multiple si at least one per

1782
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:06,930
core or and to avoid to avoid that you

1783
01:25:04,450 --> 01:25:09,220
have some switches on contact switching

1784
01:25:06,930 --> 01:25:12,490
and some essays that are shared between

1785
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:16,870
the multiple calls so that's the the

1786
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:19,599
main motivations Michael Richardson says

1787
01:25:16,870 --> 01:25:20,559
replay counter conflict so I'm gonna cut

1788
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,060
the line

1789
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:23,380
but for those that are in the line if

1790
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:24,760
you do have interest in implementing

1791
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:28,120
something like this would be interesting

1792
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:29,710
to hear Ben Carrick so just to check all

1793
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:33,490
the child's essays get the same traffic

1794
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:39,130
selectors the same traffic selectors

1795
01:25:33,490 --> 01:25:43,000
yeah yeah yeah what is my slope for this

1796
01:25:39,130 --> 01:25:48,090
plus so please remember that there is a

1797
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:52,270
limitation on the length of our F plus

1798
01:25:48,090 --> 01:25:55,060
king material because there is a counter

1799
01:25:52,270 --> 01:26:01,030
and it is a one point counter so you

1800
01:25:55,060 --> 01:26:06,610
can't iterate pair F plus more than 255

1801
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:12,309
times so if so you can't generate more

1802
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:14,559
than well it depends on the on the size

1803
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:17,500
of the key for the childís a that is

1804
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:20,770
needed but there is some limit on the

1805
01:26:17,500 --> 01:26:24,490
number of assays that you can generate

1806
01:26:20,770 --> 01:26:27,130
just it's hard coded limit in the equity

1807
01:26:24,490 --> 01:26:29,559
space because of the definition of error

1808
01:26:27,130 --> 01:26:31,270
f+ and I think that well I agree the

1809
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:35,290
historicity it's it's a bit complicated

1810
01:26:31,270 --> 01:26:39,670
so probably well

1811
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:42,040
I'm not sure that these well I see that

1812
01:26:39,670 --> 01:26:46,450
it can get some optimization if you need

1813
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:49,450
to to do a lot of assay at the same time

1814
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:52,090
to several say at the same time but I'm

1815
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:57,550
not sure it justifies the complexity

1816
01:26:52,090 --> 01:27:00,400
well we should evaluate it so so to

1817
01:26:57,550 --> 01:27:04,390
think so the first one about how you

1818
01:27:00,400 --> 01:27:07,210
extend the the key match that's first

1819
01:27:04,390 --> 01:27:09,400
some reviewer you agree on how long how

1820
01:27:07,210 --> 01:27:12,550
much you can do that

1821
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:16,089
that's a the key matt is is is then used

1822
01:27:12,550 --> 01:27:20,050
to generate the keys the length of the

1823
01:27:16,090 --> 01:27:22,270
key mode is emitted so but um well it's

1824
01:27:20,050 --> 01:27:24,520
going to be made basically a restriction

1825
01:27:22,270 --> 01:27:28,360
on them but we can work on that scheme

1826
01:27:24,520 --> 01:27:30,970
that's so about the complexity and I

1827
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:34,870
think you're referring to how the sps

1828
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:36,760
have been generated yeah but I I sort of

1829
01:27:34,870 --> 01:27:39,220
don't understand where the complexity it

1830
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:41,830
is because I think you can turn really

1831
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:45,760
announce and you can see if you have any

1832
01:27:41,830 --> 01:27:51,580
collisions with your SPI well at the

1833
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:55,240
same time you well you need to reserve

1834
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:58,059
all this SBI's and you want to use those

1835
01:27:55,240 --> 01:28:01,090
those that are I mean you say I'm gonna

1836
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:02,830
do an exchange so I'm taking ounce okay

1837
01:28:01,090 --> 01:28:05,140
these are free know what there is a

1838
01:28:02,830 --> 01:28:09,960
collision I take another one okay fine

1839
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:13,390
I'm sending it and if those the other

1840
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:16,960
choose how much si is is willing to

1841
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:20,590
generate is the same thing and but when

1842
01:28:16,960 --> 01:28:23,290
is suppose he's taking less or he's not

1843
01:28:20,590 --> 01:28:27,160
taking that exact number or is saying no

1844
01:28:23,290 --> 01:28:30,820
I'm not using those multiple choice a

1845
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:33,849
then I received that ID allocate those

1846
01:28:30,820 --> 01:28:35,849
so understand it but we have two minutes

1847
01:28:33,850 --> 01:28:40,210
left if you keep your comments short

1848
01:28:35,850 --> 01:28:42,610
okay I'll just write it so so I also

1849
01:28:40,210 --> 01:28:44,080
thought about this a while ago and and

1850
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:46,269
and and so we've been talking about a

1851
01:28:44,080 --> 01:28:48,280
few implementers so this this three use

1852
01:28:46,270 --> 01:28:50,110
cases so far enough

1853
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:52,480
where this would this would solve an

1854
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:54,610
issue one if one of them is if you need

1855
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:56,620
to bring up many child and you want to

1856
01:28:54,610 --> 01:28:57,849
do PFS and you're doing defilements for

1857
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,530
each one of them it would be really

1858
01:28:57,850 --> 01:29:02,320
expensive for some devices and

1859
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:04,210
problematic I talked about taro and he

1860
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:06,639
came up with a really good solution you

1861
01:29:04,210 --> 01:29:08,470
can do this differently by rekeying the

1862
01:29:06,640 --> 01:29:09,520
IESA and then creating the child so

1863
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:11,500
creating all the trials and then

1864
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,690
rekeying I guess a so so there's other

1865
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:16,210
ways where you can actually use it with

1866
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:17,530
without DFS and still gain the PFS

1867
01:29:16,210 --> 01:29:19,780
property on the child let's say so

1868
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:22,780
that's that was one use case the second

1869
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:25,000
use case was if he if you do this per

1870
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:26,769
CPU so we're we're working with a few

1871
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:30,130
other people with Strong's on the Linux

1872
01:29:26,770 --> 01:29:31,420
kernel to be able to do more processing

1873
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:35,350
because currently there's a limitation

1874
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:37,090
on on CPU versus Nick receive cues so we

1875
01:29:35,350 --> 01:29:38,680
cannot use the full amount of traffic so

1876
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:45,520
we want to install multiple of the same

1877
01:29:38,680 --> 01:29:47,020
essays on different CPUs and the use

1878
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,700
guys there was brought up you can

1879
01:29:47,020 --> 01:29:51,280
actually do this on demand whenever

1880
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:53,380
another CPUs it so if you have 64 CPUs

1881
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:55,330
you don't have to set up 64 children you

1882
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:57,850
can just set as soon as a new CPU

1883
01:29:55,330 --> 01:30:00,250
generates a packet it will acquire and a

1884
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:02,650
new sort of fake acquire message and you

1885
01:30:00,250 --> 01:30:04,330
will set up the the the essays on demand

1886
01:30:02,650 --> 01:30:04,929
so so you should have spreading a load

1887
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:07,300
arrazolo

1888
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:09,220
the third one is similar to the second

1889
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:11,110
one this was for the Equality of servers

1890
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:13,450
different essays where you're also

1891
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:15,219
thinking maybe need to set up 64 essays

1892
01:30:13,450 --> 01:30:16,780
at once and a similar thing applies

1893
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:18,550
there if you only set up the ones on

1894
01:30:16,780 --> 01:30:20,530
demand based on the quality of service

1895
01:30:18,550 --> 01:30:21,730
bits you're actually not setting up many

1896
01:30:20,530 --> 01:30:23,650
of them you're probably only setting up

1897
01:30:21,730 --> 01:30:25,570
two or three so then it doesn't really

1898
01:30:23,650 --> 01:30:27,969
become a much of an issue anymore so I

1899
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:29,559
think this this optimization is not

1900
01:30:27,970 --> 01:30:35,020
really needed based on the use cases

1901
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:36,820
that I know so the second thing you

1902
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:40,740
mentioned so the first I don't remember

1903
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:45,330
the first one the second one I think you

1904
01:30:40,740 --> 01:30:48,160
you're saying that you can have multiple

1905
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:51,730
create child essay after one of the

1906
01:30:48,160 --> 01:30:54,099
other which means that is that is that

1907
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:57,309
correct or yes you do this on immense so

1908
01:30:54,100 --> 01:30:59,140
so if two CPUs are being used for this

1909
01:30:57,310 --> 01:31:00,580
traffic then you have two essays by the

1910
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:01,080
time you have some new processor

1911
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:03,780
generates

1912
01:31:01,080 --> 01:31:07,550
more traffic and goes on a third TPU set

1913
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:10,530
of the third essay so given that I mean

1914
01:31:07,550 --> 01:31:14,100
security gateway who works with 24

1915
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:20,160
course I mean I'd like to avoid this 24

1916
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:22,200
Exchange weren't you doing 40 or 100

1917
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:24,750
feet of traffic right so I'm not sure

1918
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:26,460
what how that matters so so can you take

1919
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:28,140
this to the list because I think this is

1920
01:31:26,460 --> 01:31:30,090
a good discussion it'd be a worthwhile

1921
01:31:28,140 --> 01:31:32,190
to continue it on the list

1922
01:31:30,090 --> 01:31:37,640
so with that I think we're going to

1923
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:37,639
close the the meeting for ietf 106

1924
01:32:21,990 --> 01:32:25,148
