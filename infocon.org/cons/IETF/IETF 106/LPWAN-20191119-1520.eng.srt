1
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,649
so this is the room for the lp1

2
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:10,720
workgroup meeting if you want to do

3
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,310
packet over helicopter carriers you're

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,210
in the wrong room and with this we're

5
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,070
gonna start will delay a little bit

6
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:24,309
passing the blue sheets because we are

7
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,429
used to some people who are low-power

8
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:32,350
workers and arrive later in the meeting

9
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:34,450
but yes so we'll pester the blue sheets

10
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:39,970
in like 10 to 15 minutes and with this

11
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:41,950
the meeting starts so please seat and

12
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,190
the rule is the late comers are the one

13
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:49,000
who take the minutes so giorgos you have

14
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:57,490
to take some minutes no hon you have to

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:02:00,640
take some minutes okay so this is a an

16
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:04,000
official IETF meeting so the best

17
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:07,750
practice documents apply in particular

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,319
the DCP is about IPR on patents

19
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:13,500
so if you're aware of any IPR on the

20
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,929
subtopic that is being discussed today

21
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:23,230
please mention it to the room or let the

22
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:25,450
channel after the meeting this meeting

23
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:26,649
is being recorded so it will be

24
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,619
published on YouTube

25
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:31,239
I guess as usual we'll be recording the

26
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,420
presence on the blue sheets we'll be

27
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:36,760
passing the blue sheets in 9 10 minutes

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,549
please join the etherpad so the link is

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,340
given here this is where we take the

30
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:46,120
minutes and mostly if you come to the

31
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,940
mic and make a point please make sure

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,430
that your point is correctly captured in

33
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,890
the minutes so the best way for doing

34
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:57,340
that is actually to participate to the

35
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,379
minutes and help us take them so all

36
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:05,210
this would be published and make it made

37
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:07,880
available on YouTube so just one point

38
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,710

50
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:57,410
was the bashing anything anything you

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:07,580
Yucatan static contact sick then

54
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:09,710
will ever leave you first time at the

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,530
ATF presenting the sheik of aloha one

56
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:13,940

will talk about the progress and the

58
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:19,160
static context for coop and Dominique

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,080
will update you are update us on the OEM

60
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:29,870
work so that's a small reminder from

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:32,180
last time so we have our first charter

62
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,890
item that we have completed and we are

63
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,830
working on the second charter item we

64
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,200
are really advanced and that is

65
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,380
something that we are really happy wait

66
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,810
and the the two chairs and the whole

67
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,310
working group I think that we can be

68
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:47,870
proud of ourselves and you can be proud

69
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:50,510
of your work so we got all our

70
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:55,070
milestones in green we have submitted

71
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:57,110
everything and so the domain document

72
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:00,230
amend a document that is the shake

73
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:03,170
static header compression is now

74
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,440
submitted for it but today is g4

75
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,420
publication and we will it will be

76
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,250
passed on to the Secretariat into the

77
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:16,150
RFC editor very very soon so Suresh is

78
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,150
going to give us

79
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,439
so description so the chic stuff is like

80
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:26,960
gone through the iesg

81
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:28,490
a valid it's ready for opera so I'm

82
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,188
ready to push the button we were

83
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,599
expecting one review from Carsten on the

84
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:33,800
side like so we're kind of holding off

85
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:36,139
for a little bit to see if something

86
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,620
comes in so but we are until end of next

87
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:41,030
week before we approve and also like you

88
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,819
know Dominic was just telling me like

89
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:46,188
you know there's some XML v3 XML tar cv3

90
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:47,659
stuff that requests we change but it

91
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:50,180
doesn't change the content it only

92
00:05:47,659 --> 00:05:50,719
changes the source file so it shouldn't

93
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,699
be a big deal

94
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:58,969
process wise for us to do and the the

95
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:00,830
coop it's on my ed eval pile it's like a

96
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:02,180
long pile now so I probably I think I

97
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:04,400
have like 11 documents or something

98
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:08,120
right now so I'll get to it probably you

99
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,878
know I would say about before end of the

100
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:15,110
year for sure and hopefully as soon as

101
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:16,969
possible okay and for the I also talked

102
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,560
to the editor I know like Alex did as

103
00:06:16,969 --> 00:06:21,460
well and Pascal I know if you are there

104
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,319
too at the same time we could go for a

105
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:26,330
expedited request to the RFC editor to

106
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,460
make sure that the stuff gets done

107
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:30,409
little bit faster and so you can give

108
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:33,560
the number to externalized years who

109
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:35,389
want it yes sir thank you so much Thresh

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,069
actually very appreciate it because this

111
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:40,520
you know it's needed elsewhere

112
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,259
we need the service number this picture

113
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,979
tells us sort of thing right it tells us

114
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:47,689
that we are really ready to reach author

115
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:48,830
I'm good like I know like you know

116
00:06:47,689 --> 00:06:50,479
there's a chat I've been kicking around

117
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:53,539
for quite a bit it's been pretty stable

118
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,550
so whenever you're ready so we'll have a

119
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:59,180
discussion on the Charter a bit later or

120
00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,189
which is now and so you agreed and we'll

121
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,650
just send you in a dated charter and

122
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:06,889
like send me the stuff I'll kick all the

123
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:09,020
procedures so here the only points on

124
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:11,779
all the other things are as we discussed

125
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,180
a couple of times already so here what

126
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:17,509
we would like to propose is to modify

127
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:20,210
slightly item number one which before

128
00:07:17,509 --> 00:07:22,069
was really focused on coop and right now

129
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:25,339
we see that there is a lot of interest

130
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,199
in actually having other protocols so

131
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:29,779
the upper layer protocols to abusing

132
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,780
shake so we said okay how about we

133
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:32,880
reformulate

134
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,250
you know a bit more generic way and to

135
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,100
say okay well when if there is some

136
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:40,950
protocol that comes bar over shake then

137
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:43,230
you know we can be charter to to to do

138
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:44,880
that work and that's fine right like the

139
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:47,100
only thing is like the milestones need

140
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,870
to be more precise than this because you

141
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:50,940
cannot say hey I will send borrow or

142
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:52,650
something right like without knowing

143
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,570
what bar s but so the chatter can be

144
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,020
like a little bit wider but as long as

145
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:59,780
the milestones are known at a point we

146
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:03,000
stop today we will not have any

147
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,799
deliverable associated to item one but

148
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,540
if somebody comes to the room and say oh

149
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,960
I've got this technology like we had the

150
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,750
LMS from which we would need to add a

151
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,270
feature to check then we would be

152
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,160
capable of adopting this group because

153
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:20,640
of the first statement but so far and

154
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,110
then we would have an item in the in the

155
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,090
list but so far there would not be an

156
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:25,590
item that's fine and like you know

157
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,510
adding a milestone is like between you

158
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:29,280
and me right rather than that ESG so I

159
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:31,139
think like another charter like as long

160
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
as it's like clear to everybody what

161
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:34,229
needs to get done and the milestones are

162
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:40,770
specific things you already know about I

163
00:08:34,229 --> 00:08:41,610
think it's okay this yeah so you know

164
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:48,449
sign your destruction

165
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:52,190
good to go so with this we can go on to

166
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:56,310
the first presentation from Dominic and

167
00:08:52,190 --> 00:09:00,690
so for all people that are first-time on

168
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:03,989
the g---eight attending at the ITF you

169
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,520
can go to the IGF web site to meet the

170
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:07,470
meeting materials and then you can see

171
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:13,230
if all the presentations you had all the

172
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:16,350
links there hello so as you may know

173
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:20,400
there was a hackathon weekend before the

174
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:23,280
this week and so the the Czech community

175
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:27,300
had a table at the hackathon and I'm

176
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:30,410
going to tell you did so first of all

177
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,170
this is the team about a dozen people

178
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:40,050
showed up the usual suspects

179
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:42,300
Cedric who's our technical lead wrong so

180
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:44,400
which he from Japan he

181
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,439
actually flew in on his own money just

182
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,660
to be with us physically usually is

183
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:52,710
removed but this time we decided to come

184
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,500
thank you so GE for doing this for us

185
00:09:52,710 --> 00:10:00,180
our own as well Olivier a first-timer

186
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,370
first time at ATF first time at the

187
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,050
hackathon

188
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:08,240
very good technical expertise he did a

189
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:12,510
lot of stuff that we hadn't done before

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:15,270
Rahul who's a long time at the IGF but

191
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,840
first time at our table I check he dived

192
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:23,040
into the curve as well and then usual

193
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:26,660
suspects when colors myself son - we had

194
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,819
Diego student at University of Chile

195
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:32,400
joining remotely and young local

196
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:39,090
colleague Juan Carlos locally in

197
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:40,829
Singapore and Ryan from Japan and we

198
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:43,050
mostly worked on the open-source

199
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,180
implementation of shake which is called

200
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:49,680
open shake and is available in github

201
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,140
the link is available here but we also

202
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,410
worked some of us also worked on an

203
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,920
other implementation so the hackathon

204
00:10:55,410 --> 00:11:01,250
goals was to advance the implementation

205
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:04,229
of shake in the open open source

206
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,290
implementation and especially touching

207
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:10,590
two drafts one that's a generic check

208
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:14,370
mechanism and the other one that's how

209
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:18,720
co-op is compressed by a check so this

210
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,840
well the two basis for the work our

211
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,540
goals were to clean up the repo because

212
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:28,050
we had quite a few diverging branches

213
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:30,120
before and said we did a lot of work

214
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,790
before the hackathon to merge everything

215
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:35,280
so will I clean rebel to start with and

216
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:39,180
then we could remove that code we could

217
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:41,339
rename files restructure the repo etc

218
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:44,750
improve documentation we worked quite

219
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:47,040
that on creating a better dog so that

220
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:50,370
people joining the project can

221
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,219
understand why how to work with the code

222
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:54,980
and how to run it and also we improve

223
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:58,010
functionality fixing bugs

224
00:11:54,980 --> 00:12:00,710
and already set up the trayvis

225
00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,800
continuous integration tool so that we

226
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:09,920
have a non regression testing automated

227
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:11,949
and then Juan Carlos diem and Diego

228
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:15,199
worked on the implementation of

229
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:19,340
University de Chile which we nicknamed

230
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,850
budget and so yeah great a great lot of

231
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,570
activity I think open shake you can't

232
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:30,110
read that but we had nearly 80 comments

233
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:32,860
on the open shake and you can see you

234
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:37,040
know the graph of everybody active oops

235
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:41,420
everybody working on the on the code 15

236
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,550
staff merging branching etc and it's all

237
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,500
converged into one source code one

238
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:51,109
documentation at the end of the hacker

239
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,390
op what we learn what's left to do for

240
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:56,030
the next hackathons on the the time

241
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:58,069
between hackathons I think we everybody

242
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:01,250
understood the shake specification

243
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:05,480
better by trying and meant it

244
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:08,120
we spotted in one interpretation detail

245
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,430
of the specification that right now we

246
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,320
say that the fragment receiver must have

247
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:17,630
an inactivity timer and our own pointed

248
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,420
out that in some cases Wendy tag is not

249
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:22,910
used it would be better for the sender

250
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,130
to have the inactivity timer as well so

251
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,980
that it can guess what the receivers is

252
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:32,720
being doing so that was a useful

253
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,690
addition in terms of understanding the

254
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,940
specification we spotted a missing

255
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:42,140
element in the data model that that will

256
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:44,150
help the future draft on that we spotted

257
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:45,830
issues of course in European chic

258
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:49,360
implementation that's the whole purpose

259
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:53,390
of the hackathon we fixed some of them

260
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,610
and basically we we realized that more

261
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:59,300
tests on idiot that's why we put it the

262
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:02,120
test automation in place and we also

263
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:05,959
need to be better at reporting the

264
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,260
issues and missing features and so we're

265
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:12,110
going to use the issues

266
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,240
of github better in the future and also

267
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:17,600
because now we have several

268
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,790
implementations of shake we started

269
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,680
floating the idea of doing an intro next

270
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:28,579
time and we'll see if this can fly and

271
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:30,670
under which framework that's it for this

272
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:41,839
one

273
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:44,689
questions on this so thank you very much

274
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,670
and Dominic if you can tell us about the

275
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:49,070
next topic

276
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:53,060
okay so this is a second presentation on

277
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:58,430
the shake compression and fragmentation

278
00:14:53,060 --> 00:15:01,459
draft so we're now in ref 22 and as

279
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:05,540
Suresh mentioned we we passed our ESG

280
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,160
reviews very happy of that step just for

281
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:10,279
the newcomers in the room I'm going to

282
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,310
spend two free slides just to remind you

283
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:18,560
that what this draft is about and then

284
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:21,279
we kept the changes since 105 and what

285
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,989
what's left and what's ahead of us and

286
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,709
then depending on your interest in time

287
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:31,390
we can go through the changes with it on

288
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:35,479
the draft since the last version

289
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:37,520
so sorry for the old timers you've seen

290
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,060
that couple times already but this draft

291
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:43,329
is really free drafts in one it has the

292
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:46,219
header compression engine specification

293
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:48,320
so it's a generic engine it is not

294
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,300
attached to any upper layer any lower

295
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,450
layer it's just a mechanism to do

296
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:56,689
compression using a static context hence

297
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:59,000
the name shake so typically this would

298
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:03,950
sit here below IP if you want to

299
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,959
compress IP headers the same draft also

300
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,270
has a fragmentation protocol and this

301
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:11,660
protocol comes in three flavors and the

302
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:14,390
free block boxes here we could have more

303
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:17,990
flavors later on but right now we have

304
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:19,880
free which addresses the needs of

305
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:22,390
various LP one technologies various

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,870
situations

307
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,569
and all the same draft also has a

308
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,990
description how you can use that to

309
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:35,200
compress UDP ipv6 in simple situations

310
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:39,510
where you have no extension headers and

311
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:45,700
it's fairly simple because UDP ipv6 have

312
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:49,270
a fixed fields that occur only once in

313
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:53,230
headers the matching is pretty easy and

314
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:56,920
the compression is party so I see it

315
00:16:53,230 --> 00:17:02,890
more as an example of how you write

316
00:16:56,920 --> 00:17:05,170
rather than a specification and just to

317
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,869
set up the context for this work there

318
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:10,560
are other related drafts that do more

319
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:13,599
than UDP ipv6 compression typically

320
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:16,240
compressing the whole stack about UDP

321
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,958
ipv6 and this gets more interesting

322
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:24,640
because now cohab co-op has address that

323
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:29,200
are optional that okay multiple times

324
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:31,540
that are variable sizes and so this gets

325
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,970
really more complicated and that's why

326
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,740
we have a separate draft for that and

327
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:40,180
the law is going to talk about it later

328
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:43,090
and then applying shade to various lp1

329
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,350
technology also needs selecting one of

330
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,540
the three modes and setting parameters

331
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,030
for the fragmentation and that's why we

332
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:54,730
have drafts for applying shake over sig

333
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,730
fogs that bind shake over lower one in

334
00:17:54,730 --> 00:18:04,450
and others in B IOT and we have

335
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:09,550
presentations after this one so what has

336
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:13,630
happened the the draft was 72 I see

337
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:17,590
review it went on the agenda on August 4

338
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:19,930
the agenda of the August 27 is detail a

339
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:23,340
chart which is the meeting between all

340
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:27,850
the IG HT members to discuss new drafts

341
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:30,129
so I wasn't all Pascal was there as well

342
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:32,580
there was no specific comment on the

343
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:36,640
draft at this point during this telecard

344
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:41,830
which is meant to raise critical issues

345
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:45,010
that would hinder the review so there

346
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:47,080
was none the good thing about this is

347
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,340
that because it was on the agenda for

348
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,780
this date

349
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:54,730
many of the IG iesg members did a review

350
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:58,030
before that we got quite a lot of

351
00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,000
reviews in a burst fashion in two to

352
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:04,410
three days before this meeting and so

353
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,960
the initial verdict was there were three

354
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:11,940
iesg members who set up discusses so

355
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:14,500
they were not entirely clear or happy

356
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,370
about this draft and he wanted to engage

357
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:20,370
into a discussion and the good news is

358
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:25,510
that these three are now cleared

359
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:26,250
so here the names of the reviews who

360
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:29,980
provided

361
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:32,280
reviews thank you to all of them for the

362
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,670
time they spent and the efforts

363
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:42,340
providing comments and and for some of

364
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:45,010
them in very manual reviews of features

365
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:49,230
in in the draft that they liked or

366
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:54,060
didn't like we got a few reviews from

367
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:57,580
people who are not on the IC board

368
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:58,210
namely brian carpenter who did the

369
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:01,659
voluntary

370
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:03,790
review got to hear about the draft in

371
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:10,600
reddit and provided comments as well

372
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:13,050
and anyway that's another one hiding in

373
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,899
this list I can't remember right now

374
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:23,889
yeah I think it's Rosalie who did the

375
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:27,100
SEC early review or J not and so after

376
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:29,710
that we well we spent nearly two months

377
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:33,870
addressing those comments we get a whole

378
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:38,809
bunch of cons and the the net result

379
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:42,179
just within a few numbers is

380
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,430
thirty-six comets on the source code for

381
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:47,070
the draft and about you know a few

382
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:49,470
hundred lines that were changed out of

383
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:53,970
three thousand which is the source code

384
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:55,890
for the draft but 10% of the the source

385
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:58,590
code of the draft has changed as a

386
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:01,050
result of this review so I'm very

387
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,149
thankful for the all the reviews we got

388
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,180
and I think it really helped improve the

389
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,170
document in various ways but I'm going

390
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:10,770
to describe later

391
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:14,460
and so we engaged in conversation we've

392
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:17,190
all the reviewers suggesting what

393
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:21,179
changes we would do and pointing them at

394
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:23,940
the Comets in the gate so that they

395
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:27,410
could clearly see what changes resulted

396
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:30,600
from their comments and most of them

397
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:34,520
gave us their approval and so we knew we

398
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,770
were fine by publishing the next version

399
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,780
as a result of this discussion and this

400
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:43,920
was all changes the free discusses were

401
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:48,720
cleared so now we're on our way to RFC

402
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:53,179
editing so what's coming up next push in

403
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,179
the R or C idea to keep today well

404
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,260
optimistic by saying today it's probably

405
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:02,490
going to be in the next few days because

406
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:06,059
I just had a chat with the RFC editor in

407
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:08,340
the hall and I realized well they helped

408
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,149
me realize right now we have tables in

409
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:14,040
the draft that appear as ASCII art and

410
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:18,360
they want this to appear stable so that

411
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,300
it's structured in the document and so

412
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:25,919
it is them doing the change and as you

413
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:27,450
know sorry it was a noticing later on us

414
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:30,660
doing the change in XML

415
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:33,270
oh it's establishing a new version in v2

416
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,460
that has a table which markdown which we

417
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:38,580
use for the editing the document can do

418
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,890
for us so I'm going to rip in the

419
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,550
document and make the tables appear has

420
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:46,080
real tables not ASCII art so it's a

421
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,470
minor change technical change on a

422
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:51,480
document not on in the content this will

423
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:51,950
give a few days maybe for custom to

424
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,020
provide

425
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:59,210
the review that he meant to provide

426
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:02,330
regarding fragmentation and hopefully we

427
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:07,190
can push that to our see editor in the

428
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:08,899
next few days pass that in January

429
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:11,780
speaking we want to communicate and

430
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:15,170
educate the community about check that's

431
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:19,370
the whole purpose of having the open

432
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:21,560
check code writing papers having

433
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:25,129
presentation teaching courses at

434
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:28,310
universities about check which Georgia's

435
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:28,810
just set up a seventy slides course and

436
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,210
check

437
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:33,730
that's material for us to educate people

438
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,530
about check

439
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,450
continue the open check development at

440
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:41,360
the hackathons and between hackathons

441
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:44,000
and evaluate performance applicability

442
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:46,100
and again academics have students

443
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:51,920
working on that as we speak and already

444
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:53,480
publishing about that another piece of

445
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,300
information that I thought would be

446
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:58,400
useful is the current uses of shake so

447
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:00,470
of course we have drafts at the IETF

448
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,230
using shape the ones I mentioned before

449
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,540
compressing cooperate check over six

450
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:08,720
four one nine baat that we're going to

451
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:12,290
hear about next and there are couple

452
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,540
demos that are being shown for a few

453
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:19,629
years already

454
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:23,389
of course UDP ipv6 compression or lore

455
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:27,170
but more recently the LMS UDP I'll give

456
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:31,370
it six compression overall was this

457
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:33,950
month I think very recent at orange we

458
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:38,530
show the demo of compressing the coop

459
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:40,940
headers over LTE M so LT m is IP

460
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:43,040
protocol so we're not trying to compress

461
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,980
the IP headers but just the coop header

462
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:47,840
or all TM and evaluative if this makes

463
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,950
sense but the benefit of that in terms

464
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,949
of power consumption and

465
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:59,330
airtime occupation and we had a demo

466
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:03,110
with Akio and I mean how can you in

467
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,260
Cisco had a demo doing SSH over with

468
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,189


469
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:12,030
under evaluation we have Daniel me go

470
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:14,250
with Erickson evaluating your ipsec ESP

471
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:17,250
header compression Rick

472
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:20,010
instead of building his own compression

473
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:23,250
specification just using shake as

474
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:27,420
generic mechanism in a prior to his be a

475
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:30,870
head of compression implementations I

476
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:33,210
already mentioned open shake which is

477
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:37,139
patent free originally we said it would

478
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:41,600
be it would micro Python and run on PI

479
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:44,870
comma PI comes devices use a flavor of

480
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,909
non-standard flavor of micro Python and

481
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,070
quickly we had so much we'd spend so

482
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,710
much time fiddling with the hardware

483
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:55,290
RAID Europe icons that we decided we

484
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:58,170
would run micro - on computers and micro

485
00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,210
Python is a variant of - free so we

486
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,700
ended up running passion free plain old

487
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,310
- free just to advance our

488
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,900
implementation quicker so right now the

489
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:11,550
status is that open check is mostly

490
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:15,600
patient free and that's what we we

491
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:18,980
working most actively on again the URL

492
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,280
to the source to the wrapper is here

493
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:25,620
actually private company has as far as

494
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,440
understood free implementations when in

495
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:33,449
go language - indeed for their high-end

496
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:36,360
and low-end of IOT devices university of

497
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,630
chile has an implementation in the

498
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,560
Python flavor of micro passion and our

499
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,050
friends that ride have been saying it

500
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:50,790
implements shaking right but it's not

501
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:53,639
committed yet so we're looking at five

502
00:26:50,790 --> 00:26:57,060
known implementations today and probably

503
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:01,260
a 6-1 coming soon that's why we think we

504
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:04,139
can start talking about Interop and also

505
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:05,490
as I mentioned scientific papers are

506
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:07,980
being published in check so it's

507
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,860
becoming you know more visible in the

508
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,650
community the first one here is by the

509
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:15,780
this draft code first

510
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,970
the second one is by some of the

511
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,540
district office and they're close

512
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:25,860
and the third one is by totally

513
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:29,420
unrelated to the she craft offers at

514
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:32,250
University of Kent in the Netherland and

515
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:37,190
so it's showing that there is a growing

516
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:37,190
interest in a community to this protocol

517
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:44,760
okay

518
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:48,540
so changes since the twenty-first most

519
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,970
changes are the consequence of the isg

520
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:53,639
reviews and a few reviews we got besides

521
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:57,180
oh yes gee I've classified them in three

522
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:59,850
categories the functional changes is

523
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:01,890
this huge ones because you shouldn't

524
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:05,629
expect to change the functionality after

525
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:12,290
iesg review so i've classified as

526
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:14,940
functional changes to changes one is

527
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,670
mistake in the description of our always

528
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:22,310
so it's not a functional change is a

529
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:25,320
change in the text that reflects

530
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:27,600
functionality but the algorithm was

531
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,669
intended to work the way it's described

532
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,129
now so the algorithm hasn't changed that

533
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:35,040
the description was wrong actually and

534
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:37,200
that was me rewriting it clean slate a

535
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,680
year ago when we changed the way we

536
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,680
describe the algorithms I started again

537
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,050
from a blank page and it's well you

538
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:48,240
wouldn't expect such a mistake to be in

539
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:51,060
the draft at this stage but anyway this

540
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,930
happened and thanks very much to

541
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,179
Benjamin

542
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:57,030
Carrick for spotting this and you know

543
00:28:54,180 --> 00:29:00,240
it's a security area expert and he went

544
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,490
so far than in the explanations you know

545
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,730
following the iterations of the state

546
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,830
machines and his potato mistakingly in

547
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:09,990
the details of state machine which

548
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:12,540
nobody else in this group was supposed

549
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,350
to look at the state machine did so

550
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:18,420
thank you so much to him this avoids us

551
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:22,230
writing an errata later on which is

552
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:24,660
always embarrassing if you beat this guy

553
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:28,110
in the corridors you can thank him for

554
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:30,090
being so thorough and I've also

555
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,570
classified as a function change the fact

556
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:35,290
that we rewrote appended

557
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:38,020
F this was some text that was originally

558
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:40,240
in the main part of the document that

559
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,200
we'd moved to an appendix because we did

560
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,340
not quite know what to do with it and

561
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:50,980
accurately so the IHG reviews spotted

562
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:55,480
that this was a bit fuzzy and they were

563
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:59,020
right so the so we rephrase the problem

564
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,430
that the problem is that two of the

565
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:02,590
three modes of fragmentation are

566
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:05,470
bi-directional protocols they need acts

567
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:06,220
to do selective retransmission so

568
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,440
because they are bi-directional

569
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:10,570
protocols they require a better

570
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,240
bi-directional link otherwise they don't

571
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:15,899
work of course and some of the lp1

572
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,720
technologies we are talking about are

573
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:22,440
not quite variation without what we call

574
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,790
quasi bi-directional so there is a

575
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,550
downlink channel but the downlink

576
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:31,659
channel is only enabled right after an

577
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,850
uplink transmission this is a case for

578
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,840
Class A mood of rora when this is kids

579
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:39,879
for Sick Fox for example and so running

580
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:42,639
bi-directional protocol over a quasi

581
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:48,040
bi-directional link is a bit difficult

582
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:50,470
and appendix F provided a solution but

583
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:53,110
the solution may not be required there

584
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,840
might be other reasons why your you have

585
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:58,000
the pureed up links like you have an

586
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,370
application that's doing a sending

587
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,070
keepalive messages and therefore it's

588
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:05,620
providing opportunities for downlink

589
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,300
transmission so maybe you have nothing

590
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:09,850
to do because of the application is

591
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:12,850
keeping this downlink channel open for

592
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,959
you maybe in some cases you don't have

593
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,000
such a place for any reason so maybe you

594
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,520
have to do something about and so we

595
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,250
decided that this draft was about the

596
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,950
generate mechanism for compression and

597
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:30,430
fragmentation and rather than provide a

598
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:33,220
solution to a specific case of specific

599
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:36,190
lp1 technologies we would just state

600
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,140
that we need a bi-directional link and

601
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,750
you may have to do something special if

602
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,960
you're running over quasi bi-directional

603
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:45,190
names and we leave it to the she cover

604
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,190
food rafts to

605
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,510
if you need to do something and in that

606
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:59,020
case what do you do so that is a change

607
00:31:52,510 --> 00:32:02,620
that I would qualify as functional the

608
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:05,410
second category of changes were related

609
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:09,100
to security considerations actually most

610
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:11,980
of the ISE review comments we got and

611
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,169
suddenly most of the discussed points

612
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:16,600
where on the security considerations and

613
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:20,230
we are not security experts this is nuts

614
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:22,780
the security community so you one could

615
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:24,700
expect that I'm not too surprised so we

616
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:27,310
did a major rewrite of that of that

617
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:30,430
section again we added more cases that

618
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:32,379
were suggested by security expert oh you

619
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,780
sure there is a known attack on

620
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:38,470
compression algorithms there is no NAT

621
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:41,800
icon using fragmentation protocols which

622
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:44,710
is this in that how'd you fare in that

623
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,320
respect in oh we didn't know so we had

624
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,870
to understand what the attack was and

625
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:54,189
was it applicable to our case or was it

626
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:55,739
not and we responded so again free in

627
00:32:54,190 --> 00:33:00,460
the free name is at the bottom also

628
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:04,120
security experts some of changes were

629
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:07,270
editorial one changed suggested by

630
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,979
Alicia Cooper was the change of

631
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:11,220
reference be normative so we had a

632
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:14,920
little bit of discussion with ration

633
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,650
what was best but we implemented that

634
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:21,040
change made it normative there was one

635
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:23,560
remaining mistake about the RC in 21 one

636
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,850
nine language which which was the use

637
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:28,000
the use of the optional keyword

638
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:31,149
capitalized

639
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,870
which had not done properly we fixed the

640
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:37,690
reference and we mature all appendices

641
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:40,389
were reference from the text you know

642
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:43,690
which is good editorial practice and

643
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:45,610
then basically we did a bunch of

644
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:49,060
improvements in the text improve

645
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:53,740
definition see proof descriptions well

646
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:56,129
yeah you can go over the list and that's

647
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,130
it for me

648
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:08,779
so thank you very much the Minich thanks

649
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:11,210
for all this enormous amount of work

650
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:12,650
that has been done since the last HF and

651
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:15,110
thanks to all the authors and all the

652
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:24,800
reviewers it's really an amazing piece

653
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:27,560
of work and yeah thank you that's so we

654
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:36,080
are perfectly in the timing so next on

655
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:50,330
our list is Juan Carlos LP whatever sick

656
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:54,290
 - Carlos Zuniga with sick Fox so

657
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:56,270
I'm going to talk about the draft ITF

658
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:59,500
he'll be one over sick and the

659
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:03,740
updates we we've done as well as the

660
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:05,990
five shake implementation that Diego

661
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:10,339
Sandra and Rodrigo have worked out from

662
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:12,890
University of Chile so regarding the

663
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,780
draft we added a few more parameters for

664
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,560
the icon or data fragmentation and

665
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:21,560
integrity mode specifically we were

666
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,860
looking at the the fragmentation mode to

667
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:29,270
send this to use cases a text file of 53

668
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:32,710
bytes and small image of 356 bytes and

669
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:34,970
for that we were relying on the on the

670
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:37,460
implementation that Sandra presented

671
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:41,660
last time from University of Chile off I

672
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:44,290
shake which was very very useful so let

673
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,700
me jump to the next one this is the

674
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:50,560
turkey picture that we were trying for

675
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:53,149
the hackathon as Dominic was explaining

676
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,790
in our case we were using the the five

677
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:58,970
shake on the device this was of a PyCon

678
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:01,900
device and the server side we were

679
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:06,470
running it on the Google cloud using the

680
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:09,680
tutorial from Marku from Google cloud

681
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:13,879
platform that allowed during the api's

682
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,149
to the cloud and it runs pretty well it

683
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,710
helped us fine-tune and find out a few

684
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:23,359
interesting things that we want to work

685
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:27,289
on the draft the architecture of the

686
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,240
code this is what University of Chile is

687
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:30,980
doing they are trying to do it modular

688
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,759
so that they can run it equally on

689
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:37,210
laura1 or seek Foxx reusing as much as

690
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,010
possible the code in this case we were

691
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:42,829
concentrating on the icon error mode for

692
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:45,289
the fragmentation the profile that we

693
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:48,589
were trying of course was sick fox the

694
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:51,349
device platform was vikon so the python

695
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:54,799
code in the application running on the

696
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:57,410
Google Cloud I guess if you have

697
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:59,740
questions feel free to ask Sandra or da

698
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:06,200
WA but order Rodri what about the

699
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:09,950
details of the software coming back to

700
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:13,220
the to the draft in Dominic I mentioned

701
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:14,538
there are very interesting findings and

702
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,140
that's one of the beauties of the

703
00:37:14,539 --> 00:37:20,690
hackathon in this case for us it was for

704
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,720
instance on the on the usage of the all

705
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,520
one fragment because again the draft

706
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,038
that gives you flexibility on how you

707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,420
implement it and this is related to the

708
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:33,619
downlink transmission that you were

709
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:35,210
mentioning Dominic for us of course

710
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:38,260
there's only one mode of operation in

711
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:41,029
insig Fox which is you send uplink

712
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:43,099
messages and only if you if the device

713
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:45,529
requests it can open the the window to

714
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:48,380
receive the downlink so we are only

715
00:37:45,529 --> 00:37:50,119
doing that at the end of every window so

716
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:52,430
that we can allow they all zero or they

717
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,140
all want to come back and for the for

718
00:37:52,430 --> 00:37:57,109
the last all one because of the

719
00:37:54,140 --> 00:38:00,618
uncertainty on on when it can arrive in

720
00:37:57,109 --> 00:38:02,750
the in the window we think that it would

721
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:06,049
be helpful to rely on the on the sea Fox

722
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:08,960
sequence number that comes from the from

723
00:38:06,049 --> 00:38:11,720
the layer two as information and then we

724
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,359
can we can relate and find out if this

725
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:16,399
is a if if they're all one is arriving

726
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:17,779
at the right time so this is not yet in

727
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,940
the in the draft but that's kind of the

728
00:38:17,779 --> 00:38:22,819
things that we we definitely want to

729
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:24,890
keep improving and fine-tune

730
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:26,269
same thing for the timers and and in the

731
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,519
header fields tried a few a few

732
00:38:26,269 --> 00:38:30,828
different files and sizes

733
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:32,118
and now that we're getting more

734
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:36,380
comfortable with this other application

735
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:39,349
the idea of Interop came up Sandra was

736
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,689
very keen on on on proposing this and

737
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:44,719
hopefully they will be attending the

738
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:46,368
next IETF meeting that sells so the

739
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:48,559
vancouver could be a good opportunity to

740
00:38:46,369 --> 00:38:50,989
and we're at perfect time right now to

741
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:54,079
start planning on how we can work out

742
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:55,459
different combinations of of the of the

743
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,369
at least three that I know

744
00:38:55,459 --> 00:39:09,799
implementations and the two radio

745
00:38:58,369 --> 00:39:14,599
technologies Julia hello hello jr. its

746
00:39:09,799 --> 00:39:17,179
you're on the you have a mic okay so you

747
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,669
rely on a thick fog sequence number you

748
00:39:17,179 --> 00:39:22,249
what you expected to so does that mean

749
00:39:19,669 --> 00:39:25,069
that you only suppose that your device

750
00:39:22,249 --> 00:39:27,109
is only transmitting sheik frank packets

751
00:39:25,069 --> 00:39:35,239
sheikh fragments so no other payloads

752
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:37,038
are available well in fact this is the

753
00:39:35,239 --> 00:39:39,079
this is information that you always get

754
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,989
from layer two and what we are doing is

755
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:45,109
in case the information is being used to

756
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:47,539
feed as seek fox function sorry a sheikh

757
00:39:45,109 --> 00:39:49,519
function this the sheikh function can

758
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:51,349
realign not only on the payload but also

759
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,209
on the metadata that is coming from from

760
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,279
layer two in this case the sequence

761
00:39:53,209 --> 00:39:57,109
number and then it can improve the

762
00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:00,199
behavior of sheikh based on that

763
00:39:57,109 --> 00:40:02,269
metadata but i think the question was

764
00:40:00,199 --> 00:40:06,650
what happens if a packet is interleaved

765
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:08,569
between fragments a packet or I'm trying

766
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:14,900
to rephrase what I understand is what

767
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:17,419
happened if a non fragment packet even

768
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,699
not a sheikh packet is transmitted

769
00:40:17,419 --> 00:40:21,709
between two fragments then to this layer

770
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,779
to sequence counter will increase but

771
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:28,969
there's nothing to do with fragmentation

772
00:40:23,779 --> 00:40:30,409
so entirely human interleaving yes yes

773
00:40:28,969 --> 00:40:32,569
yeah well I guess that depends on the

774
00:40:30,409 --> 00:40:35,209
application and whether you are indeed

775
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:36,620
support literally couldn't that become a

776
00:40:35,209 --> 00:40:38,210
problem with you if

777
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:40,970
you use the sequence counter to figure

778
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,980
out the shake fragmentation mechanism I

779
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,959
think she is asking us if you won't have

780
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,450
a prime if there isn't a lift back yet

781
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,160
is that right jr. yes that's right

782
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,200
actually that's what we supposed in

783
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:53,960
laura1 implementation that we could not

784
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,189
rely on how to a sequence number because

785
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,670
of that actually because I've

786
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:02,120
interleaving okay yeah well in this case

787
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:04,180
I think we keep track of the the the I'm

788
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,250
not familiar with the the way the Laura

789
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,850
sequence numbering works in this case is

790
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,070
sequential but and it's per per device

791
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:15,730
so so as long as the the overall engine

792
00:41:13,070 --> 00:41:19,790
in the device keeps track of the of the

793
00:41:15,730 --> 00:41:23,030
increasing sequence number you can you

794
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:25,190
can get it but yeah maybe maybe we can

795
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:26,980
discuss this offline and see if we can

796
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:31,010
solve the problem for bolt and one shot

797
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:32,930
okay thanks so probably thanks actually

798
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:34,610
for that question probably if you would

799
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,140
like to do this kind of optimization

800
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:37,520
then that could be discussed in the

801
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:39,650
group and to see what would be the

802
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:42,530
conditions necessary to use this kind of

803
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:45,950
optimization or you know because maybe

804
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:47,900
you can say okay if in this in to to use

805
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,310
this optimization you only need to do

806
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,850
fragmentation until the session is

807
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,120
complete

808
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:55,759
for example without interleaving yeah

809
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,960
that will be hard so and maybe there is

810
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,900
something to work on and I think that's

811
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,720
very interesting to have this work you

812
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:04,550
know maybe this exchange between the

813
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,959
different technology documents maybe

814
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:10,490
have a small draft I'm not sure it can

815
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:13,190
but maybe both of the drafts can specify

816
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:15,100
how that would work okay or have like

817
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:18,080
one common document that says okay

818
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,480
optimization of like using a sequence of

819
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,100
layer two sequence number four that use

820
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,780
and then you can have like a kind of

821
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,880
suit conditions okay what's necessary in

822
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,340
order that operation to be to be made

823
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:32,300
and get leaders sounds like a good thing

824
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:33,380
to have and just wonder if it's not one

825
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,300
of those things that could be in a

826
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,710
profile or something if if really we can

827
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,690
agree on a method where the layer to a

828
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,400
number is useful then it could be

829
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,920
something that goes in a profiles it can

830
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:48,260
be enough or some technologies can use

831
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,350
it and some not but yes I mean if it's

832
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:52,120
doable at all we need to to the queue

833
00:42:50,350 --> 00:42:54,250
which conditions like maybe no

834
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:56,020
interleaving and then we would document

835
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:58,390
exactly what you win if you do this

836
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:04,090
optimization right but the protocol

837
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:08,470
works without it employee yeah okay and

838
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:14,560
I think that the last light for me does

839
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:19,209
anybody have any questions okay so I

840
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:23,799
have one or two minor questions the

841
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:26,590
first one is do you think that for the

842
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:29,710
next IDF the the document will be you

843
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:31,720
know ready for like adopting all the

844
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:34,840
changes that have been made to the

845
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,730
general shake a document and eventually

846
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:38,680
ready for working good last call so

847
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,590
that'll be my mind my hope definitely

848
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:43,290
for from excited yes to have it ready

849
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,230
okay and the second thing is if you can

850
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:48,610
if you have reviewed the data model that

851
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:50,230
law has been working to just to make

852
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:54,430
sure that all the things that are there

853
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:57,130
actually my map to to to your to your

854
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:58,690
draft so that you know we know that the

855
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,550
data model corresponds to something that

856
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,260
is used and that everything that you

857
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:11,500
need is also in the data model took it

858
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:14,820
so okay great thank you very much now we

859
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:22,120
have Olivier first time at the ATF so

860
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:33,220
big stress so the quad is ugly they will

861
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:37,990
throw things at you ready everybody

862
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:42,480
hearing you've got 15 minutes so I will

863
00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,479
present the changes on Lauren documents

864
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:49,600
what we did since last ATF meeting some

865
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:54,640
technical points of that document and

866
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:58,960
discuss the next step with you since

867
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,460
last IDF meeting we had to draft

868
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,440
published

869
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:08,410
very useful feedback from the walking

870
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:12,820
ribs so we will discuss at rest after so

871
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:16,720
the changes in version 3 we sank so

872
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:18,760
Julian proposition we unify the overhead

873
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,790
size because we had a proposition with

874
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:24,090
one by to read and to buy to read the

875
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:27,790
depending of the size of the packet and

876
00:45:24,090 --> 00:45:32,310
we we try to reduce it to one bite on me

877
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:32,310
which is pretty nice on embedded devices

878
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:39,520
which mean that the the cheeky there is

879
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:42,430
no two bytes and one bytes is the whole

880
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:45,280
ID which can be linked to the law 1f

881
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:48,250
port for those who don't know law and

882
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,570
technology GF bot is a abide embedded in

883
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:55,180
the protocol which allows to

884
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:59,640
differentiate application traffic like

885
00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:05,080
the port on TCP computer or UDP computer

886
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:10,210
so would ID match that definition and we

887
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:17,970
we squeeze one bytes inside we did it

888
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:20,380
the ID tag the tag has been created to

889
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:25,209
intercession which we do not want to use

890
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:27,730
in law one but we try to keep it when we

891
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:31,420
had some space in the header so we have

892
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:37,300
faster recovery if we lose some messages

893
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:40,720
en but to be able to to squash the

894
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:42,820
overhead in WA bite we had to to put it

895
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,830
to the it size to zero and avoid using

896
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:47,070
it which is finding the protocol it's

897
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:50,549
it's still working so it's not an issue

898
00:46:47,070 --> 00:46:52,900
we change the tile size to apply baths

899
00:46:50,550 --> 00:46:59,170
which was not a good idea well this is

900
00:46:52,900 --> 00:47:00,970
it in register for there was a comments

901
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:02,980
that the padding value we are not

902
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:03,839
explicit so it's now it's not easy to

903
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,940
zero

904
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:08,530
we added some examples fixed exam

905
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,350
because there were some mistakes in

906
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:14,410
there

907
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:16,569
and did a lot of terminology typos and

908
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,118
lately toil updates so the document is

909
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:23,020
easier to read I think we still have

910
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,119
some welcome that to do and as she Liam

911
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,950
contributed a lot directly in the

912
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:31,630
document he has been made an editor and

913
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:33,669
we'll discuss that in version 4 because

914
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:36,220
there had been some discussion in ITF

915
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:39,130
interim so who should be editor which

916
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,799
would be hotel and as we almost all new

917
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:49,630
to ATF on that document at least on

918
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:57,359
current editor we do everything so what

919
00:47:49,630 --> 00:48:00,660
changing issue for it happens that we

920
00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:07,930
misunderstood something when we set the

921
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:13,170
tile bytes to 5 so we we were limited to

922
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:21,940
something lower than ipv6 and to you

923
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:25,450
which were somewhere like 120 1265 so we

924
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:28,330
were missing 15 bytes too much IPCC

925
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:30,839
thank you we had to change it to

926
00:48:28,330 --> 00:48:34,630
something bigger

927
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:38,140
there was the option to take six seven

928
00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,890
eight nine we with which to ten because

929
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,680
it fits

930
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:46,420
it's another feat to although I wanna

931
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:49,240
MTU which goes from 11 bytes to 242

932
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:53,980
bytes with lot of values in between so

933
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:56,049
it was a more efficient the whole I

934
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:01,780
decide even that has been fixed to I'd

935
00:48:56,050 --> 00:49:04,240
be a bit because at lower one SF 10

936
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:10,030
which is the minimum payload you can

937
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:14,020
have in u.s. you can only have 11 bytes

938
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:16,270
of payload so there is no room to expand

939
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,759
the whole idea anymore but we don't

940
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,270
think it's an issue if you have any

941
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,360
comment on that

942
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:25,940
we would be able to discuss it

943
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,460
Dabu top have just a quick question

944
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:30,650
Kalki Koechlin question you said before

945
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,620
that you use the f-prot for the world ID

946
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:36,130
and you cannot use the 8 bits in in f

947
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:40,069
Burton and hear you say it

948
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:42,110
maybe it was a mistake from my cell we

949
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:45,080
use a war lifeboat for the whole ID so

950
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:51,230
we have a bit you when life port is

951
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:55,900
limited to 224 yes a bit okay no no

952
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:58,490
sorry okay so yes good good question

953
00:49:55,900 --> 00:50:01,340
another one some effort values are

954
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:07,330
reserved like the value 0 and value more

955
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:12,160
than 223 but it's not an issue it live

956
00:50:07,330 --> 00:50:14,590
222 values for the whole ID - f

957
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,470
epinephrine which are used for the

958
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:30,640
fragmentation so you have 220 values for

959
00:50:18,470 --> 00:50:34,189
the whole IDs it enough ok then another

960
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:36,920
good thing to have bigger tires is that

961
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:39,980
we have a smaller acknowledge because

962
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:44,690
the bitmap size is reduced so it's right

963
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:48,140
from network donning capacity we

964
00:50:44,690 --> 00:50:50,600
included the multicast proposition we

965
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:54,740
are open to excuse it it will be in the

966
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,750
detail at inequality rafters and we move

967
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:59,060
back Julian from editor to contributor

968
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:08,280
since last IDF meeting there were

969
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:11,770
experienced IDF us who advised that so

970
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,930
is another view of what is a regular

971
00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:17,730
fragment so maybe it will help you to

972
00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,730
understand what were discussing about

973
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:25,780
okay so there is the Aloha one heater

974
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:28,570
inside the heater which is by the way

975
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:31,690
not aligned on that diagram sorry you

976
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:33,640
have see you cannot you have something

977
00:51:31,690 --> 00:51:35,860
dedicated to lower one we will not

978
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:39,759
discuss it there you can have some

979
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:42,510
option hearings it's example is four

980
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,770
bytes but it can be 0 even of what

981
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:48,370
Lawrence Tech need to transmit to the

982
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:52,720
network server then you are all ID which

983
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:55,299
is the airport one bite and you have

984
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:58,509
your Darwin payload which will be in

985
00:51:55,300 --> 00:52:01,150
this case the payload with two bits

986
00:51:58,510 --> 00:52:05,290
windows who we have four windows DF

987
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:08,350
count and your useful payload depending

988
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:11,970
on the loja one empty you it can be one

989
00:52:08,350 --> 00:52:17,770
tiles or more in this example Perl it's

990
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:19,959
323 twice why you did not aligned Aloha

991
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:22,390
one payload to the rule ID I thought the

992
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:26,290
rule ID was in the airport which is yes

993
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:29,379
Heather it's the initial an I change the

994
00:52:26,290 --> 00:52:31,779
presentation two days ago to have better

995
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:33,940
graphics and I think I made a mistake

996
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:37,380
through the law one payload should be

997
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:40,450
aligned after the whole idea sorry

998
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:42,600
let's finish and it never works and you

999
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:47,560
have a typo in the name of the draft

1000
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:50,319
yeah I had that a few minutes ago I

1001
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:51,910
change a master slide I think so it

1002
00:52:50,320 --> 00:53:01,650
works on the first one and nothing the

1003
00:52:51,910 --> 00:53:04,000
others sorry so next steps ipv6 and law

1004
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:07,320
did you use the one I sent you yesterday

1005
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,320
or the day before

1006
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:13,290
well it's okay I'll manage it

1007
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:16,240
[Music]

1008
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:19,509
it's my fault I sent two drafts of two

1009
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:23,350
documents so ipv6 and Lauren are

1010
00:53:19,510 --> 00:53:25,930
multicast technologies so we we try to

1011
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:31,930
figure out what you way to make them

1012
00:53:25,930 --> 00:53:35,440
work together so for that multicast the

1013
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:38,710
only links we selected the fragmentation

1014
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:42,610
mod Noack because we can't have all the

1015
00:53:38,710 --> 00:53:46,480
ICS answering to at the same time it

1016
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:48,040
will be a nightmare on the network so we

1017
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,560
have no real ability and shunned by the

1018
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,340
chick layer it would be up to the year

1019
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:55,960
per layer to have reliability whether by

1020
00:53:53,340 --> 00:54:00,190
forward error correction or whatever

1021
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:02,020
other Ito that can be used the coop

1022
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:04,240
definition and the lower one only who

1023
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:06,190
for class a device are out of scope of

1024
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:08,500
the document because each network

1025
00:54:06,190 --> 00:54:12,790
several different way to the crack

1026
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:15,100
groups but for the lower one meeting

1027
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:17,590
points for class II devices there is

1028
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:20,589
already a specification application not

1029
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:23,050
made by zero Aryans I think it's not an

1030
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:26,770
issue here and it will be an optional

1031
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:28,720
feature so if you have any comments you

1032
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:32,560
want to make on that please to them

1033
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:36,250
whether now or by after the the meeting

1034
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:39,070
or in the by email on the mailing list

1035
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:43,030
because it's it might be new on

1036
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:51,250
discussion on chick so we are waiting

1037
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:53,710
for feedback one side is missing I

1038
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:57,820
wanted to discuss you the with you the

1039
00:54:53,710 --> 00:55:01,120
device identifier I adapted already the

1040
00:54:57,820 --> 00:55:11,080
draft I included that proposition in my

1041
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:13,680
last slide but it's not here sorry so so

1042
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:16,660
do you have a practical use case for

1043
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,569
multicast already this is described it

1044
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:21,200
yes female bird which is not thank you

1045
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:23,780
made by

1046
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:27,470
Loen specification the relevant

1047
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:31,780
recommendation like the EMS EMS is a

1048
00:55:27,470 --> 00:55:34,970
standard many using meters they like

1049
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:37,580
electricity or water meters they want to

1050
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:40,910
be able to do fumer glide thanks to the

1051
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:42,890
LMS and not rely on law 1 meter so we

1052
00:55:40,910 --> 00:55:46,359
need Malika's for that because I have a

1053
00:55:42,890 --> 00:55:49,040
feeling that truly the amount of

1054
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:51,860
reliable fragments that we have in

1055
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:53,750
Sheikh today are for unicast but I also

1056
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:55,490
have the feeling that those those mines

1057
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:57,820
who produced what we already have a

1058
00:55:55,490 --> 00:56:01,700
capable of producing as well

1059
00:55:57,820 --> 00:56:03,680
reliable multicast mechanism and so I

1060
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,049
was wondering if we could consider that

1061
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,730
type of effort if the use cases are you

1062
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:10,490
know important enough for this community

1063
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:12,110
whether we could consider of you know

1064
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:16,850
start thinking about a reliable

1065
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:19,850
multicast for basically downstream help

1066
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:23,140
you want and they see some smiles is it

1067
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:27,110
all or is it oh yeah it's interesting

1068
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:29,089
ok so please come to them to the mailing

1069
00:56:27,110 --> 00:56:30,770
list and let's discuss the importance of

1070
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:34,850
the use cases and see if we are

1071
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:37,850
interested in having a new real reliable

1072
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:39,440
multicast fragmentation because sending

1073
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:42,560
out those fragments if you have many

1074
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:45,890
fragments and not having any reliability

1075
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:47,810
doesn't seem like a good idea to me each

1076
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:49,640
for each destination you will use maybe

1077
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:51,790
one fragment not the same one and then

1078
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:55,100
you're stuck for everybody it seems like

1079
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:57,920
either you do a lot of fake which is a

1080
00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:00,140
waste or or maybe you want to be able to

1081
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:02,360
retry individually in unicast which is

1082
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:04,460
what we usually do in that case and that

1083
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:08,080
would require probably a new draft in

1084
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:08,080
this group they would like to see that

1085
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:17,750
Julian on the on the mic yes another

1086
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:19,600
link so you have the mic yeah can you

1087
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,820
hear me

1088
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:26,450
ok so my opinion here is that I don't

1089
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:28,780
want to delay the she cover one document

1090
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,549
to be published because of multicast

1091
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:33,500
because I have this feeling as you said

1092
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:34,960
last call that it's not it's not yet

1093
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,059
ready in our mind

1094
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,849
Oh mysticus could be used in chicken and

1095
00:57:37,059 --> 00:57:42,640
lp1 in general so my opinion is that

1096
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:45,099
what we did in Chico valera one draft is

1097
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:47,440
a simple assumption that we could use a

1098
00:57:45,099 --> 00:57:49,960
sheik and Chico Valera one for multicast

1099
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,869
but we didn't get into the details and I

1100
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:56,800
think it's sufficient for this first

1101
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:58,450
version make sense I'm not advocating

1102
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:00,339
that we delay this document for

1103
00:57:58,450 --> 00:58:03,308
multicast am also getting that we start

1104
00:58:00,339 --> 00:58:05,680
doing a generic multicast work right for

1105
00:58:03,309 --> 00:58:07,660
reliable fragments so that later we can

1106
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,270
have some specs in the technologies if

1107
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:15,970
they needed yes sure but on the second

1108
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:18,420
step right yes a second step exactly

1109
00:58:15,970 --> 00:58:22,660
okay I think we all agree on that list

1110
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:24,730
great thanks so Juan Carlos just one

1111
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:28,750
color swing yeah I supported the idea of

1112
00:58:24,730 --> 00:58:30,460
a very much I'm very interested in this

1113
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:32,530
multicast discussion but I don't see the

1114
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:35,140
need to delay any of the existing drafts

1115
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:37,990
that's only topics for real chartering

1116
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,670
and and continuing the work defined what

1117
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:40,899
what goes in the rich chapter because we

1118
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:42,670
are talking about the rich outer and we

1119
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:44,710
don't have an item for a label multicast

1120
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:51,040
and the question is do we add add item

1121
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:53,559
for this yep okay so if you move on

1122
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,009
slide further yeah thank you for the a

1123
00:58:53,559 --> 00:59:02,680
better than slide you see that there is

1124
00:58:57,010 --> 00:59:06,520
no motor guessing so on the IDE we just

1125
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:09,848
put that under the new draft which will

1126
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:12,069
be might be graph 5 it is recommended to

1127
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:17,200
create to create interface and

1128
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:24,480
identifier following specification RSV

1129
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:28,359
is 72 970 sorry and Ric 80s 64 the other

1130
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:34,150
author discussing should be removed 84

1131
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:36,279
we add 85 86 t43 so if you have any

1132
00:59:34,150 --> 00:59:38,349
input for us on that we would be more

1133
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:41,260
than happy to take it because we don't

1134
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:43,030
know really how to to manage it we don't

1135
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:46,710
want agreement the wheel and just stick

1136
00:59:43,030 --> 00:59:46,710
to what RS he recommends

1137
00:59:48,249 --> 00:59:57,348
then the 10 for the last five will be

1138
00:59:52,880 --> 01:00:01,480
the IDS there is some typos left and

1139
00:59:57,349 --> 01:00:04,849
document cleanup to do there is a new

1140
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:08,509
chapter to add on the bidirectionality

1141
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:11,839
of law and Chico palawan like Dominic

1142
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:13,759
explained we might need to find a

1143
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:18,859
shepherd one day or another so if there

1144
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:22,190
is any anyone who's feeling that might

1145
01:00:18,859 --> 01:00:27,890
fit we would be more than happy to to

1146
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:30,380
accept Connie letter and we would like

1147
01:00:27,890 --> 01:00:32,240
some feedback before because we hope to

1148
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:36,829
put the document in last call in draft

1149
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:39,950
five or so okay so do you have any

1150
01:00:36,829 --> 01:00:42,140
question I have one comment about item

1151
01:00:39,950 --> 01:00:44,210
one I think that we need to include

1152
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:46,069
those that are in in this stuck in

1153
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,509
discussion so we can actually start a

1154
01:00:46,069 --> 01:00:49,700
thread on the mailing list and invite

1155
01:00:47,509 --> 01:00:51,740
Dave so you should start this right i

1156
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:54,140
will copy day for i can't even start it

1157
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:55,910
myself if you prefer and so we will talk

1158
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,618
about the IAD selection yes that's

1159
01:00:55,910 --> 01:00:59,328
that's a very good point because

1160
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:02,329
obviously you want something stable

1161
01:00:59,329 --> 01:01:05,029
because you're compressing it so 64 is

1162
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:07,519
good and then privacy

1163
01:01:05,029 --> 01:01:09,859
I don't know so 65 we have to look at

1164
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:13,819
but basically get recommendation from

1165
01:01:09,859 --> 01:01:15,259
Dave would be certainly interesting so

1166
01:01:13,819 --> 01:01:28,880
let's include him in the discussion in

1167
01:01:15,259 --> 01:01:31,519
the mailing list and ok so I think that

1168
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,680
we we have already a excellent candidate

1169
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:38,808
for for the shepherding so that's going

1170
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:41,210
to cause any problem I think so do you

1171
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:44,749
think that you'll be ready for a working

1172
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:49,309
last call by the next IGF even well I

1173
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:51,499
hope so okay and one last thing so if

1174
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:53,569
you have not looked already at the the

1175
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:55,700
data model from Mara home can you make

1176
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:57,410
sure to read it and you know to make

1177
01:01:55,700 --> 01:02:00,368
sure that everything that is there is

1178
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:01,808
pertinent to to what you're doing and

1179
01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:05,049
know that everything that you need is

1180
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:07,980
also their heritage okay perfect thank

1181
01:02:05,049 --> 01:02:07,980
you very much

1182
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:11,420
[Music]

1183
01:02:59,670 --> 01:03:05,860
okay so I gonna talk first about that

1184
01:03:02,830 --> 01:03:08,170
time model so right now there is no more

1185
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:13,090
data model because the drafts expire but

1186
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:22,690
I will renew it soon and in fact we we

1187
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:25,990
continue we work on it okay

1188
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:29,080
so I switched to coop

1189
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:34,089
so here the draft is is ready because

1190
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:38,049
it's in a eg and now so we are in

1191
01:03:34,090 --> 01:03:41,100
version 11 of the draft and go for her

1192
01:03:38,050 --> 01:03:41,100
now and wicked wanderson

1193
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:50,290
okay so during last year if we move from

1194
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:55,420
v9 to v 11 and we make some editorial

1195
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:58,360
change to comply with viz format so to

1196
01:03:55,420 --> 01:04:01,360
be so the dreyfus will is compatible

1197
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:04,900
with bc p 14 we also modified the

1198
01:04:01,360 --> 01:04:09,430
abstract to be more precise on what we

1199
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:14,100
are doing and we also changed reference

1200
01:04:09,430 --> 01:04:18,279
because ask or move from draft to to RFC

1201
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:21,970
so it has been submitted for edgy for

1202
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:27,370
publication and now we are expecting a

1203
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:38,740
return from edgy on on the draft so

1204
01:04:27,370 --> 01:04:42,130
that's all for this one well okay so

1205
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:44,229
just when we switch so just upload it

1206
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:46,300
also the datum the yang data model so

1207
01:04:44,230 --> 01:04:49,390
what you see here you're also going to

1208
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:51,490
find it on the under data tracker so

1209
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:53,600
before we switch to that a couple of

1210
01:04:51,490 --> 01:04:57,649
questions about your of the coop

1211
01:04:53,600 --> 01:05:02,420
draft so it is so Pascal is the shepherd

1212
01:04:57,650 --> 01:05:06,350
the reviewers so next step on on on this

1213
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:13,670
one it is then going to be reviewed by

1214
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:25,970
the 80s and it since it's in in stores

1215
01:05:13,670 --> 01:05:28,490
hands yeah yeah that's the description

1216
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:31,459
as I said before it's in my queue and I

1217
01:05:28,490 --> 01:05:33,049
really hope to get it soon let's say

1218
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,380
within a month like before Christmas I

1219
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:39,320
want to get it off the ad well pal

1220
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:46,190
so you can work all the holidays and get

1221
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:47,870
it ready in January okay yeah so go back

1222
01:05:46,190 --> 01:05:50,680
to the data model so as I said just

1223
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:54,880
before now as the draft has expired but

1224
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:58,430
we will publish soon a new version and

1225
01:05:54,880 --> 01:06:01,460
so it was not useful just to renew the

1226
01:05:58,430 --> 01:06:03,620
number but to work during that time I

1227
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:09,410
walk a little bit more on the young

1228
01:06:03,620 --> 01:06:12,319
model for for chic so the idea is to

1229
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:15,560
reproduce what we have in the draft

1230
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,810
currently she grasped it's a table that

1231
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:19,759
has no no real structure it's just an

1232
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:22,880
explanation of what is a rule but it

1233
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:26,690
doesn't define formally word out to

1234
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:29,060
write it so here you have young model

1235
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,690
that describe what is a rule so you have

1236
01:06:29,060 --> 01:06:31,549
a ridy

1237
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:35,780
and then you can have ever a

1238
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:37,670
fragmentation information or compression

1239
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:40,790
information and compression information

1240
01:06:37,670 --> 01:06:43,910
is a table with fidelity and parish

1241
01:06:40,790 --> 01:06:46,630
operator on it and it's described on on

1242
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:50,270
this model so it's just a starting point

1243
01:06:46,630 --> 01:06:51,670
now we have to work more on it to

1244
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:55,130
improve it and to make it really

1245
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:58,940
compatible with all the young young

1246
01:06:55,130 --> 01:07:01,430
spirit young spirit but I think it's in

1247
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:04,270
in a good way and of course via

1248
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:07,069
Catherine L palace also to understand

1249
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:09,979
what we need to put in the rule

1250
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:11,630
especially for fragmentation so for

1251
01:07:09,979 --> 01:07:14,169
compression is quite clear because the

1252
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:21,319
draft explained a lot of a lot of things

1253
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:25,390
so so now what I say we need to have

1254
01:07:21,319 --> 01:07:28,670
some input from Sheikh implementers to

1255
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:30,739
see what you really need really need to

1256
01:07:28,670 --> 01:07:33,440
put in young medellín for young

1257
01:07:30,739 --> 01:07:36,410
community for compatibility with wrong

1258
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:39,199
model so as I say I will publish a new

1259
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:42,859
version with what we have done during

1260
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:45,410
the past weeks month and then it will be

1261
01:07:42,859 --> 01:07:49,190
a starting point to discuss on this

1262
01:07:45,410 --> 01:07:52,098
model and so my suggestion will be to

1263
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:55,400
put that item in the next entry meeting

1264
01:07:52,099 --> 01:08:03,079
we will have and make all the group work

1265
01:07:55,400 --> 01:08:11,299
on on this yes do you have any questions

1266
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:13,640
on that so that there is one point

1267
01:08:11,299 --> 01:08:16,219
that's really important here is for it's

1268
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,858
especially for the for the - for the

1269
01:08:16,219 --> 01:08:21,859
further technology drafts is to talk to

1270
01:08:18,859 --> 01:08:24,529
to the hall and and Anna may be one of

1271
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:26,210
the next interims to make sure that you

1272
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:28,639
understand that you agree with this

1273
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:31,549
structure so once we agree in the group

1274
01:08:28,639 --> 01:08:34,400
that it's good for us then we can go to

1275
01:08:31,549 --> 01:08:36,639
the yang doctors and they can say yeah

1276
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:41,149
that's like the way the yang should be

1277
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:42,799
formatted you know and make sure that it

1278
01:08:41,149 --> 01:08:44,420
also makes sense from the from the end

1279
01:08:42,799 --> 01:08:46,939
point of view but it's really important

1280
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:50,868
point to formalize this so that we can

1281
01:08:46,939 --> 01:09:00,858
have a generic way to represent shake

1282
01:08:50,868 --> 01:09:02,358
contexts so things remember so yes and

1283
01:09:00,859 --> 01:09:04,779
with this one we move to the next

1284
01:09:02,359 --> 01:09:04,779
presentation

1285
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:14,299
so we have time the mood so take the

1286
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,299
time you need

1287
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:27,149
okay so this is just a quick reminder of

1288
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:31,439
this draft which has expired

1289
01:09:27,149 --> 01:09:36,528
haven't we needed for capita ETFs we

1290
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,528
started writing this before I took

1291
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:42,649
active participation in the other drive

1292
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:45,839
- a craft which kept me busy quite a lot

1293
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:50,939
so just to remind people what this is

1294
01:09:45,839 --> 01:09:57,809
about it's about how using how to use a

1295
01:09:50,939 --> 01:10:01,410
shake to do om operation administration

1296
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:03,660
and management of IOT devices so the

1297
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:08,010
idea is to do the usual stuff that you'd

1298
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:10,530
expect with an IP network we were saying

1299
01:10:08,010 --> 01:10:13,170
with shake allows us to bring IP to

1300
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:17,730
these IOT networks and so if you bring

1301
01:10:13,170 --> 01:10:21,090
IP you bring a set of expectations from

1302
01:10:17,730 --> 01:10:23,699
the engineers technicians that since its

1303
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:27,300
IP we can do pings and trace routes and

1304
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:30,179
to get ICMP our messages for example

1305
01:10:27,300 --> 01:10:35,489
when a destination is not reachable and

1306
01:10:30,180 --> 01:10:39,780
so this draft is first a discussion on

1307
01:10:35,489 --> 01:10:43,429
what people expect with an IP network

1308
01:10:39,780 --> 01:10:44,610
and which is realistic to implement with

1309
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:49,830
lg1

1310
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:52,589
in the IP enabled networks so firstly

1311
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:55,050
needs to be a useless discussion what we

1312
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:57,300
want to do what kind of messages do we

1313
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:00,719
want to relay on the actual human

1314
01:10:57,300 --> 01:11:04,170
network what kind of responses or

1315
01:11:00,719 --> 01:11:07,980
messages we can proxy at the call before

1316
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:13,140
we get on to the constraint length the

1317
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:16,730
yl t1 link and and and then we'll work

1318
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:19,640
on applying shake to achieve that and

1319
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:22,280
namely you can do header compression

1320
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:26,750
pretty easy to had a compression on

1321
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:29,240
icmpv6 messages starting from the simple

1322
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:34,370
ones in our three four four four one the

1323
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:37,010
fourth over three so this is a reprint

1324
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:42,260
of a slide that I showed that long time

1325
01:11:37,010 --> 01:11:44,060
ago listing the various cases and asking

1326
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:47,090
questions do we want this to happen do

1327
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:50,330
we want this to happen so I'm not going

1328
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:53,570
to go again in this discussion since we

1329
01:11:50,330 --> 01:11:59,300
haven't worked on that for at least a

1330
01:11:53,570 --> 01:12:05,059
year so basically we suddenly expect a

1331
01:11:59,300 --> 01:12:11,360
few things to happen like a host on the

1332
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:14,000
internet pinging an IOT device that is

1333
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:17,150
IP enabled for shakey we expected to get

1334
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:20,300
an echo reply to its equal request

1335
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:25,309
messages we expect this device on the

1336
01:12:20,300 --> 01:12:27,620
Internet to receive an ipv6 response and

1337
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:29,330
now the question is shall those be

1338
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:32,570
propagated all the way down to the

1339
01:12:29,330 --> 01:12:35,630
device and the response be probably get

1340
01:12:32,570 --> 01:12:40,340
back with check compression or said it

1341
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:45,670
shall be proxied at the echo here and we

1342
01:12:40,340 --> 01:12:49,010
have to go through that discussion yeah

1343
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:51,320
that's what I promised we would do as

1344
01:12:49,010 --> 01:12:53,510
soon as the mainsheet draft is out of

1345
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:55,730
door which is going to happen the next

1346
01:12:53,510 --> 01:12:59,690
few days so I'm expected discussion to

1347
01:12:55,730 --> 01:13:02,980
resume shortly and again that was just a

1348
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:11,179
reminder of we have season ahead of us

1349
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:13,400
questions okay thank you so much them

1350
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:15,350
unique we have no question so what we'd

1351
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:17,809
like to do is since we have a little bit

1352
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:21,290
of time is we'd like to bring up the

1353
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:23,690
chat Oh text from the fine-tuned it

1354
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:26,870
based on what we just discussed so the

1355
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:29,750
two discussions the two changes that may

1356
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:32,240
arise in the Charter for one is the one

1357
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:34,810
that we presented earlier that

1358
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:38,809
we won't item one to be about

1359
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:40,850
maintenance so basically any change that

1360
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:44,000
would be required in the Schick

1361
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,580
mechanisms for new protocol for new

1362
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,400
above over shake so that's one change

1363
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:55,809
and the other change that we just

1364
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:59,120
discussed today is to accept new work on

1365
01:13:55,810 --> 01:14:01,340
reliable multicast which means I guess

1366
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:03,500
mostly for you know downstream multicast

1367
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:05,600
so there is this packet for number of

1368
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:07,640
nodes and some notes missed some

1369
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:11,000
fragments and we want to be able to

1370
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:14,960
recall those fragments so basically what

1371
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,590
we would like to do now is just share an

1372
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:20,300
editor session and agree with you guys

1373
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:23,150
on the tags that we want to see there

1374
01:14:20,300 --> 01:14:26,870
since we have suresh in the room let's

1375
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:28,370
just benefit from that and basically at

1376
01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:31,480
the end of these meetings we would be

1377
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:31,480
sending you the chatter

1378
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:53,870
can you make it larger as you can the

1379
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:55,790
National phones even more as you can so

1380
01:14:53,870 --> 01:14:57,559
the beginning doesn't change much and

1381
01:14:55,790 --> 01:15:10,340
I'd let you know that the intro is just

1382
01:14:57,560 --> 01:15:12,679
intro let's go to the bottom so this is

1383
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:14,840
the point one do we wanted to agree on

1384
01:15:12,679 --> 01:15:16,219
this text the way it is is the Hydra

1385
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:20,120
challenge so that's the one where we say

1386
01:15:16,219 --> 01:15:22,040
what new bar / / shake so trying to come

1387
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:26,330
on so meaning that if the Sheikh

1388
01:15:22,040 --> 01:15:41,769
mechanism itself needs to be changed for

1389
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:43,670
need of our new bar description so I

1390
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,530
understand what it means but I don't

1391
01:15:43,670 --> 01:15:49,730
think like borrow or shake it's like a

1392
01:15:45,530 --> 01:15:53,420
good formulation of that so to enable

1393
01:15:49,730 --> 01:15:55,549
new protocols yeah new upper layer

1394
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:57,290
protocols or shake or something like

1395
01:15:55,550 --> 01:15:59,449
that so we enable them we don't define

1396
01:15:57,290 --> 01:16:03,380
them so the idea would be to enable the

1397
01:15:59,449 --> 01:16:05,750
compression of new protocols and if you

1398
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:08,840
want you can say other than Koya sorry

1399
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:13,960
other than co-op in addition energy

1400
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:23,210
upper layer protocols other than coop /

1401
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:27,380
shake I mean you want to see other than

1402
01:16:23,210 --> 01:16:29,570
coop written or in addition or do you

1403
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:31,280
want white a point on of pointing I

1404
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:34,969
guess like we have already coop right

1405
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:36,980
right so I you can just leave it as as

1406
01:16:34,969 --> 01:16:39,620
if you want you know how to put a - just

1407
01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:41,809
say or for upper layer protocols over

1408
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:43,489
chicken I can explain if somebody asks

1409
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:45,500
like it's like other than quad since we

1410
01:16:43,489 --> 01:16:47,000
did it I thought like you'll just avoid

1411
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,949
a question but it's fine it's not a big

1412
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:52,070
deal so the sentence is a bit awkward

1413
01:16:48,949 --> 01:16:55,509
now in including standard tracks

1414
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:55,509
document to enable other

1415
01:16:56,180 --> 01:17:04,050
including stun attract keep including

1416
01:16:58,949 --> 01:17:06,030
but move stock Pascal I think you can

1417
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:07,949
just leave odds channel track that's it

1418
01:17:06,030 --> 01:17:11,219
you can say chic maintenance including

1419
01:17:07,949 --> 01:17:11,580
enabling upper layer protocols or that's

1420
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:18,480
it

1421
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:21,269
okay so that's item one well I don't

1422
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:23,519
quite like the upper layer protocol over

1423
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:26,850
shake it looks like you're changing your

1424
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,830
protocol to enable it to run over shake

1425
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:34,050
it anybody makes a compression the

1426
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:37,199
compression of any compression it's not

1427
01:17:34,050 --> 01:17:41,030
just compression so chic mechanisms chic

1428
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:44,910
mechanisms for new upper layer protocols

1429
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:50,130
well technically it's mostly compression

1430
01:17:44,910 --> 01:17:51,540
there's nothing in fragmentation well

1431
01:17:50,130 --> 01:17:53,160
the first thing we're gonna do is a poly

1432
01:17:51,540 --> 01:18:04,230
a protocol which needs which needs

1433
01:17:53,160 --> 01:18:06,150
reliable fragments but okay so item two

1434
01:18:04,230 --> 01:18:08,190
I'll do are we in ninety five time one

1435
01:18:06,150 --> 01:18:09,389
is there so we all know what we want to

1436
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:11,009
do there it's just that is it

1437
01:18:09,390 --> 01:18:16,290
you know understandable from the

1438
01:18:11,010 --> 01:18:18,719
perspective of Deadshot JoJo's from

1439
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:30,330
Jabbar should propose other upper layer

1440
01:18:18,719 --> 01:18:34,320
one co-op that what's the point of keep

1441
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:38,250
it simple so let's move to item two and

1442
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:40,559
I can to would be about new stuff

1443
01:18:38,250 --> 01:18:42,630
attract work for reliable multicast

1444
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:46,290
don't stream enabled it went again so do

1445
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:49,650
we want to so it's a ten well yes in the

1446
01:18:46,290 --> 01:18:54,980
Middle East we need to insert it start

1447
01:18:49,650 --> 01:18:54,980
track the command to provide reliable

1448
01:18:55,280 --> 01:19:06,590
fragment multicast we're able because

1449
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:10,570
yes we have yes we want reliable

1450
01:19:06,590 --> 01:19:10,570
multicast for downstream fragments

1451
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:28,190
photon stream fragments yep does that

1452
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:30,590
work yes no hope I'm not sure really

1453
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:33,019
bullies I think it's too strong because

1454
01:19:30,590 --> 01:19:35,480
you can imagine a group or you say only

1455
01:19:33,020 --> 01:19:39,080
90 percent of the device can receive

1456
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:40,759
this so it's not variable but it's so on

1457
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:45,950
we never walk on whiticus so for me

1458
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:48,380
multicast alone will be better yeah but

1459
01:19:45,950 --> 01:19:51,200
we already a frantic as for unreliable

1460
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:52,520
music we never tested just using the

1461
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:56,179
radio to multicast we don't take every

1462
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:57,380
try it so I mean it's kind of already

1463
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,600
there will you have it in the loja

1464
01:19:57,380 --> 01:20:03,140
document issue like so

1465
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:05,150
so maybe recoverable or something so

1466
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:07,280
what really needed is something to

1467
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:11,420
recover some missing fragments right but

1468
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:12,370
but in a multicast fashion you know the

1469
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:15,290
address

1470
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:17,809
Eugenia speaking I want to this is a

1471
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:19,820
fragment every because if you use

1472
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:21,590
forward error correction you will not

1473
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:25,219
have out from under it but we you will

1474
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:27,290
have the upper message delivered so you

1475
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:31,070
don't you don't want necessary all five

1476
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:34,640
months to be received by the by the

1477
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:39,049
device actually that's what the upper

1478
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:41,840
layer has its own for what they are

1479
01:20:39,050 --> 01:20:45,440
collection or something right if you do

1480
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:48,140
that you say you had an overhead of 10%

1481
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,629
each messages so you can it's like

1482
01:20:48,140 --> 01:20:53,000
ridiculous 10% so you don't want to put

1483
01:20:50,630 --> 01:20:54,950
multicast fragment delivery it's not

1484
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:59,510
because you can lose fragments so you

1485
01:20:54,950 --> 01:21:02,030
it's same the color the algorithm but if

1486
01:20:59,510 --> 01:21:05,239
you have some recollection that you poly

1487
01:21:02,030 --> 01:21:07,340
here I mean then you don't need us you

1488
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:08,809
can use the unreliable fragment and put

1489
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:10,430
as much focus you need at the upper

1490
01:21:08,810 --> 01:21:12,739
layer give it but then there's no need

1491
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:13,560
for us to do any work do you do you know

1492
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:17,099
today that

1493
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:19,170
the readability tests don't link on

1494
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:22,620
cheek will not use forward error

1495
01:21:19,170 --> 01:21:24,420
correction do you know it today so you

1496
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:26,550
can't put that here but all I'm saying

1497
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:29,640
is if you if you have if if you want the

1498
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:31,830
defect to be part of cheek then we need

1499
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:33,780
to standardize it a sharpie if you want

1500
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:36,000
effect to be at the upper layer because

1501
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:38,750
you have redundancy on something then

1502
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:46,470
it's not that is not what everything is

1503
01:21:38,750 --> 01:21:49,140
we can use if we can use several meter

1504
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:52,170
to achieve multicast fragment delivery

1505
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:55,950
and she clear-- one of them might be I

1506
01:21:52,170 --> 01:21:57,660
don't know for whatever correction it's

1507
01:21:55,950 --> 01:22:00,830
part of making it more reliable right

1508
01:21:57,660 --> 01:22:03,389
yeah but if you lose if you do for our

1509
01:22:00,830 --> 01:22:05,880
collection you can allow losing

1510
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:08,190
fragments yeah you are putting that you

1511
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:10,410
want to provide a multicast I'm on

1512
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:13,320
delivery but we can lose them so I think

1513
01:22:10,410 --> 01:22:15,450
we should remove reliable delivery of

1514
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:17,160
fragmented packets maybe because that

1515
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:19,110
doesn't include that the fragments are

1516
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:21,660
are recovered but the packet itself is

1517
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:30,650
reliably Apogee it's not random variable

1518
01:22:21,660 --> 01:22:30,650
delivery of mode of a fragmented packet

1519
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:40,430
various packets of multicast did the

1520
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:40,430
most remote guess somewhere

1521
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:57,119
and to conquer this when you get here

1522
01:22:54,210 --> 01:23:01,199
I'm not it's getting confusing every

1523
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:05,789
time yes I'm not sure that's coping and

1524
01:23:01,199 --> 01:23:08,219
I'd like to concede it a bit more sorry

1525
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:10,369
so I want I wonder if we want to also

1526
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:13,949
address security of the multicast

1527
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:16,230
channel so I think you've got longer but

1528
01:23:13,949 --> 01:23:17,460
it didn't address like Lana's point I'd

1529
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:21,690
like because Lana's point still remains

1530
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:23,610
it's not reliable so so the intent is to

1531
01:23:21,690 --> 01:23:24,989
have some kind of acknowledged mechanism

1532
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:26,308
is that what you're looking for like if

1533
01:23:24,989 --> 01:23:29,039
you have some idea of like you know how

1534
01:23:26,309 --> 01:23:30,480
this is gonna look like we don't have a

1535
01:23:29,039 --> 01:23:32,909
nature if it's acknowledgment or

1536
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:34,619
whatever correction of an ibrid arc or

1537
01:23:32,909 --> 01:23:36,269
anything like that

1538
01:23:34,619 --> 01:23:38,190
the bottom line would be we want to

1539
01:23:36,270 --> 01:23:40,619
improve the reliability of the mountain

1540
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:42,419
I think like that's kind of this right

1541
01:23:40,619 --> 01:23:45,150
like standard stack document that like

1542
01:23:42,420 --> 01:23:46,770
you know provides an improved mechanism

1543
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:55,348
for delivery do provide improve

1544
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:57,059
reliability it's wrong off to take sir I

1545
01:23:55,349 --> 01:23:57,840
didn't catch what you said can you

1546
01:23:57,059 --> 01:23:59,639
please repeat

1547
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,949
so that provide an improved making it up

1548
01:23:59,639 --> 01:24:08,730
for that describes an improvement

1549
01:24:01,949 --> 01:24:10,650
mechanism for increasing ISM so we go

1550
01:24:08,730 --> 01:24:12,449
through this long but at least address

1551
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:14,009
this is fine right like so that's kind

1552
01:24:12,449 --> 01:24:16,530
of our suggesting I there's no easy

1553
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:18,000
formulation for this right because it's

1554
01:24:16,530 --> 01:24:22,139
not reliable but we already have

1555
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:23,969
multicast delivery so it's a very small

1556
01:24:22,139 --> 01:24:25,469
niche right but you're trying to fill

1557
01:24:23,969 --> 01:24:28,170
because at the end end result it's not

1558
01:24:25,469 --> 01:24:31,670
going to be fully reliable either right

1559
01:24:28,170 --> 01:24:35,210
so we want a more reliable delivery of

1560
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:37,650
multicast packets that go fragmented

1561
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:41,159
yeah but it's long - so like I'm just

1562
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:42,920
saying it the the problem areas niche so

1563
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:45,839
you're not gonna have like a easy

1564
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:47,219
statement of this right so I think like

1565
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:48,599
you know just describe what you wanna do

1566
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:51,300
just say like try to improve the

1567
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:52,980
reliability of multicast fragment

1568
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:58,949
delivery that's that's really what

1569
01:24:52,980 --> 01:25:01,049
you're trying to do improve the delivery

1570
01:24:58,949 --> 01:25:03,989
of multicast packets that are fragmented

1571
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:08,590
right mechanism

1572
01:25:03,989 --> 01:25:16,079
to improve the delivery improve the

1573
01:25:08,590 --> 01:25:16,079
reliability delivering multicast packets

1574
01:25:16,380 --> 01:25:23,679
reliability of delivering multicast

1575
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:25,420
packets Lauren did that work for you all

1576
01:25:23,679 --> 01:25:27,729
right it's missing the fragment because

1577
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:36,219
if it's not fragmented that is a

1578
01:25:27,729 --> 01:25:37,840
multicast fragments well now we are back

1579
01:25:36,219 --> 01:25:39,729
to LEDs primary which is it's not the

1580
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:45,249
fragment that we want to so it's the

1581
01:25:39,729 --> 01:25:48,099
fragmented packet of fragment sheet

1582
01:25:45,249 --> 01:25:50,380
multicast packets something we take ap

1583
01:25:48,099 --> 01:25:52,659
packets and then we compress them so if

1584
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:54,699
we have an IP multicast packet then we

1585
01:25:52,659 --> 01:25:56,070
have to improve the way with the

1586
01:25:54,699 --> 01:26:02,079
riverbeast

1587
01:25:56,070 --> 01:26:08,889
so sentence here which I will keep so I

1588
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:13,420
will but efficiency more venerability

1589
01:26:08,889 --> 01:26:15,999
and multicast packet if you can see is

1590
01:26:13,420 --> 01:26:18,789
good I like it it's too high it's too

1591
01:26:15,999 --> 01:26:21,760
card we're not trying to achieve

1592
01:26:18,789 --> 01:26:24,429
reliable delivery of fragments we're

1593
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,380
attempting to achieve reliable delivery

1594
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:29,860
of data that just happens to be

1595
01:26:26,380 --> 01:26:31,360
fragmented yes and I don't think we need

1596
01:26:29,860 --> 01:26:35,469
to talk about improve the reliability

1597
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:37,839
because no one expects 100.0 percent

1598
01:26:35,469 --> 01:26:41,320
reliable reliable is is is a different

1599
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:43,300
word from assured right assured talks

1600
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:44,619
about you've got it and you got some

1601
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:47,739
kind of acknowledgment that you got it

1602
01:26:44,619 --> 01:26:50,289
whereas reliable is can include

1603
01:26:47,739 --> 01:26:51,968
statistical reliability now having just

1604
01:26:50,289 --> 01:26:53,739
said that we're not trying to achieve

1605
01:26:51,969 --> 01:26:56,079
reliable delivery of fragments I will

1606
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:58,570
now reverse myself and say that one way

1607
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:01,449
to achieve reliable delivery of data

1608
01:26:58,570 --> 01:27:04,420
that is fragmented is to use a type 2

1609
01:27:01,449 --> 01:27:08,820
hybrid air Q FEC such as is standardized

1610
01:27:04,420 --> 01:27:08,820
in RFC 57:40 at the transport layer

1611
01:27:14,469 --> 01:27:19,399
okay so final attempt like change the

1612
01:27:17,599 --> 01:27:34,630
multicast fragments to fragmented

1613
01:27:19,399 --> 01:27:34,630
multicast packets okay I'm done Thanks

1614
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:41,199
we say improve liability right so it

1615
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:41,199
gives us some some room for imperfection

1616
01:27:41,769 --> 01:27:48,289
okay so that sounds it sounds so do you

1617
01:27:45,459 --> 01:27:51,889
how does the room feel can you give a

1618
01:27:48,289 --> 01:27:54,768
hum on this on the second point so if

1619
01:27:51,889 --> 01:27:56,119
you agree with this formulation and that

1620
01:27:54,769 --> 01:27:57,409
and that okay

1621
01:27:56,119 --> 01:28:03,579
do you agree with this formulation

1622
01:27:57,409 --> 01:28:07,808
please come now you should agree okay

1623
01:28:03,579 --> 01:28:07,808
yeah if you disagree please come now

1624
01:28:08,469 --> 01:28:13,309
okay

1625
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:18,739
so nobody's nobody's coming so then that

1626
01:28:13,309 --> 01:28:20,719
that's that's good so sorry but yeah

1627
01:28:18,739 --> 01:28:37,369
okay we need to confirm that to this one

1628
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:38,899
on the list maybe we can have it so the

1629
01:28:37,369 --> 01:28:41,209
other ones are basically topics that we

1630
01:28:38,899 --> 01:28:44,059
have discussed for a couple of IPS now

1631
01:28:41,209 --> 01:28:51,110
so I think this one was the hot new I

1632
01:28:44,059 --> 01:28:58,280
mean the new topic that came from recent

1633
01:28:51,110 --> 01:29:00,709
discussions hi Carlos Gomez in Montreal

1634
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:02,119
we discussed also the idea of working on

1635
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:05,860
RTO for lp1

1636
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:14,869
so I don't know if it's kind of

1637
01:29:05,860 --> 01:29:16,848
independent from the points here or yes

1638
01:29:14,869 --> 01:29:19,518
I don't so yeah we we had your

1639
01:29:16,849 --> 01:29:21,919
presentation I'm not sure if that one

1640
01:29:19,519 --> 01:29:25,679
gets discussed further on the mailing

1641
01:29:21,919 --> 01:29:29,280
list so

1642
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:32,100
I don't know if we need to add this one

1643
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:34,769
also working as an item that we would

1644
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:36,750
like to work guys I'm sorry but I've not

1645
01:29:34,770 --> 01:29:39,449
seen enough activity right now to feel

1646
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:41,340
confident that the group wants it so you

1647
01:29:39,449 --> 01:29:43,500
can post it as a response who will post

1648
01:29:41,340 --> 01:29:46,710
that we said a the mailing list we are

1649
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:49,260
there we are desert geo discussion kind

1650
01:29:46,710 --> 01:29:51,210
of know and if we see enough noise on

1651
01:29:49,260 --> 01:29:53,190
the on the mailing list to support that

1652
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:54,090
we also include out you will propose to

1653
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,969
Suresh

1654
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:58,530
I've not seen so far that I would I

1655
01:29:56,969 --> 01:30:02,280
would not feel safe right now I'm sorry

1656
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:05,070
yeah maybe 11.2 to add on this one is I

1657
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:08,309
feel that with this five points we'll

1658
01:30:05,070 --> 01:30:11,610
have a lot of work for the next couple

1659
01:30:08,310 --> 01:30:14,159
of months I I did like your your work so

1660
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:15,780
probably if you continue you know

1661
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:19,080
developing the work we'll be able to

1662
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:20,880
include it next time when we if we do a

1663
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:23,840
smaller charter you know that I think

1664
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:26,070
that can be fairly easy to achieve

1665
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:28,110
compared to you know the points that we

1666
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:29,820
have here so please continue the work I

1667
01:30:28,110 --> 01:30:32,790
think it's I feel that is something

1668
01:30:29,820 --> 01:30:35,280
valuable and we can include it so Suresh

1669
01:30:32,790 --> 01:30:37,350
thank you thank you everyone this is the

1670
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:39,900
end of the meeting will confirm this on

1671
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:40,380
the mailing list and we'll end the rich

1672
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:42,780
are huh

1673
01:30:40,380 --> 01:30:44,880
thank you just when one point about

1674
01:30:42,780 --> 01:30:48,599
point four I think it will be better to

1675
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:52,679
put it after point one because it's in

1676
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:55,170
your bar and then the rest okay we'll

1677
