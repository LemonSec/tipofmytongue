1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:13,910
this region diversity the three together

2
00:00:15,379 --> 00:00:45,539
this is not reasonable this is not

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:49,409
really would that leave it to you to

4
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,429
yeah look at verse 17 you tell people if

5
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,429
they should finish short

6
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,768
[Music]

7
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,408
[Applause]

8
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:41,110
we have less people in the room than per

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:52,160
century that's the bet I so far

10
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:58,900
Association she should be coming no I

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:58,899
think we're fine you go back to the

12
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:36,440
finally told she would come right family

13
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:38,800
I so found me I so funny and I think she

14
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,800
will come

15
00:02:48,549 --> 00:03:07,010
this is going to be well it's

16
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:08,720
information just do nothing yes well is

17
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:11,209
that that was this very man so I'm gonna

18
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,470
go I suppose you're pretty soon will be

19
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:17,599
available after the session so we can

20
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:20,470
just grab some food and continue

21
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,470
discussing here

22
00:03:37,550 --> 00:04:29,669
just with the boy was it some was it was

23
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:33,300
about when do they stop physician

24
00:04:29,669 --> 00:05:06,599
recording yeah I mean cuz guess are

25
00:04:33,300 --> 00:05:12,330
scary literally okay so people welcome

26
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:16,740
to this audio session so the the working

27
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:20,340
group chairs are not here to to chair

28
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,930
the session so Barry and myself will do

29
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,619
this on behalf of the chairs so we

30
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:31,190
already identified note takers for this

31
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:36,090
session who will be which will be

32
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:38,479
Richard and Chi thank you rich other

33
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,479
than Chi

34
00:05:39,520 --> 00:06:03,560
so yeah okay so please take a look at

35
00:05:48,500 --> 00:06:05,419
the note well slides okay so as for the

36
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:09,020
status of the working group

37
00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:11,240
the focus is currently on finishing on

38
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:15,020
finishing the Charter items and the

39
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,740
working group items so the agenda has

40
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:22,280
been set up accordingly with a priority

41
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:25,040
on working group items so the goal is to

42
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,549
finish this milestone as soon as

43
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:32,000
possible the problem is that the author

44
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:36,050
the author's relaxed in finalizing their

45
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,710
documents for example the SSC Draft so

46
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:42,020
as a solution that shares will divide

47
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,840
the remaining drafts between them and

48
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,719
follow up with authors and editors to

49
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,609
close them out by the next IETF in

50
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:56,200
Vancouver so the agenda is as follows

51
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,620
reflecting the priorities we will have

52
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,380
three present a full presentation

53
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:06,830
relating to working group items so

54
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:10,190
performance metrics unified properties

55
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:13,430
path vector footprint and capabilities

56
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:17,200
and we will also have two presentation

57
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:21,860
on personal exploration work for future

58
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,979
outer use case is done by Luis to

59
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:31,520
determine service edge and to extend out

60
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:34,130
or by using bgp communities so as for

61
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,940
the working group progress since the

62
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:40,430
last meeting in Montreal so we have two

63
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,900
working group items that are well

64
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:47,780
progressing and the SSC Draft is

65
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:52,310
basically done the second working group

66
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,619
last call is over and all older working

67
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:55,610
group

68
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:59,389
items are very close to being finalized

69
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,550
so in more detail so the cross domain

70
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:06,470
server discovery is now in the RFC

71
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:11,220
editor view the cost calendar is in iesg

72
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:14,550
processing as for the SSC there was an

73
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,970
old working group last call data has

74
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:21,510
expired so another one has been issued

75
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:26,280
like a week ago and it will expire on

76
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:28,710
December 8th and so we look right now

77
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,299
for two volunteers to read the draft I

78
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:36,900
believe we had already identified some

79
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,968
during the last meeting so please send

80
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:43,620
us a notice or if you are in the room

81
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:50,730
and volunteer to review it please let us

82
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:52,830
know the CD ni f CI without so so a new

83
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:56,040
version has been published it's ready

84
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:59,190
but really needs feedback from the CDN I

85
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,099
working group so a message was sent out

86
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:05,300
to the CDN I working group to review

87
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,060
that document in that perspective with a

88
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,630
tentative deadline for December 15th and

89
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,849
Jensen will present it today performance

90
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,700
metric a new version was published and

91
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:20,430
Richard well presented today as well and

92
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,880
we'll see if it's ready for working with

93
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:27,839
Pascal unified property and Perfector

94
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:31,100
they asked they progress as a bundle so

95
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,900
new version have been published as well

96
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:36,450
Kai will present path vector and will

97
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,060
present a unified properties and we'll

98
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:44,750
see how far it is from working group

99
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:49,189
last call and last but not least we had

100
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:52,950
yesterday morning a side meeting on

101
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:56,310
application and network integration who

102
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:58,350
was organized in two sessions first

103
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:01,619
session with presentation and the other

104
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:05,430
one with discussion so the purpose was

105
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:06,270
to study how application and network can

106
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,199
integrate

107
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:14,069
to perform and perform gap analysis what

108
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:21,270
is missing on either side and how this

109
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:24,270
can help defining some work for alto but

110
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:28,860
also be out beyond Auto so there an

111
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:31,860
agenda was as follows so we had for

112
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,200
presentation one by ten cent on network

113
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:38,880
away five five g-cloud interactive

114
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,850
service another one by a telefónica on

115
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,200
integration of telefónica CDN with the

116
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,260
transport network another one by way

117
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,690
which was about application-aware

118
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:55,740
networking whereas Auto is more our

119
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:58,190
network aware applications and finally

120
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,350
we had a presentation by Richard on

121
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:03,000
application and network integration

122
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:07,950
possibility challenges and the next

123
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,399
steps so the slides and the minutes have

124
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:14,610
been posted on the mailing list and we

125
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:21,300
hope a second side meeting will happen

126
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:23,790
in during the Vancouver IETF so last is

127
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,529
there any other business that you would

128
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:32,520
like to discuss during this session so

129
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:35,640
yes remember the intent is to wrap up

130
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:38,939
all existing work items by Vancouver

131
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:40,579
meaning by Vancouver working group last

132
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:45,990
call is over

133
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:52,910
so at least so I'll hand now to the

134
00:11:45,990 --> 00:12:00,029
first presentation which is Richard and

135
00:11:52,910 --> 00:12:14,270
yeah and Richard you have 15 minutes

136
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:17,820
Oh minutes I will say thank you so oh

137
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:20,160
okay so I'll talk about the updates on

138
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:22,680
the alto problem magic

139
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,560
document and this is one documented way

140
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,900
which we got a lot of feedback and which

141
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,359
I think we are wrapping up I think we

142
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,579
made pretty good progress and hopefully

143
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:34,110
by this time and we'll get the feedback

144
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,980
from a working group and then we can

145
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:41,130
really wrap up so and that's oh I think

146
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:43,200
we're missing the top so basically and

147
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,390
here is the issue I won't talk about and

148
00:12:43,200 --> 00:13:00,150
essentially presentation board consists

149
00:12:45,390 --> 00:13:01,199
of you know how to fix it great thank

150
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:02,910
you

151
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,200
so basically I'll first talk about

152
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:10,140
updates and what we deep from version

153
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,180
six seven a syndromes from seven to

154
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:13,590
eight I never talk about the single

155
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,849
remaining issue which I think we know

156
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:17,070
how to resolve what would you want a

157
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:20,580
cocktail working group I now talk about

158
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:23,820
plan for next step okay and so let me

159
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:25,830
first talk about the changes that we

160
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,180
made from version seven to version eight

161
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:31,170
essentially between these two IPs and

162
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,880
really for people rhetoric of what

163
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,349
exactly why we're making the changes is

164
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,380
remember this is very interesting

165
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,450
conversation during ITF last time and

166
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,000
essentially is that time limited

167
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:43,890
decision point was do we want to have

168
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,230
the phylum LuPone metrics to be

169
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:49,140
consistent of your based on only

170
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:51,210
existing metrics based on impurity I ppm

171
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,100
so we have feedback and people from a

172
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:55,200
ppm they can you and give a very

173
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,450
increase or pinyons and so on and just

174
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,850
to refresh your memory or later bit and

175
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,900
on your life and inside is the outer

176
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:06,000
performs matrix example in latency RTP

177
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,069
and so on so essentially we have all

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,390
matrix over there about also matrix and

179
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:15,480
right-hand side would be all the metrics

180
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:18,060
defined by I ppm so therefore is quite a

181
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,970
details for example round-trip delay

182
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:24,569
active IP UDP and purity depending which

183
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:26,250
are seeing which section and so on it

184
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,610
was quoting the intensive discussion

185
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:31,440
about this topic and I think eventually

186
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:33,670
it was made quite clear of course you

187
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,830
post you in the session and right

188
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:38,050
session and the session was the feedback

189
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,670
was clarified that also really metrics

190
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,410
are really guidance they are really not

191
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,810
exactly what Apple for micros really we

192
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,310
did and so on so you're really focusing

193
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:47,199
on that what really central providing

194
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:50,069
only guidance only so therefore that

195
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:53,290
will solve a lot of these major issues

196
00:14:50,070 --> 00:14:55,870
so what we do and essentially what we

197
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:57,640
did is very simple and what we did was

198
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,520
to remand Cora fire that really the

199
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,080
automatic will be just guidance but then

200
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:03,340
of course that's really even less kind

201
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,590
of a principle which we took very

202
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,950
seriously but now the issue is there can

203
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:10,660
be multiple types of a guidance even for

204
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,820
the same metric for example a macro

205
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:14,230
could be delay I know for example here

206
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,790
four people can really maybe it had to

207
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:18,040
it's a small funds and they are from

208
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,680
Sprint and for example a guidance could

209
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:25,660
be service level agreement is I'm

210
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:29,859
over here offering all sub level

211
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:31,420
agreement and you can issue for example

212
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,890
month s mission and so on

213
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,810
oftentimes you don't update very

214
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:37,510
frequently Abdi for example as much high

215
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:38,589
chronology then I ppm would do but we

216
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:40,210
should have muscle types for example

217
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:42,490
service level agreement and worse

218
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,650
estimation so how do we solve this issue

219
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,940
over there

220
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:48,640
so you eventually let the session turns

221
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:50,800
out to be very simple and the way to

222
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:53,199
really solve is to allow multiple types

223
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,180
of guidance and you specify what type of

224
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,400
guidance you are really providing you're

225
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:59,020
not respecting the details I ppm but you

226
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,850
especially about that you're providing a

227
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,949
guidance and what a type of guidance

228
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:07,210
this for example what people can read

229
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,280
the tiny funds to allow so here's a new

230
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:12,400
tax and that was the version 7 and it's

231
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,160
version 8 and to allow to find green to

232
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:17,829
avoid finding green and information and

233
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:19,870
document introduced cost source to

234
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:22,270
indicate the high level types of

235
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:24,430
guidance which Otto would provide so

236
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,689
that's essentially they are solutions so

237
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:29,859
therefore we usually introduce these

238
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:31,090
field and call the call stars way that's

239
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,860
what we just saw is prime so therefore

240
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,620
let me go clean is a guidance it's now

241
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:37,510
other teachers and so on and then after

242
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,570
this one not turns elapse to be a little

243
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:43,390
bit easy and next step when you do is we

244
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,430
really define the details remember ITF

245
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:47,080
you can base bias optional and all these

246
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:48,609
requirements and

247
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,130
so therefore what we said was and

248
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:53,500
therefore the cost type which is a data

249
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:55,870
type system in our code and we include

250
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:59,710
use an optional optional extension field

251
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,750
called a cause source over there

252
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:06,480
so basically document you find this one

253
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:08,380
as a source and essential here to define

254
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,110
optional field over there

255
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,580
I know what happens is a core source

256
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:14,169
should be registered to a long extension

257
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:16,510
so that's the second requirement as the

258
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:18,640
essential second in the index introduced

259
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:23,440
optional field and making it fun to be

260
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:27,760
waste like I wish I am a red kitchen

261
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:29,800
right now I was a summation and one is

262
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,760
SL a so therefore now we can really

263
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,260
solve prom with this one and now turns a

264
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,180
lot life could be easy so therefore next

265
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,190
change we made it was also pretty simple

266
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,010
straightforward now and because we have

267
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:46,750
all examples and the so now what really

268
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,490
they are are the I ppm guidance and here

269
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:50,890
I guess I think really make a clear is

270
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:53,080
and we basically said will be put in

271
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,880
essentially we have of the COS source

272
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,889
but we make estimation as a default

273
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,900
value for example we did not even modify

274
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:01,030
all the examples we just say okay for

275
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:04,270
all examples and because there's no

276
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,190
optional car source extend an extension

277
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,020
field and therefore the cost is really

278
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,640
is an extension so therefore we just add

279
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:12,250
a comment so every single example we

280
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:14,650
said we could remember cost type that's

281
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:16,660
not included the record source field so

282
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:19,000
therefore the value essentially should

283
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,640
be interpreted as the estimation to

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,850
solve this issue okay

285
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:27,850
and given this one now really given that

286
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,679
we no longer dependent on IP p.m. we

287
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,810
also made a second change which I think

288
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:36,490
I should also clarify is we no longer

289
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:38,320
with all these when based on IP PM

290
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,630
I now we introduced much much simpler

291
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,240
representation of alcohol cost backers

292
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,260
for example here and we go see for

293
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:53,590
example we metric type value it's a

294
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:55,660
single Jason number and 59 section 6 and

295
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:57,340
negative therefore become much simpler

296
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,030
we don't know no really need to really

297
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,540
tie up with IPP yet

298
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:04,370
we can move on independently and same

299
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:08,500
for other metrics defining online and

300
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,840
document so that's what we'd be okay

301
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:15,620
the only potential complexity introduced

302
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:19,550
by introducing the cost source optional

303
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:22,159
field is backward compatibility so and

304
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:24,680
here is issue which we described in the

305
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,450
document potential usually introduced

306
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:29,420
file an optional course view the is

307
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,030
backward compatibility consider a an

308
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,460
information resource directory and that

309
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:38,149
you find to cast hype and with the same

310
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:39,590
cost mode and cosmetic a one-way source

311
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,780
of being as mention the other one being

312
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:43,520
SLA but if you're really backward is

313
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:45,139
that like old alkyl client and you

314
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:47,270
wouldn't know which one yes it's really

315
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,710
a submission or you really is SOA

316
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:50,389
because it's optional field we don't

317
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:53,420
understand just the other definition so

318
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,800
you can just skip and this particular

319
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,350
optional field Nadi and that's

320
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:03,409
potentially can be any issue and now our

321
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:06,110
solution the only define metric in our

322
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,370
system if I which is the standard based

323
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,040
out of protocol the only metric

324
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:12,020
defendant was cutting cost and we make

325
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,560
it a centrist that it would be this one

326
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:18,680
can only be estimation so therefore if

327
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:28,970
you use a new custom metric and for the

328
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:30,470
Newcastle metric and you otherwise your

329
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:34,610
every see just fine so I think that's

330
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:36,560
the only issue we try to solve and now

331
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,199
let me talk about the only remaining

332
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:41,270
issue here the only remaining issue here

333
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,700
turns out be very simple is this a

334
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:47,120
moment we have defined to cost source

335
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:50,660
types and the one is SOA one is

336
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:54,379
estimation which was mentioned last time

337
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:55,790
doing the idea 105 a meeting was maybe

338
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,490
we should really have third type which

339
00:20:55,790 --> 00:21:00,740
called a nominal type for example what's

340
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:02,410
normal type for example here use normal

341
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,450
type means for example for been aware

342
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:07,430
for example PC means that's really my

343
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,050
link capacity and according to my Dingle

344
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:10,850
a bow is hanging so the points got a

345
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:12,600
normal value or nominal value and

346
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:15,269
therefore it's all estimation

347
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,189
it's not really estimation the card

348
00:21:15,269 --> 00:21:19,200
everything from SEO is good enough and

349
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:20,789
good enough we do not really define

350
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
nominal but there's some other key

351
00:21:20,789 --> 00:21:23,759
discussion maybe if it really introduced

352
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,740
nominal essential is a very very simple

353
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,779
change we add a wine and most people

354
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,210
essentially for example in capacity you

355
00:21:27,779 --> 00:21:31,950
probably the most irrelevant you find a

356
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:33,419
central a fixed value and what so that's

357
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:35,070
what you capacity so that's the only

358
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:39,179
remaining issue which we won't get

359
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:42,149
people's opinions if any so here for the

360
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:45,179
next step and turns out to be pretty

361
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:46,949
simple a number one is for feedback on

362
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:49,710
the remaining item I know will really

363
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,899
talk to some people from I ppm I know

364
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:55,830
what we do is we're gonna some in update

365
00:21:51,899 --> 00:22:00,449
and if any if for example we example at

366
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:02,039
the nominal cost source type and then we

367
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:04,169
do everything by a mid-december

368
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:05,309
and then we probably can go down a final

369
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:07,289
version and people can kill last

370
00:22:05,309 --> 00:22:10,620
comments and we then we wrap up this

371
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:16,700
document so that's pretty much what I

372
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:19,969
have and any comments suggestions and

373
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,529
Chinua we wanna know cars are thank you

374
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,500
thank you Richard to take care of these

375
00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:28,830
work actually one of comments for this

376
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:32,100
is you mention one type where you

377
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:34,860
introduce this estimation and I want to

378
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,789
make sure it is affordable haver because

379
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:41,610
in some example you you actually make

380
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:44,700
comments actually you think if or

381
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,219
doesn't include a Costas also that

382
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:49,679
indicated is estimation does it mean

383
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:53,220
actually this estimation hyper is kind

384
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,039
of default type it is so by default I

385
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:57,990
think for example and yes so other

386
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,059
server basically is an optional field if

387
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:04,919
you don't indicate it and the default

388
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:08,250
value is yes so the application muscle

389
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,070
value of course is solution if you skip

390
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:16,230
it okay thank you so know for we do have

391
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:18,330
this people are bad yes you're right any

392
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,909
comments and any other opinions for

393
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:23,879
example should we do for example the

394
00:23:20,909 --> 00:23:28,950
nominal type or maybe read as well as

395
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:33,299
and estimation be good enough opinions

396
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:37,440
or no opinions thank you so for La Mina

397
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:41,460
type an interpreter as actually kind of

398
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,919
average or mean is I think that's why

399
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,450
the complete let's really make guarantee

400
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,970
right as typically you see all the

401
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:49,980
websites they really announce SLA I

402
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,600
think forget for the example we talked

403
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,039
to several people is it typical that's

404
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,350
really a so it's best one because I'll

405
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,600
tell you as necessary and as summation I

406
00:23:55,350 --> 00:24:01,559
think from let me show over here promise

407
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:06,570
that's good example for example so

408
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:08,760
typical visit and your publisher for

409
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,740
this information may be hard to use you

410
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,940
can essentially they are really like say

411
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,710
I need to pass all the websites you

412
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:16,799
don't have dates and so on and

413
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:18,539
estimation program I think this is the

414
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,129
mission they opted everyone Mouse or

415
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:23,940
every once in a while we don't want to

416
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:27,059
update every get a continue to really

417
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,350
like it as a mission I nominal what do

418
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:29,789
we want said we want to say is

419
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:31,320
essentially it's a value of which for

420
00:24:29,789 --> 00:24:33,840
example traditional like a normal value

421
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:35,789
which is expected to be 10 gig but

422
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,580
because that's really more value about

423
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:39,780
if it really not right and something you

424
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,908
should really take here because we're

425
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,690
Suze Orman guidance and there's no

426
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:52,020
guarantee about that but as a crowd

427
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:54,710
okay thank you for everything yeah so

428
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,240
actually the nominal value seems to be

429
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:01,320
more useful than the estimate to me but

430
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:02,820
anyway and it's a mega 10 gig and you

431
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,200
might me or me all around 10 gig I'm a

432
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,879
normal matter think that's why she was a

433
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,380
normal what makes a lot of sense yeah in

434
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,850
the contacts and I actually would take

435
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,409
that one as the for to be honest okay

436
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:15,510
okay what my actually point was like we

437
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:16,980
came the discussion we had last time was

438
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,360
because there was like some use case

439
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,159
where people actually want to use this

440
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,439
information on a very small time scale

441
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,700
and then like it would it be important

442
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,070
to actually understand how it was

443
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,470
measured and what the time scale is for

444
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,450
the measurement and so on and that has

445
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:32,370
like a lot of problems and like when I'm

446
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,809
looking at this light right now I also

447
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:36,239
doesn't seem to be in the intention here

448
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,500
so this draft say anything about this

449
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,620
about times

450
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,730
typical SLE is not really as submitted

451
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:47,129
as SLE you wouldn't give you the okay I

452
00:25:44,730 --> 00:25:48,810
think maybe I think maybe your question

453
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,790
could be learn to perform Union let me

454
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:53,460
clarify we're trying you're met for the

455
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:55,740
estimation is always summation yeah

456
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:57,720
Jennifer's clarify cell we would have

457
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:00,510
over there for exam I say basically

458
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,870
typical means how long is SOS ballot for

459
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:04,890
one mouth one day for one year and so on

460
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:07,320
second whereas I also mean for example

461
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:10,470
typically a you really have some kind of

462
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:13,669
definition and say for example you say

463
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:16,380
and it's really married in this way

464
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:18,240
contract right so the way we want to do

465
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:20,820
is the following is we own is estimation

466
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,640
and remember is in the cause a type

467
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:25,800
system we have a cost mode and the cost

468
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,660
metric and it cost source we also have

469
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,149
description I would suggest in this

470
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:31,710
moment is in Makati description which

471
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:34,620
often or fuel you give a link to

472
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:36,240
describe we are this value for this

473
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:38,489
festival and people can retrieve it but

474
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,750
we don't want to define go to details or

475
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:41,010
for example you find figures as we

476
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,840
defined for Mary every five minutes

477
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:44,100
seconds everything millisecond and so on

478
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:46,169
we don't want to go down that path we

479
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,179
won't give it like a coarse-grained high

480
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:50,550
level to use essential guidance that's

481
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,140
lovely session okay with you or maybe

482
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,520
that's this make sense but like it

483
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:57,180
what's your expectation what the

484
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:00,000
timeframe people will use here I think

485
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,650
typically or number one course is for

486
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,260
example estimation we probably expect

487
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,180
people to examine other up days mom says

488
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:07,920
that typically like people ugly their

489
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:10,740
wife said proudly up days like a day is

490
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,860
mouse is I think oftentimes a tip is

491
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,460
like a master every value for example

492
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:18,719
and there are not redefine degree of

493
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,750
course much longer often time they

494
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,790
publish it a long time so that means

495
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:25,590
definitely per like whatever connection

496
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:27,840
requests or whatever it should be stable

497
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:29,310
right I think that's a good

498
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,379
recommendation to actually write down in

499
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:33,080
the draft sure so we probably kind of

500
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,370
essentially you know operational

501
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,350
consideration part we protocol a little

502
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:38,879
bit of a quarter depends on the contact

503
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,770
well we recommend probably there should

504
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,750
be those relatives stationed around

505
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:45,810
values

506
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:48,660
thanks varies hi this is a loose run

507
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:50,050
telefónica a when you have mentioned the

508
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,640
nominal

509
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:53,800
the nominal value you have referred to

510
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,410
the bank with which is clearly let's say

511
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,090
an absolute value but I was wondering if

512
00:27:56,410 --> 00:28:02,200
for other cases that could be the delay

513
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:07,449
for instance we could manage percentiles

514
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:10,630
or I mean not absolute values but 95 95

515
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:12,790
percent of the time this is to my

516
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,860
question is if this also could be

517
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:17,370
consider as nominal value or would be

518
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:20,229
[Music]

519
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,760
yeah I think that's a complex of using

520
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:24,390
introduce a nominal value what exactly

521
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,360
it is and and which was normal which was

522
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:30,070
abnormal and you're right so 95 person

523
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,169
hell I up front I don't know how to

524
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,179
specify and yet I would introduce the

525
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:37,660
complex a over basing the complex that

526
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:45,370
we don't really get into is all these I

527
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:46,840
ppm complexes so complex multiplication

528
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:51,070
don't need this happen information at

529
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:52,209
all and but the short answer is I think

530
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:54,460
about that maybe I tricked you some

531
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,230
comments and you actually probably it's

532
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,760
a moment I think for me if we can give a

533
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,740
summation and we can give for example

534
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,390
some folk band amazing game normally

535
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:03,190
Allah was you don't help you find this

536
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:03,850
moment we probably okay with essentially

537
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,890
the only

538
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,570
panel is phenomenal value is valid and

539
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:09,010
what the label product and d4 to a

540
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:13,270
future document we can try to extend

541
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:16,510
more fine-grain divers like a richer

542
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:17,350
matrix but for later document okay thank

543
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:25,020
you okay

544
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:26,350
okay great any more question so sorry

545
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,770
okay

546
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:34,600
so we'll switch to the the next

547
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:36,270
presentation his own unified properties

548
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:44,080
will be done by myself

549
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:49,960
so this draft has been around for a

550
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:52,720
while and so the the current update is

551
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:59,340
not about the design I'm sorry

552
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,340
I try to does it work No

553
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:12,289
okay so at the last IETF the conclusion

554
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:15,440
about this draft was that it was very

555
00:30:12,289 --> 00:30:18,710
complicated and the introduction of the

556
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,580
features of unified property were so

557
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:25,759
complex and hard to understand and so

558
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,129
this is actually not the case as long as

559
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:31,340
it is clearly explained and introduced

560
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:36,339
so the major changes in the present

561
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:38,959
version are on simplification and

562
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:41,629
clarification on how to introduce the

563
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,679
new concept so the major changes are on

564
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:48,678
section 1 2 3 and of course we started

565
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,239
looking at some type of but that's that

566
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,940
was not the hardest part so in the

567
00:30:50,239 --> 00:31:00,080
meantime the draft grew even fatter but

568
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:03,919
we are now working how to make it simple

569
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:07,629
and concise so there is no change in the

570
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:10,549
design as I said but there is a very

571
00:31:07,629 --> 00:31:13,928
strong need to simplify the text so we

572
00:31:10,549 --> 00:31:18,019
opted for a didactic approach and

573
00:31:13,929 --> 00:31:22,729
progressively introduced a concept in

574
00:31:18,019 --> 00:31:25,039
with a progressive complexity and of

575
00:31:22,729 --> 00:31:28,330
course we did need to do that for the

576
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,389
rest of the document and that requires

577
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:34,879
substantial revisions so as a digest the

578
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:38,839
introduction has been made non-technical

579
00:31:34,879 --> 00:31:43,869
we removed every text any text that was

580
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:47,210
like specifying already things there's

581
00:31:43,869 --> 00:31:49,879
we added a we the second section is now

582
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:52,700
about the basic features of the new

583
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:55,189
United property extension as they were

584
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:58,159
defined in the first version of the

585
00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:01,789
document in the third section is about

586
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,690
advanced features for unified property

587
00:32:01,789 --> 00:32:09,609
so this section explains limitations in

588
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:12,440
some cases of using the basic features

589
00:32:09,609 --> 00:32:13,669
it also explains the risk of an

590
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,800
ambiguous

591
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:22,490
client requests and how to solve it and

592
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:25,909
this ambiguity issue was around for like

593
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:28,790
more than a year and caused some head

594
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:32,150
scratching so and you finally found a

595
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:36,139
design that solves it this is now the

596
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:39,650
new talk for the three first sections so

597
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,230
in Section two as you will see we

598
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:45,500
introduced basic features what is an

599
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:49,880
entity generalizes endpoints examples

600
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:53,510
what is an entity domain defined as a

601
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,700
set of entity of the same type which is

602
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:58,400
also defining the type of the entity

603
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:02,140
domain it also defines an entity ID

604
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:05,390
format and we give examples section 2.4

605
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:07,700
entity property that can be network

606
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:12,460
aware like an AAS number or network

607
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:15,800
agnostic like a geographical region and

608
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,860
2.5 new information resource because

609
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,590
that's one of the key points of the

610
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,959
draftees we introduce a new media type

611
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,929
and a new resource which is called Alto

612
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:32,290
property map that you can get half via

613
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:37,400
get Mart of your post lot section 3 and

614
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:43,330
introduces advanced yupi extension

615
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:46,070
features so we have section 13.1 that

616
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:48,649
establish the relation between what an

617
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,480
entity identifier and an entity domain

618
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:59,180
with some rules and especially a rule

619
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:02,480
saying that the entity is not the entity

620
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:05,300
points to a physical or logical object

621
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,050
but you can have two different entities

622
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:12,230
that point to the same physical and

623
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:15,370
logical object because auto is like it's

624
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,500
a map so the object in an auto map is a

625
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:22,819
identify so you have one endpoint that

626
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:26,969
has a AP v4 address and an ipv6 address

627
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:29,190
you have two entities because

628
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:31,709
different applications use different

629
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:37,099
address formats and so you need those

630
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:40,560
two entities so 3.2 defines resource

631
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:45,919
specific entity domain name why do we

632
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:50,339
need that because the PID for example

633
00:34:45,918 --> 00:35:03,720
the entity in which an entity which is a

634
00:34:50,339 --> 00:35:06,779
PID domain has any identifier like okay

635
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,379
here so that you can use the same

636
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:15,480
identifier in different network maps so

637
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:18,630
if you only use this identifier for a

638
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:20,520
PID you cannot distinguish in which

639
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:24,720
information resource in which property

640
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:31,380
map it is defined so this is why we

641
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:35,848
compose the entity domain name with the

642
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:39,329
resource where it has been defined for

643
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:46,319
example here you you you want to define

644
00:35:39,329 --> 00:35:51,980
an entity domain PID so and if you want

645
00:35:46,319 --> 00:35:55,319
to distinguish between PID number 10

646
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:59,430
define in two different network maps you

647
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:01,859
need to compose your entity domain with

648
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,040
the resource idea so here if you use

649
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:08,339
this and this you can distinguish

650
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:14,069
between the two entities which otherwise

651
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:17,880
you cannot section 3.3 does well

652
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:22,410
similarly the same we have the similar

653
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:25,230
issue for entity properties same if a

654
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:30,230
property is defined relatively to an

655
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:33,359
information resource the property value

656
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:38,160
can change depending on this information

657
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,470
resource so if you and if you require if

658
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,259
you query a property

659
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:51,509
for an entity for example defining the

660
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:53,640
ipv4 entity domain this this end point

661
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,740
can have two PID properties in two

662
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,049
different Network Maps two different

663
00:36:55,740 --> 00:37:03,060
Network Maps use this end point and

664
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:06,360
define a PID property so if you want to

665
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,230
query the value of the PID property for

666
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:13,560
this ipv4 entity you need to specify in

667
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:16,950
which network map you want it so the

668
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,850
resource here is impacting the property

669
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,560
value so and in the text you can look up

670
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:26,819
the text and the text explains how to

671
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:32,070
how to do this no comments on section

672
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:36,600
for that 3.4 sorry 3.5 will be in the

673
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:39,450
next slide and 3.6 is the okay yeah that

674
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:41,880
idea that this section 3.6 needs

675
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:42,990
clarification we are not done yet with

676
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,000
the clarification

677
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:51,450
it's about INR registration and so there

678
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,650
is a discussion regarding mapping

679
00:37:51,450 --> 00:38:02,609
definitions section 3.5 so this actually

680
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:05,760
solves that ambiguity issue we had the

681
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:10,320
use case like more than one year ago on

682
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:13,020
the FCI map capability use case so in

683
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,330
the initial design there was one member

684
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:18,540
on the capability you had one member

685
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:21,450
that was defining which entity domain

686
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,720
types you can query and the other main

687
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:28,799
member was listing what properties you

688
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:33,390
can query on that on these entity

689
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:38,520
domains and the problems is that well it

690
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:43,980
up actually you can you cannot query PID

691
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,259
on every of those entities PID does not

692
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,130
exist on country code it does not exist

693
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:54,030
on a SN how does the client figure out

694
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:59,130
so the solution is now to introduce

695
00:38:54,030 --> 00:39:02,070
a new member in the capability and this

696
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:06,410
member for each of the listed entity

697
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:09,420
domain types gives you the list of

698
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:14,330
property that you can query on this

699
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,740
entity domain type and it specifies it

700
00:39:14,330 --> 00:39:20,040
results depend whether it's resource

701
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:22,770
dependent or or not so here with this

702
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,890
design okay you can end up with very

703
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:30,480
long names but these solves the problem

704
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:33,779
in a clean way so and of course we

705
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,490
really need to simplify the text but

706
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:41,100
basically it appears to be very pretty

707
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:44,339
clearly defined now so there is another

708
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:46,319
work we studied on illustrative sections

709
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,550
as some sections do not provide any

710
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,490
protocol specification I meant to

711
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:55,530
explain the design and but they

712
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:57,330
introduced complexity and notions that

713
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:00,240
are otherwise not useful to the

714
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:03,480
implementers given that arif sees meant

715
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,419
for implementers so we also want to

716
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:10,320
clarify this so the next steps will be

717
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,460
to fix typos and errors that I detected

718
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:16,350
right after sending the the new version

719
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,800
continue the clarification and cleanup

720
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:22,620
and this will be required substantial

721
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,200
work we also need to make a last check

722
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,359
on the IANA section regarding how we

723
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,439
define mappings and many things that

724
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,720
have been that have been added in this

725
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,940
section and once we are done we will

726
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:39,689
propose it for working group Lascaux so

727
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,050
we really hope to be done well III don't

728
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:47,060
dare to promise a date but hopefully in

729
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:47,060
January or February latest

730
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:51,800
any questions

731
00:40:53,410 --> 00:41:02,740
I usually am premier so when you say you

732
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,420
want to I'm trying to entice again it

733
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,399
says I think you give a comment that the

734
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:10,090
current this document is getting very

735
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:13,450
long right I don't know 50 pages or some

736
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,220
page yes it's getting very long I'm the

737
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:18,790
one reason I think that God pretty law

738
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:22,330
was being caused a lot of examples yes

739
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:25,180
and so when you say you want to clean up

740
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:27,310
do you mean to really clarify remote

741
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,230
examples or I'm just want to get a

742
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:30,820
little bit sense about what you're

743
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,170
really meant to really for example I

744
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,700
think clarification of course because

745
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:36,490
always sense but when you see coming up

746
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:41,500
what does which direction potentially

747
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:44,169
might be really pursuing definitely as

748
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:48,340
far as examples are concerned I rather

749
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:51,100
tend to be willing to add examples we

750
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:54,070
need to add examples own abstracted

751
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,520
Network elements we need to add examples

752
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:59,050
on FCI

753
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,370
capabilities because they were the ones

754
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:08,530
who caused actually who who helped us

755
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:11,589
identifying the ambiguity issue and led

756
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:15,960
us to design this resource dependency

757
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:19,140
and more thinking about the text where

758
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:29,440
just the wording that can be really

759
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:32,799
simplified and so I think if there is no

760
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:41,760
question we can move to the next

761
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:41,760
presentation which is by kite thank you

762
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:55,000
name wrong so I'm time here to talk

763
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:57,340
about the auto past Baxter extension so

764
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:59,350
for those who are familiar and not

765
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,300
familiar ways past brand extension I

766
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:05,500
like to give a quick summary of the

767
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,210
current status of the drafts first what

768
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:09,250
is the motivation behind this draft

769
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:12,849
it wants to provide a what kind of new

770
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:16,839
features it provides so a in addition to

771
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:18,700
the cost metrics before endpoints and we

772
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:20,740
also want to review some internal

773
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:23,049
structures and detailed properties

774
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,390
associated way these internal structures

775
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,040
find the ISPs point of view for the past

776
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,730
between human said also stationed in

777
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,640
pairs and example is that driven that

778
00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,680
the tracks this chats includes water

779
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:39,250
negatives for NARS security and ethics

780
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,980
and recently we also receive some inputs

781
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,900
from other working groups that for

782
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:46,420
example like five GU Pierre functions

783
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:49,240
and also mobile edge computing and

784
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:52,540
probably service edges as well they

785
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:55,149
might benefit from this information we

786
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,790
provided and why this instantly

787
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,920
essential to the auto framework there

788
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:03,130
are two reasons first such information

789
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,210
is useful as we mentioned we can derive

790
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:09,940
resource correlations of flows and also

791
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:14,500
provide and also enable applications to

792
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:18,070
identify context in the in the path they

793
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:20,250
are for it and also these this

794
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:27,060
information is not included in or

795
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:29,410
supported in a current auto framework so

796
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:31,960
how does this extension provide such

797
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,940
information to represent internal

798
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:37,450
structures we introduce a concept called

799
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:39,640
optional elements which will give more

800
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:41,680
details about why we do this later and

801
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:45,730
then for the detail property information

802
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,368
we reuse the unified property map for

803
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:51,510
the for the for these optional elements

804
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:53,830
and to represent the path between

805
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,200
especially the entry in communications

806
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:57,970
where you reuse the auto base protocol

807
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:01,000
basically the cost map and end point

808
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,580
cost services where it uses like source

809
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,290
and destination pairs to represent

810
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:10,900
potential communications between hosts

811
00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:14,080
and so what problems we need to solve in

812
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:16,510
this draft yeah back to two parts of the

813
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:19,359
problem first when you consider about

814
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:21,170
some privacy concerns and then we need

815
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:24,500
to determine basically this is rate

816
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,839
to how we determine the representation

817
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:29,480
of our internal structures and first of

818
00:45:26,839 --> 00:45:33,078
course we don't want to expose the

819
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:35,869
physical properties of the network

820
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:38,750
elements so we want these elements to be

821
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:41,210
abstract and then there's a question of

822
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:43,010
are these internal structures persistent

823
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:46,430
in the network or they can be dynamic

824
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,049
and constructive argument and our

825
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:49,640
current decision that first we need to

826
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:56,480
want to make these natural elements

827
00:45:49,640 --> 00:46:00,319
abstract and then because first right

828
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:03,140
now we are making him to be basically

829
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,670
the scope of this idea of the end the

830
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:10,339
identifiers for this the elements are

831
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:12,470
assumed temporary in your query but we

832
00:46:10,339 --> 00:46:14,630
had a property to optionally expose

833
00:46:12,470 --> 00:46:17,779
persistent entities in the network and

834
00:46:14,630 --> 00:46:20,390
we also designed this protocol we also

835
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:22,940
consider some performance issues that

836
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:25,519
may arise when the developers are

837
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,650
building their servers or end clients

838
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:31,578
and one problem is scalability and also

839
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:33,589
consistency as well is the pattern of

840
00:46:31,579 --> 00:46:36,740
walk because essentially we are now

841
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:39,650
requesting information of two resources

842
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:42,979
in Auto for the path vector for the

843
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:47,359
correlate for the application error and

844
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:49,609
in part we need the resource of cosmic

845
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,980
or endpoint service but for the

846
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:53,390
properties we we want to use the unified

847
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:55,910
program map so the problem is we are

848
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:57,740
actually now requesting two resources so

849
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,019
do we want to request these two

850
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:02,479
resources in a single query or in two

851
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:06,769
separate queries and another separate

852
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:08,690
two consecutive queries and that brings

853
00:47:06,769 --> 00:47:11,058
us to a problem of one run communication

854
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,579
and to run communication and our current

855
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:17,960
and also there's intimidation capacity

856
00:47:13,579 --> 00:47:20,079
basically when you want to implement you

857
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:21,829
want to up your up creates the auto

858
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,769
implementation to supports the

859
00:47:21,829 --> 00:47:28,039
prospective extension then from there

860
00:47:24,769 --> 00:47:32,538
you want to use a new message format or

861
00:47:28,039 --> 00:47:34,130
you want to reuse the old format that is

862
00:47:32,539 --> 00:47:34,940
already supported in the auto based

863
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:36,530
protocol

864
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,170
our decision is to use one-run

865
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:42,020
communication with multiple responses so

866
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:45,650
that we can first if we use to run

867
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:47,960
communication then the you have to keep

868
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:50,300
track of the previous of the first

869
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,619
requests before you can provide the

870
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:55,400
properties for the second request and

871
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:57,859
that means you need to cache the request

872
00:47:55,400 --> 00:48:00,140
for you need to catch the first request

873
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:03,500
before you can return the result of the

874
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:07,549
second request and that qu need to get a

875
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:11,540
bitty problem on the server and also the

876
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:14,119
the problem with for the multiple

877
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:17,329
response so so that means we need to use

878
00:48:14,119 --> 00:48:20,690
one run communication and then we'll

879
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:23,300
actually reuse format that we already

880
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:27,349
have for the honor protocol so we want

881
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:30,319
to so the decision is to make them into

882
00:48:27,349 --> 00:48:33,410
two different mess

883
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,119
parts of a single message and these two

884
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:40,190
paths should be included in one

885
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:44,410
multi-part response and a quick summary

886
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:49,970
of what we did in the last gita IETF so

887
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:52,970
for the NIT f15 basically we did some

888
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,430
kind of a major revision and first we

889
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:57,618
finalized the specification for the cost

890
00:48:55,430 --> 00:49:00,589
type extension for the extension of the

891
00:48:57,619 --> 00:49:04,190
cost type we essentially introduced a

892
00:49:00,589 --> 00:49:06,380
new MIT new new cost type the Cosmo is

893
00:49:04,190 --> 00:49:08,869
array and the cost metric is any path

894
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:14,619
and we also clarify the property

895
00:49:08,869 --> 00:49:18,349
negotiation process because so before

896
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:21,230
0/8 there is no explicit explanation of

897
00:49:18,349 --> 00:49:23,180
how the probably negotiation is happy

898
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:26,119
it's happening between client and a

899
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:29,598
server and we basically clarified we add

900
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:33,290
a new section to explicitly specify the

901
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,740
negotiation process of the properties

902
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:40,000
for a E and we also introduced a persist

903
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:44,180
entity as an initial registry entry for

904
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:48,500
any properties and we Kara Phi the part

905
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:50,240
resource ID in the multi-part message

906
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:55,450
because this is actually related to

907
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:58,009
integration ways incremental updates and

908
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:01,098
so in the last revision it is

909
00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:04,940
synchronized with SEC draft version 16

910
00:50:01,099 --> 00:50:07,250
and I recently checked the status of SEC

911
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:10,630
and I see there's a new version popping

912
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:12,920
up so this is actually a really

913
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:17,060
remaining issue that we need to solve in

914
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:20,960
the next revision and we also prop so

915
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:23,810
before 0-8 we have we will leave the

916
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,300
capability of cost Condor of future a

917
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:28,970
work and in the last revision we

918
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:35,530
actually proposed solutions for the cost

919
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:39,169
can of ability problem and so after a

920
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:41,570
ITF on five we basically because before

921
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:45,500
I file we did a lot of work and after

922
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:47,660
alpha we had a minor revision that's the

923
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:49,660
latest version and we emphasize that

924
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:53,210
action elements can be captured

925
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:56,118
dynamically to rockery and we highlight

926
00:50:53,210 --> 00:51:01,099
the benefits of this decision in

927
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:02,359
multiple places in the drafts and here

928
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,060
I'm going to talk about some remaining

929
00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:07,299
issues first as subbing missioned in

930
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,849
chair size there's a dependency between

931
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,760
the past vector draft and also the UFL

932
00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:16,490
probably trapped and first that I have

933
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:19,540
identified three dependencies first

934
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:22,759
they're the terminology dependency and

935
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:25,670
also the pop the format of the property

936
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:28,310
map basically reuses response data

937
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:32,680
format from the unified property draft

938
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:36,920
and also oh we need to register some

939
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:38,720
probably domains and for int oh sorry

940
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,460
there's tab you should be entity domain

941
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,009
and entity properties should be

942
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:46,060
registered using the mechanism defined

943
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:49,099
in the unified a poverty trap and

944
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:51,500
currently is synchronized with the

945
00:51:49,099 --> 00:51:55,910
unified republican version number zero

946
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:58,580
eight i think it is a newer version yeah

947
00:51:55,910 --> 00:52:00,759
okay and also there's a dependency on

948
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:05,540
the sse drafts

949
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:08,480
basically in sec 17 it includes a

950
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:11,990
section saying how we should handle

951
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:13,970
multi-part message using SSC so this

952
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:18,080
part should be removed from the current

953
00:52:13,970 --> 00:52:19,368
path vector extension now and I also

954
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:21,259
identified there as a terminology

955
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:24,380
inconsistency between these two jeff's

956
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,839
so it is called so the same object is

957
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,300
called part resource I the impasse

958
00:52:26,839 --> 00:52:30,830
factor and is called Content ID SEC and

959
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:35,450
we need to resolve this issue in the

960
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:38,359
next review and here's a revision plan

961
00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:40,819
so first in terms of writing we need to

962
00:52:38,359 --> 00:52:42,730
fix the dependency issues and improve

963
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:45,589
the quality of the writing and we also

964
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:46,760
and to improve the quality of writing we

965
00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:50,690
need some feedback from the working

966
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,510
group as well and another revision is so

967
00:52:50,690 --> 00:52:56,570
based on the discussion with a being and

968
00:52:53,510 --> 00:53:00,410
also some inputs from other ITP working

969
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:04,640
groups so in our current design the AE

970
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:07,790
is designed to be homogeneous so we will

971
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:10,879
provide the same unified the same

972
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:14,150
properties for all the areas returned by

973
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:16,369
the perspective extension but there is

974
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:19,369
actually a growing demand in the

975
00:53:16,369 --> 00:53:24,160
internet that we might want information

976
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:26,990
about heterogeneous and E's though first

977
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,690
for example in the site meeting talks we

978
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:32,419
had yesterday so a Chinese company

979
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:33,770
courtesan they are building a gaming

980
00:53:32,420 --> 00:53:37,730
platform which might use this

981
00:53:33,770 --> 00:53:40,009
information from the are collaborating

982
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:44,750
with some eyes piece to get the

983
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:47,240
information from the network and also I

984
00:53:44,750 --> 00:53:49,430
listened to a talk called compute first

985
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:52,189
networking they are basically trying to

986
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:58,460
do some load balancing for EM EC servers

987
00:53:52,190 --> 00:54:01,640
and I think there's a so the the the

988
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:04,790
ability to expose capabilities in the

989
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:06,379
network to the for in for better into in

990
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:12,710
communication is actually a growing

991
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:14,610
demand in the network today and and so

992
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,670
according to the discussion with Sabine

993
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:19,380
and we both agree that at least my

994
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:20,970
understanding that we both agree is that

995
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:24,320
pass factor can be used as a mechanism

996
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:28,169
to expose these capabilities to the

997
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:30,140
application layer and I think if we go

998
00:54:28,170 --> 00:54:33,510
down this path it will strengthen the

999
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:35,970
power of our extensions and also extends

1000
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:38,250
the scope of our Obi's right now we're

1001
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:40,649
more focusing on some traditional

1002
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:45,870
networking scenarios such as flow

1003
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:51,840
scheduling and resource sharing groups

1004
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:55,589
and if we can extend a bit it will allow

1005
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:58,380
us to bring and to adapt to the going

1006
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:00,720
trend today and the reason why I think

1007
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,090
we can do it is that it actually doesn't

1008
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:05,040
require a lot of work for the past

1009
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:06,840
paragraphs so what we need to do is

1010
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:12,120
first we need to define the entity type

1011
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:15,810
here the structure for this is basically

1012
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:18,089
we need we need we need ability to first

1013
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:20,370
need to identify what what types of

1014
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:21,690
æneas we need and what should be the

1015
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:27,500
properties associate ways different

1016
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:30,990
types of ease and in order to do that

1017
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:34,020
the property negotiation process should

1018
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:36,689
be slightly tweaked in the current draft

1019
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:40,650
and but this is actually not a big deal

1020
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:43,500
because the capabilities are Lansing so

1021
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,570
right now the we are using a more

1022
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:48,600
simplified version because previously we

1023
00:55:45,570 --> 00:55:50,580
only have one type of anyi and right now

1024
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,190
we the extension is actually we have

1025
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:55,650
multiple types and that is actually a

1026
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:58,920
good new because this can be this

1027
00:55:55,650 --> 00:56:00,240
weekend before different days can be

1028
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,240
considered as different types of

1029
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,700
entities that means we can reuse the

1030
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:08,220
capabilities from the unified property

1031
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:11,009
map so actually I think this is actually

1032
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:13,020
a cool new for us because that basically

1033
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:16,170
means the unified problem the unified

1034
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:18,960
problem draft and password drafts they

1035
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,510
they have more we don't have to build a

1036
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:25,910
new mechanism to expose the properties

1037
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:28,560
for different entities and after we

1038
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:31,290
adopt this change what follows

1039
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,810
we might need to identify more any

1040
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:36,840
drafts maybe work with other working

1041
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:42,029
groups for example on working groups I

1042
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:45,270
related to the mobile edge or like 5g

1043
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:48,930
and MIT and then we need show researcher

1044
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:51,840
the relate age energy type and their

1045
00:56:48,930 --> 00:56:55,890
properties to the unified property map

1046
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:58,080
but that the part included in what

1047
00:56:55,890 --> 00:57:02,660
follows is not part of the aspect or

1048
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:06,120
extension it should be maybe consider as

1049
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:09,359
new individual extensions to the unified

1050
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:12,080
appropriate draft and the conclusion

1051
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:14,280
that the current status of the job most

1052
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:18,410
the motivations and the potential

1053
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,660
problems I think I think we have already

1054
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:22,950
made them relatively clear and most part

1055
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:24,690
of the specifications are relative

1056
00:57:22,950 --> 00:57:27,210
completely unstable

1057
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:30,200
except the part I mentioned about the

1058
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:35,010
heterogeneous option error evidence and

1059
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:36,149
we like to say thanks to the co-authors

1060
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,550
and also the working group for the

1061
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:40,440
feedback and guidance and for the next

1062
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:41,910
step first I liked I think we need to

1063
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,640
make a revision to adopt the changes

1064
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:46,049
that we mentioned earlier and we're

1065
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,750
gonna stay the milestone for working

1066
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:50,880
group Lesko so yeah I was actually more

1067
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:54,240
conservative and I think we can do this

1068
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:56,100
in ITF Oh 8 but I think the working

1069
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:58,950
group chair would like to push us to

1070
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,920
finish it in the next basically in

1071
00:57:58,950 --> 00:58:04,770
Vancouver and also we neck to a couple

1072
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:06,450
reviews yeah that's all thank you great

1073
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,900
so can I ask some questions on one

1074
00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:09,000
simple

1075
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,010
and one simple one might more complex

1076
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:15,300
and a simple working in the following

1077
00:58:11,010 --> 00:58:19,650
and so for the proposal matrix we have

1078
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:24,570
introduced learn your cost source

1079
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:25,770
fueled SLA and estimation and very

1080
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:27,990
likely of course right now there's no

1081
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,520
dependency but actually I think it

1082
00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,250
passed vacuum most likely will be use

1083
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:33,900
cosmetic of a bandwidth available

1084
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:36,510
bandwidth that's probably one of the

1085
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:38,820
most typical use cases was a little

1086
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:39,990
bandit ways for it's a cough loss right

1087
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,150
because I think that's one of the major

1088
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:44,819
use cases which being first of all you

1089
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:46,799
so many places and so very likely that

1090
00:58:44,819 --> 00:58:48,720
particular metric with a bandit would be

1091
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,730
defined in the problems of magic

1092
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:53,578
document which means now you actually

1093
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:56,099
really could have a dependency one is

1094
00:58:53,579 --> 00:58:58,260
you define and measure yourself and one

1095
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,839
is you use a metric defined unit cost

1096
00:58:58,260 --> 00:59:02,250
performs a magic document and then

1097
00:59:00,839 --> 00:59:04,380
you're gonna have create a dependency

1098
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:06,450
very likely my understanding will be the

1099
00:59:04,380 --> 00:59:09,089
praval metric document a proper go first

1100
00:59:06,450 --> 00:59:10,828
what probably becomes an iced so what do

1101
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:12,630
you mean how to solve this dependency

1102
00:59:10,829 --> 00:59:14,460
issue so you have for the other one I

1103
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:16,049
mean let me be very specific number one

1104
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:18,569
is do you think for example about

1105
00:59:16,049 --> 00:59:20,849
bandwidth would be SLA or to be a

1106
00:59:18,569 --> 00:59:23,660
summation or you need like a nominal or

1107
00:59:20,849 --> 00:59:29,220
some different types of a cost source I

1108
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:31,288
think for example it's in the example we

1109
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:35,009
have in the past Burger Chef we probably

1110
00:59:31,289 --> 00:59:37,079
are using some either SEO a or nominal

1111
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:41,490
busy waste some care with some

1112
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:45,980
guarantees from the ISP but I I don't

1113
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:49,618
think that part basically either it's

1114
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:51,480
SLA or estimation or nominal should be

1115
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:54,029
included as part of the past whether

1116
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:59,329
Jeff because a special job does not

1117
00:59:54,029 --> 01:00:04,650
depend has not specify what specific

1118
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:06,690
needs or properties there should be that

1119
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:09,960
should be using I think they probably

1120
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:11,520
need another chance basically at least

1121
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:17,220
should be reaches to the unify the

1122
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:19,619
property registry this should be

1123
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:23,609
registered using the mechanism defined

1124
01:00:19,619 --> 01:00:25,859
in the unify the party drafts but this

1125
01:00:23,609 --> 01:00:28,980
one really comes from a coastal metric

1126
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:30,509
from cost types is separate and so

1127
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,430
therefore that's probably not handled by

1128
01:00:30,510 --> 01:00:35,010
the unified probably most likely we

1129
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:37,078
coupling with the performance metrics so

1130
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,640
of course we will probably took this

1131
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,349
week and taking it offline about the

1132
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:42,509
high level thing really potentially

1133
01:00:40,349 --> 01:00:43,950
maybe there's some feedback which can

1134
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:45,299
keep it till the pop-up matrix documents

1135
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:47,700
are oh that's really a new type of

1136
01:00:45,299 --> 01:00:48,750
guidance and so what exactly really it

1137
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,919
is I think that's the one you should

1138
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,960
sell I realize maybe there's such a

1139
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:55,289
dependence I think that's one and number

1140
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,820
two is very common if I may have like

1141
01:00:55,289 --> 01:00:59,430
user on to me and it's able to be

1142
01:00:56,820 --> 01:01:02,220
the dependency if you really wanted to

1143
01:00:59,430 --> 01:01:04,310
extension to handle Hitler genius can't

1144
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:06,868
go to hatred genius any part that

1145
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:09,090
actually number one of course it's super

1146
01:01:06,869 --> 01:01:11,369
cool right because even now probably

1147
01:01:09,090 --> 01:01:13,650
even right now today and in in Denver

1148
01:01:11,369 --> 01:01:16,619
and Colorado I think it was these people

1149
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:18,060
Cal attack and yes not about doing demos

1150
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:20,400
I think one of them was was using this

1151
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:22,049
like any staff pass vector they're doing

1152
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,580
all the demos without the major use

1153
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:26,130
cases without the biggest and his big

1154
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:27,390
data analytics and so therefore actually

1155
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:29,280
I think that's a perspective well most

1156
01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,960
useful thing but then if you do this

1157
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,060
extension and that throughout like you

1158
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,860
mentioned you potentially can add a comp

1159
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:36,779
like it so do you really envision the

1160
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:39,090
final version would include all these

1161
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:43,050
little juniors are not really a single

1162
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:46,230
simple most of base class app has any I

1163
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:48,090
think we would probably meet first we

1164
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:50,460
need to define me when we design

1165
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:52,500
protocol we definitely should leave some

1166
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:53,910
space for future extensions but I don't

1167
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:57,720
think we should

1168
01:01:53,910 --> 01:02:01,470
for example consider every single types

1169
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:03,060
of Annie's and put them in this draft in

1170
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:07,169
the extra we probably just defined a

1171
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:12,540
very basic basically an initial registry

1172
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:14,600
to to the as any basically we probably

1173
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:18,420
need consider any as a family of

1174
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:20,430
entities not a specific type of entities

1175
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:25,770
and then we probably want to introduce

1176
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:28,410
the very basic anyway some for example

1177
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:32,190
like penalize properties and some simple

1178
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:34,980
properties before we go in and if we can

1179
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:36,630
for example maybe later well we can we

1180
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,420
want to consider more come

1181
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:43,170
complicated use cases such as their MBC

1182
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:45,359
and UPF then maybe we need to add put

1183
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:47,850
them in another individual traps and for

1184
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:50,160
example we want to saying that we want

1185
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:53,700
to define a new type of any call the UPF

1186
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:57,210
any and what could be the properties

1187
01:02:53,700 --> 01:03:00,629
associated ways that I think that's way

1188
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:05,100
I think you have sugar just a very very

1189
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:06,740
quick comment as a co-author and because

1190
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,440
I am very motivated by this

1191
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:13,288
heterogeneous stuff

1192
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:16,710
the metrics that are conveyed by the

1193
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:21,509
auto performance metrics are metrics on

1194
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:25,140
path and properties here are properties

1195
01:03:21,509 --> 01:03:28,710
on network element so to me the

1196
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:31,288
bandwidth on in performance metric is

1197
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:35,749
not the same as the bandwidth is some

1198
01:03:31,289 --> 01:03:39,059
data center or element and the other

1199
01:03:35,749 --> 01:03:43,078
quick command is what makes in my view

1200
01:03:39,059 --> 01:03:46,470
this draft interesting is that it has a

1201
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:49,589
design that opens the way to any type of

1202
01:03:46,470 --> 01:03:51,538
abstracted network element so it's if

1203
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:54,808
it's only a switch then we should name

1204
01:03:51,539 --> 01:04:01,619
this extension extension switching

1205
01:03:54,809 --> 01:04:04,170
listing switches so just you mentioned

1206
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:06,569
that you were looking for reviewers you

1207
01:04:04,170 --> 01:04:12,509
want them to review the current draft or

1208
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:15,180
the updated that you will make I think

1209
01:04:12,509 --> 01:04:17,970
maybe after the IDF we would submit a

1210
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:20,249
new version and host a to that to the

1211
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,839
working group and maybe I think it's

1212
01:04:20,249 --> 01:04:25,078
probably better to review the latest one

1213
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:27,930
okay are there anybody in the room that

1214
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:34,289
would be willing to review that craft

1215
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:36,569
when it comes on the mailing list okay

1216
01:04:34,289 --> 01:04:40,999
then you have to find them on the - I

1217
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:40,999
want you to review okay excellent Thanks

1218
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:53,040
yeah thank you okay - aw

1219
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:55,079
I'll be quick and like I mentioned and

1220
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:57,270
then I had some questions sort of I

1221
01:04:55,079 --> 01:05:00,170
could be very quick so I'm gonna give an

1222
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:01,950
update on the city and I I've CI

1223
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:04,260
document and this one I could have

1224
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:05,700
pretty simple now and it's a good

1225
01:05:04,260 --> 01:05:10,829
collaboration between young and

1226
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:13,710
cabbing and John and also Jensen so let

1227
01:05:10,829 --> 01:05:15,839
me go where I don't you mean I probably

1228
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:17,369
can get done in like a five minutes so

1229
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:18,900
the change is actually the most such as

1230
01:05:17,369 --> 01:05:20,880
text ideas I think that's why it's a

1231
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:22,980
sign that's a really most ready and text

1232
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,780
I the in particular mostly all the edits

1233
01:05:22,980 --> 01:05:27,599
in the two versions will be consistent a

1234
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:30,030
user terminology and very thorough check

1235
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,859
for internal use and also I think one

1236
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:33,359
you should why we encounter all the tech

1237
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:34,740
side is all the time in lately it's

1238
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:36,598
because all the dependency among all the

1239
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:38,578
documents so therefore we an athlete to

1240
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:40,470
be consistent with the dependency for

1241
01:05:38,579 --> 01:05:41,760
example unify the proper document you're

1242
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:46,169
the same terms that's why we're cause

1243
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,640
all these like I text edit okay and so

1244
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:49,230
number one the change we made it was

1245
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:51,150
very simple is constantly use of

1246
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:53,970
terminology within the same document and

1247
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:55,859
we sometime called City FC service

1248
01:05:53,970 --> 01:05:57,740
sometime we call obsidian I've seen a

1249
01:05:55,859 --> 01:05:59,848
map service eventually we will

1250
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:01,529
terminology we make sure they all

1251
01:05:59,849 --> 01:06:03,990
essentially using one so that's the

1252
01:06:01,530 --> 01:06:06,329
change in number one it and then we of

1253
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:07,709
course we also made it a consistency

1254
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:09,720
over to be consistent way so the

1255
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:12,569
documents the terminology using auto

1256
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:14,160
document program Proctor map and we also

1257
01:06:12,569 --> 01:06:16,109
do the same thing so basically I don't

1258
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:19,529
need to go to all the essential

1259
01:06:16,109 --> 01:06:21,839
consistency and we also need to be

1260
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:23,940
consistency with essentially the unified

1261
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:25,859
properly document and for example there

1262
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:27,180
that were using and then the name change

1263
01:06:25,859 --> 01:06:29,310
from anything addressed to end it here

1264
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:31,529
identifier we also start we go through

1265
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:33,119
the whole document make sure we were you

1266
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,740
the same thing I don't think we're

1267
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:37,200
really depend on a document but I think

1268
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:40,618
that's essential to what we did to to

1269
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,930
dual updates and for example here is

1270
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,910
previously we call alternative domain

1271
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:47,060
registry and now right now really called

1272
01:06:44,910 --> 01:06:50,040
auto entity domain the hybrid tree a

1273
01:06:47,060 --> 01:06:51,839
term changes because it about chasing

1274
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:54,089
the dependence say that's why makes life

1275
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:55,920
live your heart but we I think we're so

1276
01:06:54,089 --> 01:06:57,029
far were doing pretty good job or maybe

1277
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,369
we'll make sure they're all consistent

1278
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:01,740
so work a more as soon as possible so

1279
01:06:59,369 --> 01:07:03,690
the samurais and I think documents is

1280
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:05,649
quite stable now except really a lock a

1281
01:07:03,690 --> 01:07:09,329
portrayal names we have the follow names

1282
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:11,799
any other clever way to do it and we're

1283
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:14,440
waiting for some comments from singing I

1284
01:07:11,799 --> 01:07:17,049
working group and from over there give

1285
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:19,299
us final comments and until they sign

1286
01:07:17,049 --> 01:07:20,559
off with other changes and then we

1287
01:07:19,299 --> 01:07:22,029
essentially want to go to a working

1288
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:23,650
group ask our I will grab a miss

1289
01:07:22,029 --> 01:07:26,049
document that's pretty much it so I know

1290
01:07:23,650 --> 01:07:33,600
it's short but we really don't need to

1291
01:07:26,049 --> 01:07:34,680
change it too much okay any questions

1292
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:40,029
[Music]

1293
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:44,799
okay so then we would have the same

1294
01:07:40,029 --> 01:07:48,880
question as with the other draft so are

1295
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:52,390
there potentially any people willing to

1296
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:56,619
review these documents of course we can

1297
01:07:52,390 --> 01:08:08,009
ask afterwards but that it was that and

1298
01:07:56,619 --> 01:08:08,010
probably review a lot okay okay

1299
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:18,020
so the last two presentations are not

1300
01:08:14,510 --> 01:08:22,549
about working group items but they

1301
01:08:18,020 --> 01:08:31,850
address exploration work regarding modem

1302
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:34,278
networks yeah thank you yes next

1303
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:36,230
presentation is about the idea of using

1304
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:39,410
altitude at their mind the service edge

1305
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:40,939
so somehow thinking in the pollution of

1306
01:08:39,410 --> 01:08:46,009
the networks and ike i referred to that

1307
01:08:40,939 --> 01:08:48,108
in the previous talk potentially we will

1308
01:08:46,009 --> 01:08:49,520
bore by the progeny computing

1309
01:08:48,109 --> 01:08:52,250
capabilities and so so the idea would be

1310
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,040
to leverage from their capabilities in

1311
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:58,100
in order to help us to identify the

1312
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:59,420
better edge for a given service and here

1313
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:01,219
the ponies to to differentiate between

1314
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:03,830
the physical edge and the service edge

1315
01:09:01,219 --> 01:09:06,560
so no not all the services necessarily

1316
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:08,660
have to go a close to the access or

1317
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:11,449
probably the edge for each service

1318
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:15,710
depend on the kind of service tree to be

1319
01:09:11,448 --> 01:09:17,689
honored to be the Liebherr so yep

1320
01:09:15,710 --> 01:09:19,219
basically the the the situation is that

1321
01:09:17,689 --> 01:09:20,960
now operators that are starting to the

1322
01:09:19,219 --> 01:09:21,799
products within covering capabilities

1323
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,890
across the network

1324
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:27,019
the edge environments that more

1325
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,449
centralized data centers large data

1326
01:09:27,020 --> 01:09:31,069
centers close to the interconnection etc

1327
01:09:29,448 --> 01:09:35,540
cetera these data centers all of them

1328
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:39,140
had different capabilities in terms of

1329
01:09:35,540 --> 01:09:43,759
the environment itself the size of the

1330
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:47,029
number of CPUs memory bandwidth even for

1331
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:50,089
forgiving the traffic and so so the idea

1332
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:51,949
the detective would be to think of

1333
01:09:50,089 --> 01:09:53,929
mechanisms for assisting the decision in

1334
01:09:51,948 --> 01:09:55,250
which datacenter we deploy a given

1335
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:57,290
service according to the restriction on

1336
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:59,750
these services in terms of latency

1337
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:01,780
bandwidth etc cetera and we consider

1338
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:04,780
that the alto could play a role on this

1339
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:07,719
so basically the idea will be to

1340
01:10:04,780 --> 01:10:10,219
incorporate into Alto all the

1341
01:10:07,719 --> 01:10:12,860
information ready to compute into the

1342
01:10:10,219 --> 01:10:15,290
computing environments so CPUs memory

1343
01:10:12,860 --> 01:10:16,910
the storage and so and combine that with

1344
01:10:15,290 --> 01:10:19,400
the topological information from the

1345
01:10:16,910 --> 01:10:21,019
network in such a way that the Alto

1346
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:22,940
client could request the Altos shared

1347
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:25,700
information based on the needs

1348
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:28,820
for the computing capabilities but

1349
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:31,370
linking these these recommendations this

1350
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:35,030
is for let's say for Alto together with

1351
01:10:31,370 --> 01:10:37,070
information from the network so how the

1352
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:39,769
computing needs are commonly expressed

1353
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:42,620
so typically they are structurally in

1354
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:45,020
bundles of CPU RAM and storage units and

1355
01:10:42,620 --> 01:10:46,970
we can see this in commercial examples

1356
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:50,660
like Amazon Web Services or make micro

1357
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:54,740
service or there is another example that

1358
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,290
is being from promoted let's say between

1359
01:10:54,740 --> 01:10:59,480
Linux Foundation and the SMA which is a

1360
01:10:57,290 --> 01:11:02,260
common network function virtualization

1361
01:10:59,480 --> 01:11:05,299
infrastructure telecom tax force C NTT

1362
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:07,700
and in this particular case that we have

1363
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:10,220
taken as an example for the for the

1364
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:12,710
draft the the different flavors or

1365
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:16,910
instances are characterized by five

1366
01:11:12,710 --> 01:11:19,610
different item items the same the type

1367
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:21,710
of instance so basically this instance

1368
01:11:19,610 --> 01:11:23,929
can be characterized as basic network

1369
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:25,610
intensity for computing intensive the

1370
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:27,740
interface option where basically

1371
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:31,339
declares the bandwidth of the interface

1372
01:11:27,740 --> 01:11:33,620
that is required for for the function to

1373
01:11:31,340 --> 01:11:36,230
be deployed on top of that the compute

1374
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:38,990
flavor which basically refers to a

1375
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:40,639
combination between CPU Raman and disk

1376
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:44,090
and the bandwidth for the management

1377
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:45,620
interface of this instance optionally

1378
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:48,500
storage suspensions to request

1379
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:50,150
additional storage capacity and optional

1380
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:52,820
harbour acceleration graph statistics in

1381
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:54,889
order that in case that they design a

1382
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,590
specific need for the application

1383
01:11:54,890 --> 01:12:01,250
running on top of the of the of this

1384
01:11:56,590 --> 01:12:02,870
computing capabilities regarding the set

1385
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:06,080
a characteristics of acceleration in the

1386
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:11,420
liberty of the traffic here you can see

1387
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:13,460
more or less the kind of flavors that

1388
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:15,470
are being proposed in this yen TTD

1389
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:17,390
initiative and also you have here the

1390
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:18,890
link for for that for checking that and

1391
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:21,410
we have performed in this graph an

1392
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:23,540
initial mapping to the property map seen

1393
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:26,030
in alt so this would be an initial

1394
01:12:23,540 --> 01:12:28,910
exercise that we would like to develop

1395
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:31,519
and to complete in future revisions of

1396
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:34,010
the other document that basically will

1397
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:36,540
be to take this alongside as an example

1398
01:12:34,010 --> 01:12:40,890
for exercising how the

1399
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:44,280
how Alto could be play a role in in this

1400
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:45,570
part there in the association of

1401
01:12:44,280 --> 01:12:47,639
computing capabilities a network

1402
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,500
topology we have identified so far three

1403
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,270
potential solutions this does not mean

1404
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:54,060
that could be others for sure but these

1405
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:57,240
these ones are the potential solutions

1406
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:59,370
that we have identified one could be one

1407
01:12:57,240 --> 01:13:01,769
could be to leverage and possible is ten

1408
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,860
the service function network topology

1409
01:13:01,770 --> 01:13:08,310
model that is been moved into T's

1410
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:11,250
working group in fact now in this cell

1411
01:13:08,310 --> 01:13:12,930
function our topology model we already

1412
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:14,400
including the current version so

1413
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:16,590
information about the data center

1414
01:13:14,400 --> 01:13:18,240
capabilities probably the idea that we

1415
01:13:16,590 --> 01:13:20,190
are considering the Delphis of this

1416
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:23,370
graph is to move this forward and get in

1417
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:24,629
a specific document for that so no

1418
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,950
mixing with the surface of Ceres

1419
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,720
functional stuff itself because the

1420
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:30,870
service function referred to there to

1421
01:13:27,720 --> 01:13:32,490
the function and and somehow they buried

1422
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:35,160
in infrastructure from fraction let's

1423
01:13:32,490 --> 01:13:37,980
say a second ocean could be to extend

1424
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:42,269
the BGP LS or to propose to stand the

1425
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:44,280
VPLS RFC including among other

1426
01:13:42,270 --> 01:13:48,330
attributes the information of the

1427
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:50,840
compute part and a third option could be

1428
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:53,430
there to combine somehow the information

1429
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:55,140
from this researcher profiles catalog

1430
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:57,690
with a topological information by

1431
01:13:55,140 --> 01:14:00,000
leveraging on the AP prefixes allocated

1432
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:04,559
here to the Gateway all the data centers

1433
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:09,150
basically populating this probably doing

1434
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:12,720
this together with a IP Alton gave me so

1435
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:15,299
very next steps we are considering to

1436
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:18,090
elaborate more on the mapping exercise

1437
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:19,860
to the property property maps in Alto so

1438
01:14:18,090 --> 01:14:22,380
elaborating more in that example that I

1439
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:23,460
showed you before this product relatives

1440
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:25,440
for the Association of compute

1441
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:27,330
capabilities to network topology and

1442
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:29,460
this probably the first step will be to

1443
01:14:27,330 --> 01:14:33,690
generate this need of this document

1444
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:37,980
derive from the service fashioned our

1445
01:14:33,690 --> 01:14:39,690
topology module also here for sure the

1446
01:14:37,980 --> 01:14:41,160
idea is to collect interest from other

1447
01:14:39,690 --> 01:14:42,480
working group to understand if this is

1448
01:14:41,160 --> 01:14:45,450
something of interest for the working

1449
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,730
group and in so two local men advances

1450
01:14:45,450 --> 01:14:49,540
for next ITF in mokuba

1451
01:14:47,730 --> 01:14:52,059
so this the

1452
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:58,540
all for this presentation some love

1453
01:14:52,060 --> 01:15:00,690
comments to move on Howie for the second

1454
01:14:58,540 --> 01:15:03,550
point actually you mention you want to

1455
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:06,070
support a computer capability

1456
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:10,210
so have you consider you to support a

1457
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:12,009
storage capability or you think it's not

1458
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:15,130
a use cases you want to connect focus on

1459
01:15:12,010 --> 01:15:18,070
computer capability what I refer compute

1460
01:15:15,130 --> 01:15:20,140
in a general term so will be four bits

1461
01:15:18,070 --> 01:15:23,280
even remember CPUs memory storage and

1462
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:27,160
also so complete information at the end

1463
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:29,590
probably a startling the so how trying

1464
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:32,250
to abstract with this idea of bundles of

1465
01:15:29,590 --> 01:15:35,350
flavors this is this makes this more

1466
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:37,780
easy to handle than the individual

1467
01:15:35,350 --> 01:15:40,210
values of memory and storage but this is

1468
01:15:37,780 --> 01:15:41,259
something to explore but remember in

1469
01:15:40,210 --> 01:15:44,740
your question idea would be to address

1470
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:47,890
everything not only CPUs but memory

1471
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:50,559
storage and so so I referred as computer

1472
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:53,200
in a linear dynamical way Junaid general

1473
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:57,040
way all the capabilities of data center

1474
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:59,230
for deploying services for its compute

1475
01:15:57,040 --> 01:16:02,980
computer capability there's some

1476
01:15:59,230 --> 01:16:06,400
relevant water worker in Si and Fe I'm

1477
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:10,120
not sure how to marry together for well

1478
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:12,639
in fact this initiative or sorry this

1479
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:15,849
one try to standardize the way in which

1480
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:18,490
an API capabilities can be requested so

1481
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:20,680
normalized on how they the way or not

1482
01:16:18,490 --> 01:16:23,080
only requested normalize the way in

1483
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:24,730
which the nmda capabilities can be

1484
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,830
somehow exposed in such a way that the

1485
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:29,049
different network functions can be

1486
01:16:26,830 --> 01:16:31,780
deployed in a similar way in different

1487
01:16:29,050 --> 01:16:34,330
environments so somehow we have this

1488
01:16:31,780 --> 01:16:39,030
link with an API stuff that's gonna be a

1489
01:16:34,330 --> 01:16:42,700
stuff I just remember some open issue in

1490
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:45,099
service service aware topology model

1491
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:47,370
there's some open should relate to the

1492
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:50,230
NFA actually I'm having followed

1493
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:52,300
discussion very closely that seems

1494
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:54,429
actually they need to you know talk ways

1495
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:56,770
as a younger way to address that open

1496
01:16:54,430 --> 01:17:00,860
your issue so probably you needed need

1497
01:16:56,770 --> 01:17:04,310
to you know consider this okay thank you

1498
01:17:00,860 --> 01:17:07,969
so we can yes I think this is super

1499
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:09,889
interesting and I do wanna say comedian

1500
01:17:07,969 --> 01:17:12,050
it won't be the intradomain setting and

1501
01:17:09,889 --> 01:17:13,699
even show to be a single network or

1502
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:16,610
eventually this model will involve

1503
01:17:13,699 --> 01:17:18,710
multiple domains meaning out of multiple

1504
01:17:16,610 --> 01:17:21,049
autonomous systems and there are

1505
01:17:18,710 --> 01:17:22,820
competition or what a story resource'

1506
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:24,679
will be aggregated or maybe the

1507
01:17:22,820 --> 01:17:25,369
eventually only invasion essentially a

1508
01:17:24,679 --> 01:17:26,330
single one

1509
01:17:25,369 --> 01:17:29,030
you don't worry about it eventually

1510
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,769
information abrogation issues the

1511
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:33,320
initial approach is single domain sure

1512
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:35,900
so that could be applicable a I guess I

1513
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:39,170
presume to to multi multiple level

1514
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:40,670
domain case should not be probably too

1515
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:46,510
much complex there will be probably

1516
01:17:40,670 --> 01:17:48,650
issues of authentication privacy

1517
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:51,380
probably different levels of a structure

1518
01:17:48,650 --> 01:17:53,809
maybe I think it can be extended to to

1519
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:56,929
multi domain but the initial approach is

1520
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:58,850
single domain only to start for for the

1521
01:17:56,929 --> 01:18:01,400
easy part and maybe to complicate the

1522
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:04,310
things sure yeah because if I mean so

1523
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:07,519
one reason why I want is following

1524
01:18:04,310 --> 01:18:09,619
several years ago and IBM guys will

1525
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,440
trying to use this actually a map to

1526
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:14,239
really do the IBM private class to do

1527
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,339
information aggregation and of course

1528
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:18,080
that he was in Kiyomi multi domain

1529
01:18:16,340 --> 01:18:19,670
setting and turns out the information

1530
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:21,469
aggregation turns out to be very very

1531
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:23,840
tricky so I can give you a very quick

1532
01:18:21,469 --> 01:18:26,060
example just like follow record and for

1533
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,590
example like calcium formation seems to

1534
01:18:26,060 --> 01:18:29,989
be very easy for example essentially

1535
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:32,420
it's decent vector if for example my

1536
01:18:29,989 --> 01:18:34,009
cost to you is five years of being is

1537
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:37,010
three and the eventual if you go to

1538
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:38,750
relay from from stopping from me to you

1539
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:40,340
to suddenly five plus three equal to

1540
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:42,710
eight very easy to the addition every

1541
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:44,840
since I'm still working so I've had my

1542
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:47,179
house from me to you you fake your cost

1543
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:48,770
from you to stop being we had together

1544
01:18:47,179 --> 01:18:50,989
we got eight everything seems to be okay

1545
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:53,270
but but somehow competition has this

1546
01:18:50,989 --> 01:18:54,619
very weird property of somehow the

1547
01:18:53,270 --> 01:18:57,199
outreach system somehow seems to be

1548
01:18:54,619 --> 01:18:59,299
broken and for example the example which

1549
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:01,669
I p.m. gasps gasps encounter was very

1550
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:03,650
simple use case was for example I will

1551
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:06,230
see I have two users I have to use of

1552
01:19:03,650 --> 01:19:07,759
CPU I got information I'll tell you and

1553
01:19:06,230 --> 01:19:10,369
you heard from Kyle that he has two

1554
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,840
units of CPU he also tells you and he

1555
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:14,089
were and you might tell us I mean you

1556
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:15,710
have for your new units or CPU but I can

1557
01:19:14,090 --> 01:19:17,780
funny thing might be my tune you'll

1558
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:19,520
sleep you might hold for exam two units

1559
01:19:17,780 --> 01:19:21,949
I mean I would also keep example Chi two

1560
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:23,510
units we all posted Howie we have two

1561
01:19:21,949 --> 01:19:25,428
units and you got two units and

1562
01:19:23,510 --> 01:19:26,989
eventually you got four units and you

1563
01:19:25,429 --> 01:19:28,880
tell actually for example you control

1564
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:30,290
they subpoena your for you know you

1565
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:31,760
don't you only have two units um honey

1566
01:19:30,290 --> 01:19:33,469
simple mission when the propagate it

1567
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:34,880
somehow mean gold may not they cannot be

1568
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:36,380
distinguished somehow the information

1569
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,780
becomes quite a complex that's why

1570
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:40,730
you're in surely will encounter this

1571
01:19:38,780 --> 01:19:42,530
issue or an action now most likely the

1572
01:19:40,730 --> 01:19:44,239
IBM gas eventually I don't know what

1573
01:19:42,530 --> 01:19:45,559
eventually how to do it I think then you

1574
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:47,330
solve this issue for their cloud

1575
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:48,730
aggregation here in the cloud they were

1576
01:19:47,330 --> 01:19:52,130
using this outer thing using as example

1577
01:19:48,730 --> 01:19:54,530
but that's a completely encounter okay

1578
01:19:52,130 --> 01:20:02,679
thanks for the comment something to

1579
01:19:54,530 --> 01:20:05,210
consider is - important from Sprint

1580
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:08,270
so thank you for the presentation I

1581
01:20:05,210 --> 01:20:12,739
think it's very interesting and I

1582
01:20:08,270 --> 01:20:14,270
support further work in this area in

1583
01:20:12,739 --> 01:20:17,989
addition to the properties of the data

1584
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:21,260
center I'm wondering if we should also

1585
01:20:17,989 --> 01:20:24,259
consider the the back hall or a

1586
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:28,699
transport going into the property for

1587
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:30,500
that going into the data center right so

1588
01:20:28,699 --> 01:20:34,369
it's something to think about also I'd

1589
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:38,300
like to maybe work with you off talk to

1590
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:42,290
you offline about possibility of maybe

1591
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:45,590
leveraging this idea with at ccsm that

1592
01:20:42,290 --> 01:20:46,880
I'm working in okay for sure so there

1593
01:20:45,590 --> 01:20:49,810
are in the back :

1594
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:53,989
and so for sure we intend to let's say

1595
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:57,980
mix all they play with all to help us or

1596
01:20:53,989 --> 01:21:01,159
allow us to mix both words say they

1597
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:03,830
never part together with a compute part

1598
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:05,480
in a generic way in such a way that we

1599
01:21:03,830 --> 01:21:07,429
can take their worse decision but

1600
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,369
looking at both things together at the

1601
01:21:07,429 --> 01:21:13,369
same time so I my answer will be yes and

1602
01:21:10,369 --> 01:21:18,259
for the second days at ccsm for sure we

1603
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:24,339
will talk of that thank you okay thank

1604
01:21:18,260 --> 01:21:24,340
you yes let's go for the next one

1605
01:21:26,260 --> 01:21:33,890
okay so here the idea is to what of the

1606
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:36,170
objective is to present an idea but that

1607
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:40,240
would be it was 10 alto by using bgp

1608
01:21:36,170 --> 01:21:44,210
communities so the the BP communities

1609
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:47,570
are BP communities have a BP attribute

1610
01:21:44,210 --> 01:21:49,580
basically is commonly used for grouping

1611
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:52,610
destination so you associate a number of

1612
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:54,500
prefixes to a community and you defined

1613
01:21:52,610 --> 01:21:58,339
this community and you basically use the

1614
01:21:54,500 --> 01:22:02,180
communities for policy purposes purposes

1615
01:21:58,340 --> 01:22:04,460
for influencing the delivery of the

1616
01:22:02,180 --> 01:22:07,670
traffic to certain prefixes so this is

1617
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:11,240
basically the fact these communities are

1618
01:22:07,670 --> 01:22:14,690
represented as an indigent number 32

1619
01:22:11,240 --> 01:22:18,650
feet length basically including the

1620
01:22:14,690 --> 01:22:21,169
information of the autonomous system and

1621
01:22:18,650 --> 01:22:23,599
yeah and also interesting these

1622
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:25,100
communities this community exhibit can

1623
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:30,410
be carried across an autonomous system

1624
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:32,360
so somehow could help us to to support

1625
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:36,320
these multi domain cases in the future

1626
01:22:32,360 --> 01:22:39,110
as well so the the problem when looking

1627
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:42,349
at this issue was the basically we

1628
01:22:39,110 --> 01:22:45,230
operators used stands extensively the BP

1629
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:49,790
communities is a way of putting together

1630
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:53,719
some practices or some IP destinations

1631
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:55,280
this is basically used for applying

1632
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:56,750
policies for the traffic again as I

1633
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:58,759
mentioned before for influencing the

1634
01:22:56,750 --> 01:23:00,680
behavior of the trafficked or different

1635
01:22:58,760 --> 01:23:04,910
associated associated destinations

1636
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:09,170
towards the prefixes the other protocol

1637
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:11,660
is based on IP practices and the point

1638
01:23:09,170 --> 01:23:14,360
here is but--but and we usually use

1639
01:23:11,660 --> 01:23:17,059
these these communities in aggregation

1640
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:20,690
nodes so basically when we allocate IP

1641
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:23,480
prefixes to PNG or to a P gateway so how

1642
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:25,160
we are identifying the users we handle

1643
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:28,250
these happy prefixes with just a single

1644
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:32,599
identifier so the point here will be

1645
01:23:28,250 --> 01:23:34,370
instead of going to individual IP

1646
01:23:32,600 --> 01:23:35,570
prefixes to play with the PEP

1647
01:23:34,370 --> 01:23:37,640
communities in order to obtain

1648
01:23:35,570 --> 01:23:39,769
information to retrieve the information

1649
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:42,950
from the from the alto service said well

1650
01:23:39,770 --> 01:23:45,320
we see benefits on on this one would be

1651
01:23:42,950 --> 01:23:47,860
probably the reduction in the number of

1652
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:51,200
queries to the auto server so we've just

1653
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:53,839
working with VP communities if we could

1654
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:56,990
address information for different number

1655
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,760
of prophecies and also to fully absorb

1656
01:23:56,990 --> 01:24:00,980
the natural change in practices because

1657
01:23:58,760 --> 01:24:02,840
well with all the migration of users and

1658
01:24:00,980 --> 01:24:06,860
we need to move professors here and

1659
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:09,680
there and sometimes this complicates I

1660
01:24:06,860 --> 01:24:11,330
say the management of a addressing IP

1661
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:14,090
addressing in the internal of the

1662
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:15,769
network so going to with big communities

1663
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:19,190
somehow we are hitting this complexity

1664
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:22,910
and we will kept the Altos tough more or

1665
01:24:19,190 --> 01:24:25,429
less constant without so many changes so

1666
01:24:22,910 --> 01:24:26,480
regarding their next steps for this idea

1667
01:24:25,430 --> 01:24:28,430
will be to elaborate more on the

1668
01:24:26,480 --> 01:24:31,250
proposal this is just to present you

1669
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:33,200
they what we have in mind to call any

1670
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:35,180
interest for an alto glue to understand

1671
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:37,940
if this is of interest or not actually

1672
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:39,920
and be sure to document the proposal for

1673
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:42,559
the next a team meeting and create a

1674
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:46,970
specific draft for it and that's all for

1675
01:24:42,560 --> 01:24:48,470
this presentation so I only want to get

1676
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:52,280
one go I think this is super clever so

1677
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:54,110
for example the the essential a PID is

1678
01:24:52,280 --> 01:24:55,370
into some kind of like for example a bit

1679
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:57,650
if you agree in some way of doing

1680
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:59,240
aggregation doing and marking and this

1681
01:24:57,650 --> 01:25:03,740
one it's much more junior it is a very

1682
01:24:59,240 --> 01:25:05,240
clever proposal thank you and more

1683
01:25:03,740 --> 01:25:08,000
preferring to the multi domain case that

1684
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:10,880
we have mentioned before these because

1685
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:14,390
this is transitive so we also could use

1686
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:18,490
these for the multi domain case in order

1687
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:18,490
to to support a multi domain basically

1688
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:25,850

1689
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:59,170
so thanks everybody we really we still

1690
01:25:56,440 --> 01:26:00,750
have five minutes for open discussion if

1691
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:04,840
somebody would like to raise a question

1692
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:07,660
thanks a lot to Luis because this is

1693
01:26:04,840 --> 01:26:09,610
well of course we are swamped with

1694
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:12,010
working group documents but it's really

1695
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:15,870
important to have some look out and

1696
01:26:12,010 --> 01:26:21,310
especially your first presentation

1697
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:24,400
leverages actually the on the well the

1698
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:27,040
interest of having an open design for

1699
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:29,559
path vector stuff like that that are not

1700
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:34,450
restricted to particular network

1701
01:26:29,560 --> 01:26:37,360
topology and context and elements and in

1702
01:26:34,450 --> 01:26:40,349
the light of these actually we can try

1703
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:43,780
to play some scenarios to really test

1704
01:26:40,350 --> 01:26:46,450
how open and flexible the path effect I

1705
01:26:43,780 --> 01:26:49,900
think path vector and properties are

1706
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:53,710
definitely two items that will open the

1707
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:56,740
way for heterogeneous technology because

1708
01:26:53,710 --> 01:27:04,890
now the trend is end to end path and 20s

1709
01:26:56,740 --> 01:27:12,630
means a Yanni's of any type so so any

1710
01:27:04,890 --> 01:27:17,040
thing needs to be said no in which case

1711
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:17,040
thank you very much to everybody

1712
01:27:27,680 --> 01:27:46,230
no you don't you oh thank you so much

1713
01:27:34,580 --> 01:27:49,010
thank you that's so nice thank you so

1714
01:27:46,230 --> 01:27:49,009
maybe we should

1715
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,949
