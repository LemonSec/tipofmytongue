11
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:12,280
with it not well I don't want to read it

12
00:02:06,969 --> 00:02:16,209
but you have to be aware of that well

okay this is meeting medallions Avenue

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:53,290
Chavez primary military code can help

20
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:53,980
with a diverse crime oh yeah okay thank

21
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,329
you very much

22
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,369
any minute takers do we have we have to

23
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:11,410
wait a bit until people more people are

24
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:13,510
right okay

25
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:17,670
please don't tell four-minute acres and

26
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:17,670
if you can't add some information oh

27
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:46,120
okay thank you very much thank you

28
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,120
when it is our agenda for today we are

29
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:52,870
going to meet the today and tomorrow so

30
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:57,870
this is our agenda comments for the

31
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:57,870
dinner ok

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,160
we have updated the mind stones to be

33
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:11,200
more aligned with the reality so yeah

34
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:14,560
you can see that some documents most of

35
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,959
all the documents were updated so please

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,720
review this and if you want to send

37
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,019
comments or suggestions please let us

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,020
know

39
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:33,880
so yes I think for the doll projection

40
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,920
is still a bit optimistic next December

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,990
we are not there yet I think it's coming

42
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,870
next year hopefully by the next idea if

43
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:56,280
we really work hard on it okay thank you

44
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:58,870
very much updated thank you okay we have

45
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,880
active internet drop the most of things

46
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:08,470
are going to be discussed two days or at

47
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:12,460
least I give some updates on changes and

48
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:17,440
they are expired in internet draft that

49
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:21,430
we should work on in the near future to

50
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,469
be aligned with milestones and that they

51
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:26,770
are as well related introduct are driven

52
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:31,030
to get discussion today and tomorrow

53
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:34,750
into the end tomorrow okay we notice

54
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:37,210
that they did have repository is great

55
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:40,330
to check in issues and there is a lot of

56
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:44,320
people updating including issues indeed

57
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:47,979
happen that is great this to list is

58
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,800
more useful than the biggest one I mean

59
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:55,000
I see more people actively participate

60
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:57,120
in the training tickets indeed hub but

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,930
the still so we are going to track these

62
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:04,690
geezers and as well them all tracking

63
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:08,440
system tickets so we are going to watch

64
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:11,740
pose but it is that the community the

65
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:17,590
working group I prefer they did have

66
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:25,750
because is super easy right okay some

67
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:29,320
relation for drop so we noticed a

68
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:33,090
unaware leaf drop it's aligned with user

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:37,560
people in Poland some of our terminology

70
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:42,210
then officiant and video relies on rebel

71
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,750
status in our lives then for capability

72
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:48,960
mode of operation graft we have

73
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,630
announced three relations for the

74
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:54,599
projection sure there was commenced in

75
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,570
the Middle East that we asked to the

76
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:02,040
working group should be used a new mode

77
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:04,710
of operation for that or not this is a

78
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,600
question transfer today working group

79
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:17,479
what do you think oh no no because he's

80
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:19,590
going to yeah then for channel 81 38

81
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:24,300
should be this implemented into

82
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:28,138
capabilities we want to discuss this

83
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:31,979
tomorrow and then as well for tomorrow a

84
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,740
lighting guy of information synchronize

85
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,289
the counter of capability draft so this

86
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:44,220
is the relation that we saw in those

87
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:47,849
current job so as well they do

88
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:51,800
information draft a could be aligned

89
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:55,380
with this modification draft we can say

90
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,710
may be can be merged we have to discuss

91
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:04,050
that so this is that enough for today

92
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,870
so I want to start for ripple

93
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:10,500
observations by always going to state

94
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:13,440
the observation of which issues are

95
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:16,800
still open in Ripon some of them then

96
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,080
Pascal a give us a update in their

97
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,850
projections and which the next steps to

98
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:22,919
follow and then we are going to talk

99
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:26,160
about capability and mode of operation

100
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:31,640
draft and then we have our backbone

101
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:34,640
open floor okay thank you very much

102
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,640
please

103
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:49,470
[Music]

104
00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:00,610
okay hello everyone I'm Rahul shadow

105
00:08:54,340 --> 00:09:02,830
from Huawei so so what is this draft

106
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:03,790
about so we have been documenting most

107
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,280
of the observations

108
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:10,420
most of the implementers experiences in

109
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:11,920
this Jack and it's it's its aim is to

110
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,880
clarify

111
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,050
6550 in some cases may fix it and

112
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,300
provide some implementation guidelines

113
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,550
and so in the book in the course if you

114
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,859
see in if you have read the draft you

115
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,599
might see that there are questions so

116
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:28,480
every every section has a questions

117
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,880
asking it should we do it in this way or

118
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,290
other way so it's essentially from the

119
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,360
implementation perspective you have

120
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,240
multiple ways of implementing certain

121
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,030
things and each of it might have some

122
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,620
implications so that's what this staff

123
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:46,480
clarifies and it's mostly the

124
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:48,280
observations but just to be clear we

125
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,710
might not publish this job but we might

126
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:56,170
eventually keep it for a long term by

127
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:58,630
over a period of time so the first first

128
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,000
first observation is regarding the

129
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:04,510
parent switching operation mode

130
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,460
operation wherein there is an element

131
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,960
there is a field called as DTS in the

132
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,940
destination advertisement trigger

133
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:12,670
sequence number and it has a very large

134
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:19,000
implication and on the overall control

135
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:20,979
overhead of ripple you know just try to

136
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,360
if it's full screen then it will advance

137
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:30,430
properly it doesn't take it so you have

138
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:32,410
to do it right so this field is

139
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:34,959
something which is sent into D IO which

140
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:38,110
informs the downstream peers to update

141
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:41,170
the DAO basically update the destination

142
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:42,940
advertisement now it's very easy to

143
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,560
handle this in non storing mode because

144
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,480
it is directly controlled by the route

145
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,910
the DTS and in value is directly

146
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,100
controlled by the route in case of

147
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,180
storing mode of operation it becomes a

148
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,460
little bit tricky

149
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,069
and there are multiple implementation

150
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,970
strategies possible now an example here

151
00:10:57,070 --> 00:11:06,339
when the node D switches from B to C now

152
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:08,320
no B needs to on C's C needs to have not

153
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:10,540
only the information about no D but all

154
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:16,270
the the completes do subdue that routed

155
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:18,490
at node D now either D can update Big D

156
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:20,010
Jason increment the DTS and then the and

157
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:23,440
reset the decay D I have trickle timer

158
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:25,779
in which case no DS the Dow can go to

159
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,820
see but subdue drag also has to be

160
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,529
updated if that is one of the way to

161
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:31,779
handle it and I've seen the implement

162
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:35,230
some implementations doing it the other

163
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:36,820
way is node B already has the routing

164
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,459
information on behalf of all the nodes

165
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,390
and it sends an aggregated Dao on behalf

166
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:43,599
of sub Buddha

167
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,920
well this is a great option there are

168
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,470
certain issues handling this is because

169
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,160
if the subdue dag is quite big it would

170
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:56,950
mean or sending a lot number of lot of

171
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,360
lot of dowels to see every Dao has a

172
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,779
sequence number and the state

173
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,700
information becomes too large to handle

174
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:05,890
implementation wise so it has a direct

175
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,080
impact on the RAM and things like that

176
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,650
you have to maintain the state while

177
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:14,709
while you send while you fragment the

178
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:16,270
DAO and then send it so one of the

179
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:21,010
implementation right what it does is it

180
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:22,750
just pushes all the subdue dag

181
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,640
information all the all the targets into

182
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:28,089
the same Dao and leaves it to the six

183
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:30,160
slow for fragmenting it that is that is

184
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:35,020
one option but then we have seen that it

185
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,319
it has a very I mean if you have like 20

186
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:40,360
nodes below your below you then the Dow

187
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,550
object is really really big object in

188
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,709
which case it will it results in more

189
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,599
than five fragments which case the

190
00:12:44,709 --> 00:12:50,229
performance at six slow fragmentation

191
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:55,870
goes back maybe maybe the other minimal

192
00:12:50,230 --> 00:13:00,010
fragment can help there but it's just

193
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:01,900
one hop so okay so yeah again but it

194
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:03,370
also definitely has an implication on

195
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,420
Ram because you have a different our

196
00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:05,620
sequence and if you enable

197
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:08,699
acknowledgment for

198
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:10,870
each of these douse you have to keep you

199
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:14,080
you might want to keep the information

200
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:20,440
in the memory while you are

201
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:22,690
retransmitting Pascal we're here so yes

202
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:27,370
I see that the specification is not very

203
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:29,770
specific about exactly what you say at

204
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:32,740
least what was in mind is your option -

205
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:35,770
that is if you're in norms if answer if

206
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:37,270
you're in storing mode you at the end of

207
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,310
the day you need to have this state

208
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:40,960
about all the children and children of

209
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:44,170
children all that they send out you need

210
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,920
to have it so even if you say if you do

211
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,020
your option one which will recursively

212
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,349
do the DTS and all the way down you will

213
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:55,930
end up in Nazi with all the state that

214
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,060
you talked about because that's that's

215
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:59,319
storing mode so at the end of the day

216
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:01,540
you need a state for all the children

217
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,040
and you need to know the latest path

218
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,890
sequence for all the children you need

219
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:09,130
that state so version two that you

220
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:12,580
mentioned Wendy reveals all this big

221
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,010
dowel to see it's just the same result

222
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,300
without the term sending the DTS end all

223
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,730
the way down but at the end of the day

224
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,579
the amount of State in C is the same

225
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:23,200
it's the collection of children so that

226
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,090
doesn't change the amount of State at

227
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,900
the end it just changes how much

228
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:30,910
messaging goes through and I would I

229
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:33,069
would say that in terms of bytes in the

230
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,750
air if you have to go the way to G 4G to

231
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:37,600
do the dowel it's more bytes in the air

232
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:42,070
than if D reconstructs it I would also

233
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:46,150
argue that we should pack many and we

234
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:48,490
can many targets into a single dowel

235
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,260
make the Dow as big as possible but

236
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:51,880
reasonably big because after that the

237
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,910
transmission has some chance to fail

238
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,210
right so it's not one that I prefer yet

239
00:14:54,910 --> 00:15:00,219
is that Walker packed targets at least

240
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:02,200
right but just we have to pass this

241
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,180
information on the best thing we can do

242
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:10,030
next is to compress this as much as we

243
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:14,829
can like in project down we use 8 OC 8 1

244
00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:16,030
3 8 to compress the the VR options at

245
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:18,610
some point we could use that same

246
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:22,470
compression in the Dow if we really

247
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:24,730
want to try to make it that's not as big

248
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:26,500
as a since you brought up the

249
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,970
compression issue here you know there's

250
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:30,220
one more thing that one more observation

251
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,430
that that that we have in context of

252
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:35,079
this compression every target and most

253
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,689
likely whatever the target information

254
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,890
that D has each one of the target has a

255
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,750
different path sequence and be a

256
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:43,269
different life path life time so what

257
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,100
happens is it is not possible to

258
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:46,630
aggregate multiple targets to the same

259
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,700
transit information option so you have a

260
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,100
one tagged transit information option

261
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,680
for every target two options going on

262
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,510
going out for every time so I mean

263
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,120
that's that's really too much of control

264
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,279
over at the per target having said that

265
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,170
what you say said this C needs to have

266
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:04,269
all the information and if you do reset

267
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,219
trickle timer and increment the DTS and

268
00:16:04,269 --> 00:16:07,990
it is definitely going to cause more

269
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,060
control over head whatever we do as

270
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,370
compared to D sending the aggregate at

271
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:15,518
now that is very clear and but it is it

272
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,380
is condom easy to implement and I can

273
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,519
see that is limited I have chosen the

274
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:23,800
shortcut and it's very easy Michael

275
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:25,060
Richardson so I I have I think three

276
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,709
questions and we've talked about this

277
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,869
what since the first version of your

278
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:36,310
draft right maybe was three years ago

279
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:38,380
right okay so I think that this may be

280
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:39,849
appropriate for I don't know if we want

281
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:41,560
to put this in a separate draft or just

282
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,180
writing it right eat down as an errata

283
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,310
four six five five Oh

284
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:46,989
for the moment once we have working

285
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:48,160
group consensus on the right answer I

286
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,600
mean we can leave it in your draft but

287
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,310
I'm just I'm not sure procedurally what

288
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,740
we will do with it with the conclusion I

289
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:56,500
think we can make it I think we can make

290
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,490
a conclusion finally for this that we

291
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,360
should yeah sure so so that was my first

292
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,240
question I'm not sure what the

293
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:10,079
procedural next step once we decide on

294
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,079
on a on a point the second question is

295
00:17:13,619 --> 00:17:18,290
is there an inch

296
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:23,989
operability issue here with whether or

297
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:28,220
not the decision about no D does one or

298
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:30,530
the other there is yeah so greed that

299
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,110
you brought up disappoint regards to

300
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,300
interoperability now the handling of

301
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,080
aggregated Dow well the RFC doesn't

302
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,590
mandate it

303
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,409
okay so RFC doesn't say so we already

304
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:44,570
have implementation we don't write and

305
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:47,630
quantity doesn't work at multiple hops

306
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,850
today so so so going with the second

307
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:52,059
option doesn't work because the handling

308
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,678
of the aggregated Dow is not clearly

309
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:57,050
articulated in the document so there's

310
00:17:54,679 --> 00:18:00,260
an errata right now or we can say thou

311
00:17:57,050 --> 00:18:02,360
shalt handle multiple dowels okay and so

312
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,820
we have an interoperability issue in the

313
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,169
meantime incrementing the DTS n is a

314
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,800
good thing we don't know whether the

315
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:11,750
downstream of sorry um is that on the

316
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,960
sender or the receiver so that's one on

317
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:16,880
see that has the issue no see doesn't

318
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,830
have an issue so it's it's it's it's the

319
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,870
sender D who needs to decide whether to

320
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:22,460
send aggregated now are just well the D

321
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,020
knows whether he handles aggregated

322
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,750
dolls or not he doesn't know if C

323
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:28,010
handles i aggregated dolls right so so

324
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,080
we do have an interrupt it's not a

325
00:18:28,010 --> 00:18:33,770
unilateral decision I know I implement

326
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,720
this code therefore I'm okay so it

327
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:39,320
because he doesn't know the best he can

328
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:42,679
do is send whether he's got whether he

329
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,470
implements increments DT SN or just

330
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:47,660
resend the data he's already got the

331
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:52,250
most pessimistic thing he has to do is

332
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:55,760
send single towels single single

333
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:59,390
prefixes per doubt right so if

334
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,190
introduced I what I'm saying Pascal just

335
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,890
saying we seem to be mixing two problems

336
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:07,670
right and just clarify that point one

337
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:10,910
which is whether the answers for all the

338
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:13,640
children and prone to is whether D

339
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:16,670
package them as few messages with a lot

340
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:19,280
of targets in them or as one big message

341
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:23,270
with all the targets in two prompts

342
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,750
right so my argument was sending the

343
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:28,790
test and recursively down is

344
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,149
quote-unquote a bad idea and to which

345
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,408
house

346
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:32,839
said yes but it's very easy to do

347
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:35,149
something like that but it's it's about

348
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,820
age and and it's not it's not just that

349
00:19:35,149 --> 00:19:39,678
it's easier to do it's that it results

350
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:41,619
in single dowels coming back up and

351
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,719
therefore you don't have to package them

352
00:19:41,619 --> 00:19:48,439
you can you can do single or multiple

353
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:50,839
and it does not necessarily I mean if

354
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,820
Dee decides to be a single dau it will

355
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:54,739
be a 1000 of them but it can package

356
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,999
them one by one if it likes to right

357
00:19:54,739 --> 00:19:58,700
it's not because he has them in memory

358
00:19:55,999 --> 00:20:01,039
that has to pack that so it's not I

359
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,690
agree with the same thing image the guy

360
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,889
below you did aggregation you just for

361
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:07,219
what that you get it would be aggregated

362
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:08,899
for you you wouldn't know so so I think

363
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:12,259
it's three two different products you

364
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:14,570
should so so okay so that's a good a

365
00:20:12,259 --> 00:20:16,279
good observation so that the the

366
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,779
multiple dowel we have a problem with

367
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:19,399
interoperability we have this problem

368
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:20,899
break it's nothing to do with packet

369
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:24,849
switching we just have that problem of

370
00:20:20,899 --> 00:20:27,439
there and it causes an issue right okay

371
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:29,779
it sounds like everyone would like to

372
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,259
use to do solution be it's a better

373
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:32,409
answer

374
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:33,979
we just don't know whether we can or not

375
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:36,739
that's the point

376
00:20:33,979 --> 00:20:38,929
yeah okay so having said that I want to

377
00:20:36,739 --> 00:20:42,739
ask not that many people in the room how

378
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:45,200
many people are have storing mop are

379
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:47,779
using it you're using it and you're

380
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,999
having difficulty across devices okay

381
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:54,200
anyway I didn't see behind me anyone put

382
00:20:49,999 --> 00:21:00,950
their hand up okay so anima ACP is using

383
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:04,039
storing right and we could probably at

384
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:05,779
this point you know say whether which

385
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:11,529
one mattered or something like that it's

386
00:21:05,779 --> 00:21:14,299
early days enough to do that I feel that

387
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:17,139
we shouldn't spend to this was my third

388
00:21:14,299 --> 00:21:21,289
point we shouldn't spend too much time

389
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:22,758
agonizing over this issue like it's not

390
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:25,129
work me I don't know if it's worth the

391
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:28,369
capability to solve to solve the

392
00:21:25,129 --> 00:21:29,570
multiple dowel point or not like we

393
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:31,129
could invent we could have a

394
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:33,468
capabilities we've discussed elsewhere

395
00:21:31,129 --> 00:21:36,228
right find it if all the nodes support

396
00:21:33,469 --> 00:21:38,929
packing dows and multiple dowels in a

397
00:21:36,229 --> 00:21:40,969
single message and if that's the case we

398
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:43,010
can say it's enabled because everyone

399
00:21:40,969 --> 00:21:44,600
supports it right

400
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:47,710
would be an example of using the

401
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,559
capability mechanism right to fix this

402
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:53,540
I'm not sure that's worthwhile for the

403
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:56,928
simple reason that I think we would be

404
00:21:53,540 --> 00:22:00,049
way better off to have non storing mode

405
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:02,929
of projected Dao as the other

406
00:22:00,049 --> 00:22:06,110
replacement regardless okay

407
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:08,900
and we may just want to write the errata

408
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:13,040
that says you should support multiple

409
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:19,010
dowels if you don't you have bug and you

410
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:21,409
should you you should resend them when

411
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:24,980
you change parents from your storage

412
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:26,720
rather than incrementing the DTS n right

413
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,840
okay we could write those two things

414
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,860
down and not really worry about the fact

415
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,290
that we may have a backward

416
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:35,600
compatibility issue with something yeah

417
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:37,399
so weak yeah right that's my suggestion

418
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,990
and then we can take that slide off your

419
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,090
deck and I'm sorry you know go on to the

420
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:43,220
next place right so I don't know if you

421
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,990
want to that's my suggestion and we

422
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:54,340
could huh monitor or whatever we want to

423
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:54,340
do all right okay

424
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,050
so again we coming to another topic

425
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:02,690
which we have discussed before but there

426
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:05,120
are some updates on this thus handling

427
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,580
so the Dow AK handling again this is not

428
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,919
much of an issue when you handle it in

429
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:12,290
non storing mo P because as you can see

430
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,030
here in the diagram that the root node

431
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:17,149
is going to send a now add back to the D

432
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:19,700
now that Dow AK is extremely important

433
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:22,310
for an in or any implementation because

434
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,980
that is the signaling which gives you an

435
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:27,379
indication that the application traffic

436
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,680
can begin that is the only indication

437
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:32,440
available on a big network that the

438
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:34,880
application traffic can be instantiated

439
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:36,230
so this is an extremely important point

440
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,390
so sadawa

441
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:40,160
needs to be handled in that sense so in

442
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,500
case of non story mode it is really

443
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,750
really simple because the root node if

444
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,440
it informs about the dirac everyone is

445
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:52,430
clear in case of storing MLP now again

446
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:54,860
what what we have is every the Dow AK is

447
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:58,850
sent on every hop by hop basis now know

448
00:23:54,860 --> 00:24:01,459
being here I know where when the node B

449
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:04,730
sends the DAO to node B it sends a Dao

450
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:08,840
ack instantaneously and relies on node B

451
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:11,720
to reliably send send now all the way or

452
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,090
to the to its upstream peer now there

453
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:16,190
are two problems with this this this

454
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:19,550
implementing or this this methodology

455
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:21,880
one is if the node B is going to

456
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:24,560
instantly respond back with the DAO AK

457
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:26,150
now X is no more an indication of

458
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,540
starting instantiating a traffic

459
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:31,700
instituting the traffic's so you can't

460
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,250
rather the the node here which might be

461
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,290
like ten hops deep should not really

462
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:39,200
instantiate its application traffic just

463
00:24:36,290 --> 00:24:41,750
because it got a dowel bag back from an

464
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,570
immediate upstream peer that is one

465
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:46,490
issue here the second issue is node B

466
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,460
for whatever reason it sends its upwards

467
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:52,040
that our reason that node a might report

468
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:55,280
a failure now act failure with a

469
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:57,889
negative status and since the dirac has

470
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,690
already been reported downstream the

471
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,450
negative status cannot be reported any

472
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,020
any further below so that is another

473
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,240
issue

474
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,410
so in storing mo P we really have

475
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,410
problem how to

476
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,860
yes master

477
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,450
yes two things here first are just sorry

478
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:17,419
to be back with time for me to dig the

479
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:18,920
DRF see there is a sentence in repo

480
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,810
which says the repo target option may be

481
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,830
repeated as necessary to indicate

482
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,750
multiple targets

483
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:25,879
I was surprised by your comment that you

484
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:30,020
could not agregate a package and because

485
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,430
we did it so I always thought we should

486
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,990
be doing it I was surprised that the

487
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:35,000
tech was gone from repo but it's there

488
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,180
it's expected that you can package

489
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:41,420
multiple targets sorry that was fun ok

490
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:43,130
so this part that's not yeah yeah yeah

491
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,120
it's it's its implementation back so so

492
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,010
it's good to have an implementation

493
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:48,860
recommendation I quickly loved the idea

494
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:50,390
and we so we should have like the side

495
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:53,419
document of shows or maybe have a

496
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,920
section for recommendations and that one

497
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,550
it's actually to implement it's

498
00:25:54,920 --> 00:26:02,600
recommended to do what the RCC

499
00:25:57,550 --> 00:26:04,700
so for this I agree and when you wrote

500
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,770
this or see this document it was true

501
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:11,060
but since then you wrote another

502
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:13,220
document which is d0 and so if you

503
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:15,530
wanted to we can explain how this you

504
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:16,700
can be used that is I'm sorry I didn't

505
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,070
get the context of this you in this

506
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:21,290
context so how does well if you have a

507
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,540
dour crime down there you can kill the

508
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:26,570
path to say I could not make it so

509
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,220
you're saying the DCO get a bird yeah it

510
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,659
still does not solve the first issue

511
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,610
right and which is which is the primary

512
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,500
design consideration yes you cannot stop

513
00:26:31,610 --> 00:26:36,590
the traffic immediately the traffic back

514
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,570
exactly that's that's true I mean is

515
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,879
there any other way for the node to know

516
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,740
when to start the application traffic

517
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,770
apart from this is what my other

518
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:49,760
question would be so this is this is

519
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:51,530
true so so it's non storing Michael

520
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,920
reducing and it's non storing note so if

521
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:58,220
and your example is so the the Dow a

522
00:26:54,920 --> 00:27:02,690
core the Dow from B to a has failed okay

523
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:05,690
D thought it could send traffic it's non

524
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:09,950
storing mode so excuse me it's storing

525
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:15,020
though so so the issue is that if D

526
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:17,810
start sending traffic up to be traffic

527
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,250
will not come back right so we can send

528
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:21,220
traffic and they can go out to the

529
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,930
network if he's sending you know

530
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:25,430
unidirectional traffic cool traffic

531
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:28,580
coming back doesn't work so if you tried

532
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,770
to do TCP or co-op okay for instance

533
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,230
which has a response then you're not

534
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:36,350
gonna get an answer okay

535
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:37,910
well that happens right and it's okay

536
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:41,870
that happens that's that's part of the

537
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:43,820
world right okay if B does have a route

538
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:49,070
let's say that's a bad example but let's

539
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:52,159
lose the case of F to D okay and Dino's

540
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:53,870
in the traffic is to see because it's

541
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,240
destined to see well D knows how to get

542
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:58,520
there see the fact that B and 8 don't

543
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,140
know how to get to F yet not so

544
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,090
important because the traffic is going

545
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:05,840
to see C actually has you know could

546
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:08,240
could be going back like by two ways but

547
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,000
so that's okay that traffic works and I

548
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,210
and I and I guess I would say it would

549
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,610
be okay to say da da AK means start

550
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:19,910
traffic but of course traffic doesn't

551
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:22,459
always reliable yeah so yeah so it's

552
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,810
just that in this case all the nodes

553
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:25,550
downstream starts

554
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,560
started and starts their application

555
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,710
traffic which simply aggravates the

556
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:33,139
situation so if there are a lot of nodes

557
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:35,060
below so it not only impacts the

558
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:37,820
application traffic but also the other

559
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:39,350
control traffic in the network so the

560
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:43,669
situation simply goes bad the network

561
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:47,449
convergence time is impacted terribly hi

562
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:50,780
Alvaro Dona featuring networks speaking

563
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:54,760
as a working contributor I kind of like

564
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:57,560
the DCO option just your color path

565
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,720
assuming we had a reason to the other

566
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:01,490
traffic all that stuff but was going to

567
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:05,690
say is that what other protocols do is

568
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:12,080
that they of course wait till the route

569
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:17,840
acts before acting that that's the next

570
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,760
line yeah yeah so there is another Dalek

571
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,600
interpretation which is essentially

572
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,930
whatever wire you're mentioning so

573
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:29,149
usually this is the case no D sense the

574
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,399
doubt would be and it simply

575
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,929
acknowledges back in other case

576
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:34,609
the Dow is send all the way back to the

577
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:36,950
root and then root acknowledges it back

578
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:39,978
well this is great I mean it definitely

579
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:41,599
is a clear indication of what once the

580
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:43,999
note gets the Dow acknowledgement it's a

581
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,739
clear indication that the application

582
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:47,450
traffic can be began but it has

583
00:29:45,739 --> 00:29:49,639
implications on the state information

584
00:29:47,450 --> 00:29:51,619
that has to be maintained on these notes

585
00:29:49,639 --> 00:29:55,968
intermediate hops so that state

586
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:58,759
information is on Pearl I mean that that

587
00:29:55,969 --> 00:30:00,379
is enormous I mean even if you if you

588
00:29:58,759 --> 00:30:03,109
add one byte it means you have to add

589
00:30:00,379 --> 00:30:06,379
one byte in the routing table which is

590
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:09,379
which is kind of fuchsia basically I'm

591
00:30:06,379 --> 00:30:12,259
just to give a little context on on the

592
00:30:09,379 --> 00:30:16,039
design so the official design is first

593
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:18,049
one you acknowledge per round by

594
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:20,389
acknowledging you say hey I have the

595
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:22,309
resources you don't say I have the path

596
00:30:20,389 --> 00:30:25,238
right that's part but we say other

597
00:30:22,309 --> 00:30:27,769
resources meaning that you take over

598
00:30:25,239 --> 00:30:30,919
responsibility to propagate watching to

599
00:30:27,769 --> 00:30:35,179
the root meaning also that if you fail

600
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:37,009
to do that then you will actually have

601
00:30:35,179 --> 00:30:38,809
to key on your relationship with that

602
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:41,330
child because you can't serve him as a

603
00:30:38,809 --> 00:30:43,820
parent Sue's that's how recursively

604
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:45,678
today it will reach the children the

605
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,689
problem with that is the only way to do

606
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,219
this because we didn't have the co was

607
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:52,669
to actually completely stopped being a

608
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:54,109
router for this guy and so you would

609
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:57,619
have to find another parents through

610
00:30:54,109 --> 00:30:59,389
which the path would work and that would

611
00:30:57,619 --> 00:31:00,918
happen somewhere like in not I for

612
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:02,209
instance even if you're serving the D if

613
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,559
naday it doesn't have enough resources

614
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:09,200
for all its children so not be trying to

615
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:12,559
forward the DAO we'd get a bad response

616
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,779
and and today a new iPhone would be well

617
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:16,668
that I would basically have to stop

618
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,889
being a router from Abby

619
00:31:16,669 --> 00:31:21,169
and hopefully not be would find another

620
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:22,820
path oh it would be disconnected if it's

621
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:26,539
disconnected you poison the graph that

622
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:28,279
blah blah so it's not like you're stuck

623
00:31:26,539 --> 00:31:30,799
there is something which will happen

624
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:34,969
even shall I like either you're detached

625
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,359
or the the packet will find its way so

626
00:31:34,969 --> 00:31:41,690
the only real problem is you don't know

627
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:43,339
how much to wait till you've got your

628
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,290
routing back that's so you don't have

629
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:48,379
any assurance coming from the routes

630
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:50,000
okay now I see you right but but it's

631
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,130
not like we're honest uation well the

632
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:54,260
pot all be stuck in a state everybody's

633
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:58,790
waiting nothing happening so there is

634
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:00,200
always a next step which may end up

635
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:06,830
breaking everything but at least you

636
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:09,470
know about it well the other scheme does

637
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:10,970
not exist I mean it's easy so this

638
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:13,100
scheme that that the world is talking

639
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,890
about is a trick that was implemented by

640
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:18,860
Kentucky because they wanted to do

641
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:20,360
something to work fine for them forth

642
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,909
because they wanted to make a product

643
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,560
with power plugs and so it's that's why

644
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:26,270
you find it in Kentucky but it's not in

645
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,950
the spike the spec was never meant to do

646
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,370
this second thing it's not like that I

647
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:37,430
don't think there is ambiguity there you

648
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:41,810
did well okay well that was not known to

649
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:43,160
be because the department that is what

650
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:45,230
kind of time out do you have and how

651
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,110
long because if the network is very slow

652
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:50,030
I mean the dowel work if you just sell

653
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:52,129
it it fails and you don't get an

654
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:54,230
acknowledgement and you're there and so

655
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:56,420
so and it can be mounted how what would

656
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:58,310
be do your time out when do you start

657
00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:00,620
thinking I didn't work I should try to

658
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,120
fire another one it's like we're less

659
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,590
naughty hope we do acknowledgement at

660
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,409
every hops because otherwise it can be

661
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:08,899
very very slow so so what's your timeout

662
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:10,760
if do you know standard owl which is

663
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,140
supposed to be propagated and then come

664
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,570
back and anything can happen at every

665
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,450
step the timeout is kind of long now and

666
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:19,100
the rich rise of the all the paths it's

667
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:24,080
much more costly to recover then you

668
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:26,659
should do it right fails so Pascal here

669
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,939
we can call Kentucky's implementation

670
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:31,250
another interpretation of the draft but

671
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:34,820
they have not really violated any of the

672
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:43,100
I mean any of the recommend any of the

673
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:47,740
specification take probably corrective

674
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:50,510
it's okay

675
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,420
yes what about what is the desired way

676
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,910
so status is equal to zero endow act

677
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:57,860
should serve as an indication that the

678
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:59,390
path is established that

679
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,120
I think is definitely needed in story

680
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:05,900
mode of operation in any mode of

681
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,280
operation for that matter and it's we

682
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,840
hoping that there should not be an

683
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:11,210
explicit state that should be required

684
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:14,929
to be maintained on intermediate 6l ours

685
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:17,179
for thou a king I mean if at the same

686
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:22,639
time we can handle Dawa aggregation that

687
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:25,250
will be really great so going to the

688
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,409
next point here about signaling resource

689
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:32,270
constraints so signaling resource

690
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:34,909
constraint so the point here is that

691
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:37,699
mentioned that is the let's say node B

692
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:42,470
note D has gone through node B and node

693
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:43,908
B has limited resources and some of the

694
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,618
nodes in the sub doodads have already

695
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:48,169
attached to node D but now it cannot

696
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:51,889
take any nodes further so we don't have

697
00:34:48,168 --> 00:34:53,540
any metric system to tell to percolate

698
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,879
this information down down down words

699
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:57,440
now we have enrollment priority which is

700
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:00,350
coming up it's a step in that direction

701
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,190
but it helps at the same at a single hop

702
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:06,259
is what my understanding is and if we

703
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,700
need to go it further down if you need

704
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:10,040
to send this information further down we

705
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,669
need to somehow put this information in

706
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:18,109
to the metrics constraints using 6 5 5 4

707
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:20,480
and then handle in you try to write the

708
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:22,160
draw from these providing this

709
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,230
information through the Dao packets and

710
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:26,359
the metric Wars is the remaining

711
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:28,520
resources that we have remaining

712
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,440
resources right you have seen and then

713
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,680
we translated this to the enrollment

714
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:41,030
priority that's how Michael goes across

715
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:43,310
but for the moment and Michael Yin so so

716
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,720
if I recall that was there was your

717
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:48,410
draft that had a whole bunch of

718
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,149
unbalanced trees yes ok so I don't

719
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,460
understand the last point but needs to

720
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,790
be used with multiple hops maybe I don't

721
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:58,400
maybe maybe that's wrong or maybe I just

722
00:35:55,790 --> 00:36:00,470
don't understand the point what why is

723
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,410
it not more usable at multiple hops

724
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:07,790
meaning it's not a can't tell see that

725
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:09,230
it's out of space or no if B let's say

726
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,308
for example this is the routing distant

727
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:12,559
that's the same example if we

728
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,959
take if note edge is going to send it

729
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:16,819
down it goes through F it goes to the OD

730
00:36:14,959 --> 00:36:19,069
and then finally it ends up at B but B

731
00:36:16,819 --> 00:36:22,099
responds back with a negative status now

732
00:36:19,069 --> 00:36:24,049
only only H has to be impacted not D and

733
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,939
F so it's there is no point in these

734
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:30,049
which I see I see the point is that that

735
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:32,420
that D would switch um when B said I

736
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:34,999
haven't got any space that would cause D

737
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:37,160
to switch to C well C might not have

738
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:41,749
space for the whole thing either right

739
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:45,229
and the answer is that somehow the the

740
00:36:41,749 --> 00:36:47,868
tree has to be split across B and C but

741
00:36:45,229 --> 00:36:50,149
both F is in the way we can't in this

742
00:36:47,869 --> 00:36:54,709
network F has to pick one parent or the

743
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:56,779
other right so it can't we don't maybe

744
00:36:54,709 --> 00:36:59,569
there is no solution yeah there is no

745
00:36:56,779 --> 00:37:02,689
solution as a foul I mean right now if

746
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:04,099
you see that the other graph that was

747
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:05,509
talking about it doesn't handle the

748
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:08,539
solution that the scenario that you just

749
00:37:05,509 --> 00:37:10,670
mentioned right so so we can't solve the

750
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:15,499
problem that B and C don't have enough

751
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:16,969
space for D F G and H there if neither

752
00:37:15,499 --> 00:37:20,089
have enough space it doesn't matter

753
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:22,549
where D goes your stock and and we can

754
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:25,578
look down it as God and see that the

755
00:37:22,549 --> 00:37:27,829
problems not solvable so the fact that

756
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:30,589
we can't signal it's not it is maybe not

757
00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:32,319
so important we would have to do

758
00:37:30,589 --> 00:37:35,150
something else F would have to somehow

759
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:38,989
be able to have two parents D and E to

760
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:40,849
split if that were possible and I guess

761
00:37:38,989 --> 00:37:43,910
F somehow has enough space for gene H

762
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:46,640
but the combination of G H and F is too

763
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,410
much for and E is too much for the nodes

764
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,150
above right because there's other we

765
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:52,308
could assume there's other part of the

766
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,539
tree as well if this usually happens if

767
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:55,729
you have a lot of notes if you have

768
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:58,699
thousand notes network and somewhere

769
00:37:55,729 --> 00:38:02,569
upstream the the the situation is quite

770
00:37:58,699 --> 00:38:06,349
easy to be a it can be very easily

771
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:09,079
produced there yes so we actually we

772
00:38:06,349 --> 00:38:10,969
spent a lot of time when we devised the

773
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:13,039
first repo wondering if we should be

774
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:14,900
doing something for that one and

775
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,479
actually it was favoring being at least

776
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:20,239
able to say I can't I can't take more

777
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:22,759
resource just status at least right so

778
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,000
so you can push back children to the

779
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:26,520
left to the right

780
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,440
whatever you do in the distributed

781
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,850
fashion like this since it's an

782
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,740
np-complete problem at the end of the

783
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:33,569
day you can only push back and push back

784
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,419
and push back as you put more and more

785
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,310
complex stuff in the solution space you

786
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,780
and signalling and stuff you push back

787
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:42,060
the primer little bit and the more

788
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:44,640
little bit and another little bit and

789
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,540
it's expressional e difficult and and

790
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,509
you win an expansion elation s whatever

791
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:54,120
so we spoke a lot against people said

792
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:56,190
this document is too sick already so

793
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,049
let's not make ripple more complex and

794
00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:01,440
that's how we ended up with this

795
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:04,970
constraint but basically any node

796
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,560
whether it's G of a should have enough

797
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:10,799
resources in storing mode for the whole

798
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,940
network whatever got almost all enough

799
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,470
storing load space

800
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,450
whichever your position in the graph and

801
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:21,270
if you want to shift functions if you

802
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,009
have enough memory for 100 nodes on the

803
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:25,590
on the box you should say don't be able

804
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,420
to network with more than 100 nodes with

805
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:29,700
this device in storage node that's kind

806
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:32,430
of what the conclusion was whenever we

807
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,770
said anything else is just incremental

808
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:38,040
and to to complicate yet bla bla bla so

809
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:40,590
it's kind of a decision we took at the

810
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,630
time that can be revised that you know

811
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:46,230
in a distributed fashion it's very very

812
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,940
hard to to do other things so we prefer

813
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,420
work on the NP tower or things like that

814
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:54,860
right so just to come to that point I

815
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:57,530
mean it's it's it is completely I mean I

816
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:00,450
understand that we take a decision about

817
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,850
making I mean taking this decision that

818
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:05,520
node fde all this node should have

819
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:08,670
enough resources to hold the company but

820
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,320
this this this this this design

821
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:14,850
assumption never came into 6550 and

822
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,000
people who are deploying it eventually

823
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:19,980
realize at a later stage that this this

824
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,930
this could be a very big issue and that

825
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:23,280
is what you know is one of the point

826
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:28,230
that should be mentioned somewhere oh

827
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:31,080
yeah sure but it's the early point is

828
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,730
it's not even a developer recommendation

829
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,500
it's not an L week type of thing it's a

830
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:37,180
type of thing right when you build

831
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,470
product when you use a product you

832
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,790
should you should not choose throwing

833
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:44,109
mode in the network speaker than this

834
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:45,730
product can do it even I notice it's not

835
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:48,640
even implementation recommendation like

836
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:50,320
a lot of things right it's deeper yeah

837
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,379
the use case document says that you know

838
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,730
we should be using storing mode for we

839
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,070
can use touring mode for thousands of

840
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:59,170
network nodes at least that document

841
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,860
maybe we should have captured it or what

842
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:06,580
do you think how can we use right I mean

843
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:11,380
a thousand nodes is a few ten thousand

844
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:12,670
well maybe 100k memory for some box 100k

845
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:15,400
is nothing for some others it's

846
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:18,430
impossible I mean you can have a power

847
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:21,190
grid meter which is always powered and

848
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:23,529
that cost thousands of dollars anyway so

849
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:27,160
I think one leg of memory in this niche

850
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:29,110
is no problem so this is a layer 3

851
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:31,930
protocol it doesn't really make

852
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:34,900
assumptions on what the hardware or even

853
00:41:31,930 --> 00:41:38,919
if it's a ratio right we said animal

854
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:40,750
uses repo on Ethernet so so then no

855
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,010
assumption at layer 3 it's just that if

856
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:43,600
you really want to use it in the

857
00:41:42,010 --> 00:41:46,420
constraint network with constrained

858
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,870
devices then yes it starts towing mode

859
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:52,420
impacts the size of the networking with

860
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,220
the memory you can put into it so it

861
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:56,320
should be written somewhere agree I'm

862
00:41:54,220 --> 00:42:00,490
just glad that we have this on record

863
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:02,950
that you know we we need the nodes to be

864
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:06,160
equally capable all the nodes from

865
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:08,549
resource wise if you really want storing

866
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,330
more mo bit to be used yeah

867
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:14,860
ok going to the next point here the the

868
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:16,540
transit information option the design

869
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:18,280
goal of transit information option was

870
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:19,660
to make sure that we map one or more

871
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,360
transit information to one or more

872
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,370
targets provide a syntax for aggregating

873
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,010
common transit information option but

874
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:29,350
then what whatever what I can see and

875
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:31,720
yeah maybe I would like to be corrected

876
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:33,520
from the working group the certain

877
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:36,459
elements of the transit information

878
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,590
option for exam the external is not with

879
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:41,890
regards to the transit right it's it's

880
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:43,620
it's a target specific flag similarly

881
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:46,210
the path sequence and path lifetime

882
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,370
these these these characteristics are

883
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:51,360
not related to

884
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:53,370
it is about specific target now what

885
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,800
happens is once you have this target

886
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,839
specific options information going into

887
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,670
transit information option the

888
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,850
aggregation options are limited now you

889
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:06,960
can't have multiple targets pointing to

890
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:09,150
the same transit information option copy

891
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,760
theory is Kelly here again this is only

892
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:15,270
meant for if I have this device and it

893
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,460
has multiple either of tethered devices

894
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:19,950
like leaves which would be the route to

895
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,040
it or multiple addresses into this

896
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,810
device then you can aggregate it this

897
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:26,700
way because you will notice them as a

898
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:29,310
package every time but that's the only

899
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:32,279
cares pretty much but but just just some

900
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:34,380
time back use we talked about that the

901
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,730
same mechanism is going to be used in

902
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:41,520
context of pattern switching I mean we

903
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:51,570
discussed now right that we need

904
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:54,330
aggregate income factor this is

905
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:57,840
factorization with about so factorizing

906
00:43:54,330 --> 00:44:01,100
a transit for multiple targets works if

907
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:04,470
all those targets are kind of co-located

908
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:06,000
location meaning for instance a reaper

909
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:08,970
unaware leaf which would not even

910
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,350
understand the rule draft so so it could

911
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,180
not be mobile at all it would be

912
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:15,480
physically attached to the river water

913
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:19,379
just like a card or USB cable or

914
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,390
whatever else and so you could have a

915
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:23,100
number of addresses that are really

916
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,960
packed together from where they are

917
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,730
attached in the ripple Network in which

918
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,860
case you could factorize them with a Jo

919
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:31,770
but that's the only case I have in mind

920
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:33,660
what this could happen yeah okay so just

921
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:35,250
one question so in case of unaware news

922
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,720
we still have the path lifetime which

923
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:38,760
has been informed which may be informed

924
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,629
from them from the unaware leave through

925
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:44,040
Andy right I mean it's still the bot

926
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,870
lifetime might still eventually be

927
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,759
derived from nd then propagated by our

928
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,420
Phillips yes in this case it's not

929
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,510
factorizable

930
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:54,810
yeah and inverse means T they are in

931
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:56,850
really like completely slave okay

932
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:00,440
the road raft with eight five four five

933
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:02,900
decouples the two so the rules

934
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:04,340
can move from one parent to another and

935
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:07,250
that's when it needs to be able to have

936
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,480
its own path sequence because the the

937
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:10,910
path will be injected other than

938
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,290
different paths and they will compare to

939
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:14,629
common parent somewhere with the basic

940
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:16,630
ones but if the device itself cannot

941
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,340
provide the path sequence it cannot move

942
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:21,920
and then if you cannot move that's what

943
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:25,040
I mean by tethered physically attached

944
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,810
yeah so in this case the device cannot

945
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,330
gender cannot give us a part sequence

946
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,740
but it can give us a part lifetime well

947
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:32,270
there is no protocol for that right at

948
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:35,120
five four five is the protocol for both

949
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:38,509
so I expect that device that ste third

950
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:40,730
is an ipv6 host with zero zero but

951
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,040
nothing like at five four five so since

952
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,260
we have nothing else it means that it's

953
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:48,230
it's just doing no more even normal and

954
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,710
gee I don't know right and so so the six

955
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:53,930
the repo router would learn that the

956
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:56,240
device is sure through snooping and EEO

957
00:45:53,930 --> 00:45:58,060
those weird stuff and then it would

958
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,140
translate that into repo if you'd like

959
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:02,779
we don't have a spec for that it's

960
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:06,549
doable I don't want to write a spec for

961
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:09,080
that because we have a try for five but

962
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,910
what in mint either I mean this could be

963
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,620
the water that does the river water

964
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,770
could be a big router it could add

965
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:19,250
multiple Ethernet interfaces on which

966
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:22,970
you could plug physically some devices

967
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:24,770
or it could be USB ports and it would

968
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,850
just report them together so it's a

969
00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:32,480
possibility that's when you factorize

970
00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:34,370
right so basically we still say that we

971
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:44,000
have one Tier one target for most of our

972
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:45,799
time all right so so alighting options

973
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,530
maybe I won't talk much about this the

974
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,990
only thing is we have the draft updated

975
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:53,780
for this there is a scenario where you

976
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:56,479
can't so RFC 6550 already says that

977
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,430
configuration option can be lighted but

978
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,560
there is a scenario where it cannot be

979
00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,000
so we had updated the observations out

980
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,140
but I am NOT going to talk into detail

981
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,630
about this because you already have

982
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:07,430
another draft about this so so we'll

983
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:09,470
discuss about this yeah the whole

984
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,180
purpose of having that draft the next

985
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:13,609
part and I really would like to have a

986
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:16,009
clear conclusion on this

987
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:20,030
that regarding the RPL persistent state

988
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:22,220
that has to be maintained now for every

989
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:24,740
lollipop counter for the linear part we

990
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,810
need the persistent purse persistent

991
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:28,700
memory position storage if you do not

992
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:30,799
have a persistent storage it is possible

993
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:33,259
that there are lot of scenarios where a

994
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,430
node might not be able to join in the

995
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:39,890
network for a long long time

996
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:41,990
now the question is whether a so we had

997
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:44,770
discussed this back and we have a clear

998
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:47,479
understanding that if the node reboots

999
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:49,070
during the linear part there is no way

1000
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:50,810
to know that it has rebooted or the

1001
00:47:49,070 --> 00:47:53,150
other nodes it is not possible for it to

1002
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:55,090
know that it is a rebooted and this is a

1003
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:59,710
very important problem to handle because

1004
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:59,710
nodes might get rebooted a lot of times

1005
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:08,600
yes two things the first one is you have

1006
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,190
to adjust the linear path so you avoid

1007
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:11,870
this progress much as you can second is

1008
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,670
when you are in the linear part why do

1009
00:48:11,870 --> 00:48:16,310
we have a linear path right why don't we

1010
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,870
just have a point zero many protocols

1011
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:20,060
just at the point zero and this gives

1012
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:21,589
zero when you keep turning so we have a

1013
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:23,660
linear path because we may lose some

1014
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:27,920
messages so we want to have a chance to

1015
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:29,960
increase and still detect so if I send a

1016
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:32,000
message that indicates that rebooted and

1017
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:33,800
is lost then people will miss five out

1018
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,620
that every booted so I think a linear

1019
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:38,810
path gives me like sixteen chances for

1020
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:41,810
people around me to realize that I have

1021
00:48:38,810 --> 00:48:44,029
rebooted or something now if I send one

1022
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:46,820
of this message every year then I will

1023
00:48:44,030 --> 00:48:49,310
be all my life in in your part if I use

1024
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:51,440
sixteen right like sixteen years so

1025
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:53,390
obviously you need to achieve the linear

1026
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,870
path with the frequency at which you

1027
00:48:53,390 --> 00:49:00,080
send those messages right and if you

1028
00:48:56,870 --> 00:49:01,819
thought if you send them frequently at

1029
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,170
least when you reboot use you just want

1030
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:05,510
to send a batch on them to make sure

1031
00:49:03,170 --> 00:49:07,100
people heard it then you can keep it to

1032
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:10,490
sixteen now if you decide to be very

1033
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,110
slow shrink it let's take an example of

1034
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,540
DTS n here you know let's take an

1035
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:15,770
example of DTS and now if we follow the

1036
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,390
logic where DTS and doesn't get

1037
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:19,580
incremented when the parent switches and

1038
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,980
there it's hardly possible so in this

1039
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:24,230
case what would I mean

1040
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,420
6550 says recommends the sequence window

1041
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:26,930
of sixteen in this case it's very

1042
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:29,839
difficult

1043
00:49:26,930 --> 00:49:32,569
to recover from that we should basically

1044
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:36,670
update that depending on which field it

1045
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:40,579
is as I'm writing the P Dow we have

1046
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:42,290
several seconds contours there I give a

1047
00:49:40,579 --> 00:49:46,339
different value for starting the relief

1048
00:49:42,290 --> 00:49:49,279
up I say basically just I don't remember

1049
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:54,319
about something like 254 so it has very

1050
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:57,589
very short enough but when yes we just

1051
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:01,670
put 16 and twas mostly thought for the

1052
00:49:57,589 --> 00:50:03,349
ions and now well it's too much unless

1053
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:06,650
you really send them a rapid it's too

1054
00:50:03,349 --> 00:50:09,380
much I mean the problem with DTS n is if

1055
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:11,660
you don't know how much is tool is okay

1056
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,599
for example we can't even say for is

1057
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,609
okay because even if we keep it for it

1058
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:19,280
will may still take really really long

1059
00:50:16,609 --> 00:50:21,319
for nodes to recover if the DTS and

1060
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,220
information is lost because if we

1061
00:50:21,319 --> 00:50:23,839
underwear because we are not

1062
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:25,368
incrementing DTS infrequent well the

1063
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:27,078
point is you should be I mean that's

1064
00:50:25,369 --> 00:50:30,500
what I was trying to say if you use a

1065
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:33,619
linear part something should be

1066
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:35,450
basically there is a tension between you

1067
00:50:33,619 --> 00:50:36,890
don't want to stay in that part on time

1068
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:39,290
so if you have a big number you should

1069
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:41,569
have a short interval the problem we're

1070
00:50:39,290 --> 00:50:43,279
having DTS and in short interval well

1071
00:50:41,569 --> 00:50:44,990
the cool thing about it is that if some

1072
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,160
child missed that your granny the DTS

1073
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:48,709
end because reason reason reason

1074
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:50,868
encouraging DTS and each type in a short

1075
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:52,220
interval they will end up seeing it so

1076
00:50:50,869 --> 00:50:52,640
you will have the doubt so that's the

1077
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:55,669
good news

1078
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,940
now the bad news is is that all your

1079
00:50:55,670 --> 00:51:03,220
children will will send you their stuff

1080
00:50:58,940 --> 00:51:03,220
and that you don't want because

1081
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:09,590
so run children you will get that

1082
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,170
repeated 16 times so basically I think

1083
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:15,320
in we should be same case-by-case and

1084
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:17,420
and talk about how often as you're in

1085
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:20,150
the linear case you need something more

1086
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:23,210
often and how long should that in our

1087
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:26,660
case be in for DTS ed probably almost

1088
00:51:23,210 --> 00:51:28,640
zero understand with UD TSN is a bad

1089
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:31,250
idea dinner parties should not be that

1090
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,990
long so so it's 60 inches like the

1091
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,720
default for the new normal mechanism but

1092
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:37,819
we should have stated over this flow for

1093
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,069
this message it's this is the the length

1094
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:41,780
of the linear part which I'm doing now

1095
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:43,550
for P now you will find if you look at

1096
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:46,040
the letters P Dow you will find that

1097
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:51,080
every sequence counter are the size of

1098
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,460
inner part which is not 16 so what what

1099
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,020
should we do so basically we have a lot

1100
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:55,610
of lollipop counters and you should look

1101
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:58,520
at all of them one by one and provide a

1102
00:51:55,610 --> 00:52:00,650
different increment value and and say

1103
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:04,490
words which are related with a frequency

1104
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:08,090
you send and so that it belongs to very

1105
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:09,649
like limited life span after that you in

1106
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:11,300
the circular part once you're in the

1107
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:13,820
circular part you can space what you

1108
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,640
sell much much more but something around

1109
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:18,440
the fact that the trickle timer should

1110
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,690
stay for instance for those which are

1111
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,400
below trickle they should stay small

1112
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:24,290
until you're in the circular part you

1113
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,420
never wrote anything like that but the

1114
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:32,000
you should not trickle out is showing

1115
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:33,980
the linear part okay so this is an

1116
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,200
interesting topic because this talks

1117
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,200
about part control bits and I'm not sure

1118
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,509
if there is any implementation which

1119
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:44,509
uses this stuff well it occupies a lot

1120
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:47,750
of real estate in 6550 but no one uses

1121
00:52:44,510 --> 00:52:51,230
it as far as I know as of now well it's

1122
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:53,360
a it's a very it no it's a very flexible

1123
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:55,550
logic for having multiple download

1124
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:58,190
routes you can have multiple download

1125
00:52:55,550 --> 00:53:01,300
routes with preferred routing over these

1126
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:03,970
routes using path control bits now the

1127
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:06,020
point that I'm trying to make here is

1128
00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:07,430
path control bits it's not an easy

1129
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:09,020
mechanism to implement at all it

1130
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:10,339
completely directly implements the

1131
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,290
memory size and the program size

1132
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,020
everything but it might be useful in the

1133
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,220
future for sixty show draw is what I

1134
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,000
because it allows you to have multiple

1135
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:18,350
down

1136
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,840
routes and allows you to load balance

1137
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:22,850
and do things like that having said that

1138
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:25,010
I don't know if there is any

1139
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:27,040
implementation which is compliant with

1140
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:29,650
the use of pod control bits in fact

1141
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:33,680
almost every implementation is

1142
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:36,530
non-compliant with 6550 today because 60

1143
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,359
65 50 says that a node must not unicast

1144
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:40,400
a down message that has no active bits

1145
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:41,930
set in the path control field set I

1146
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:44,810
don't know if anyone any implementation

1147
00:53:41,930 --> 00:53:48,020
which is setting this this the bit

1148
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:50,420
correctly or handling this bit at all so

1149
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:53,860
so essentially there is no

1150
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:57,560
implementation which implement 65 52

1151
00:53:53,860 --> 00:54:00,470
appropriately yes and jojos would come

1152
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:03,140
to a mic here but this is this is a

1153
00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:05,330
basic thing even if it's complex I mean

1154
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,620
the results kind of basics because you

1155
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:09,230
know your picture illustrates that you

1156
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:12,500
can end up going through the same parts

1157
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:15,560
exactly so there are new proposals which

1158
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,500
are a bit more intelligent than this

1159
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,720
okay and so if nobody implemented it it

1160
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,630
could be something we duplicate when we

1161
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,399
revisit repo for instance the fact that

1162
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:28,550
you look at common home parents allows

1163
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:30,230
you to ensure that that you can do you

1164
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:33,110
talk about roll right roll has a lot to

1165
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:34,640
do with having redundant to parents

1166
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:37,310
having the same two children so you can

1167
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:38,299
crisscross and so this is not capable of

1168
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:40,759
doing this because you have no

1169
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:42,440
visibility of who's your grandparent so

1170
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,990
so I think the new algorithm such as

1171
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,720
Georgia's draft how much more powerful

1172
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:49,339
than this so if we end up thinking a

1173
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,259
four or six days you want to do

1174
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:53,390
something like that now I would tend to

1175
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:56,150
think that we need to look at the newer

1176
00:54:53,390 --> 00:54:57,710
approaches and duplicate this but I

1177
00:54:56,150 --> 00:54:59,210
think the new approach that we are

1178
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:01,640
talking about I mean I'm assuming you're

1179
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:03,350
talking about the NS exchange ins in

1180
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,750
which case it has a different set of

1181
00:55:03,350 --> 00:55:07,069
assumptions the design consideration

1182
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:09,440
including the security considerations

1183
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:12,680
the security aspects overhearing

1184
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,750
requires you to have all the nodes using

1185
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,399
the same network key while di or

1186
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:18,440
requires but in this case what we are

1187
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,300
saying is the data path uses the shared

1188
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:23,300
key which is a big very big implication

1189
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:25,370
in my hearing yes for although you're in

1190
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:27,590
packets right now over here in packets

1191
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:29,069
is is a one of the benefits you can do

1192
00:55:27,590 --> 00:55:30,630
with the NSA

1193
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:33,930
extension but at least it also builds

1194
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:36,570
you ain't path which has redundancy in

1195
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:37,890
the fact that those two parents see

1196
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:40,260
those two children so the packet can

1197
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,700
even go from parent to parent even the

1198
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:43,290
unique guys from different keys or this

1199
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:44,549
bound to this child or this part to this

1200
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,020
child or they know that if you reach

1201
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,120
those two chart they can still forward

1202
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:50,759
on the same guidance so you get this

1203
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:52,170
integration between two paths that go

1204
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,690
from the root to the child that that's

1205
00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:56,190
one of the benefits of the draft so it's

1206
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,690
not you're not building like say two

1207
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:59,340
paths which are far away from one

1208
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,570
another or the three converge

1209
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:02,790
you're building two paths which are

1210
00:56:00,570 --> 00:56:04,590
integrated with one another so so you

1211
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,750
have redundancy at every hop of the way

1212
00:56:04,590 --> 00:56:09,120
as much as you can even if you don't

1213
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:10,350
over here so ever giving is the same you

1214
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:12,750
can do because you've got this

1215
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:14,400
interrogation but the first thing you do

1216
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:16,740
is intricate the path as opposed to

1217
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,900
having button exactly like this okay so

1218
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:28,410
okay so yeah alright so okay okay so

1219
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:30,840
right okay coming to the last I'm almost

1220
00:56:28,410 --> 00:56:32,370
done the miscellaneous section mandating

1221
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,990
we support for reception of aggregated

1222
00:56:32,370 --> 00:56:35,609
targets I think we should clearly

1223
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:37,919
mention this in the raft somewhere or

1224
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:40,530
somewhere in the the aggregated now

1225
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:44,910
should be handed by the receiving no is

1226
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:46,830
it possible okay the DAO AK I don't know

1227
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:51,089
why Dow AK is mentioned as I showed in

1228
00:56:46,830 --> 00:56:54,270
6550 it should actually be must so the

1229
00:56:51,090 --> 00:56:57,120
the receiver node might on saying the K

1230
00:56:54,270 --> 00:57:01,170
flag might still decide not to send now

1231
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:03,600
acts that is what it means in case of

1232
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:06,120
multi do dragon multi instance I think I

1233
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:07,259
mean we have we still have a work in

1234
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,180
progress but there are certain

1235
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:10,740
observations basically one one important

1236
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,149
observation that we have is should the

1237
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,520
routing table the reset when switching

1238
00:57:12,150 --> 00:57:16,440
from one do that to another in the same

1239
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:18,090
instance not talking about different

1240
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:21,030
instance so there are certain

1241
00:57:18,090 --> 00:57:22,710
implementation practices which I mean if

1242
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,210
the vendors could be confused about when

1243
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:27,300
implementing multiple two dies and

1244
00:57:24,210 --> 00:57:30,450
multiple instances transit information

1245
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:33,120
option is an OP is an optional element

1246
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:35,910
but I don't see how it can be optional

1247
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:37,650
at all in case of stowed non storing

1248
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:40,350
mode as well as in storing mode it has

1249
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:41,700
to be mandatory but the DAF says that it

1250
00:57:40,350 --> 00:57:43,019
may be same

1251
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:47,368
the transit information option may be

1252
00:57:43,019 --> 00:57:49,049
sin I'm just wondering whether is it

1253
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:50,309
better to have for us to have some

1254
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:52,920
mineral PL or something like that

1255
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:54,359
without part control bets anyways most

1256
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:57,359
most of the folks are not using path

1257
00:57:54,359 --> 00:57:59,819
control beds seek condense the whole

1258
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:02,069
archaeologic into very specific you know

1259
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:03,930
memory optimized and maybe we have clear

1260
00:58:02,069 --> 00:58:06,900
assumption saying that it works only for

1261
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:09,000
such kind of devices and you know the

1262
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,559
general art pill can work for the bigger

1263
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,710
set of devices including at on it and

1264
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:16,200
things like that for a CPUs case but can

1265
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:18,000
we have a mineral feel like thing so

1266
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,980
that is one of the question that I would

1267
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,200
like to ask to this okay group having

1268
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:25,410
said that the Dow AK there are some

1269
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:27,058
possibly that I know that Robbie is

1270
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:29,670
working on the prototype and draft

1271
00:58:27,059 --> 00:58:32,460
implementing a draft which clarifies how

1272
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:35,670
to how do he he was not in time for this

1273
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:37,799
idea but he's trying to prototype and

1274
00:58:35,670 --> 00:58:40,109
try to get some numbers as in the

1275
00:58:37,799 --> 00:58:42,690
control overhead and all that so Dow AK

1276
00:58:40,109 --> 00:58:44,848
that there is one more option that is

1277
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:46,799
trying to check whether just like non

1278
00:58:44,849 --> 00:58:49,349
storing mode if we have a Dow AK

1279
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:50,788
reported back from the root to the know

1280
00:58:49,349 --> 00:58:57,480
what it means

1281
00:58:50,789 --> 00:59:00,119
what what will it result into so that's

1282
00:58:57,480 --> 00:59:02,160
K once you have the DCI and you have

1283
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:04,019
statuses be a 120 H which you know you

1284
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,629
to do anything you like which is

1285
00:59:04,019 --> 00:59:09,089
positive you could have a state either

1286
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:11,519
this yellow value below 128 which which

1287
00:59:09,089 --> 00:59:13,558
is triggered by a new bit in the Dow and

1288
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,000
when it which is the root order which is

1289
00:59:13,559 --> 00:59:20,789
this bit just fly fire on this year with

1290
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,339
status warm too I'm just worried about

1291
00:59:20,789 --> 00:59:26,390
the other case that we talked about you

1292
00:59:23,339 --> 00:59:28,470
know about instantiating the app graphic

1293
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:31,078
so you need now act

1294
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:34,078
do you know for the node to know whether

1295
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:36,059
it can instantiate the app traffic so if

1296
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:37,319
this here is the case where you can

1297
00:59:36,059 --> 00:59:39,509
clean up the route if there is a

1298
00:59:37,319 --> 00:59:41,069
negative failure I'm just thinking of

1299
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:43,380
this you it's it's a very powerful thing

1300
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:44,339
it's the only message we have going down

1301
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:47,549
the geotag

1302
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:51,328
a.m. so for now it was meant to destroy

1303
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:53,400
something but us as a sweetened it now

1304
00:59:51,329 --> 00:59:54,490
it carries a repo status when it was

1305
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:57,010
very recent but

1306
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:59,109
does the report status in it and for now

1307
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:01,450
it's always considered as a newer to

1308
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:04,930
sell it the CEO but since we can report

1309
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:07,390
a status below 128 and it's not yet son

1310
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:09,850
to the Aussie editor you could still say

1311
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:11,710
a by the way there is no snooze statuses

1312
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:14,140
which means those new things and one

1313
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:16,210
status disuse and by the roots down and

1314
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:19,000
you see I'm going I guess it could just

1315
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:20,500
mean either art is open fire but if you

1316
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,720
get the DCO from the word it means you

1317
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:24,670
can reach you now it's not telling you

1318
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,680
you can go you can do anything it just

1319
01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:28,180
tells you the route can reach you

1320
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:30,910
because the rest of the internet may be

1321
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:33,819
brokered we don't want you office co-op

1322
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:36,100
may still not work maybe maybe the name

1323
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:40,200
that we used was not right maybe we

1324
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,200
should not have called a cleanup object

1325
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:48,160
dot would you see to to small when let's

1326
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,610
try to keep open the options we have

1327
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:55,810
here ok so it still it's all that

1328
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:59,020
alright hope you heard so the bottom

1329
01:00:55,810 --> 01:01:02,290
line is the CEO is a powerful tool we

1330
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:04,810
can use it for more than just cleaning a

1331
01:01:02,290 --> 01:01:07,359
path because now we have a repo status

1332
01:01:04,810 --> 01:01:09,160
in it and the ripple status below 128

1333
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:11,140
could be more information like oh I'm

1334
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:13,960
the route and that you can reach I can

1335
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:17,500
reach you now so so you can do the hop

1336
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:18,970
by hop back but a flag in the Dow when

1337
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:20,500
it reaches the route could trigger or

1338
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:24,368
the CEO from the route back to the notes

1339
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:27,010
I oak offset you can fire if we want it

1340
01:01:24,369 --> 01:01:29,590
to right it's just that I think if

1341
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:31,270
message just from one proposed since

1342
01:01:29,590 --> 01:01:33,580
since the only message that goes down I

1343
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:36,369
think it's a bit of a waste now we see

1344
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:38,040
more value of using this yellow for and

1345
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:41,080
we can forget what this show is about

1346
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:42,580
yeah I'll find a new acronym something

1347
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:44,980
which stays this year which is more

1348
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:47,619
generally thank you thank you for

1349
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:49,990
bringing up our big data yeah okay

1350
01:01:47,619 --> 01:01:52,570
so there's still some other points which

1351
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:54,069
are uncovered which are which possibly

1352
01:01:52,570 --> 01:01:55,869
might get updated in the future or

1353
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:58,090
version of the draft it's about the

1354
01:01:55,869 --> 01:02:00,400
multi sink and water outer practices if

1355
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:02,140
an implementation has to use multiple

1356
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,000
things multiple border routers multiple

1357
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:06,129
doodads what are the best implementation

1358
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,050
practices that one should follow

1359
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,700
the multicast operations there a lot of

1360
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:11,040
configuration items in multicast

1361
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,990
operations which have to be synchronized

1362
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:17,470
appropriately to all the nodes

1363
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:19,419
secondly the SM RF + sm RF while it has

1364
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:22,140
been widely used in the networks it has

1365
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,300
not been standardized for some reason so

1366
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:28,618
it seems I don't know if there has been

1367
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:31,420
any attempt of standardizing such things

1368
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:34,900
the next part is the partial dependency

1369
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:36,220
on nd so now today we have prefix

1370
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:39,100
information option which is which is

1371
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:40,270
part of our PL but there is a there is a

1372
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,830
whole lot of other information for

1373
01:02:40,270 --> 01:02:43,240
example the DNS configuration which

1374
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:46,210
needs to be given from the border out

1375
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:48,850
all the way to the to the node this

1376
01:02:46,210 --> 01:02:52,140
information still relies on the on the

1377
01:02:48,850 --> 01:02:55,180
RS are a kind of signaling mechanism so

1378
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:57,220
boobage should we really have this

1379
01:02:55,180 --> 01:03:11,440
partial dependency on and is still with

1380
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:14,980
ripple is the another question my

1381
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,400
question I would like to say that if I

1382
01:03:14,980 --> 01:03:25,630
would be very happy to put context stuff

1383
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:29,109
into di O's and be okay without nd I

1384
01:03:25,630 --> 01:03:32,530
think that's okay the the the corollary

1385
01:03:29,109 --> 01:03:34,840
is that you know we made some effort to

1386
01:03:32,530 --> 01:03:39,250
or they come the converses we've made

1387
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:43,270
some effort to support unaware leaves so

1388
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:46,240
we actually need nd for all of that so I

1389
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:48,220
would say that's a you know kind of here

1390
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:51,009
know there and and maybe the answer is

1391
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:53,649
we should put it in the DI O's for

1392
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:56,740
networks that have no on note no leaves

1393
01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:58,570
and if we have routers that expect to 6l

1394
01:03:56,740 --> 01:03:59,560
RS that expect to have leaves because

1395
01:03:58,570 --> 01:04:02,680
that's the kind of network there are

1396
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:04,570
then they should do it that way that I

1397
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,339
don't I don't know

1398
01:04:04,570 --> 01:04:08,500
the example that I give you know the DNS

1399
01:04:06,340 --> 01:04:10,750
the DNS configuration it's a must-have

1400
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:12,520
thing for all the nodes it simply

1401
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,630
doesn't have it today if you are

1402
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:16,200
actually connecting to the internet

1403
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:17,440
directly from the node without any

1404
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,509
further

1405
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:25,270
although yeah but we

1406
01:04:19,510 --> 01:04:26,530
you can also use DHCP right so it goes

1407
01:04:25,270 --> 01:04:29,680
all the way up to the top to get that

1408
01:04:26,530 --> 01:04:32,260
info I mean I mean it may be expensive

1409
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:34,270
but DNS lookups aren't gonna do that too

1410
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:39,850
so if you really are doing DNS lookups

1411
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:42,670
then you know I don't know I maybe we

1412
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:43,839
should maybe we should have a maybe we

1413
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:48,630
should have a conversation about

1414
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:48,630
configuration information okay

1415
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:55,690
the cool thing is now we have the

1416
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:59,230
capability to relied configuration

1417
01:04:55,690 --> 01:05:01,720
information meaning that now we are we

1418
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:08,290
can be a lot richer in what we push in

1419
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:11,470
the configuration for this protocol of

1420
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:13,990
thing there was a lot of discussion till

1421
01:05:11,470 --> 01:05:17,379
the end of repo where for instance for

1422
01:05:13,990 --> 01:05:19,689
the SLA option because there's one thing

1423
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:23,859
is these implementations which don't

1424
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:27,520
rely on RS array but just on D iOS they

1425
01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:30,190
are violating ipv6 because you're

1426
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:33,160
supposed to resolve the address of the

1427
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:36,820
router using in RS multicast and they're

1428
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:39,220
a unicast back that's n D and if you

1429
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:40,690
just wait for a DI Yahoo and pick the

1430
01:05:39,220 --> 01:05:44,319
MAC address of the router from there

1431
01:05:40,690 --> 01:05:46,960
you're violating now it would have been

1432
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:50,740
very very easy to put succinctly address

1433
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:54,130
in the DI or for instance certified I

1434
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:56,229
lost it's not there because we wanted to

1435
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,630
keep the spec and the implementations

1436
01:05:56,230 --> 01:06:00,369
thin or something so so I mean that

1437
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:02,710
person counts it's not like it's obvious

1438
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:04,180
but the bottom line is at the time we

1439
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:06,070
could not realize options so now again

1440
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:08,830
ok ok

1441
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:10,859
preyas so just before I'm all out of

1442
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:13,240
this you know I just want to state that

1443
01:06:10,859 --> 01:06:16,450
the next attempt for this job would be

1444
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:18,129
to actually get some numbers in terms of

1445
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:20,520
the control overhead that have been

1446
01:06:18,130 --> 01:06:23,170
caused by these different mechanisms and

1447
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:27,040
tell the working group what implication

1448
01:06:23,170 --> 01:06:30,220
it might have you know another

1449
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:32,740
information that may be useful in my

1450
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:33,160
original mind the IO was adaption in

1451
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:38,279
there

1452
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:42,279
it was a radio array with Dao and people

1453
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:46,269
meaning list we agreed to split that and

1454
01:06:42,279 --> 01:06:48,220
I think the most very acceptable reason

1455
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:50,649
for splitting was that some information

1456
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:51,970
that you usually find narrow is sent at

1457
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:54,069
a different pace and for different

1458
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:56,348
reasons then find some information that

1459
01:06:54,069 --> 01:06:58,299
you find that Dao right so you can

1460
01:06:56,349 --> 01:07:02,200
expect that in the network like this GRA

1461
01:06:58,299 --> 01:07:04,690
will be a lot less frequent then at

1462
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:08,200
Yahoo now the prime is if there are a

1463
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:09,759
are not frequent it might be that the

1464
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,328
first thing that note sees is a di oh

1465
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:15,759
right well become internet yo-yo so you

1466
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:17,079
don't want to wait for our array after

1467
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:19,539
you got the jelly which could be a long

1468
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:22,690
time so now you end up broadcasting in

1469
01:07:19,539 --> 01:07:24,220
our eyes and so so you wonder if you

1470
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:26,980
could put enough information that you

1471
01:07:24,220 --> 01:07:28,990
don't need the array for the ripple

1472
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:32,019
stuff which is I guess your point then

1473
01:07:28,990 --> 01:07:34,359
you could start working right away and

1474
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:36,459
actually the way we did ripple we re

1475
01:07:34,359 --> 01:07:39,190
expected to put in the options just

1476
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:42,190
change their minimum which is just avoid

1477
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:45,130
alignment and and so express things in

1478
01:07:42,190 --> 01:07:46,720
in bytes and supposed to act a 2 to 4 4

1479
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:49,059
bytes so just generally you need at the

1480
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:51,009
size and look at the PIO that's exactly

1481
01:07:49,059 --> 01:07:54,039
what it is right so it's really meant to

1482
01:07:51,009 --> 01:07:55,029
package more options Roy it's just that

1483
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:59,130
we didn't do it

1484
01:07:55,029 --> 01:08:03,849
ok so fully supportive if you start

1485
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:06,160
thank you thank you very much please say

1486
01:08:03,849 --> 01:08:08,289
voluntary if you want to do some

1487
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:11,618
implementation about what the topics not

1488
01:08:08,289 --> 01:08:14,140
I'm saying could be very useful or if

1489
01:08:11,619 --> 01:08:17,080
you want to write you can start with a

1490
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:20,080
lollipop contest like a document how can

1491
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:23,408
I paint each counter that we have in in

1492
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:26,649
britain you can start writing voluntary

1493
01:08:23,408 --> 01:08:29,080
and contact us around how can i how can

1494
01:08:26,649 --> 01:08:31,719
you help us I mean there is a lot of

1495
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:38,318
more to do and we are happy to have new

1496
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:45,569
comers does it have something thank you

1497
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:45,569
now Pascal

1498
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:49,569
[Music]

1499
01:08:50,238 --> 01:09:00,839
okay

1500
01:08:51,738 --> 01:09:06,388
Thank You eNOS so yes this is about the

1501
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:08,639
projected down document so we did a lot

1502
01:09:06,389 --> 01:09:13,109
of work in the last month since last

1503
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:15,750
IETF on Pio and on the rule so last HF

1504
01:09:13,109 --> 01:09:18,449
we decided number of things and I will

1505
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:23,599
go through them we decided to add more

1506
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:23,598
capabilities to the PDR drafts and so I

1507
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:29,639
try to propose things on email didn't

1508
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:32,429
get a lot of responses so I thought let

1509
01:09:29,639 --> 01:09:34,889
me write down and publish starting

1510
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:36,179
points so they are not fully agreed by

1511
01:09:34,889 --> 01:09:39,060
the groups that's why I'm presenting

1512
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:41,279
them today and I really hope expect that

1513
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:43,679
I'll get feedback from you guys is it

1514
01:09:41,279 --> 01:09:46,259
taking the right path but since we added

1515
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:48,179
all these new things I expect churn in

1516
01:09:46,259 --> 01:09:49,799
the document count till all of those

1517
01:09:48,179 --> 01:09:52,920
things settle to something that the

1518
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:55,710
group likes and that's why December is

1519
01:09:52,920 --> 01:10:27,960
not a feasible date because of all these

1520
01:09:55,710 --> 01:10:29,730
additions we made so I I have two slides

1521
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:32,790
just for the changes I light and it's

1522
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:36,178
just the eyes so yes I mean you see that

1523
01:10:32,790 --> 01:10:37,889
the number has increased as well so the

1524
01:10:36,179 --> 01:10:42,510
first thing we said we should be doing

1525
01:10:37,889 --> 01:10:44,610
and this one was easy is the option is

1526
01:10:42,510 --> 01:10:46,409
big because you have a sequence of ipv6

1527
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:49,679
addresses so what we decided to do is

1528
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:51,809
compress it and very easy because it one

1529
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,630
through I 3:8 says ok take a reference

1530
01:10:51,810 --> 01:10:55,889
address and you just have to put the

1531
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,950
bytes which are different from that

1532
01:10:55,889 --> 01:11:00,550
address

1533
01:10:56,950 --> 01:11:02,590
thing is you have the same compression

1534
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:05,680
for all the addresses in the in the P

1535
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:08,980
Dow so either you you put more segments

1536
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:10,750
or you just have to use the same number

1537
01:11:08,980 --> 01:11:12,969
of bytes five row address because that's

1538
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:15,790
what the compression value tells you so

1539
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:18,250
as written right now a P Dow is a

1540
01:11:15,790 --> 01:11:20,080
segment and the segment has the same

1541
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:21,700
compression for all the addresses so if

1542
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:23,140
one could be compressed to two bytes but

1543
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,880
the next is to four bytes you learned

1544
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:28,540
everybody to four bytes which is pretty

1545
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:34,300
much the way we did in six five five

1546
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:36,550
three okay so basically the reaction

1547
01:11:34,300 --> 01:11:37,840
noise is much smaller because we can

1548
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:41,230
compress to two or four bytes or

1549
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,750
something like that second thing it's

1550
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:45,160
related question that Michael placed in

1551
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,990
the mailing list is how do you manage

1552
01:11:45,160 --> 01:11:49,059
this thing creating it is good but you

1553
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:51,730
need to delete it you need to update it

1554
01:11:49,060 --> 01:11:55,660
and for that you need to identify it in

1555
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:58,389
the first place so we were missing when

1556
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:00,010
identifier for each path that you are

1557
01:11:58,390 --> 01:12:02,800
creating so we can say hey we are going

1558
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:05,140
to destroy it and we needed the usual

1559
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:06,940
sequence like the path lifetime and the

1560
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:10,240
path sequence this exact same thing were

1561
01:12:06,940 --> 01:12:13,389
needed but first we needed a path ID and

1562
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:15,550
if you read the 60s architecture you

1563
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:21,040
will find that 60s already describes

1564
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:23,890
that actually a path that we built in

1565
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:25,780
60-ish is called the track - because

1566
01:12:23,890 --> 01:12:27,730
path is so generic that you never know

1567
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:31,210
what you're talking about is it a multi

1568
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:32,769
path a single path so track is more

1569
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:34,750
specific to what we are talking about

1570
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:36,730
it's kind of the directly sik graph to

1571
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:39,030
this nation so you can have some degree

1572
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:43,719
of redundancy to get to that destination

1573
01:12:39,030 --> 01:12:47,170
in repo add a model for index this thing

1574
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:48,910
which is the local instance ID so the

1575
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:51,040
local instance ID is a number which is

1576
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:52,780
taken from a namespace which belongs to

1577
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:55,060
the destination or the source of the

1578
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:57,730
packet since we are talking about a

1579
01:12:55,060 --> 01:12:59,350
traffic engineer path to a certain

1580
01:12:57,730 --> 01:13:01,629
destination the packets always go to

1581
01:12:59,350 --> 01:13:03,340
that destination so it's kind of logical

1582
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:05,770
to take the number from the name space

1583
01:13:03,340 --> 01:13:07,300
of the destination so it's just like

1584
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:09,430
your use today all right you send a

1585
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,219
packet towards the route well if it's a

1586
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,989
global is

1587
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:14,329
you just look at the instance ID but if

1588
01:13:11,989 --> 01:13:16,098
it was a local instance the route the

1589
01:13:14,329 --> 01:13:17,929
packet would be flagged so that the

1590
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:20,090
destination plus the local instance ID

1591
01:13:17,929 --> 01:13:22,550
in the RPI I tell you what geotag that

1592
01:13:20,090 --> 01:13:25,269
is which tells you what routing table

1593
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:28,190
you need to look at to route this packet

1594
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:30,440
so we just sixty said generalize that

1595
01:13:28,190 --> 01:13:32,030
for trucks and that's that's now

1596
01:13:30,440 --> 01:13:33,768
replicated in this draft so we're

1597
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:36,440
consistent with this draft under sixty

1598
01:13:33,769 --> 01:13:40,130
shark-attack sure so the track ID is

1599
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:42,739
really a repo a local repo instance ID

1600
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:45,139
which is associated with the destination

1601
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:46,759
address of the packet that flow in this

1602
01:13:45,139 --> 01:13:48,550
do dark towards that target

1603
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,679
it's called in I have a question here

1604
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:54,499
how do we define this truck like we have

1605
01:13:51,679 --> 01:13:58,400
the ID but how this truck will be

1606
01:13:54,499 --> 01:14:01,639
defined which changes so the world could

1607
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:04,940
be updated basically now you have a

1608
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:07,489
track ID the route will send a new Pio

1609
01:14:04,940 --> 01:14:11,329
message to update it with the same track

1610
01:14:07,489 --> 01:14:13,159
ID and a new path sequence cutoff so and

1611
01:14:11,329 --> 01:14:14,989
the new path sequence kind of remove the

1612
01:14:13,159 --> 01:14:16,969
old one life time of zero we move what

1613
01:14:14,989 --> 01:14:18,589
you had if you have the same sequence

1614
01:14:16,969 --> 01:14:20,420
number it's a rich why you should

1615
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:21,590
forward it the way it is but not you

1616
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:23,150
don't have to change anything because

1617
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:24,190
the same as before so maybe it was lost

1618
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:27,768
a bit later

1619
01:14:24,190 --> 01:14:30,589
so that's installing it is the good old

1620
01:14:27,769 --> 01:14:33,860
pedal that we had forever but now it's

1621
01:14:30,590 --> 01:14:35,360
more like being able to retry a packet

1622
01:14:33,860 --> 01:14:38,989
that did not make its way all the way to

1623
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:40,900
the end or update what you had is a kill

1624
01:14:38,989 --> 01:14:43,249
it with a lifetime zero or

1625
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:45,049
change you know something in the past

1626
01:14:43,249 --> 01:14:47,360
which was like this now it's going like

1627
01:14:45,050 --> 01:14:49,610
this so you may need to kill the old one

1628
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:52,159
installed a new one but maybe some hopes

1629
01:14:49,610 --> 01:14:53,690
were come on so instead of discarding

1630
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:56,719
everything and recreating everything you

1631
01:14:53,690 --> 01:14:58,699
just want to update what you had so so

1632
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,349
then we can do all those inspire because

1633
01:14:58,699 --> 01:15:04,579
we have a sequence counter and a

1634
01:15:00,349 --> 01:15:06,050
lifetime and I will come back to that

1635
01:15:04,579 --> 01:15:09,469
because there is another side effect of

1636
01:15:06,050 --> 01:15:13,429
what we discussed last time we're also

1637
01:15:09,469 --> 01:15:16,760
missing a segment ID because a track is

1638
01:15:13,429 --> 01:15:18,499
not a serial path why because if you

1639
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:21,289
have a control a controller are they are

1640
01:15:18,499 --> 01:15:24,090
outside of your say say typical ripple

1641
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:28,559
Network is a fan right fill our network

1642
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:30,650
smoked with you do that I do that the

1643
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:33,540
control is far away the network is slow

1644
01:15:30,650 --> 01:15:34,980
so if you build on your serial path and

1645
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:36,480
there is some Prime on that path you

1646
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,239
need to go back to controller to fix it

1647
01:15:36,480 --> 01:15:41,190
you don't have the time so you really

1648
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:43,619
need the path to be very resilient for

1649
01:15:41,190 --> 01:15:44,909
the possessor wrong problem if the path

1650
01:15:43,619 --> 01:15:46,980
is very resilient it means it has

1651
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:48,690
multiple segments it has one way north

1652
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:50,369
one myself and maybe replication

1653
01:15:48,690 --> 01:15:52,739
elimination between those and maybe

1654
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:55,460
several even north-south middle blah

1655
01:15:52,739 --> 01:15:58,080
blah blah and they hold the same track

1656
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:59,489
there are different segments on the same

1657
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,989
track when you put all the segment's

1658
01:15:59,489 --> 01:16:03,659
together you get the vision of the track

1659
01:16:00,989 --> 01:16:05,428
so we needed not only a track ID but

1660
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:07,170
also a segment ID so you could modify a

1661
01:16:05,429 --> 01:16:09,929
segment without repainting the whole

1662
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:11,429
track so the red best version that was

1663
01:16:09,929 --> 01:16:12,719
missing in the previous version the

1664
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:13,230
latest version that I published this

1665
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,480
morning

1666
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:19,169
I added back the segment ideas which

1667
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:20,699
were missing what is the same promise

1668
01:16:19,170 --> 01:16:21,960
Michael said how do you manage this

1669
01:16:20,699 --> 01:16:24,449
thing the first thing you need to manage

1670
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:26,969
it is to identify it so this piece is

1671
01:16:24,449 --> 01:16:28,469
solved now if we don't have everything

1672
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:30,139
we need to manage it and that would be

1673
01:16:28,469 --> 01:16:32,280
discussion in the mailing list

1674
01:16:30,139 --> 01:16:34,949
another thing we said we would be doing

1675
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:36,750
is add sibling information because

1676
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:38,250
initially when you register off we said

1677
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:41,340
oh there will be another protocol to

1678
01:16:38,250 --> 01:16:43,469
expose the the logical structure to the

1679
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:45,270
route and that's not feed out but

1680
01:16:43,469 --> 01:16:46,860
nothing came up and then we end up with

1681
01:16:45,270 --> 01:16:48,739
the wrong projection mechanism but no

1682
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:51,598
way to expose the topology to the route

1683
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:55,799
we said a in story mode the route

1684
01:16:51,599 --> 01:16:57,239
already knows the dirt dag right so the

1685
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:59,909
only thing that's real missing is a few

1686
01:16:57,239 --> 01:17:01,909
siblings and then the root is enough so

1687
01:16:59,909 --> 01:17:03,960
why don't we package that into bid out

1688
01:17:01,909 --> 01:17:06,780
ravage other father

1689
01:17:03,960 --> 01:17:09,090
strangely enough I discovered that part

1690
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:11,639
control birds can actually do that so in

1691
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:13,619
in transit information option it is

1692
01:17:11,639 --> 01:17:16,409
possible using transmitters it is

1693
01:17:13,619 --> 01:17:18,659
possible for one target to send multiple

1694
01:17:16,409 --> 01:17:21,420
transit information options with

1695
01:17:18,659 --> 01:17:23,190
different parents to the route and I

1696
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:25,590
discovered this very recently that it is

1697
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:27,480
possible for the node to sing tell the

1698
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:29,790
route that it is attached to all the

1699
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:32,940
server right but they are parents so so

1700
01:17:29,790 --> 01:17:34,260
what and so we needed to be able to see

1701
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:37,509
know something which was not apparent

1702
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:40,210
and the poem with a norm parent

1703
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:44,140
is well you want it to be able to signal

1704
01:17:40,210 --> 01:17:46,120
like the sub-matrix and so so basically

1705
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:47,739
this the sibling information can have

1706
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:50,110
complimentary containers and that was

1707
01:17:47,739 --> 01:17:51,549
actually you Rabia yes Westers I don't

1708
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:54,339
remember somebody Estes was a great

1709
01:17:51,550 --> 01:17:56,739
question so now since it was this case

1710
01:17:54,340 --> 01:17:58,780
on the mailing list this one it's not

1711
01:17:56,739 --> 01:18:02,339
only sibling but also some metrics about

1712
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:05,410
you know between you and the sibling

1713
01:18:02,340 --> 01:18:08,320
very important the sibling selection is

1714
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:10,030
out of scope this is just signaling you

1715
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:12,759
expressed a retarded sibling the route

1716
01:18:10,030 --> 01:18:14,800
manages with that now say I'm in a very

1717
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:17,739
dense Network like thousands of nodes

1718
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:21,670
around me I won't be able to report one

1719
01:18:17,739 --> 01:18:23,500
thousand seedlings to the route worse

1720
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:24,820
than that it's not only knowing that you

1721
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:27,370
are sibling it's also maintaining

1722
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:29,110
bi-directional connectivity with them or

1723
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:31,260
at least having some packets between

1724
01:18:29,110 --> 01:18:33,639
them so you know the signal strength and

1725
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:36,280
so you realize that something will have

1726
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:38,200
to be done to select siblings in all

1727
01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:40,840
directions so I can get anywhere as

1728
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:43,150
opposed to taking for instance the three

1729
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,739
best seed neighbors which are all on my

1730
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:47,799
right so if I use them I can never go

1731
01:18:44,739 --> 01:18:51,879
left so that there is a prime of sibling

1732
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:53,590
selection which is not addressed by this

1733
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:56,440
draft I don't I don't see that we should

1734
01:18:53,590 --> 01:18:57,850
address it because some networks they

1735
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:59,860
don't need it because you have few

1736
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:01,540
siblings and you can report them or some

1737
01:18:59,860 --> 01:19:04,000
other networks have different sort of

1738
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:06,700
siblings and I see the sibling selection

1739
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,830
as an objective function problem just

1740
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:11,559
like gof is separated from a pole the

1741
01:19:08,830 --> 01:19:13,630
sibling selection could be various

1742
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:16,330
intelligences based on various networks

1743
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:18,760
and I expect that we would see documents

1744
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:21,000
coming to them to row just about

1745
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:23,380
objective function to select siblings

1746
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,880
the result of that objective function

1747
01:19:23,380 --> 01:19:26,380
will be I said like I said like those

1748
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,170
three siblings and now report them to

1749
01:19:26,380 --> 01:19:30,670
this thing so this is more like repo we

1750
01:19:29,170 --> 01:19:32,890
don't give the objective function we say

1751
01:19:30,670 --> 01:19:34,600
there is this plug-in and now we expect

1752
01:19:32,890 --> 01:19:39,400
some different plugins for different

1753
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:42,640
situations to come up ok so that's so my

1754
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:44,650
lights okay yeah disorder request at

1755
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:48,340
least by two people I see that the

1756
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:50,330
Chinese is on on the mythic oh and there

1757
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,910
was another person

1758
01:19:50,330 --> 01:19:53,830
for it may be ready again I don't

1759
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:57,650
remember

1760
01:19:53,830 --> 01:19:57,920
so that was oh and that was what's your

1761
01:19:57,650 --> 01:20:00,799
name

1762
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,990
well I'm sorry um well I remember whom

1763
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,670
but not his name anyway so so number of

1764
01:20:02,990 --> 01:20:07,010
people asked for the capability for a

1765
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:08,840
node in the repo network to say a mr.

1766
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:12,500
root I want a path to this other guy

1767
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:16,250
so now we have a PD request and the

1768
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:17,750
people request acknowledgement which is

1769
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:21,590
a unique aspect get to the root and back

1770
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:23,510
and that's the response tells you I'm

1771
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:25,430
mr. wood and I have taken you your

1772
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:28,100
problem into account and then you expect

1773
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:29,660
some Pio to come back later but at least

1774
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:31,460
an acknowledgement from the root that

1775
01:20:29,660 --> 01:20:33,380
you understand that you asked him to do

1776
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:35,480
this and the root will come back with a

1777
01:20:33,380 --> 01:20:37,430
track ID in the response so when you see

1778
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:38,929
that the the PD our coming with this

1779
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:42,650
track ID no it's the one that is

1780
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:44,000
actually built for your request and same

1781
01:20:42,650 --> 01:20:45,740
thing you have lifetime so you can also

1782
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,330
ask the root to answer it by putting a

1783
01:20:45,740 --> 01:20:49,160
lifetime of zero blah blah blah so it's

1784
01:20:47,330 --> 01:20:52,490
a simple mechanism this one does not

1785
01:20:49,160 --> 01:20:55,760
I hope this did not need a lot of in the

1786
01:20:52,490 --> 01:20:57,800
future and it's missing and I don't know

1787
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:01,060
if you wanted to define it here we might

1788
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:03,950
have something like a metric container

1789
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:05,720
but the metrics would be about the

1790
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:09,889
quality of the path that you want to

1791
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:12,680
build like if I want to say I want a

1792
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:14,360
pass with three nines which means that

1793
01:21:12,680 --> 01:21:15,500
the route will have to compute or the

1794
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:18,019
controller somewhere I will have to

1795
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:21,080
compute maybe more paths because with

1796
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:22,940
two paths I can only have two nights so

1797
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:24,740
you know being able to express the

1798
01:21:22,940 --> 01:21:26,389
quality of the path that you want to be

1799
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:29,929
able to do maximum latency or whatever

1800
01:21:26,390 --> 01:21:32,270
else that needs to be expressed as

1801
01:21:29,930 --> 01:21:33,590
metrics it's probably not exactly the

1802
01:21:32,270 --> 01:21:36,530
type of things we have today in our

1803
01:21:33,590 --> 01:21:40,190
metric containers I don't know so right

1804
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:42,679
now I just notice when we remember we

1805
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:45,290
know that when we asked our path we

1806
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:47,450
don't give like characteristics of the

1807
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:48,890
path we want to build if you want to be

1808
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:51,200
able to indicate that that we need to

1809
01:21:48,890 --> 01:21:53,600
improve this section by saying here is

1810
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:54,950
container of some form with metrics

1811
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:57,800
which indicate the quality of the path

1812
01:21:54,950 --> 01:22:00,630
you want to be able up to you up to the

1813
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:03,690
meaningless to say we needed the

1814
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:05,130
a lot of work on the iana etc we still

1815
01:22:03,690 --> 01:22:08,759
need and that's one of the issues we

1816
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:12,420
have a better security section so going

1817
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:16,469
to a little bit more details so the new

1818
01:22:12,420 --> 01:22:18,929
fields are here oh by the way just to

1819
01:22:16,469 --> 01:22:20,699
differentiate what we do for from the

1820
01:22:18,929 --> 01:22:24,179
path for instance in the transit

1821
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:25,799
information I rename the same track and

1822
01:22:24,179 --> 01:22:27,090
segment because you have the two

1823
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,969
components right the track is a

1824
01:22:27,090 --> 01:22:31,830
collection of segments maybe a truck is

1825
01:22:29,969 --> 01:22:33,360
just one segment if it's a serial path

1826
01:22:31,830 --> 01:22:35,100
but the truck can also be a collection

1827
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,659
of segments so instead of cutting

1828
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:38,040
something paths and I don't know if it

1829
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:41,159
would be this thing or that saying that

1830
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:43,620
I should call paths I put a different

1831
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:46,710
name track ID at segment ID the track ID

1832
01:22:43,620 --> 01:22:49,019
is a local repo instance you will find

1833
01:22:46,710 --> 01:22:52,110
it in the packets associated with the

1834
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:54,000
destination and so in the PD all you've

1835
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:57,000
got a target for the destination so

1836
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:58,800
target plus truck ID gives you the

1837
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:02,960
destination that I get with the FBI

1838
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,960
that's how you match one with the other

1839
01:23:03,290 --> 01:23:07,800
so you by the way doing this we don't

1840
01:23:05,969 --> 01:23:11,520
change the report data plane right we

1841
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:13,380
use the data plan as it stems so just

1842
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,420
just to clarify here so the track ID

1843
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:18,179
will be used eventually in the data

1844
01:23:15,420 --> 01:23:19,949
plane as well but segment ID one is

1845
01:23:18,179 --> 01:23:23,580
purely for management purposes surely to

1846
01:23:19,949 --> 01:23:25,650
build it right so because you might have

1847
01:23:23,580 --> 01:23:28,769
a VR for one segment and then as Elvia

1848
01:23:25,650 --> 01:23:30,629
for segment and lower segment they are

1849
01:23:28,770 --> 01:23:32,130
in the same track but when you forward

1850
01:23:30,630 --> 01:23:33,929
you don't negate which segment that's

1851
01:23:32,130 --> 01:23:35,820
maybe you will tell me you need to and

1852
01:23:33,929 --> 01:23:39,179
then with James thanks but the way the

1853
01:23:35,820 --> 01:23:41,540
draft is written right now we say put it

1854
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:43,050
on this track and it's up to wow

1855
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:44,760
Wednesday morning

1856
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:46,770
please attend Rome Wednesday morning

1857
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,150
it's up to Rahl to make the decision of

1858
01:23:46,770 --> 01:23:49,949
amusing the upper segment the lower

1859
01:23:48,150 --> 01:23:51,480
segment I'm using both I'm doing

1860
01:23:49,949 --> 01:23:53,099
application English evaluating

1861
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:57,870
constructive interference and whatever

1862
01:23:53,100 --> 01:24:00,870
else and so for each you need a sequence

1863
01:23:57,870 --> 01:24:03,570
right so both track sequence which tell

1864
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:05,969
you when you flush the track you have

1865
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:07,500
and build a new one and something for

1866
01:24:05,969 --> 01:24:10,050
each segment individually within the

1867
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:12,030
same track so if you see the same track

1868
01:24:10,050 --> 01:24:14,569
sequence and the same fragments in same

1869
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:16,669
fragments segment sequence

1870
01:24:14,569 --> 01:24:19,010
what does that mean well it probably

1871
01:24:16,669 --> 01:24:21,469
means that you have a storing mode P Dow

1872
01:24:19,010 --> 01:24:22,999
which was sent by the root and they

1873
01:24:21,469 --> 01:24:25,249
would never get never got an

1874
01:24:22,999 --> 01:24:27,919
acknowledgement so it's just we trying

1875
01:24:25,249 --> 01:24:30,889
it so the idea is when you get it if you

1876
01:24:27,919 --> 01:24:32,539
already got it it has to be the same so

1877
01:24:30,889 --> 01:24:34,030
if you took actions like establishing

1878
01:24:32,539 --> 01:24:36,349
writing state it should still be valid

1879
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:40,549
maybe refresh the lifetime if it's

1880
01:24:36,349 --> 01:24:43,099
really a shot lifetime but it's a retry

1881
01:24:40,549 --> 01:24:44,419
so so it's just that somewhere down the

1882
01:24:43,099 --> 01:24:46,219
path somebody last ate the root is

1883
01:24:44,419 --> 01:24:47,510
retrying yet and expects an

1884
01:24:46,219 --> 01:24:49,969
acknowledgment that you didn't get last

1885
01:24:47,510 --> 01:24:56,089
time and yes I hope that we have a must

1886
01:24:49,969 --> 01:24:57,589
somewhere to say that X - 1 must so here

1887
01:24:56,089 --> 01:25:00,199
is the format of the packet by the words

1888
01:24:57,589 --> 01:25:03,019
I indicated so d/c new text so remember

1889
01:25:00,199 --> 01:25:04,938
a local WIPA instance iodine in repo is

1890
01:25:03,019 --> 01:25:06,349
built like that the first bit tells you

1891
01:25:04,939 --> 01:25:08,569
if it's a global instance all the

1892
01:25:06,349 --> 01:25:11,209
constants so instant zero is a global

1893
01:25:08,569 --> 01:25:14,809
instance instance 128 is a local

1894
01:25:11,209 --> 01:25:17,719
instance this bit the second bit in the

1895
01:25:14,809 --> 01:25:21,169
in the API is for the data path not for

1896
01:25:17,719 --> 01:25:24,379
the signaling it tells you for local

1897
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:26,059
instance so if this bit says lookö this

1898
01:25:24,379 --> 01:25:28,399
bit tells you if it's local to the

1899
01:25:26,059 --> 01:25:31,760
source or the destination so if you use

1900
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:35,530
a deal bag in both direction the the

1901
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:39,169
address which is the namespace for that

1902
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:41,749
instance local instance is on the way up

1903
01:25:39,169 --> 01:25:45,139
the destination and the way down it's

1904
01:25:41,749 --> 01:25:46,969
the source right so so repo as this

1905
01:25:45,139 --> 01:25:49,099
notion of this bit which tells you if

1906
01:25:46,969 --> 01:25:50,659
it's a source out of this nation which

1907
01:25:49,099 --> 01:25:53,449
is a namespace associated to this

1908
01:25:50,659 --> 01:25:55,148
instance in our case the truck is always

1909
01:25:53,449 --> 01:25:58,428
going somewhere else never coming back

1910
01:25:55,149 --> 01:26:00,109
is that the traffic is directional which

1911
01:25:58,429 --> 01:26:01,699
means it's always the destination so

1912
01:26:00,109 --> 01:26:05,419
this bit is always as always same

1913
01:26:01,699 --> 01:26:08,719
setting saying destination and then you

1914
01:26:05,419 --> 01:26:10,969
get 64 value for that right so you can

1915
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:14,169
be out 64 tracks quote-unquote towards

1916
01:26:10,969 --> 01:26:14,169
any given destination

1917
01:26:16,530 --> 01:26:20,849
so sibling information what you have so

1918
01:26:18,690 --> 01:26:23,549
far is a step of rank so at least we

1919
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:26,250
give the the RAC Express by the

1920
01:26:23,550 --> 01:26:28,020
objective function as if it was a parent

1921
01:26:26,250 --> 01:26:30,660
for which you compute the step of Frank

1922
01:26:28,020 --> 01:26:32,640
use same logic and you look at the

1923
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:35,910
signal with this you can at least signal

1924
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:37,710
the step of Frank to the root so at

1925
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:39,720
least the root can measure everything in

1926
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:42,540
terms of Frank what step of Frank

1927
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,830
now we also have a sentence somewhere

1928
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,420
since we had this description our

1929
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:49,670
mailing list that you can have a metric

1930
01:26:45,420 --> 01:26:49,670
container as an option to this thing

1931
01:26:50,660 --> 01:26:57,540
Fidel requests so asked for

1932
01:26:54,990 --> 01:26:59,519
acknowledgment and this is something to

1933
01:26:57,540 --> 01:27:02,460
be discussed but as I said we are

1934
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,350
missing metrics to express the kind of

1935
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:06,210
quality we want for the builder for the

1936
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:07,980
past would be out so at least I put this

1937
01:27:06,210 --> 01:27:11,820
little bit to remember that to say I

1938
01:27:07,980 --> 01:27:13,379
want a redundant path or not like but

1939
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:16,170
maybe it's not the right for signaling

1940
01:27:13,380 --> 01:27:18,000
it maybe we need options or something to

1941
01:27:16,170 --> 01:27:20,460
really say what kind of characteristics

1942
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,440
you want for this path that you want to

1943
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:25,920
create so this is a packet that the node

1944
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:28,169
sends to the root and the root answers

1945
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:31,010
with that and so you get a lifetime

1946
01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:33,360
which is actually accepted by the root

1947
01:27:31,010 --> 01:27:35,970
you've got an eco of the sequence

1948
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:37,740
numbers and thing for diode awak so you

1949
01:27:35,970 --> 01:27:41,250
can correlate the request on the

1950
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:43,580
response and get the status similar to

1951
01:27:41,250 --> 01:27:47,750
the repo status and Odysseus data so

1952
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:54,510
tells you how good you know this world

1953
01:27:47,750 --> 01:27:56,460
pending issues we've got nice so first

1954
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:58,170
thing we'll do is go through this one in

1955
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,030
more details based on what we have now

1956
01:27:58,170 --> 01:28:01,740
most of it is still relevant and I'm

1957
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:06,330
really sorry Michael I missed it when I

1958
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:08,280
was there ness told me about it to

1959
01:28:06,330 --> 01:28:10,080
finish what I was doing but no now now

1960
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:11,940
we have like some some base on which we

1961
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:14,670
can work and let's a tries to get one

1962
01:28:11,940 --> 01:28:16,139
make 180 and there is a beginning of

1963
01:28:14,670 --> 01:28:17,580
answers to some of the questions like

1964
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:19,230
the fact we have the IDS and now we can

1965
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:21,150
manage the tracks and that's part of the

1966
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:25,709
discussion that Michael had about how

1967
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:27,990
you manage the damn thing so part of the

1968
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:29,910
security was we have a to do in the

1969
01:28:27,990 --> 01:28:33,690
document about how Peter

1970
01:28:29,910 --> 01:28:38,970
messages can be abused so that's part of

1971
01:28:33,690 --> 01:28:41,669
the game and oh that's the configuration

1972
01:28:38,970 --> 01:28:44,160
parameter I mentioned earlier so can do

1973
01:28:41,670 --> 01:28:45,840
want to push some parameters on the

1974
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:49,670
quality of the past that we wanted the

1975
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:54,090
route to be able so this is basically

1976
01:28:49,670 --> 01:28:55,560
most needy thanks so first step is okay

1977
01:28:54,090 --> 01:28:57,480
there is a lot of change lead document

1978
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,450
right there's everything I told you and

1979
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:02,339
more details so it's really good now

1980
01:29:00,450 --> 01:29:03,809
that we set it all and say okay let's

1981
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:05,310
look at the whole this proposal so

1982
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:08,960
everything we said with the dress last

1983
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:11,250
time is addressed in a certain fashion

1984
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,080
some of it was discussed on the mailing

1985
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:15,630
list for some of these I got responses

1986
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:19,230
for some of these I did not so it would

1987
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:21,960
be really cool to to set up and settle

1988
01:29:19,230 --> 01:29:23,610
and and look at all this and say okay do

1989
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:27,690
we agree on the directions that were

1990
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:31,170
taken is it a way to go and then we can

1991
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:34,429
progress this thing segment information

1992
01:29:31,170 --> 01:29:38,880
was published this morning so it's done

1993
01:29:34,430 --> 01:29:40,740
live on formats to optimize that's

1994
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,830
something we could look at you now or in

1995
01:29:40,740 --> 01:29:45,240
the future is it because right now there

1996
01:29:43,830 --> 01:29:46,680
are a lot of reserved space you're on

1997
01:29:45,240 --> 01:29:49,920
there some of the format's that you've

1998
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:51,570
seen of two bytes reserved because I

1999
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:53,850
don't know what we'll discuss now

2000
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:55,799
but that before we ship we might say

2001
01:29:53,850 --> 01:29:58,020
orders to be it's us two bytes won't

2002
01:29:55,800 --> 01:30:00,660
have to be resolved we can just not send

2003
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:03,810
them we have to basically look at those

2004
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:05,370
bits formats and then that's that's when

2005
01:30:03,810 --> 01:30:08,670
I say the best we can do for worker

2006
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:10,170
Brasco is probably around next idea that

2007
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:12,360
would be just walk abreast go and then

2008
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:19,530
submitting to ASG would be like by

2009
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:22,920
summer or something for long thank you

2010
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:28,170
very much Muskaan so fine we have 30

2011
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:30,860
minutes questions who is willing to

2012
01:30:28,170 --> 01:30:30,860
reveal disrobe

2013
01:30:32,590 --> 01:30:36,010
or thank you thank you very much pretty

2014
01:30:35,290 --> 01:30:39,430
no comment

2015
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:42,120
so a lot of this is new feel free to

2016
01:30:39,430 --> 01:30:56,430
reach Allen jet it's the right time

2017
01:30:42,120 --> 01:30:59,410
Thank You Pascal hey next all right so

2018
01:30:56,430 --> 01:31:01,300
there has been doing trims specially

2019
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:02,080
input to discuss the capabilities and

2020
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:05,290
the mopix

2021
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:06,910
and I'll just quickly give you an

2022
01:31:05,290 --> 01:31:09,430
overview of what capabilities is most of

2023
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:11,680
you already know it allows our till

2024
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:12,910
nodes to signal their capabilities now

2025
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,380
one of the things that we discussed last

2026
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:16,210
time was we need to clearly

2027
01:31:14,380 --> 01:31:18,280
differentiate between what we already

2028
01:31:16,210 --> 01:31:19,600
have mode of operation and the DI of

2029
01:31:18,280 --> 01:31:21,429
configuration option how is it different

2030
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:23,020
how is capability is going to be

2031
01:31:21,430 --> 01:31:25,510
different now one clear difference is

2032
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:27,640
that a movie in the configuration option

2033
01:31:25,510 --> 01:31:29,770
is strictly route control in case of

2034
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:31,600
capabilities this could be sent by any

2035
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:33,370
of the nodes so that is one of the most

2036
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:35,350
most important difference you know that

2037
01:31:33,370 --> 01:31:36,700
should not and capabilities can emit

2038
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:40,510
more richer information because it is

2039
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:43,210
sort of a format options TLB format by

2040
01:31:40,510 --> 01:31:45,820
itself then and capabilities may be more

2041
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:48,480
dynamic than mo PM configuration it

2042
01:31:45,820 --> 01:31:51,849
might change over a period of time and

2043
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:53,709
design goals any node could generate the

2044
01:31:51,850 --> 01:32:01,390
capability an option could be sent in

2045
01:31:53,710 --> 01:32:03,370
any message so the K + 1

2046
01:32:01,390 --> 01:32:05,350
the important thing is it should be able

2047
01:32:03,370 --> 01:32:06,940
to it should it should be possible for

2048
01:32:05,350 --> 01:32:09,100
capabilities to work with the existing

2049
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:11,799
mode of operation well this is this is

2050
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:13,600
non-trivial and we'll discuss in the

2051
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:15,550
subsequent slides how this can be

2052
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,530
handled and capabilities could be

2053
01:32:15,550 --> 01:32:18,940
explicitly query and now this is

2054
01:32:17,530 --> 01:32:20,620
something that we have not handled as of

2055
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,049
now how the capabilities could be

2056
01:32:20,620 --> 01:32:25,180
queried from the node is a different

2057
01:32:23,050 --> 01:32:26,350
question altogether and we would really

2058
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:30,580
like to have some feedback from the

2059
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:32,200
working group on this point how it looks

2060
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:34,809
right now this is how it looks so

2061
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:36,610
earlier if you if you have read in your

2062
01:32:34,810 --> 01:32:39,490
earlier version of the draft we had

2063
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:41,049
simply a combination of bits but we have

2064
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:43,450
moved away from the combination of birds

2065
01:32:41,050 --> 01:32:47,860
to individual clearly for each of this

2066
01:32:43,450 --> 01:32:49,720
capability because we might need more

2067
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:52,929
information in context to every

2068
01:32:49,720 --> 01:32:54,640
capability that to be sent so there is

2069
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:56,290
one more there are few more interesting

2070
01:32:54,640 --> 01:32:58,390
bits in context to each of the

2071
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:00,670
capability for example the che bit which

2072
01:32:58,390 --> 01:33:02,650
is whether the node can join only as a

2073
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:05,140
leaf node if the capability is not

2074
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:09,879
understood or and their capability has

2075
01:33:05,140 --> 01:33:11,740
to be copied downstream and then the

2076
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:12,940
third bit is whether the capability

2077
01:33:11,740 --> 01:33:14,380
information is present now each

2078
01:33:12,940 --> 01:33:16,360
capability might be optionally

2079
01:33:14,380 --> 01:33:19,270
associated with additional set of

2080
01:33:16,360 --> 01:33:21,099
information if the I bit has said that

2081
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:22,570
information is present and if it is

2082
01:33:21,100 --> 01:33:25,960
present distr has to be in this format

2083
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:27,730
so during the interim we discussed that

2084
01:33:25,960 --> 01:33:30,820
we might need this length so that we can

2085
01:33:27,730 --> 01:33:34,139
skip the whole option all together so we

2086
01:33:30,820 --> 01:33:40,080
avoided this length in the draft as well

2087
01:33:34,140 --> 01:33:43,210
yeah final cap unaware nodes we try to

2088
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:48,340
we try to reason if it is possible to

2089
01:33:43,210 --> 01:33:50,260
handle the cap and aware nodes and what

2090
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:52,750
we discussed in the interim was it is

2091
01:33:50,260 --> 01:33:56,830
better to use capabilities only with

2092
01:33:52,750 --> 01:34:00,130
them new mode of operation so the new

2093
01:33:56,830 --> 01:34:03,430
mopix allows you to send the old mo P in

2094
01:34:00,130 --> 01:34:05,440
the new option so if the new option is

2095
01:34:03,430 --> 01:34:08,380
used you can as well send caps with that

2096
01:34:05,440 --> 01:34:11,759
so caps is only supported only if the mo

2097
01:34:08,380 --> 01:34:13,560
pecks is used now this is something

2098
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:18,210
which working over it needs working

2099
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:19,920
group consideration as well so the

2100
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:22,980
capability is signaling the capabilities

2101
01:34:19,920 --> 01:34:24,720
I kept one thing that we discussed was

2102
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:27,509
the capabilities could be carried in

2103
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:30,590
existing signaling messages the d io

2104
01:34:27,510 --> 01:34:32,810
douse or it could be explicitly correct

2105
01:34:30,590 --> 01:34:35,760
signal through some additional my

2106
01:34:32,810 --> 01:34:39,300
messaging new messaging this new

2107
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:41,370
messaging is yet to be discussed this

2108
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:44,180
would be the right time if working group

2109
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:47,130
has a specific point to say here whether

2110
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:50,040
it is not good to have a new message all

2111
01:34:47,130 --> 01:34:54,750
together for querying the capability but

2112
01:34:50,040 --> 01:34:57,570
we need this querying mechanism or we

2113
01:34:54,750 --> 01:34:59,490
could simply rely on this unicast this

2114
01:34:57,570 --> 01:35:01,380
di o to query this such scan of

2115
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:04,080
information which I feel is not a good

2116
01:35:01,380 --> 01:35:05,580
idea because the idea has a lot of other

2117
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:10,380
information apart from the capabilities

2118
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:12,420
which has to be given as well so what

2119
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:14,160
can we use it now as of now we have been

2120
01:35:12,420 --> 01:35:16,020
discussing most of the capability

2121
01:35:14,160 --> 01:35:18,290
options in context to the projected

2122
01:35:16,020 --> 01:35:22,950
Rover project at Dow and the six low RH

2123
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:26,100
six low RH here and we find that it is

2124
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:28,970
in a position to solve the needs of

2125
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:28,970
those two troughs

2126
01:35:29,810 --> 01:35:33,420
Knoppix

2127
01:35:31,079 --> 01:35:38,130
so one of the things that has changed in

2128
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:40,349
context to the Malbec says is the final

2129
01:35:38,130 --> 01:35:42,150
mopix value calculation we don't use the

2130
01:35:40,349 --> 01:35:44,699
complex it was not complex but it was

2131
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:46,589
still the multi-level calculation where

2132
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:48,030
you use the base mo P and then you mo

2133
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:50,070
pick add them together and then you get

2134
01:35:48,030 --> 01:35:54,599
a final mo P we don't do that anymore

2135
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:56,489
we finally if we use the mop X value as

2136
01:35:54,599 --> 01:35:59,219
it is as the final mo P so it's much

2137
01:35:56,489 --> 01:36:02,040
simpler to understand and secondly we

2138
01:35:59,219 --> 01:36:04,349
have that option of using old mo keys

2139
01:36:02,040 --> 01:36:09,480
and continuing using them capability

2140
01:36:04,349 --> 01:36:09,960
options the whole time to jump on the

2141
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:11,790
mic

2142
01:36:09,960 --> 01:36:15,659
this is best can you go back to the

2143
01:36:11,790 --> 01:36:17,429
previous visit yes so I want to insist

2144
01:36:15,659 --> 01:36:20,159
on the difference between configuration

2145
01:36:17,429 --> 01:36:22,199
capability for instance in those two

2146
01:36:20,159 --> 01:36:26,820
cases projected route and eight one

2147
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:29,400
three eight the configuration is when

2148
01:36:26,820 --> 01:36:31,349
the route imposes something like you

2149
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:33,989
program the CLI in a router or something

2150
01:36:31,349 --> 01:36:37,050
so in this case the configuration will

2151
01:36:33,989 --> 01:36:41,968
say and user free polyfill says it for

2152
01:36:37,050 --> 01:36:45,059
for its own use go ahead and use this

2153
01:36:41,969 --> 01:36:46,170
tank set it up and if you understand it

2154
01:36:45,059 --> 01:36:48,659
but you can't set it up you should

2155
01:36:46,170 --> 01:36:50,730
operate as a leaf or something so you

2156
01:36:48,659 --> 01:36:55,079
mentioned P routes and six leverage but

2157
01:36:50,730 --> 01:36:58,049
there's also the use of the new FBI in

2158
01:36:55,079 --> 01:36:59,549
user free / info right so basically you

2159
01:36:58,050 --> 01:37:02,159
have a bit in the configuration option

2160
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:05,040
which size use it and it would be good

2161
01:37:02,159 --> 01:37:07,619
that the route sets this when it knows

2162
01:37:05,040 --> 01:37:10,619
that the node support that's when the

2163
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:13,019
capability is coming to play right so if

2164
01:37:10,619 --> 01:37:16,230
you have another way to know that your

2165
01:37:13,020 --> 01:37:19,409
devices support this right like

2166
01:37:16,230 --> 01:37:20,909
functions management you don't need the

2167
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:23,519
capability you still need the

2168
01:37:20,909 --> 01:37:25,619
configuration right you use the

2169
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:27,329
management to know that the node support

2170
01:37:25,619 --> 01:37:29,730
and once you're happy with that you turn

2171
01:37:27,329 --> 01:37:31,469
the switch on or you just know your

2172
01:37:29,730 --> 01:37:33,089
device and once you've uninstalled the

2173
01:37:31,469 --> 01:37:34,559
last one which did not support or we

2174
01:37:33,090 --> 01:37:37,349
flushed it you know you have refreshed

2175
01:37:34,559 --> 01:37:39,119
everyone that you can use the bit in the

2176
01:37:37,349 --> 01:37:43,079
configuration to turn the function on

2177
01:37:39,119 --> 01:37:45,839
that's true for the new API that's true

2178
01:37:43,079 --> 01:37:47,610
for using projected rods well which is

2179
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:49,590
not a bit special but that's true fight

2180
01:37:47,610 --> 01:37:51,480
one three eight so that's why we have

2181
01:37:49,590 --> 01:37:54,510
those bits in the configuration and

2182
01:37:51,480 --> 01:37:56,428
that's one thing on the left the thing

2183
01:37:54,510 --> 01:37:59,010
on the right is how does the would know

2184
01:37:56,429 --> 01:38:01,079
and that's when the capability come into

2185
01:37:59,010 --> 01:38:03,659
play with this draft will be capable to

2186
01:38:01,079 --> 01:38:05,639
pull from the network what the network

2187
01:38:03,659 --> 01:38:07,199
device do so we don't need to configure

2188
01:38:05,639 --> 01:38:11,300
it the management

2189
01:38:07,199 --> 01:38:15,119
thank the repo manages itself so it's

2190
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:18,540
completely useful it separates it from

2191
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:20,369
the configuration we already did use a

2192
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:24,329
free pollen fo with a bit to configure

2193
01:38:20,369 --> 01:38:27,119
we need a 23-8 for the same thing pierot

2194
01:38:24,329 --> 01:38:29,009
is more like the wood will decide for

2195
01:38:27,119 --> 01:38:30,360
just this rod so maybe it's not really

2196
01:38:29,010 --> 01:38:31,860
you don't already have a configuration

2197
01:38:30,360 --> 01:38:34,380
for it the P Dow is the configuration

2198
01:38:31,860 --> 01:38:36,869
file but for FC eight one three eight

2199
01:38:34,380 --> 01:38:38,219
and for user freepo it's completely

2200
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:40,199
separate whether you can pull the

2201
01:38:38,219 --> 01:38:45,179
capability and when when you decide to

2202
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:46,860
configure it right so the you do not

2203
01:38:45,179 --> 01:38:50,099
drive tonight once way it does not need

2204
01:38:46,860 --> 01:38:53,159
this one you see because it just says

2205
01:38:50,099 --> 01:38:55,290
configure it but when we have this true

2206
01:38:53,159 --> 01:38:57,659
for user free / info true for for eight

2207
01:38:55,290 --> 01:39:00,829
one three eight then repo will have a

2208
01:38:57,659 --> 01:39:03,480
total solution to manage and configure

2209
01:39:00,829 --> 01:39:05,099
okay so that's how its decouple so there

2210
01:39:03,480 --> 01:39:08,519
is no the idea that there is a

2211
01:39:05,099 --> 01:39:09,210
dependency on this draft in use of a

2212
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:10,790
well cell

2213
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:13,290
[Music]

2214
01:39:10,790 --> 01:39:15,449
eight one three eight run on a don't

2215
01:39:13,290 --> 01:39:18,030
rearrange yeah well there is no

2216
01:39:15,449 --> 01:39:20,428
dependency right so just one question in

2217
01:39:18,030 --> 01:39:24,570
this context so where do we define the

2218
01:39:20,429 --> 01:39:27,960
bed the capability option of for the

2219
01:39:24,570 --> 01:39:29,730
node which says that it supports eight

2220
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:31,619
one three eight weather will it be in

2221
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:36,480
that draft or will it been in the

2222
01:39:31,619 --> 01:39:38,519
capability draft or well my feeling is

2223
01:39:36,480 --> 01:39:41,610
that we already shipped use of ripple

2224
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:44,820
info and we don't want to delay use of

2225
01:39:41,610 --> 01:39:47,040
ripple info to use to do the capability

2226
01:39:44,820 --> 01:39:50,070
so for user free / info the answer is

2227
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:52,530
this draft I will say it for user free /

2228
01:39:50,070 --> 01:39:54,960
info so we'd say then this draft can

2229
01:39:52,530 --> 01:39:57,330
also say it four eight one three eight

2230
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:59,219
okay so we keep consistent

2231
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:01,680
between the two which means that eight

2232
01:39:59,219 --> 01:40:04,350
one three eight eternal night right 3/8

2233
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:06,180
can fly right away and the reason why I

2234
01:40:04,350 --> 01:40:08,550
am kind of pushing for that is that we

2235
01:40:06,180 --> 01:40:10,350
already need to be able to control a

2236
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:13,650
23-8 today in the field we would like to

2237
01:40:10,350 --> 01:40:15,330
 that like yesterday and because now

2238
01:40:13,650 --> 01:40:16,799
we are in a brown field really and we

2239
01:40:15,330 --> 01:40:18,450
have nodes which do in these notes which

2240
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,670
don't so we want to ship the new

2241
01:40:18,450 --> 01:40:23,400
function cat ability well capable of

2242
01:40:20,670 --> 01:40:25,950
doing it but we can't turn it down as

2243
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,839
long as it's a brown field and so the

2244
01:40:25,950 --> 01:40:30,510
only way to address that is to be able

2245
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:33,650
to set the bit in the configuration this

2246
01:40:30,510 --> 01:40:36,570
is secondary because we have management

2247
01:40:33,650 --> 01:40:39,769
okay so I'd like to ship the other right

2248
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:39,769
away that's the point

2249
01:40:39,830 --> 01:40:44,280
so Michael so you just don't really

2250
01:40:42,750 --> 01:40:48,030
really don't want to wait for us to do

2251
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:49,320
capabilities in any way to do eight one

2252
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,540
three eight and what's your what you're

2253
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:52,799
saying you wanted you want to do it we

2254
01:40:51,540 --> 01:40:56,130
could do eight one three eight with

2255
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,540
capabilities is the point right and but

2256
01:40:56,130 --> 01:41:00,540
you don't want to do that you want to

2257
01:40:57,540 --> 01:41:03,150
ship it the way that it is I want to

2258
01:41:00,540 --> 01:41:06,269
ship down on the way it is and then

2259
01:41:03,150 --> 01:41:09,629
define how you express the capability in

2260
01:41:06,270 --> 01:41:12,210
this draft so you want to control it

2261
01:41:09,630 --> 01:41:13,950
being on or off with turn on but you

2262
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:17,489
want to find out if it's available with

2263
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:19,500
capabilities okay I can live with that

2264
01:41:17,489 --> 01:41:21,419
okay which is what we do for use of repo

2265
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:30,000
info unless we you want to old user

2266
01:41:21,420 --> 01:41:32,280
frequent flow right right okay right so

2267
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:34,320
then I have in context - morphix that

2268
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:37,139
has been very less changes when is the

2269
01:41:34,320 --> 01:41:38,940
final mo P mopix calculation and the

2270
01:41:37,140 --> 01:41:42,840
other part is if I move to value is

2271
01:41:38,940 --> 01:41:48,900
seven and we will discard the vio if the

2272
01:41:42,840 --> 01:41:51,900
mopix is not present if clear so two

2273
01:41:48,900 --> 01:41:54,269
questions mopix currently has 24 bits

2274
01:41:51,900 --> 01:41:57,299
now do we really want to use those many

2275
01:41:54,270 --> 01:42:00,050
bits because as I can see our dependency

2276
01:41:57,300 --> 01:42:03,810
on mo PS will reduce with capabilities

2277
01:42:00,050 --> 01:42:07,530
so we can do with less number of bits

2278
01:42:03,810 --> 01:42:09,239
for more packs but again I don't see

2279
01:42:07,530 --> 01:42:10,620
much of a value there because once we

2280
01:42:09,239 --> 01:42:12,900
start alighting

2281
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:16,110
such fields then it might not even be

2282
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:18,480
important to worry about the field size

2283
01:42:16,110 --> 01:42:26,790
then but I would like to have any

2284
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:29,070
opinion here second question is whether

2285
01:42:26,790 --> 01:42:29,730
we should split the two topics the mopix

2286
01:42:29,070 --> 01:42:32,460
and cap

2287
01:42:29,730 --> 01:42:36,959
the reason being looks like capabilities

2288
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:39,210
might take some time to mature and mopix

2289
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,150
is really really a simple thing to do we

2290
01:42:39,210 --> 01:42:43,440
might as well ship it separately and

2291
01:42:41,150 --> 01:42:45,780
there is a clear difference I mean there

2292
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:48,330
is no overlap of information between I

2293
01:42:45,780 --> 01:42:50,309
mean there is no overlap of thing

2294
01:42:48,330 --> 01:42:57,210
between mopix and capabilities so any

2295
01:42:50,310 --> 01:43:00,050
any any views there I mean I would I

2296
01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:03,510
would really push that question 12-hour

2297
01:43:00,050 --> 01:43:07,290
because basically it makes more sense

2298
01:43:03,510 --> 01:43:08,700
for the engineering for us to split so

2299
01:43:07,290 --> 01:43:09,990
we have one document for one thing and

2300
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:12,120
the other document for the other thing

2301
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:13,740
but now that means both will be still

2302
01:43:12,120 --> 01:43:20,220
not track documents to go through the

2303
01:43:13,740 --> 01:43:22,170
iesg a DHT might not like it so so rope

2304
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:33,360
X would be a very simple earth and we

2305
01:43:22,170 --> 01:43:35,460
could flush it throw this matter I would

2306
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:37,559
prefer one document just because it's

2307
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:37,980
easier I process only one time and

2308
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:45,270
that's it

2309
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:46,559
but I know there are other non ihe the

2310
01:43:45,270 --> 01:43:48,990
event a middle considerations around

2311
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:51,000
having multiple or RCS I've heard from

2312
01:43:48,990 --> 01:43:53,370
other working groups for example the

2313
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:55,290
need to do RF piece and point it one

2314
01:43:53,370 --> 01:43:56,190
thing or another so if we need troops

2315
01:43:55,290 --> 01:43:58,320
through the functionality that's

2316
01:43:56,190 --> 01:44:02,419
perfectly fine so whatever you guys want

2317
01:43:58,320 --> 01:44:02,420
to do work for me okay thank you

2318
01:44:03,530 --> 01:44:09,660
good so I can I would like to have two

2319
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:12,750
documents I asked for that before and

2320
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:14,309
yours I so um I think your diagram is

2321
01:44:12,750 --> 01:44:15,510
incorrect and I just looked at the

2322
01:44:14,310 --> 01:44:17,370
document and it's correct for the

2323
01:44:15,510 --> 01:44:19,890
document I just got sixty five fifty and

2324
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:23,650
it doesn't match 6550 so if I'm not

2325
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:27,760
mistaken this is a a

2326
01:44:23,650 --> 01:44:30,549
our pl option lives in diyos or daos and

2327
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:35,710
they actually are in the format of a

2328
01:44:30,550 --> 01:44:37,930
type length and stuff oh yeah yeah yeah

2329
01:44:35,710 --> 01:44:39,640
right that should be length right okay I

2330
01:44:37,930 --> 01:44:42,370
should relent but the important part is

2331
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:45,010
that that means that we can decide how

2332
01:44:42,370 --> 01:44:46,690
big that value is and it can be as long

2333
01:44:45,010 --> 01:44:53,020
or as short as we like as we have a

2334
01:44:46,690 --> 01:44:55,839
length yes like 64 bits of of of mop X

2335
01:44:53,020 --> 01:44:58,300
probably not probably should have a

2336
01:44:55,840 --> 01:45:00,400
maximum but the point is that if we have

2337
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:03,010
only one byte to send and we say it's an

2338
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:05,259
integer and it fits in one bite we only

2339
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:08,590
have to transmit one byte at the point

2340
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:11,410
where we have to find 256 mop mop X

2341
01:45:08,590 --> 01:45:13,270
values we can add a second bite we just

2342
01:45:11,410 --> 01:45:15,010
need to make sure up front that we tell

2343
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:18,280
people please pay attention to the

2344
01:45:15,010 --> 01:45:19,870
length but lengths larger then I think

2345
01:45:18,280 --> 01:45:22,750
the number would be six because that we

2346
01:45:19,870 --> 01:45:25,570
four bytes are probably unreasonable so

2347
01:45:22,750 --> 01:45:28,570
you don't need to do 64-bit arithmetic

2348
01:45:25,570 --> 01:45:30,759
on this or whatever okay so I'm pretty

2349
01:45:28,570 --> 01:45:33,910
sure we can do that right you'd agree to

2350
01:45:30,760 --> 01:45:35,770
Pascal right okay so I think that solves

2351
01:45:33,910 --> 01:45:37,690
that how many bits should we have we

2352
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:44,160
don't we have as few as we can live with

2353
01:45:37,690 --> 01:45:44,160
right yeah yes I love what I just heard

2354
01:45:45,390 --> 01:45:56,020
yes interesting enough we are changing

2355
01:45:52,000 --> 01:46:00,520
the first bits in the DI you pretty much

2356
01:45:56,020 --> 01:46:02,950
with a new map x value of seven and we

2357
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:05,950
don't have a version for people all

2358
01:46:02,950 --> 01:46:07,240
right so it seems to me that somehow we

2359
01:46:05,950 --> 01:46:10,559
are packaging a number of features

2360
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:14,740
together or like P Dow which I'll really

2361
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:17,010
rule bring all these capabilities we are

2362
01:46:14,740 --> 01:46:23,650
really making a version to a free poll

2363
01:46:17,010 --> 01:46:25,480
and seems to me which is not because we

2364
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:26,230
can do we can formally define that yeah

2365
01:46:25,480 --> 01:46:30,219
all right

2366
01:46:26,230 --> 01:46:33,940
that really needs to say a multi-core

2367
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:35,590
seven means that you're expected to at

2368
01:46:33,940 --> 01:46:36,309
least understand even if you don't

2369
01:46:35,590 --> 01:46:38,430
operate

2370
01:46:36,310 --> 01:46:40,750
at least understand all the other dress

2371
01:46:38,430 --> 01:46:43,120
right so you should also if you can't

2372
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:44,560
apply them purely for whatever but

2373
01:46:43,120 --> 01:46:47,110
you're supposed to understand all this

2374
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,950
draft so otherwise map said you don't

2375
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:50,320
understand right

2376
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:52,929
yes right so capability as you said was

2377
01:46:50,320 --> 01:46:58,900
wrong but I would say let's list them

2378
01:46:52,930 --> 01:47:01,330
and call that triple V - okay yeah

2379
01:46:58,900 --> 01:47:02,710
that's all that's all yeah I mean no no

2380
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:04,990
it's not only one major upgrade looks

2381
01:47:02,710 --> 01:47:07,770
like we will have a major revamp in the

2382
01:47:04,990 --> 01:47:18,639
document based on the discussion today

2383
01:47:07,770 --> 01:47:21,580
that's all thank you very much wrong

2384
01:47:18,640 --> 01:47:24,250
path can see that the operation should

2385
01:47:21,580 --> 01:47:30,400
be a new mode of operation what do you

2386
01:47:24,250 --> 01:47:33,700
think well I thought it was a discussion

2387
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:36,700
on the mailing list about this and that

2388
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:38,519
no it's not I mean I agreed with the

2389
01:47:36,700 --> 01:47:43,170
point that was made that was a very good

2390
01:47:38,520 --> 01:47:43,170
email and again I wonder

2391
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:48,910
I really loved his arguments I think he

2392
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:51,240
made me make perfect sense

2393
01:47:48,910 --> 01:47:54,639
what he said and I kind of boat

2394
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:56,230
everything so no it's not a new mode you

2395
01:47:54,640 --> 01:47:57,700
will you will have a main gear that

2396
01:47:56,230 --> 01:48:01,530
which will operate in the normal mode

2397
01:47:57,700 --> 01:48:03,760
you will have the capability to project

2398
01:48:01,530 --> 01:48:06,940
projected rods and you will install them

2399
01:48:03,760 --> 01:48:09,460
but the peel the peel out itself it is

2400
01:48:06,940 --> 01:48:13,120
some type I mean so it's not like a mop

2401
01:48:09,460 --> 01:48:15,670
the mop is the global deal dag and since

2402
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:18,849
we don't use the yo-yo to build the P

2403
01:48:15,670 --> 01:48:21,130
Dow what if you don't have anything to

2404
01:48:18,850 --> 01:48:24,940
express a separate mop but the big dag

2405
01:48:21,130 --> 01:48:27,340
is like Bobby said it's what it is we

2406
01:48:24,940 --> 01:48:28,900
don't need a new mop for that so if

2407
01:48:27,340 --> 01:48:31,750
there is still text simply our draft I

2408
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:34,299
need to remove it I think there's no but

2409
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:38,310
if there is you to clean it up I mean if

2410
01:48:34,300 --> 01:48:38,310
people agree right I do agree with Robby

2411
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:46,650
thank you very much additional comments

2412
01:48:42,430 --> 01:48:46,650
who's willing to review this draft

2413
01:48:47,809 --> 01:49:00,380
thank you yeah they're all your own to

2414
01:48:56,059 --> 01:49:02,539
split post okay thank you

2415
01:49:00,380 --> 01:49:05,150
so yeah and we are going to send the

2416
01:49:02,539 --> 01:49:10,789
comments the questions that we arise

2417
01:49:05,150 --> 01:49:18,159
today so tomorrow um can we split it

2418
01:49:10,789 --> 01:49:18,159
quickly and adopt the mob acts quickly

2419
01:49:19,070 --> 01:49:25,518
today we can adopt adoption tomorrow in

2420
01:49:22,880 --> 01:49:27,860
the tomorrow yeah I thought I think I

2421
01:49:25,519 --> 01:49:30,619
think that I was not urgent see I think

2422
01:49:27,860 --> 01:49:32,480
that we've discussed it to death and you

2423
01:49:30,619 --> 01:49:47,869
know it just sure we should just go

2424
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:50,440
right additional comments questions okay

2425
01:49:47,869 --> 01:49:52,190
so we need tomorrow then

2426
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,928
thank you very much for your
