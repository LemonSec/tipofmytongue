1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,620
I know the meeting is almost ready to

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,680
start and we've already had the blue

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,430
sheets go through once it's a good sign

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:18,820
so it actually it is 5:40 so let's get

5
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:18,820
started

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:30,799
Thank You friends for being here the for

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:33,079
this our second session of IDR like the

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,640
previous session we're not gonna go on

9
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:41,079
and on from the chair one thing we did

10
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:48,530
want to talk about for just a minute is

11
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:50,030
auto-discovery and you know as those of

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:53,600
you for whom this isn't your first

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:56,570
meeting we'll know we have touched on

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,410
this topic multiple times in over the

15
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:03,800
last couple years and a couple days ago

16
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:07,158
one of the authors approached me and

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,908
said Shawn are we gonna do this work or

18
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,400
what

19
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:17,150
and I said yeah we're gonna do this work

20
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:21,220
and thank you for bringing that up but

21
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:25,220
the the deal is that we haven't sort of

22
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:29,960
successfully really driven to conclusion

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:31,970
on what so it's pretty clear to the

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,529
chairs and if you you know if you

25
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,810
disagree with this you know let us know

26
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:39,830
in person at the mic now in private

27
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,870
whatever but I mean we're pretty sure

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,550
that the there's interest in the working

29
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:48,350
group to work on this auto-discovery

30
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:51,590
thing we last time we tried to reach

31
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,649
consensus on a specific draft to move

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:57,380
forward with we had some interesting

33
00:01:54,650 --> 00:02:01,280
discussions but we didn't have a clear

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:03,199
conclusion the the good news is if you

35
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,040
go back and look at the different drafts

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,800
that were proposed and I think that you

37
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,430
know in various flavors were you know we

38
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,420
got up to at least four of them they're

39
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,440
all pretty close in terms of semantics

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:20,450
they all look

41
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,240
more or less like let's exchange the

42
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,640
data necessary to bootstrap hold on just

43
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:28,190
one second to bootstrap appearing and

44
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,640
then let's you know move forward from

45
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,800
there

46
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,540
AC yes please go ahead as a simple

47
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,160
reason for that John a selenium Cisco

48
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:38,750
Systems they all copied mind exactly

49
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:45,590
when when you care enough to copy from

50
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:47,390
the very best that's yeah if anybody

51
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:52,460
would like to do Tom Lehrer impressions

52
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:58,760
later you know at the bar please do okay

53
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:01,760
so so yeah but we've got there are a

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,670
number of important differences between

55
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,179
the various approaches and things that

56
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:12,320
just haven't gotten nailed so rather

57
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:14,120
than having you know a whole several

58
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,329
different teams of authors continue to

59
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,040
work on their own drafts and then you

60
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:23,720
know debate about it in the working

61
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,269
group our tentative conclusion is maybe

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,020
this is time for IDR to actually charter

63
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,180
a design team to get together and say

64
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:36,020
you know where 80% converged

65
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,250
anyway let's converge on to one proposal

66
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:40,250
we'll bring it to the working group and

67
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:44,570
do it by the next IETF so that's our

68
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,250
proposal we hope to put together a

69
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,410
design team in the next couple weeks if

70
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:52,459
you're interested in working on it

71
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,950
please approach the chairs if you're

72
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:57,380
have suggestions for how it should

73
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:00,829
operate that means you probably should

74
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:06,670
also approach the chairs you know we

75
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:08,630
would like to do a solution that is

76
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,970
pragmatic because there's obviously been

77
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,920
appetite for this for a while now let's

78
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,220
get it done and then we can iterate

79
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:19,479
forward so it does not necessarily have

80
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:22,910
to solve the generic ultimate protocol

81
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:25,730
problem it just has to be useful for

82
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:27,380
some of the important use cases that's

83
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:30,860
about it will keep the working group

84
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,300
updated you know it's our our intention

85
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,520
to not have this be

86
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,330
a long live design team like I said

87
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,500
hopefully to conclude by the next IETF

88
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:45,560
and report out if you have questions or

89
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:48,080
comments right now you know the mics are

90
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:52,639
open otherwise we can continue forward

91
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,710
please go ahead Randy Bush I J

92
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,740
anarchists conclude but conclude by the

93
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:59,739
next IETF is Vancouver being canceled

94
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,460
sorry I don't think you're gonna make

95
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,360
Fame you think that I'm an unrealistic

96
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,219
goal

97
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,960
okay well I'm famous for setting

98
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:16,969
unrealistic goals we thank you for the

99
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:19,159
for the feedback you're probably right

100
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:21,949
if you say that because you've done this

101
00:05:19,159 --> 00:05:24,229
more times than I have we will at least

102
00:05:21,949 --> 00:05:27,289
have a report out by the next IETF if

103
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:29,960
it's an interim report then so be it

104
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:32,180
I mean obviously the conclusion of the

105
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,159
design team at least my expectation is

106
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,629
the design team is not to present the

107
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,219
working group with a finished product

108
00:05:35,629 --> 00:05:40,090
the design team is to present the

109
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:42,500
working group with a zero-zero

110
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,840
at which point we will proceed forward

111
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,380
but your point is well-taken nonetheless

112
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,380
thank you

113
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:57,139
there is one thing this will be held as

114
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,360
open working groups and open meetings

115
00:05:57,139 --> 00:06:02,120
meaning they'll be WebEx that should

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:07,550
allow according to ELISA anyone who

117
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,440
wants to participate read that is I

118
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:17,690
don't think will be impacted by any

119
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:19,960
restrictions for any of you okay June

120
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:19,960
please

121
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,979
hello my presentation contains two

122
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:45,270
drafts both are about the using BGP to

123
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:49,500
advise IPSec config started okay yeah so

124
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:54,750
the first one is I've made update for

125
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:59,270
mark previous IDR BGP IPSec a draft so

126
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:01,650
that update is based on the feedback

127
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:05,490
feedback I received so far since last

128
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:08,520
IDF the first one I replaced the color

129
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,449
sub-team is the new IP ii finishing tag

130
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:16,049
sub TOB the reason being that instead of

131
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:18,779
being overload the color sub TOB it's

132
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,129
clear to use a new sub theory for such

133
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:25,080
poppers next ones are some text on the

134
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:29,449
selecting theories when there are

135
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:33,389
multiple IP SEC theories availables

136
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:36,240
basically is that would you when there

137
00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,770
are multiple feasible secretary in the

138
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,949
update you can choose one based on the

139
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:49,219
most explicit or we say shortest reign

140
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:51,990
address range match and then there's a

141
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,330
lecture on the parity cosmetic

142
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:58,589
so basically changing the crypto using

143
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:01,740
the example of a draft from the AES CBC

144
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:07,050
to the like more more than crypto

145
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:10,199
structure and so this basically just

146
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:11,969
cosmetic change and also they change

147
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:14,909
title from which be signal or IP sector

148
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:19,069
no coefficient to bgp provisioned nano

149
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:24,270
configuration and also add a section

150
00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:26,610
basically to outline that some what

151
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,969
should what system should do in when the

152
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:33,659
tanner goes down or when sister should

153
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:35,849
agree stops taro and also add more

154
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,539
content in the Security section

155
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:41,490
basically he says like I agree to what

156
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:45,839
kind of mechanism to proven accurate to

157
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,730
level dos attack and so also at

158
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,699
specification and map of time each of

159
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:54,810
this new sub theory could appear in the

160
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:57,719
give antenna theory and so order some

161
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,599
clarification in the intro to just to

162
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,800
clarify this draft is about IPSec can a

163
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:06,389
mode and then last why is that basically

164
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,569
the traffic selector itself and the

165
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:13,790
proper the pot and pod range now coming

166
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:21,810
from mapping of the IPSec conviction tag

167
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:25,170
so these are the updates then I write a

168
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:28,560
new draft about using the IPSec

169
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:34,319
transport mode with any type of IP said

170
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:37,469
sorry any type of IP tunnel so this one

171
00:09:34,319 --> 00:09:40,880
is little bit different from current

172
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:44,339
what define in the tunneling cap draft

173
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:49,470
current Alan capital can specifies how

174
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:53,550
panel stack works like for example tano

175
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:55,050
X in inside a kind of Y but the IPSec

176
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,389
trust model is working it'll be

177
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:00,599
different because it's really not a ton

178
00:09:57,389 --> 00:10:04,800
of stack it's really using a same IP

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,560
header for the IPSec transport

180
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,099
protection so here is example as you can

181
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:14,459
see different from the IPSec tunnel mode

182
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:18,060
here you don't really have as new IPSec

183
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:21,660
IP header here you are reuse the pay

184
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:24,268
little packets IP header adding a ESP

185
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,610
header and then basically the IPSec

186
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:31,079
protection is applied to the payload of

187
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:34,620
the original clear packet so it is it's

188
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:37,109
like it's like attribute to exiting IP

189
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,779
tunnel for example in this in this

190
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,610
figure it shows the GRU is IPSec

191
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,010
transformer protection but it could be

192
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,870
any type of a piano like be excellent

193
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:48,360
whatever

194
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:49,360
you couldn't apply this every sector

195
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,870
spot

196
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,589
action so the current kind of ink up

197
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:59,470
that and really address such a use case

198
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:09,339
so I that's why I great a new draft for

199
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:10,089
this I think or it goes through this so

200
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:14,200
how does it work

201
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:17,350
so in this draft I introduce a new IPSec

202
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:20,769
transport protected sub tier V the value

203
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,870
of this theory sub theory is that it's

204
00:11:20,769 --> 00:11:28,720
an IPSec convenient tag as defined in

205
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:31,360
the previous draft when IPSec in

206
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,290
capturing theory includes this new sub

207
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,810
theory it means that the sizing router

208
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:40,240
requires IPSec transport mode protection

209
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:45,430
for the corresponding IP tunnel so for

210
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,040
example if you have this IPSec transport

211
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:51,160
mode protection sub TV inside a VX LAN

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:53,949
at a node theory which means that the

213
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,010
vine router requires you to use IPSec

214
00:11:53,949 --> 00:12:03,849
trust mode along with VX Lantana to

215
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:06,640
reach this particular route so once the

216
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:09,550
receiving side receiving router get this

217
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:14,380
update and and descend to four packets

218
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:16,449
to this advancing router so he will use

219
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,510
following a piece of config to create a

220
00:12:16,449 --> 00:12:23,290
try to say so basically you use

221
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:25,029
transpose with ESP and then the public

222
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:28,810
probability instance would be the same

223
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:30,339
as the packet to be forwarded and the

224
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:32,949
pier tunnel address would be same as

225
00:12:30,339 --> 00:12:35,800
indicated in the remote endpoints of

226
00:12:32,949 --> 00:12:38,859
tier V the local traffic selector would

227
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:42,219
be the following address range would be

228
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:45,250
the Lakota endpoint address the protocol

229
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,310
and the pot grinch coming from the IPSec

230
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,970
configured attack mapped a value similar

231
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:53,739
to the motor traffic selector address

232
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,560
range would be the address in the remote

233
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,529
endpoint security of the selected tunnel

234
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,719
in capsule in theory the protocol and

235
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:03,100
Poe range will become from the tech

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,560
mapped value

237
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,560
and other transfer confusion like

238
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:10,689
transform a lifetime those ipsec

239
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,989
confusion also come from the tech map

240
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:18,520
value so this is a quite straightforward

241
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:21,610
idea to have this IPSec transport mode

242
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:26,620
protection protocol attano editor the

243
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:28,750
BGP so lastly I think because these two

244
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,790
draft is just the extension to existing

245
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:34,570
working group draft Italian Cup drafts

246
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:37,209
so I hope we can what more can consider

247
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:38,710
to adopt these two drafts and ideas

248
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,950
pretty straightforward

249
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:43,770
[Music]

250
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:47,050
Stephanie toasty

251
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:53,370
maybe question two chairs with the two

252
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:53,370
draft I do you plan to obsolete 5566

253
00:13:53,580 --> 00:14:02,380
sorry I was asking if you are planning

254
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:07,510
to deprecated 5566 if we are going

255
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:12,220
through this draft because we are

256
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:18,340
defining using all the way to to do for

257
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:22,720
example MPLS of our IP SEC or IPSec yeah

258
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:26,560
I think the answer I have a few

259
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:29,380
questions for him I the old IPSec

260
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,560
tunnels work slightly different in my

261
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:35,890
mind but I may need more clarity I don't

262
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,050
think we should I think they work

263
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:40,930
different is the answer but I may be

264
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:43,449
mistaken so before I can do a working

265
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,870
group last call or adoption call I've

266
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:51,070
got to figure out how much overlap last

267
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:54,730
time my understanding from the SEC folks

268
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,910
is that they made some suggestions for

269
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:00,610
it so I hope you'll be glad to read it

270
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,610
as well and give me your opinion along

271
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:05,230
with the other question okay I have a

272
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,340
little bit of a different answer I mean

273
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:11,950
not not contradictory but my answer is

274
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:12,850
does anyone here know of any reason why

275
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:16,840
we shouldn't

276
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:20,440
obsolete 55 66 if we adopt this work

277
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,440
you can answer later

278
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:28,130
this is Linda Dunbar from future way I

279
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:30,590
have a few questions on this so how do

280
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:32,960
you distribute this PGP update because

281
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:35,300
when you talk about IPSec between two

282
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:39,980
nodes right you're going through public

283
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,760
network so from a say we have four peers

284
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:48,589
how does he send this update to be also

285
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:51,710
just BGP regular listen well regular BGP

286
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:53,930
is transported through trusted domain so

287
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:57,890
here we're going through untrusted so

288
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:59,930
this message is BGP update from a do you

289
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:03,439
just suppose it as an internet package

290
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:06,469
just IP packet to send it to be through

291
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,420
with public internet yeah this is just V

292
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:10,820
so just the control plane protocol right

293
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:13,610
so yeah I think I think your point is

294
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:16,130
mainly on how do you I'll do safeguard

295
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:18,290
BGP itself from like attacking attacking

296
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:20,960
right that's that's your point like

297
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:25,040
there's a multiple mechanisms in VG like

298
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:28,310
HV sack like outbound the future you can

299
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,920
use those to prevent attacking okay so

300
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:33,010
no not much more than that because this

301
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,469
packet is not encrypted is it encrypted

302
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:39,110
no BGP server even we can run BGP as

303
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,720
well right all right but you have much

304
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:43,700
more information just than a s number

305
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,580
I'm talking to my peers you're talking

306
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:49,820
about configuration or the Lexi have a

307
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,730
is in Singapore B is in Beijing or in

308
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:55,970
Dallas for example and you're sending

309
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,310
this BGP update from Singapore to Dallas

310
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:59,410
through public internet with your

311
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:02,959
configuration

312
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:04,670
Wow is I mean this is tough see that

313
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,980
when you okay I don't really care

314
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:09,770
internet or not it's it's just IP

315
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:12,709
packets okay that's one question I have

316
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:16,400
second question I read your new draft

317
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:18,860
update you proposed for sub T OBS right

318
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,020
so I see some of the sub T Ovie's

319
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,708
information already carried by the BGP

320
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:27,740
update for example your local address

321
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,050
right local address actually you can be

322
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,950
encoded in the next index

323
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:36,020
and also why not no no so the local

324
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:38,990
local prefect as it is no it's not he's

325
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:43,510
not a little next stop I think about the

326
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,510
local endpoint kind of in point sub tre

327
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,899
not that that's already included in the

328
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,940
draft hey guys

329
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,590
our time is pretty tight so if you've

330
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,420
got like specific questions about

331
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:55,189
encodings and stuff like that I'd like

332
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,990
to ask you to keep that for the mailing

333
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,460
list if you have like fundamental

334
00:17:56,990 --> 00:18:00,110
questions like your first one was more

335
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:01,850
about the security properties I think

336
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:05,449
that's appropriate for our discussion

337
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:07,310
time here ok ok thank you my first main

338
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,220
concern because through the public

339
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:14,360
Internet the BGP and you do have someone

340
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,540
in line behind you jeff has and this is

341
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,860
directed mostly to Linda's question so

342
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:21,260
everything in the tunnel encapsulation

343
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:23,300
attribute has this security problem in

344
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,220
the sense of you know the security

345
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:27,200
properties can get away from where the

346
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:29,240
routes have been injected this means

347
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,980
that you have to worry about securing

348
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,300
this at your edges of your network that

349
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,450
is actually the terminal on caps

350
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:37,580
security considerations and this is a

351
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:39,620
section that the security ADEs have

352
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:41,270
given a little bit of scrutiny they're

353
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,360
not necessarily happy with our answer

354
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:47,200
about trying to scope the stuff but it's

355
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:50,959
already discussed in the document so

356
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:53,480
Jeff my understanding is when you use

357
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,000
the tunneling cap in an MPLS network or

358
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,730
in the trusted network and you are in

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,120
the ward in domain so that eliminates

360
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:05,750
some of the concerns oh that's my yes

361
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:06,889
and it does address it by having an ad

362
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,610
transports that are a little bit more

363
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:11,090
localized so you're having trouble

364
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:13,520
hearing you

365
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:18,970
and I I do need to so if you just raise

366
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:21,860
the mic sorry say that again

367
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,930
Linda is correct that transport such as

368
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:25,699
MPLS do have the advantage that they're

369
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:28,640
sort of put scopes locally to a network

370
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:31,220
whereas this or to take an example SR v6

371
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,540
which knows intentionally supposed to be

372
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,260
able to go across no things like the

373
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,360
Internet

374
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,790
the security considerations do change a

375
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,409
little bit and I suspect at some point

376
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:41,690
this is going to come back and make the

377
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:43,880
security ADEs make doesn't has Carter

378
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,799
questions okay so

379
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:52,580
that's that leads me to my next question

380
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:55,039
who do you feel this draft answers all

381
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,039
the security considerations that Ben

382
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,890
gave you last time because that that

383
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:02,720
will be my check before I before we go

384
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:06,289
through it I have to also answer the

385
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,570
IPSec I have to answer the administrator

386
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:11,960
I think I already applied every question

387
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:14,600
they posed in the mail list okay and

388
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:17,179
just thought that you believe you

389
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:19,580
finished it and you answer them and your

390
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:22,159
mailing list comment is is complete yes

391
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:24,740
okay I think I will I will need to I

392
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,720
read that I thought I followed it but I

393
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:28,520
will need to do a deep dive so this may

394
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,940
take me a little time to prep for a

395
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:35,690
working group adaption call I have to

396
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:38,390
open items the the previous IPSec VPNs

397
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:40,789
and this so please give me a little time

398
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:43,130
to do a little digging on this before

399
00:20:40,789 --> 00:20:44,658
not that I'm trying to not do an

400
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,990
adoption call I need to do an

401
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:50,120
intelligent one and just to conclude my

402
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:52,130
comments I do think that this work is

403
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,449
worth working on but getting the

404
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:59,530
security correct is going to be very

405
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:59,530
challenging thank you

406
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,950
okay hello can you hear me okay so this

407
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:19,100
is the second time we're presenting this

408
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:22,520
and just give an update on what we have

409
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:26,480
done so far so the intention of the

410
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:31,250
draft it is really a informational draft

411
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:33,770
we have applied a Safi for sd-1 and here

412
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:37,760
we want to explain how the sap is used

413
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:41,000
that's it and we will be glad to get I

414
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:43,520
would like to get your feedback on how

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,390
we use it or maybe some suggestions will

416
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,710
be even better

417
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:52,070
actually we already call some

418
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:56,510
suggestions from some IPSec folks so in

419
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:57,620
this domain you can see that we have a

420
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:00,650
bunch of CPEs

421
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,649
located in different locations and the

422
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:06,140
CPE is interconnected by multiple types

423
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:09,830
of network they can have MPLS Network

424
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:13,220
and they can also have in Internet

425
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:15,379
public Internet untrusted and they are

426
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:18,530
in their own administrative domain

427
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:20,840
together with the route reflector so

428
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:24,800
each of the nodes has the secure channel

429
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:28,580
to the rot reflector Dave Corral had

430
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,080
this good term Confederated IPSec so

431
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:33,470
it's different from the traditional

432
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,750
peer-to-peer IPSec like if you do

433
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:41,180
traditional IPSec as who we drink just

434
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,950
mention that you need to configure a lot

435
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,160
more things not only need to configure

436
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:49,400
yourself you configure your peers and

437
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:51,650
you configure who is attached on your

438
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:53,870
side and who is attached on the remote

439
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:57,490
side and you have to set up the tunnel

440
00:22:53,870 --> 00:23:02,149
peer-to-peer in this Confederated mode

441
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:04,670
each node don't even know who is he is

442
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:08,960
supposed to talk to basically the

443
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:12,010
security policy the set as ad is managed

444
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,470
by the reflector the central controller

445
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,750
this is for the SD one case a node is

446
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,880
expected to be 0 attached provisioning

447
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,680
while he being powered up supposed to be

448
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,190
running right away so he doesn't even

449
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,880
know who he can

450
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:29,400
talk to so he's in his own information

451
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:33,210
to the rot reflector to the controller

452
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:36,870
and then with his own information in the

453
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:40,470
wrong reflector decide who this message

454
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:42,659
is propagated to and in this domain is

455
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:46,410
under the assumption everybody trusts

456
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:49,550
his own controller because this update

457
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:53,460
is just a small portion of the entire

458
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:55,409
scheme of things not only you trust the

459
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,160
controller tell you who we are supposed

460
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:01,260
to talk to you also have other

461
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:04,020
configurations like the tractor pattern

462
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:06,629
who your client is a bunch of more

463
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:12,330
information which is complete out of

464
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:15,780
scope of BGP idea so in in this domain

465
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:19,250
the node himself what do a regular BGP

466
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:22,170
update to basically propagate his

467
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:25,500
attached routes that's basically his VPN

468
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:29,280
his attached routes he will use the BGP

469
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:31,860
update regular BGP update with I pass

470
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:35,300
attributes to indicate all the routes

471
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:38,729
and if they're tunnel and whatever

472
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:42,330
encapsulation he may use tunnel pass

473
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:45,210
attribute to indicate them and then in

474
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:47,460
addition to the regular BGP update what

475
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:51,660
he need to do next is to be able to

476
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:58,200
propagate the report properties because

477
00:24:51,660 --> 00:25:00,780
the web property from note like CP 2 is

478
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:03,060
not visible to the remote node right

479
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,440
remote knows doesn't know so what he

480
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:09,710
does need to do is be able to advocate

481
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:12,690
propagate the the web port properties

482
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:17,250
including the routable public routable

483
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:22,230
address because this PE choose port to

484
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:26,430
get assigned address from isp like for

485
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,830
example Verizon or China Telecom and so

486
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:31,800
he need to tell them Who am I my

487
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,350
identity and then send a message through

488
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:36,440
a secure channel to the route reflector

489
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:39,020
and row reflector were

490
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:41,600
propagate that information to the remote

491
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:47,060
notes were authorized remote notes in

492
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:50,810
them so in the Li the path attribute you

493
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:53,990
will give the identity of the sport the

494
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:57,320
one foot and in the past the tunnel in

495
00:25:53,990 --> 00:26:00,530
cap path attribute and you need to

496
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:03,620
include the net information you need to

497
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:07,070
include IPSec information if there's a

498
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:09,409
certain application can only be talking

499
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:12,500
have certain topology you may need to

500
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:16,070
indicate that as well so that's

501
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:19,310
basically how this new and RI is used is

502
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:21,710
used for an ten defy the web port that's

503
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:26,810
it the tunneling cap is pretty much

504
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:29,690
saying as before so so for the the web

505
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:33,320
port and entity there will be several

506
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:38,690
attributes to uniquely identify this

507
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:40,939
went port so there will be port and then

508
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,760
the fire write this port and then if I

509
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,560
may be locally significant the note may

510
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,580
only know oh this is meant number one

511
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:52,070
point number two port numbers report and

512
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:55,220
there's another attribute could be where

513
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:58,280
am i I'm in Singapore okay I'm in in

514
00:26:55,220 --> 00:27:01,250
Dallas for example basically geographic

515
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:04,340
location of this note whatever this

516
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:07,580
provider need to decide on they will use

517
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:11,629
their specific identifier for their site

518
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:14,750
location another one is the routable

519
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:18,020
address meaning how can anybody else

520
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:20,660
reach you right see if if I'm here in

521
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:23,240
Singapore and my peers in Dallas and

522
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:25,190
they had to know how to reach me

523
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,820
there has to be a routable address so

524
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:32,630
that's the note ID address okay

525
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:39,350
those three attributes uniquely identify

526
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:42,440
the port here is the sub TOB for the net

527
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,159
so basically you need to indicate what

528
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:49,580
kind of a net type it is you need to

529
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:50,240
indicate how your panel associated

530
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:54,490
property

531
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:57,200
associate with net here is the

532
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:59,000
information to be carried minimum

533
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,700
information we're not talking about full

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,370
suite of information for IPSec but

535
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,380
minimum information that there's no need

536
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:08,929
to pass through his route his controller

537
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:13,000
actually I took most of the information

538
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:16,400
from Dave Dave Corral's a draft so

539
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:21,620
basically you need to include what kind

540
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:24,320
of weather is a th or ESP whether it is

541
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,510
your public key right you have to tell

542
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,419
everybody a public key you have to tell

543
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:33,379
them the the key counter this key is the

544
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:36,080
first time or second time and you know

545
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,270
child tell the controller your nose and

546
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,370
you may have another indicator you

547
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:42,860
probably want to tell so I have another

548
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:46,090
field that keys three they're just four

549
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:51,610
additional field that's that's it and

550
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:55,129
that's the minimum ones and if if this

551
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:58,610
this and note need to establish like

552
00:28:55,130 --> 00:29:01,430
route based IPSec tunnel you can also do

553
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:05,709
that actually you can use footings draft

554
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:11,720
to be able to establish broad-based

555
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:14,870
IPSec tunnels so next step I would like

556
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,720
to call for working group adoption the

557
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:21,679
reason is to be able to demonstrate how

558
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:26,270
PGP is used to do the port based IPSec

559
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,880
and to scale the sd1 overlay Network I

560
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:33,379
guess I have two questions

561
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:36,940
one is is you you say it's to

562
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,740
demonstrate demonstrate how BGP is used

563
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:42,020
do you really mean like you want to ship

564
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:44,180
a product that actually does this or do

565
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:50,450
you actually mean you just want to use

566
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:56,660
it for a demo okay because today people

567
00:29:50,450 --> 00:30:01,280
use a HRP and use DM a VPN thr p and h

568
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:03,670
RP h RP that much so today people use an

569
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,399
HR p actually is modified and HRT

570
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:10,060
a Sharpie is for atm so they modify it

571
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,850
many vendors does that and it's okay for

572
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:15,490
device just supporting that by for

573
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,740
device already suppose a PGP stack is

574
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,480
much easier and simpler okay I was just

575
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,880
getting hung up on this word demonstrate

576
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,470
but really what you're saying is you

577
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:25,180
just like the solution you want to ship

578
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:30,040
the solution you think it's a worthwhile

579
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:32,680
solution yeah it's worse well yes okay

580
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:36,670
and then that leads into the second

581
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:40,720
question which is your intended status

582
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:43,480
as informational is that you don't want

583
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,050
it to be standards track well I just

584
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,430
feel like informational just to show

585
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:50,680
that this is in the first-come

586
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:53,530
first-serve branch of the Safiye

587
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:56,290
and just demonstrate how it's used okay

588
00:30:53,530 --> 00:30:57,879
I mean just because it's FCFS doesn't

589
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:05,740
mean that you can't ask for us to enter

590
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:11,050
its track I mean to me this looks like

591
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:14,670
standards track work and I would think

592
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:17,440
that if the working group I mean I guess

593
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:19,480
if the working group were going to adopt

594
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,030
it my inclination would be to say this

595
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:23,830
looks like standards track okay actually

596
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:26,710
I'm gonna work with David with me

597
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:29,560
afterwards and see if his draft like he

598
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:32,380
has this draft and if we want to take

599
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:35,560
the content for them his content is

600
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:38,950
device information message that's the

601
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:42,070
specific content of that merged together

602
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:45,850
with this draft then that definitely can

603
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:48,100
become standard yes

604
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:49,780
actually actually did John made the same

605
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,969
point I was gonna make about the

606
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,530
information I read the draft on the

607
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:55,930
plane and I didn't even realize I

608
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:59,770
thought it was standards track okay and

609
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:06,190
and I didn't check to see that the Safi

610
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:09,700
was a FC FS yeah I Anna so I didn't know

611
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,160
that you wouldn't need a document to

612
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:13,960
allocate one I mean it wasn't apparent

613
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,310
to me but I understand okay thank you

614
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,560
thank you that's a good question it does

615
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:19,030
look like stand-in in reading

616
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,850
it looked a lot like standard strike to

617
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:23,830
me to grace that okay so I work with

618
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:27,570
David is that's his component can be

619
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:33,780
merging with this one then we can okay

620
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:33,780
thank you thank you very much thanks I'm

621
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:56,650
so yes there's been a lot of interest in

622
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,460
this draft in in the last three months

623
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:03,790
since Montreal a lot of good discussion

624
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:06,820
on both the IDR list and the grow list a

625
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:09,280
lot of good feedback so we this was

626
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:11,860
Warren and I were keeping it alive for

627
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,810
the last maybe several years but now the

628
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,909
interest has picked up in the last two

629
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:20,830
months we have had two updates of this

630
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:24,070
draft Jeff offered some very interesting

631
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,550
slides with good insights regarding the

632
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:29,169
asset implementation and now how that

633
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:32,020
results in some of the quality behavior

634
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:34,900
that we see in the measurements he also

635
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,379
offers in couple of his slides some

636
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:42,940
pretty good advice or operational

637
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:45,430
considerations items so-so is going to

638
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,780
pick up on from some of the slides and

639
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:52,870
speak to them so tremendous interest in

640
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:54,070
trying to get this done the deprecated

641
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,620
yes

642
00:33:54,070 --> 00:33:57,760
sets and yes can fred seitz at least we

643
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:59,830
have been doing a great deal of

644
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:04,270
measurements and the measurements show

645
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:06,220
that out of 800,000 routes less than 500

646
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:08,590
have a assets in them so very a

647
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:10,929
minuscule percentage and if you start

648
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,750
looking at them more closely we've done

649
00:34:10,929 --> 00:34:15,700
a pretty detailed analysis the link is

650
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:19,300
at the bottom if you look at them

651
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:22,178
closely only 21 have meaningful air sets

652
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:25,480
and the remaining 450 so fifty-four and

653
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:29,168
fifty or so don't have they don't seem

654
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:30,940
to have meaningful air sets why before

655
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:31,418
you go off of that since that's an

656
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,299
interest

657
00:34:31,418 --> 00:34:40,808
in statistic do you know why you have

658
00:34:34,299 --> 00:34:43,210
these malformed oh goody I'm a straight

659
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:48,099
person so part of it is implementation

660
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:50,589
quirks so then we looked at aggregate

661
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:54,490
atomic aggregate aggregate or atomic

662
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:57,040
aggregate out of again 800,000 updates

663
00:34:54,489 --> 00:35:01,660
about 10 percent have aggregate

664
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:04,329
aggregator in them and out of the 76,000

665
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:08,890
or 10 percent less than half of them

666
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:12,250
also have atomic aggregate let Jeff

667
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:14,009
speak to the next so the interesting

668
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:16,180
thing we're seeing in this dad's is that

669
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:19,030
roughly 10 percent of the Internet is

670
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:21,640
using a knob that is resulting in

671
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,829
aggregation of routes so this is proving

672
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,540
that no this is actually a dangerous

673
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:27,220
thing for us to be touching what if we

674
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,990
actually get involved in the specs this

675
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,109
is really my feedback no that is

676
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:34,390
generated this light so slides that if

677
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,339
we're going to actually try to get rid

678
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:37,930
of this there's a lot of implication not

679
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:40,210
a lot of documents and if we get it

680
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:41,470
wrong well you're impacting 10% of the

681
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,140
prefixes on the Internet and that's

682
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:46,118
obviously a scary thing but looking at

683
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:47,618
specific data sets one of the things

684
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:49,540
that we see is you know these weird

685
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:52,089
things where we have a single S at the

686
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:55,839
end that has a set element in there and

687
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:57,730
now we have you know 40 to 71 actually

688
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,828
tells us how we do this and Jared moach

689
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:00,880
was actually very kind to send know some

690
00:35:59,829 --> 00:36:02,680
routes from his network that

691
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,930
demonstrated you know one of the reasons

692
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,910
we get into this simple example is that

693
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,180
consider a set of a s

694
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:12,160
set of routes that have you know in null

695
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:14,589
a s path this is strictly internal and

696
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,259
then you have similar set of routes that

697
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,450
have a single a s in there if you do

698
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:21,730
aggregation by the current rules you

699
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:23,410
know the longest common path is 0 and

700
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,510
everything else gets tossed into us at

701
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:27,730
length of 1 now what's sort of

702
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,680
interesting for these things it is

703
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:33,460
potentially possible in such a case

704
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,819
- maybe merge this into the actual AAS

705
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:38,049
sequence that's right next to it

706
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:40,000
in that case the length would be

707
00:36:38,049 --> 00:36:42,849
preserved versus what we actually see of

708
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,310
the set on there but the question really

709
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:48,070
becomes whether this is preserving the

710
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:50,049
actual origin 1/10 especially since the

711
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:51,790
whole point of this exercise is people

712
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,900
don't like this because of its impact on

713
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:57,850
rpki so the two observations here is

714
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:00,520
that in the case where you may actually

715
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:03,640
have in the case of you know and a s

716
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,780
followed by a set of the same a s the

717
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:06,549
merge operation has sort of an

718
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:08,950
optimization may make sense to preserve

719
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:11,530
the length the other observation is

720
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:13,089
pretty much the brief style of

721
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:15,370
aggregation which has been implemented

722
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,070
by pretty much every implementation of

723
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:23,770
each B aggregation since the 1990s will

724
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:26,070
actually make this know the correct this

725
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:30,610
picture is just to make the point that

726
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:35,230
if as long as a s 3 which is aggregating

727
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:38,020
P 1/24 and P 2/24 into a P slash 23 as

728
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:41,560
long as a s 3 does not announce the less

729
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:45,160
specific to a s 2 and even though a s 4

730
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,810
may announce it to a s to sew up that I

731
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:50,440
mean why horizontal is lateral

732
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:54,310
peer-to-peer and slanted is customer to

733
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:56,980
to provider so even if is for announces

734
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:59,320
the the less specific to a s 2 s 2 will

735
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,480
still be fine because it installs the

736
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,360
less specifics that are necessary within

737
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:07,020
the the the more specifics that are

738
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,820
necessary within the less specifics s

739
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,430
operation at a s 2 the overall operation

740
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:14,740
will be fine only problem arises when if

741
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:16,870
P 2 stash 24 gets cut off then there is

742
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,270
a possibility of data packets looping

743
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:21,520
for a brief period of time and that goes

744
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,970
away when the recovery happens the

745
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,800
network recovers or a s 2 decides to D

746
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,339
aggregate because it doesn't have one of

747
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,410
the contributing let more specifics so

748
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:35,820
with the aggregator alone and without

749
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:40,629
using a a set things seem to work fine

750
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:43,270
generally so in the draft we have this

751
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:47,530
must and should we are still debating

752
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:49,600
that we do say that if you are locally I

753
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:52,540
mean don't must you must not or the

754
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,779
router must not locally generate bgp

755
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:59,140
update messages containing a set a set

756
00:38:55,780 --> 00:39:01,600
or a s Confed set and we we do

757
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:04,720
say also that upon receipt of a message

758
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:06,819
of such kind the conformant BGP speaker

759
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,529
should use Street as we draw so one

760
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:10,960
question is would the working group like

761
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:15,010
to see that change to must just use the

762
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:17,860
stronger language and deprecated without

763
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,140
allowing any room for use of a assets'

764
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:22,540
under any circumstances and that would

765
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:26,410
help things like IP care origin

766
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:28,930
validation BGP SEC and Alexander's ASP a

767
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,930
great deal not having assets in the

768
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:34,870
updates so there are two choices here

769
00:39:31,930 --> 00:39:38,830
def is as you will see in the next few

770
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:42,960
slides he he thinks that it is possible

771
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:46,420
to just have a BCP with the operational

772
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,150
considerations clearly specified on the

773
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:51,610
other hand we can do a change to the

774
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,420
existing RFC's that that talk about a

775
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:57,460
SaaS Confed set make it as standards

776
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:59,380
document which which updates these other

777
00:39:57,460 --> 00:40:02,590
documents which has a asset india's

778
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,540
conferred set on them in them and it's

779
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:06,220
doable I have identified how many

780
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,900
mentions of these things are there we

781
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:09,520
can go and make specific target

782
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,430
recommendations regarding wording

783
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,960
changes so that syllable so just if you

784
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,220
go back to that I'd like to add

785
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:22,060
something however and I were just

786
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:25,779
discussing the fact that there is some

787
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:31,720
desire to see RC forty to seventy one

788
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:34,980
head tortoise internet standard and some

789
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:39,279
of these might fall along the same way

790
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:43,480
that is one of the projects that I'll

791
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,760
send to the working group it might be

792
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,750
the time to do that since we would have

793
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,450
to do it anyway

794
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:56,500
and I had a lot of pieces so this might

795
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:58,600
not be the problem you're thinking that

796
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:01,390
was something we were talking about in

797
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:06,610
the Charter if you hate that idea do

798
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:09,040
come tell the chairs the idea if we do

799
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:12,370
an internet standard is not new features

800
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,000
but to document what is existing in out

801
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,150
there

802
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:21,970
just so I holding questions just one

803
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:23,590
second so the feedback I have given is

804
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:26,200
that if we are going to touch these

805
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:27,970
specs it is deeply intrusive and we have

806
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,859
to be very very very very careful about

807
00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:32,410
them and a number of us spent a lot of

808
00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:35,230
time getting these right the alternate

809
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,500
paths for you know standardizing this or

810
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:40,599
PC peeing this is no we're saying pretty

811
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:42,910
much every implementation does support

812
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:44,740
brief aggregation so no new code is

813
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:48,549
actually needed to do the correct thing

814
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:50,649
here convincing your vendor that a

815
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:52,690
default knob no needs to change his

816
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,820
behavior that's a different question but

817
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:58,210
in terms of functionality it is already

818
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:00,820
present there isn't any need to

819
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,970
necessarily change in the RFC's 6472

820
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:05,890
came out some time ago and said stop

821
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:09,009
doing this well they're not gonna stop

822
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:10,690
doing this is brief implementations it

823
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:12,609
is reasonable to ask the vendors

824
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:15,220
including the person that's standing at

825
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:17,410
the microphone here to add policy such

826
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:19,359
that a assets can be matched with in the

827
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:23,339
policy engine so that you can implement

828
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,080
no drop this prefix if you so chose and

829
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:28,529
somewhat in the absence of no people

830
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:32,080
actually no doing any of these things

831
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:34,869
rpki filtering is becoming more and more

832
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:36,819
common if people don't clean up their

833
00:42:34,869 --> 00:42:38,109
own act in their own self-interest

834
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,150
they're just something I get their

835
00:42:38,109 --> 00:42:44,109
routes filtered anyway you know this is

836
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:46,510
a self-correcting problem my sort of

837
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:49,089
recommendation is that we take this

838
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,560
opportunity and you know clean it use

839
00:42:49,089 --> 00:42:53,740
the operational considerations section

840
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:55,089
here and cover the facts of what happens

841
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,470
but you know what was sets actually

842
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:58,509
there for it what does it actually

843
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:00,279
prevent you in terms of receiving routes

844
00:42:58,510 --> 00:43:03,359
within your network and receiving your

845
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,430
own forwarding so you know that the

846
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,009
behaviors that we need that we see that

847
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:10,839
are known that are called out in the RFC

848
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,450
but aren't necessarily something you

849
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:15,190
think through unless you're an operator

850
00:43:12,450 --> 00:43:17,230
aggregators you know the person that's

851
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,450
actually doing that needs to supply the

852
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,920
more specifics to the contributing a s's

853
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:22,540
you know that's that's the behavior that

854
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,940
was expected out of this when you're

855
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:26,800
doing proxy aggregation it's not

856
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:28,480
documented anywhere

857
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,630
the entity that's doing the aggregation

858
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:34,260
should not send the aggregate downstream

859
00:43:31,630 --> 00:43:36,730
to the contributing gases and that

860
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,010
answers that are getting aggregated

861
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:40,720
probably should be rejecting routes that

862
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:42,640
contain your own address space and

863
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,500
making sure that we have some sort of

864
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:48,819
policy knob that's capable of doing that

865
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:50,860
you know is a tricky thing I'm aware of

866
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:53,500
from at least one that when a service

867
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:55,000
provider that they have a practice of

868
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,710
taking their own address space and

869
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,180
basically nailing up a black hole route

870
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:00,670
internally for all of their own space

871
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,470
and this keeps traffic knowing in the

872
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,050
case you actually do get some sort of a

873
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:07,509
great route internetwork from leaving

874
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:09,310
the network this again is not written

875
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:17,170
down anywhere and this is not a bad

876
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:19,270
place to put it okay please keep

877
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:20,410
comments brief we are running really

878
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:24,520
short on time thank you

879
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:27,220
shared much Akamai thank you

880
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,410
also sorry for the ASX that we found and

881
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:31,359
thank you for looking into it if you

882
00:44:29,410 --> 00:44:33,160
find any more from us we'd like to clean

883
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,250
those up because those are definitely

884
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,390
not an intended operation and I suspect

885
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,660
that's the case actually with the

886
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:44,109
majority of the ones out there I think

887
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:46,600
that we probably want to deprecated this

888
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:48,069
this stuff and it might be helpful if

889
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,290
the vendor has even delivered a soft

890
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,390
knob where I could on my administrative

891
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,060
domain say hey I'd like to drop these

892
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:56,980
there's drop path attributes options

893
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:59,020
that exist on some vendors that allow

894
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:01,450
you to drop those and if I can drop

895
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:04,509
routes including certain path attributes

896
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:07,359
and being able to drop a SS routes I

897
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:09,250
suspect would allow people to update and

898
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:11,009
correct their configuration and the

899
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:13,300
aggregate function I think has been

900
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:14,950
we've we've seen a number of weird

901
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:16,210
issues with that and we're gonna we need

902
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:18,279
to change the way that we r originator

903
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:22,480
routes as a result but thank thank you

904
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:25,900
for this Warren Kumari Google um while

905
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,180
I'm all for moving 40 to 71 to like full

906
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,619
standard but keep in mind it's a huge

907
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:30,339
job and it's gonna take a really really

908
00:45:29,619 --> 00:45:32,859
long time

909
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:36,190
I've seen oh and it's gonna be much

910
00:45:32,859 --> 00:45:39,069
navel-gazing I've projected this three

911
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:43,510
times before Warren

912
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:45,700
I'm but I think it's really neat that

913
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:47,800
there'd be a short-term effect because

914
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:51,700
this needs to happen sooner rather than

915
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:54,670
later I think I want to echo Jared this

916
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,279
is a thank you this is going to be a lot

917
00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:00,370
of hard work but it's needed to be done

918
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:02,890
we couple of years so you go gosh and

919
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:06,220
skip Verizon media Yahoo a couple years

920
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:08,170
ago like eight or so we went through a

921
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,850
painful process of changing every single

922
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,100
announcement that we had that was using

923
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:15,400
aggregation a assets to do atomic

924
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:17,350
aggregate so I'd like to echo Jared can

925
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:20,200
you give people a knob that just says

926
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:22,779
convert AS sets to atomic aggregate that

927
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,509
would be such an applied and I think

928
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:29,340
most of it it could just be work around

929
00:46:25,510 --> 00:46:29,340
kind of like that because for most of us

930
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:34,330
it was just the default way of doing

931
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,279
aggregation we just say aggregate this

932
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:38,980
it came from three different asses and

933
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,840
they just kind of got nailed up so I get

934
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:42,790
it I'm gonna call this the guillotine

935
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,500
option I don't think it's actually a

936
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,810
good idea to go changing other people's

937
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:49,530
AAS paths even though you know obviously

938
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:52,270
you could do such a an OP to do this on

939
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:53,800
your infrastructure cleats brief yeah

940
00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:55,480
it's what the whole thing's for yeah so

941
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,700
that would be very helpful to be able to

942
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,410
do that so if you're an aggregator and

943
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:02,080
you've got a s set as a result of you

944
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:04,330
being an aggregator just kill it because

945
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:06,400
otherwise at least right now you have to

946
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:11,350
go manually router out another router

947
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:19,600
and that takes time but that's okay all

948
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:25,110
the noise can fix your telecom just a

949
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:27,870
short remark I'll try seeing seeing

950
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:32,530
discussion about cleaning up certain

951
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:37,690
historic artifacts and deprecating some

952
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:40,900
of them I would suggest we probably

953
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:47,170
should be also considering to clean up

954
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:51,910
as far as possible the a that you bite a

955
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:52,490
SS showing up just I I got the idea we

956
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,819
should be

957
00:47:52,490 --> 00:47:59,319
thinking about it after once more this

958
00:47:55,820 --> 00:48:04,040
week having to comment that well okay

959
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:11,420
figure well okay creating complexity in

960
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:13,700
new BGP stuff to take care of the of

961
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:17,000
implementations that actually don't do

962
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:22,279
to be don't do for by it is that's

963
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:25,430
that's a that's a thing of a past so

964
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:27,590
comments the chairs basically what we

965
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,930
have is no we the original draft which

966
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:31,340
says let's perceive a deprecation I'm

967
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:32,960
offering an alternate path that's

968
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:35,060
basically here's ways to take it forward

969
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,290
as a clean up thing the Britain group

970
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:38,799
will need to figure out which way wants

971
00:48:36,290 --> 00:48:44,930
to go I can contribute text either right

972
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:46,820
thank you yep so as you will have

973
00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:51,740
noticed from my increasing I so we're

974
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:54,290
done thank you for my increasing

975
00:48:51,740 --> 00:49:00,200
agitation we are running super short on

976
00:48:54,290 --> 00:49:16,460
time we so kitten I'm gonna ask you yeah

977
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:21,500
to just fly through these all right okay

978
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:24,290
so this very quick get ontological Cisco

979
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:29,210
so we have this working group draft

980
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:31,279
it's about SR policy Safi for signaling

981
00:49:29,210 --> 00:49:32,260
of SR policies from controllers to head

982
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,970
ends by a BGP

983
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:37,100
now it's been there for quite some time

984
00:49:34,970 --> 00:49:40,129
and we are preparing for working group

985
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:42,560
last call it's a companion draft of the

986
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:46,460
SR policy architecture draft which is in

987
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,369
spring and also close to working group

988
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:53,270
last call implementations are around

989
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:56,570
even deployments so what we have done in

990
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,470
this recent updates is taken care of

991
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:01,369
some things

992
00:49:57,470 --> 00:50:04,129
to make this last called smoother and go

993
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:06,050
faster so I'm not going to go into all

994
00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,350
of these because there has been some

995
00:50:06,050 --> 00:50:08,480
disk

996
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:12,860
on the thread and we are running short

997
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:16,130
of time so key points is error handling

998
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:19,870
things have been consolidated in in one

999
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:22,310
section just to make it easier IANA

1000
00:50:19,870 --> 00:50:25,310
considerations has been updated to catch

1001
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,770
something which was missed out from the

1002
00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,230
color extended community and some minor

1003
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:34,220
changes to the allocation process we

1004
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:36,320
welcome feedback so this is really more

1005
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,870
of a heads up to the working group to

1006
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:40,580
review provide inputs implementation

1007
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:44,029
reports have been updated with two

1008
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:48,290
implementations so hopefully by when

1009
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:51,200
cooler maybe we can get it the next one

1010
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:53,600
is the BGP also working group document

1011
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,680
for BGP LS applications specific

1012
00:50:53,600 --> 00:51:01,850
attributes this will be even faster hope

1013
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:06,319
so just want to update the progression

1014
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:08,299
so this was adopted and we have got code

1015
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,950
points and implementations are also in

1016
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:11,420
progress

1017
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:14,029
the key thing which I wanted to point

1018
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:16,850
out here is that underlying IGP specs

1019
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:19,610
have are in the review is de review and

1020
00:51:16,850 --> 00:51:23,750
as they have been updated based on

1021
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:26,300
feedback we have updated this spec to be

1022
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:29,000
aligned with them so again I'm not going

1023
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:31,970
to go into the details but at a high

1024
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,290
level that's all about what the changes

1025
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:40,100
to this draft is so we are requesting

1026
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:43,490
for review and once the IDP drafts go

1027
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:45,950
past the work there is d reviews we hope

1028
00:51:43,490 --> 00:51:52,250
that we can do a working group last call

1029
00:51:45,950 --> 00:51:55,100
for this as well AC are you here still

1030
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:57,140
yeah there when you look at it for I GPS

1031
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:59,540
would you make sure that it still makes

1032
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:02,660
sure to be a standalone document with

1033
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:05,150
with this being this that this document

1034
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,759
should be a standalone document you

1035
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:12,650
don't have to answer just we look at it

1036
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,330
a seal and a seal indem Cisco Systems LS

1037
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:17,450
our working group chair it should be a

1038
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:19,470
standalone document because the two IG p

1039
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:22,680
documents have gone

1040
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:23,730
so far okay thank you that I mean

1041
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:26,578
they're they're actually they're

1042
00:52:23,730 --> 00:52:28,589
actually in in lburrows q4 review

1043
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,180
they've completed working group last

1044
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:33,328
call

1045
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:36,690
hi my name is Ian from juniper I'm going

1046
00:52:33,329 --> 00:52:48,869
to present this new draft called the BGP

1047
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:52,109
flexible color based on o selection so

1048
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:56,550
in the inter demand sigma routing we are

1049
00:52:52,109 --> 00:52:59,069
seeing more and more cases where you

1050
00:52:56,550 --> 00:53:01,680
know network attributes and natural

1051
00:52:59,070 --> 00:53:05,579
resources are assigned colors and colors

1052
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:08,970
used together with BGP next hop to map a

1053
00:53:05,579 --> 00:53:12,030
prefix you know a service prefix or pelo

1054
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:15,328
prefix to transport a nose so in this

1055
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:18,599
case here we have pedal prefix with BGP

1056
00:53:15,329 --> 00:53:22,470
next sub N and color red and we map it

1057
00:53:18,599 --> 00:53:25,050
to a red tunnel to n there are two

1058
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:28,828
reason behind that once that you know

1059
00:53:25,050 --> 00:53:31,410
color is a very generic in the notion it

1060
00:53:28,829 --> 00:53:35,490
can be used to represent any you know

1061
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:39,118
there were attributes second reason is

1062
00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:42,629
that you know color encoded as BGP

1063
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:45,480
community can be conveniently signaled

1064
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:48,869
across the main boundaries and can be

1065
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:52,770
signal from controller to routers so if

1066
00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:55,530
we can assign colors to network

1067
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:57,480
attributes or animal resources we'll be

1068
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:02,060
able to create the color tunnels and

1069
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:06,180
color the panel prefixes the kind of

1070
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:08,910
tunnel would be the color of the network

1071
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:11,430
attribute that based on which the tunnel

1072
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:14,490
is established and the color of the

1073
00:54:11,430 --> 00:54:16,919
payload prefix will be the color of the

1074
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:21,149
you know that the color of the type of

1075
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:24,180
the tunnel that the prefix desires so on

1076
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:26,760
top of that if we can do color based

1077
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,848
Tunnel selection will have a very

1078
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:32,270
general service map in the chasm it can

1079
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:33,520
work in you know inter domain

1080
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:39,360
environment

1081
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:43,360
and controller driven environments so uh

1082
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:46,390
red you know red color panel prefix

1083
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:50,110
mapping to a retino is the most basic

1084
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:52,230
mapping mode in many cases we would like

1085
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:54,670
to have much more flexibility

1086
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:57,490
flexibility so that's the purpose of

1087
00:54:54,670 --> 00:55:00,280
this draft in this draft

1088
00:54:57,490 --> 00:55:03,790
so this trap introduced a set of you

1089
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:06,640
know the final defines a set of extended

1090
00:55:03,790 --> 00:55:09,270
mapping modes and it talks about how to

1091
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:13,740
use this mode to construct so called

1092
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:19,300
flexible selection schemes each scheme

1093
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:22,149
consists of a sequence of extended modes

1094
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:25,870
in in a fallback order meaning that you

1095
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:28,630
know you select your title based on the

1096
00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:32,049
first mode if it's unsuccessful you you

1097
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:34,390
know move on to your second mode and a

1098
00:55:32,050 --> 00:55:37,420
third mode so on so in this example we

1099
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:41,609
have pelo prefix with next op n and

1100
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:46,150
color red and that the user may define a

1101
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:49,060
scheme and attach to that

1102
00:55:46,150 --> 00:55:52,150
pelo prefix there are three modes in

1103
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:55,630
this scheme the first ones are color IP

1104
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:58,530
card with a fallback blue and green so

1105
00:55:55,630 --> 00:56:01,810
what this means that you know will first

1106
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:04,930
attempt to find a red tunnel to end if

1107
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:07,270
it's unsuccessful we'll move on to look

1108
00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:10,629
for a blue you know a plutonic to N and

1109
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:12,520
and now green tunnel to n if the entire

1110
00:56:10,630 --> 00:56:15,550
first mode is and success we will move

1111
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:18,490
on to the second mode which is in this

1112
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:21,400
case converged IP color with a fallback

1113
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:24,580
blue meaning that we're going to convert

1114
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:28,360
the IP address and to a ipv6 address and

1115
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:31,240
then look for a red tunnel to that ipv6

1116
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,760
service or if it's a and successful

1117
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:37,479
we'll move on to a pluton know if the

1118
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:40,030
entire second mode is unsuccessful we're

1119
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,250
going to the third mode which is IP only

1120
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:46,300
meaning that we can I just equal ignore

1121
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:48,420
the color and look for a and color the

1122
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:53,370
tunnel to

1123
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:56,530
so there are three modes to provision a

1124
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:59,859
flexible selection scheme first one is

1125
00:56:56,530 --> 00:57:02,410
called ingress provision mode in this

1126
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,570
mode we configure the scheme as a local

1127
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:07,420
policy on the ingress router and we

1128
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:10,090
apply that you know policy to the

1129
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:14,770
payload prefixes second voice mode is

1130
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:17,220
called egress provisioning mode we

1131
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:20,290
comfort a configure the scheme the

1132
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:23,230
egress router and I will use BGP to

1133
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:26,410
signal the scheme with the payload

1134
00:57:23,230 --> 00:57:29,320
prefix to two ingress routers and here

1135
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:32,290
we are using a new path attribute called

1136
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:36,100
the flexible color tunnel exit path

1137
00:57:32,290 --> 00:57:39,520
attribute and then on the each ingress

1138
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:43,420
router we you know apply the scheme to

1139
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,830
the associate pelo prefixes similarly we

1140
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,990
have a third mode called controller

1141
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:50,950
provisioning mode where the controller

1142
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:53,169
will signal the scheme by using the the

1143
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:56,230
new path attribute to ingress routers

1144
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:58,690
and then on each ingress router we apply

1145
00:57:56,230 --> 00:58:03,640
the scheme to associate the pale Oprah

1146
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:07,390
Figgis this shows the encoding of the

1147
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:11,080
new path attribute it consists of a

1148
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:15,700
sequence of extended mapping mode T RVs

1149
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:18,279
each t RV has a mode value and it may

1150
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:21,700
optionally have a list of four for bad

1151
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:24,310
colors so this Lisa for bad colors

1152
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:30,910
applied to the some some mode not all

1153
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:34,120
the modes okay and the segment routing

1154
00:58:30,910 --> 00:58:37,540
policy draft and ID are same routing

1155
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:41,410
policy draft defines two so called color

1156
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:43,870
only a bits in the color extending

1157
00:58:41,410 --> 00:58:45,240
community and defines three four back

1158
00:58:43,870 --> 00:58:48,549
modes

1159
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:53,040
compared to that this this draft just

1160
00:58:48,550 --> 00:58:54,810
you know provide a more flexible and

1161
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:58,060
extendable

1162
00:58:54,810 --> 00:59:00,520
mechanism in the fully support the four

1163
00:58:58,060 --> 00:59:04,600
back predefined by the the

1164
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:07,270
two drafts in the case that the a

1165
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:11,440
flexible selection scheme and the sealed

1166
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:13,930
bids coexist if the the scheme is

1167
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:16,390
defined as a local policy on the ingress

1168
00:59:13,930 --> 00:59:21,640
router will give you no preference to

1169
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:25,930
the local policy if it's received by the

1170
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:28,509
new path attribute and in that case

1171
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:30,779
we're going to give preference to the C

1172
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:34,660
opiates

1173
00:59:30,780 --> 00:59:36,580
so next hall next steps we like to

1174
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:39,960
encourage the working group to review

1175
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:44,460
and I have just a few questions for you

1176
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:48,340
number one have you shown this

1177
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:50,920
particular scheme to the spring folks

1178
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:55,120
who are working on the other dress with

1179
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:58,680
policy we have not okay that might be at

1180
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:02,020
least why since you refer to that

1181
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:05,529
secondly can you compare and contrast it

1182
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:07,840
with the use that other than the IPSec

1183
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:14,170
portion that June was using for his

1184
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:18,340
color the the in captain cut path

1185
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:22,210
attribute applies to a prefix that's you

1186
01:00:18,340 --> 01:00:27,460
know you know Tom knows that bill there

1187
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:31,030
pal right specify actually I'm sorry can

1188
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:32,830
I ask you to take it offline because

1189
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:35,470
we're we're actually out of session time

1190
01:00:32,830 --> 01:00:38,020
we have one more thing on the agenda I

1191
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:40,240
will ask people if you can if you have

1192
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:46,690
five minutes please give us five more

1193
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:48,399
minutes please we did have go ahead I'm

1194
01:00:46,690 --> 01:00:49,840
just as you're setting up I'm gonna make

1195
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,530
one other announcement which was we had

1196
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:55,690
one extra talk that came in late we put

1197
01:00:53,530 --> 01:00:57,460
it on if time allows time is not going

1198
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:59,770
to allow I'm sorry Louis

1199
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:02,050
you know group members can look on that

1200
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:06,460
on this meeting material site and see

1201
01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:09,670
the slides hello I'm hiper wall from

1202
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:14,220
Holly a noun well introduce a definition

1203
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:14,220
a tRNA is filter for TPA flows back

1204
01:01:14,970 --> 01:01:20,939
because now frostback is used for a

1205
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:23,549
judge traffic or more and more some some

1206
01:01:20,940 --> 01:01:25,320
operators give me some requirements

1207
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:29,640
outside you want to adjust a trafficker

1208
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:31,980
from four special is from one side to

1209
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:35,250
another side such as the front they want

1210
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:37,860
to adjust the traffic from r2 to r3 in

1211
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:41,220
current method or we can we also care

1212
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:42,840
into each but we must generate several

1213
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:46,709
multiple across the back roads

1214
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:49,980
understanding the true the rotor we must

1215
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:53,640
use for sewing room you will use s IP

1216
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:56,190
and the IP and multiple to do this but

1217
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,109
we probably mostly sell so we use one

1218
01:01:56,190 --> 01:02:01,530
road to instead of multiple we use a

1219
01:01:58,110 --> 01:02:03,840
destination IP or aeneas route to

1220
01:02:01,530 --> 01:02:07,920
instead of multi port kasnia IP address

1221
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:10,440
this is have some benefits for example

1222
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:13,230
it's easier to for operator operator and

1223
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:16,260
also with it will reduce the messages

1224
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:19,230
for several earth from server server to

1225
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:25,110
rotor and also it may reduce the number

1226
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:29,400
of suspects table entries we now use a

1227
01:02:25,110 --> 01:02:32,580
new component type 40s and we for this

1228
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:36,420
common highway suggest method to to

1229
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:39,360
realize it to look up or to knock out

1230
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:43,050
fit then catch the t IPS or me ears and

1231
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:46,110
then use a TS to match the distro also

1232
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:49,170
you may have another two options you to

1233
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:54,150
expand that he asked for to multiple the

1234
01:02:49,170 --> 01:02:56,070
IP based arose under the there is a

1235
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:58,830
location and the evolution gotcha we may

1236
01:02:56,070 --> 01:03:01,560
come back combined this leg z combines a

1237
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:03,600
new component which exists for us back

1238
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:07,350
common answer for shark man matching the

1239
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:09,240
way combined with the money touched and

1240
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:12,990
also more new types so we want to

1241
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:15,660
introduce such as a society or nes and

1242
01:03:12,990 --> 01:03:19,319
destination IP community or society

1243
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:21,920
community and the others and we also

1244
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:25,350
have will receive some comments there

1245
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,110
are two about too many considered one is

1246
01:03:25,350 --> 01:03:30,630
the security consideration we

1247
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:32,040
that we may use capability negotiation

1248
01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:33,930
for direction

1249
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:36,480
direct connection between Realtors and

1250
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:39,299
our flow space or us and also we may

1251
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:41,790
your PMP to connect a Rotel capability

1252
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:43,350
then the server can control whether to

1253
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:45,990
send us a new component the type to the

1254
01:03:43,350 --> 01:03:48,930
rotor also women you know the target to

1255
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:52,859
country to control well which rotor that

1256
01:03:48,930 --> 01:03:55,589
can receive this new component type and

1257
01:03:52,860 --> 01:03:58,370
now another question Natalie whether we

1258
01:03:55,590 --> 01:04:01,070
will use a new Safi for this common type

1259
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:04,500
because now the new covenant I will also

1260
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:06,870
provides a match criteria under a fruit

1261
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:08,610
spec architecture north of the component

1262
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:11,819
type of menu together with existing

1263
01:04:08,610 --> 01:04:13,890
common type so we don't want to use a

1264
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:17,430
new Safiye

1265
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:22,950
later on we may welcome to or for

1266
01:04:17,430 --> 01:04:25,379
comments thank you Jeff Alice I'm going

1267
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:27,839
to just make the point that my this

1268
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:30,060
comments stand please review the

1269
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,880
comments on the list for context but you

1270
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:35,700
have mischaracterize my objection my

1271
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,530
objection is that flowspec operates and

1272
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:39,299
firewall rules you are reaching across

1273
01:04:37,530 --> 01:04:43,860
the boundary between the firewall and

1274
01:04:39,300 --> 01:04:46,860
the red I agree I agree a seal in them

1275
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:48,480
especially you have the AS origin and i

1276
01:04:46,860 --> 01:04:50,220
think okay you're pushing that into the

1277
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:52,560
fifth then you say we could do all these

1278
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:54,180
other rules to it i'm thinking oh my god

1279
01:04:52,560 --> 01:05:00,180
you're gonna put all the bgp attributes

1280
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:02,220
into the FIB no same command and is

1281
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:04,049
number or any other bootie Phe booties

1282
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:05,730
never and keep your interaction with the

1283
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:10,320
best path selection and be clear about

1284
01:05:05,730 --> 01:05:13,160
that it's not a good idea by the way you

1285
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:16,920
know if we do not consider expanded

1286
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:21,750
releases total too many week because

1287
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:26,550
they're only the as ace number because

1288
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:28,650
you know you can take the flow control

1289
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:32,910
more flag more flexibility you know and

1290
01:05:28,650 --> 01:05:37,620
is option against the you know kind of a

1291
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:37,920
but fifth table okay you don't from

1292
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:40,049
Howie

1293
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:42,160
actually I think we in this draft it

1294
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:44,319
provides two options wise you

1295
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:46,058
match the destination is in the FIBA

1296
01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,420
another issue you think lenses to

1297
01:05:46,059 --> 01:05:51,910
several rules in the device but you just

1298
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:59,160
need to advertise wine from the server

1299
01:05:51,910 --> 01:06:01,359
this is two options okay now because

1300
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:05,140
we're five minutes over thank you

1301
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:07,980
everybody for sticking it out sorry for

1302
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:11,650
running over our time twice in one week

1303
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:13,000
we'll try to do better next time hope to

1304
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:15,549
see you all there

1305
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:17,019
please I know we've had to cut off

1306
01:06:15,549 --> 01:06:19,059
several conversations I hope you

1307
01:06:17,019 --> 01:06:19,538
continue them on the list or out in the

1308
01:06:19,059 --> 01:06:22,170
hallway

1309
