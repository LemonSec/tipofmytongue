39
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,940

41
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,980

46
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:58,489

00:03:51,400 --> 00:04:00,440

now you can't read it but you've read it

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:14,300
all week so doesn't matter remember we

51
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:17,239
are the it was it it was a push button

52
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:22,160
on PowerPoint that said make all letter

53
00:04:17,238 --> 00:04:23,810
Heights the same width I'm mad I was

54
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,490
great I was like looking free you know

55
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:31,190
one of those fuzz out options and I

56
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:31,879
didn't see so I just um yeah though the

57
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,439
weird

58
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:35,839
the weird thing about this is if you

59
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,809
look at the at the end of the third line

60
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:41,119
were where it says carefully that's in

61
00:04:38,809 --> 00:04:44,020
period not an L that it stretched out to

62
00:04:41,119 --> 00:04:49,909
the same height as all the other letters

63
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:50,589
okay yeah come on okay no well continued

64
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:54,020
there we go

65
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:57,139
all right document status these are the

66
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,669
ones that are done draft Acme CAA was in

67
00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:01,240
the queue was published two days ago

68
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:04,308
three days ago so cool

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:08,749
Acme IP challenged IP address challenges

70
00:05:04,309 --> 00:05:11,389
in the queue TLS a LPN in the queue and

71
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:14,149
Acme star which is sort of the first of

72
00:05:11,389 --> 00:05:20,990
two of the short-term certificate stuff

73
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:23,229
is also an acute document status in

74
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:23,229
progress

75
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,459
so we have agenda items and slides for

76
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:31,039
the first three I'm sorry Jen arms for

77
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,889
the s/mime John is in miyako maybe he'll

78
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,179
say something you're on you want to just

79
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:38,059
come to the mic since I didn't get the

80
00:05:35,179 --> 00:05:47,748
slide loaded and say what's going on you

81
00:05:38,059 --> 00:05:51,860
can come up here you're on shuffle we

82
00:05:47,749 --> 00:05:55,189
haven't published Rev since last IDF we

83
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:57,169
did meet with people from city and I so

84
00:05:55,189 --> 00:06:02,329
we have better understanding of that use

85
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:05,599
case and the next so the draft the next

86
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:11,119
big thing on the draft right now is a

87
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:15,789
way for the identity owner to to signal

88
00:06:11,119 --> 00:06:19,249
a csr template to the name delegation

89
00:06:15,789 --> 00:06:27,919
client so that the NDC can actually

90
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:33,139
generate a CSR policy any questions how

91
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:35,269
many people read this draft all right

92
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:42,079
how many people have interest in the

93
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:44,829
star technology okay but half dozen

94
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,509
almost all right

95
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:54,329
so we'll it'll be on the agenda for

96
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:54,329
Vancouver great okay

97
00:06:54,359 --> 00:07:02,649
document status three drafts on the

98
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:10,049
agenda to consider for adoption and

99
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:10,049
that's it for the chair slides Oh John

100
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:18,189
hey can you me yes okay fantastic so

101
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:20,859
yeah I just wanted to say we did submit

102
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:22,779
new version of the both of the two

103
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:24,519
acmetropolis related to the ongoing stir

104
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:26,649
work the good news is we're now getting

105
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:29,469
the point actually where the stir CAS

106
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:31,029
are imminently gwyne to diploma it's a

107
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:34,539
goal at least America that there will be

108
00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:37,289
initial shakin CAS and December

109
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:39,459
timeframe actually it's pretty cool

110
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:40,959
weather Acme immigration would be part

111
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,019
of that initial phase of it we're not

112
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:45,399
quite sure yet we think probably more at

113
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:46,989
the end of January we'll have some

114
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:49,059
better visibility into exactly when that

115
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:51,128
is gonna get factored into the way that

116
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:52,779
practically these certificates get

117
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,699
issued I think it's still everyone's

118
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:56,949
long-term plan it's written into all the

119
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:58,629
at aspects but as with many of these

120
00:07:56,949 --> 00:08:00,519
kinds there's like a tremendous interest

121
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,099
in just getting something out now that

122
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:04,719
is signing calls and working so I mean I

123
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:06,429
think my intuition on news is we've

124
00:08:04,719 --> 00:08:08,889
submitted these versions I think they're

125
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:11,018
probably stable I would still hold them

126
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:12,549
though for another cycle I think just

127
00:08:11,019 --> 00:08:15,399
because I kind of want to see what is

128
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:18,039
gonna happen and what at us is gonna end

129
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,719
up correcting or not as you know we do

130
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,688
the initial rollout of these things

131
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:24,399
and so I would say what's CDs again in

132
00:08:22,689 --> 00:08:27,759
Vancouver I doubt they'll be any

133
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:30,309
different but they might be okay so I

134
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,079
will change the timeline from the end of

135
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:35,050
this year to just after next after

136
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:38,019
Vancouver right hold it for the four

137
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:40,929
months I mean you know I see no reason

138
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,339
to last call it until we you know get at

139
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:44,889
least this initial deployment out of the

140
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,959
way and we know that um since I mean it

141
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:49,179
you know there's CDs and stuff already

142
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,429
out there it's like let's just see what

143
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:52,899
happens for a bit but let's target that

144
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:55,600
we probably could like push these not

145
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:56,829
these done and around Vancouver okay

146
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,329
great

147
00:08:56,829 --> 00:09:04,888

okay I'm in the queue okay great hi

158
00:09:54,249 --> 00:09:59,259
so I updated the acne client draft which

159
00:09:56,949 --> 00:10:02,618
essentially establishes additional

160
00:09:59,259 --> 00:10:05,939
challenge types that can be used for

161
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:09,970
users with previously issued credentials

162
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:12,069
and if you just go to the next slide the

163
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,879
changes from the previous meeting is

164
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:19,660
that to challenge types were added from

165
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:24,429
Thomas Peterson's review text was added

166
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:28,689
for eg certificates from Tim Tims review

167
00:10:24,429 --> 00:10:31,149
and let's see I removed this section

168
00:10:28,689 --> 00:10:34,868
which was just legacy on device

169
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:38,379
certificates after Andres review and a

170
00:10:34,869 --> 00:10:41,019
bunch of points from Deb's review so

171
00:10:38,379 --> 00:10:44,529
there's been a fair amount of activity

172
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:47,439
on it and I'd love to know if there's

173
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:49,869
more interest in if this is ready for

174
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:55,029
working group adoption or interest in

175
00:10:49,869 --> 00:11:02,199
that okay how many people have read the

176
00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:04,839
document a smattering okay any comments

177
00:11:02,199 --> 00:11:07,378
on on in favor of or not in favor of

178
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:07,379
adoption

179
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:20,200
I patients on so generally in favor we

180
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,820
do similar things internally for for

181
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,880
entered by CAS there I'm sure there's

182
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:35,769
their stuff still missing here but as a

183
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:38,980
starting point yeah okay all right we'll

184
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:41,790
take a preliminary hum here hum now so

185
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:45,040
it'll be in favor of adoption opposed

186
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,660
don't know don't know decision so all

187
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,500
those in favor of adoption please come

188
00:11:46,660 --> 00:12:00,100
now all those opposed

189
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:03,360
all those undecided seemed clearly in

190
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,490
favor yeah I heard the most around

191
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,070
around in favor or no one against end a

192
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:11,320
little bit with for the third option

193
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:14,829
okay so I'll I'll send a note to the

194
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:16,240
list to confirm that and sometime

195
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,670
shortly after Thanksgiving Kathleen

196
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,250
resubmit as a formal document assuming

197
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:27,540
nothing comes up great thank you and

198
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,540
more reviews were appreciated yep okay

199
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:48,180
one of these days I'll figure out the

200
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:51,010
way the scroll works all right yeah okay

201
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:58,390
good morning everyone so I'll do a very

202
00:12:51,010 --> 00:13:01,380
quick update on s/mime it's only work

203
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,380
doesn't work okay

204
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:09,700
so yeah I'm it's Friday I'm not going to

205
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:14,110
bore you with all the changes I think

206
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:17,140
all the email related decisions are made

207
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:23,110
at this point about format and specific

208
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:27,010
examples who updated there is one open

209
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:30,070
issue about using D key M and what needs

210
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:35,470
to be signed to prevent people in the

211
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:42,070
inserting falsified header fields into

212
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:47,230
challenges and responses I think I know

213
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:50,410
what to do about this at this point I

214
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:52,839
think because this document requires

215
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:54,610
expertise from like as mine people as

216
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,750
well as acne people as well as pure

217
00:13:54,610 --> 00:14:00,910
email people I will I think it's ready

218
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,380
for working group law scholars is

219
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:05,350
knowing that there is one issue that

220
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:06,910
I'll fix and particularly if people can

221
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:13,660
have a look at security considerations

222
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:18,100
that would be much appreciated and I

223
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:20,920
will try to reach out to with raspberry

224
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:26,020
mission to lamps working group for

225
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:29,140
asthma expertise and to also I think IGF

226
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,870
SMTP where email people congregate to

227
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:37,480
ask for specific feedback on whether

228
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:42,190
it's sensible okay how many how many

229
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,570
people use email all right how many of

230
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,709
those would be hands up of red yes it

231
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:50,010
was a leading question how many of you

232
00:14:44,709 --> 00:14:52,839
read the document Thank You Russ okay

233
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:54,730
what we'll do I mean it was the

234
00:14:52,839 --> 00:14:56,529
timetable was you know before next

235
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:59,110
before Vancouver or in Vancouver so

236
00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:01,570
we'll do a last call will issue a last

237
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:04,240
call after the holidays early you know

238
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:07,029
January okay and then maybe be able to

239
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,459
progress it even if you want early it's

240
00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:13,260
up to you if you want after Thanksgiving

241
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:15,430
before Christmas I'm then I'll catch up

242
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,830
what are we good in January enjoy

243
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:19,120
today's final do it in January working

244
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:21,400
group last call with the intent to

245
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,230
advance right in the meantime I can

246
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,449
actually try out two people before that

247
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:33,960
so that's fine awesome that's problem so

248
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:37,830
okay great all right Thank You Owen

249
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,830
which one you want to talk about first

250
00:15:54,089 --> 00:15:58,089
okay so this is a new draft it was split

251
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,100
out from Jack me into great construct

252
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:01,450
based and feedback last time around so

253
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,980
what this does is what the Acme

254
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,680
specification allows you to do is it

255
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:08,560
allows and based in C a policy it allows

256
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,150
an ACME client to prove the main

257
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:13,300
ownership of a parent domain and then

258
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:14,680
allows declined to register and obtain

259
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:17,319
certs for all the subdomains when I

260
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:19,540
would have to do an explicit proof of

261
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,490
ownership for all two subdomains so acne

262
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:23,680
does allow this and what this draft does

263
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:30,730
is just specified up behavior next slide

264
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:32,829
okay this is just a it's a summary of

265
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,420
what the shape what the floor looks like

266
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:36,100
on the left hand side we see step one

267
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,900
and an acne client is doing

268
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,459
pre-authorization off a parent's domain

269
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,709
the example given here is domain.com

270
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:43,900
it's just using standard DNS text

271
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:45,069
authorization for the prove it on the

272
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,170
parent domain and on the right hand side

273
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,700
it declines is placing an order for a

274
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:51,000
subdomain of that parent domain and

275
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,420
what's not illustrated here but what is

276
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,830
possible and allowed is declined can

277
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,110
place new water request for multiple

278
00:16:56,830 --> 00:17:00,550
different clients hurts off that

279
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:02,110
subdomain without having to do an

280
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,730
explicit authorization for each one of

281
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:08,770
those subdomains okay next slide so the

282
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,900
direction so when I talked about this

283
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:12,939
last time around we said 2-0 changes

284
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,920
required to baseline Acme to support

285
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:17,020
this but when we get read the text of

286
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,000
Acme in detail we found there is one

287
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,500
substantive change this is one erasure

288
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,910
and there's one minor addition in some

289
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,730
domains compared with baseline Acme

290
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:27,310
that's like

291
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:30,220
so what to subdue substantive changes is

292
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:32,919
about new authorization handling and and

293
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:35,050
I'm quoting exactly what the base

294
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,820
dynamics spec says here for new

295
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:38,200
authorization handling the identifier

296
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:40,780
and the authorization object most

297
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:43,500
exactly match that the new authorization

298
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:45,970
request and product made for subdomains

299
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,700
changes is that the identifier and the

300
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:50,710
authorization object match is out of the

301
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,150
parents domain even if the subdomain is

302
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:53,590
specified the new authorization request

303
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,390
which makes perfect sense for this use

304
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:59,320
case but that's the only substantive

305
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:05,260
change to the text in our RC eight five

306
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:07,210
five five that's the only one next all

307
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:09,010
right yeah yeah any any clarifying

308
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:13,480
questions comments concerns about this

309
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:15,400
substantive change I assume that means

310
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:22,110
if we adopt this this would go is in

311
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:25,570
updates eight five five five right okay

312
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:28,300
so this one minor change it's in a

313
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:29,649
wrapper that have raised and it's fixing

314
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:32,770
of two hundred rock a response who are

315
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:34,930
appropriate currently RFC if I fight the

316
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:36,940
text mandates a to one response to all

317
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:39,220
new all set requests and clearly that

318
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,110
doesn't make sense if client issues and

319
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:42,700
when you are the same knew what set

320
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,949
request twice and it in what said

321
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,530
request art the object already exists

322
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:49,720
and so that's what acne some of the

323
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,399
mains does is if the authorization

324
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,070
already exists it recommends returning

325
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,900
at 200 okay and set it was 201 so there

326
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:57,610
is no ratah opened against eight five

327
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,900
five five to clean that up but it makes

328
00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:02,320
perfect sense it doesn't seem

329
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:04,990
particularly controversial Rob

330
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,870
straddling did that errata right was it

331
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:09,760
the guy from Commodore who did they

332
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:12,669
doesn't matter okay nevermind there's

333
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,610
one one minor addition which is an a new

334
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:17,470
directory metadata field for a server

335
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,449
can advertise whether it supports and

336
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:24,190
subdomains or not and based on feedback

337
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:26,170
on kind of member holders on the matters

338
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,020
where was private if there's no field

339
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:31,030
entry there is no assumed default value

340
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:35,850
so the server doesn't specify then the

341
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,850
client doesn't know and that's it and

342
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:39,989
so that's it so it's missing security

343
00:19:38,059 --> 00:19:41,609
considerations but Tim has said he will

344
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:42,600
write these Tim as a co-author he said

345
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:47,369
be right here we just haven't got around

346
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,899
to it yet and her is the working group

347
00:19:47,369 --> 00:19:55,738
interested in adopting this work okay so

348
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:57,209
you okay Phil all right so the standard

349
00:19:55,739 --> 00:20:03,749
two questions how many people have read

350
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:06,960
this document okay all right

351
00:20:03,749 --> 00:20:08,789
typical are you in favor are you not are

352
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,440
you opposed do you not know enough all

353
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:16,440
those in favor of adoption please come

354
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:20,820
now all those opposed to adoption please

355
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:29,429
come now and all those unsure please

356
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:31,200
come now sounded like weakly yes is a a

357
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:34,109
technical question such comment about

358
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,070
the document itself once once your once

359
00:20:34,109 --> 00:20:38,369
your just thought once your favor the

360
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:42,869
home okay I heard in favor

361
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:45,299
yep will confirm on the lists so in some

362
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:46,918
respects this is like a wild card not in

363
00:20:45,299 --> 00:20:49,259
every respect but in this best that like

364
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,549
the authorizing for the parent but then

365
00:20:49,259 --> 00:20:52,470
you're you're you're issuing for the

366
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:55,590
child and I was just hoping you could

367
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,419
contrast the security implications of

368
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:58,949
that with a wild card because the wild

369
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,109
card is an explicit indicator in the

370
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:05,039
document for in the transaction that

371
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:06,210
you're doing a walker certificate so I

372
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,769
don't know I'm you thought it through

373
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:09,600
but I sort of like as I was reading I

374
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:12,379
was like huh that's a good question I'm

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,549
not sure yet either yeah sure yeah I

376
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:15,869
mean a certain a blocker to acceptance

377
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:17,999
but it's a walker but you think about it

378
00:21:15,869 --> 00:21:21,449
as we move forward with this um yeah I

379
00:21:17,999 --> 00:21:22,739
guess I recall like I think I'm a little

380
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,940
denial of the Savior because I recall

381
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,049
when wild cars were first being done

382
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,269
with acne there was like talk of like

383
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:28,769
they're doing a random challenge for a

384
00:21:27,269 --> 00:21:30,690
second subdomain and it's like anyway

385
00:21:28,769 --> 00:21:37,070
like worth we're thinking about as we as

386
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:41,179
we go for yeah that was ekor Michael

387
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:45,570
Michael Richardson um it is your concern

388
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:47,820
that the challenges are confused between

389
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,730
the two things is that that the servers

390
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,639
won't be sure which one we're trying to

391
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:55,310
authorised is that we are concerned I'm

392
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,140
not I'm not sure my concern is if I even

393
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:59,720
have one but I guess what I remember it

394
00:21:57,140 --> 00:22:02,000
is it's like when did like obviously

395
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:05,300
there's there's like Kern Acme right has

396
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,040
um as I said has like a challenge check

397
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,360
for like the wrong card and one for the

398
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,860
non wild card there's indicator in the

399
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,659
messages somewhere and I'm trying about

400
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,740
why us there and so I can tell I

401
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,730
remember why that's there I'm not sure

402
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:16,730
whether it we need something like that

403
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,670
here um so like I say I don't think we'd

404
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,870
I think like like the the missing

405
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,340
security consideration is a great

406
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,689
opportunity to analyze this and fill it

407
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,580
in so I don't think it the or they're

408
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:28,070
here but I'd want to fly it yeah

409
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,470
and that actually makes me think that

410
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:32,240
that there may be some people that try

411
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:34,400
to use this when they meant to use a

412
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,110
wild card and the advice and the

413
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,520
opposite they'll try to use a wild card

414
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:41,149
when they should have used this and so I

415
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:42,590
think that just ability saying if you're

416
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:44,780
trying to do this this is not don't

417
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:52,820
you're in the wrong room go the other

418
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:55,370
way right yeah so Deb Cooley NSA so this

419
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:57,230
is for a specific subdomain not for all

420
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,489
of the subdomain so if it was a wild

421
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:00,640
card it would be for all of the

422
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,350
subdomains right

423
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,880
agreed but my understanding is so I

424
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:06,320
think there's the issuance pieces the

425
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
verification piece because I understand

426
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,510
it this like bootstraps a verification

427
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,890
for the parent domain into an arbitrary

428
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:14,690
number issuances for the child domains

429
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:16,130
and so in that respect it's like a what

430
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:18,710
and that respect it's like a wild card

431
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:20,090
in it you did one dedication that

432
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,310
correspondence somehow to the parent and

433
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:23,540
now your issue and now you're getting

434
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:24,860
certificates that for the children now

435
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,080
the fact you have to get multiple cific

436
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,820
it's like is is like a different it's

437
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:31,100
there for anaesthetic aliy but it still

438
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,350
has the property that the that the

439
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,879
caught that yeah that the client is

440
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,230
basically good the client is basically

441
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,540
getting authorized for everything on

442
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:41,510
everything the left of the other parent

443
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:43,129
and in one case that's like a silent the

444
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:45,440
in which case in one case taking

445
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,880
advantage of her authorization for each

446
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
subdomain requires a transaction in but

447
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,760
in other case it is not but in it's

448
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,760
still like the same authorization logic

449
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,779
[Music]

450
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:07,840
but we're different heights it does

451
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:09,909
really work how different how how

452
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:15,009
unusual is it to have a subdomain like

453
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:17,320
where you're not talking like it's very

454
00:24:15,009 --> 00:24:20,200
common I mean like you know um but I

455
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:22,720
guess I mean the in the usual assumption

456
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,909
the usual assumption in DNS right is the

457
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:29,019
parent controls child but it doesn't

458
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:32,740
necessarily mean but as I say on the in

459
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:33,850
in this context I mean in this like I

460
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,100
say this contest I'm just saying we had

461
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:38,709
a special indicator that said um I'm

462
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,750
getting authorization for everything the

463
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:42,009
left of this and we did that when we did

464
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,059
a wild card and I'm just saying this

465
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:45,370
that feels like a wild card ins are

466
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:46,658
respected so like I just wanna make sure

467
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:50,678
we don't need a special indicator when

468
00:24:46,659 --> 00:24:52,840
you authorize for this as well if it's

469
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:54,850
super common then you need something

470
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,928
that says that you're allowed to issue

471
00:24:54,850 --> 00:25:03,189
everything to left as part of that right

472
00:24:58,929 --> 00:25:06,519
and we don't have it do we so this is d

473
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,169
kg so the you can measure roughly how

474
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:09,549
common it is that something like this

475
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:11,950
might be problematic by looking at the

476
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:15,220
public suffix list so the public suffix

477
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:18,309
list is is definitely not short and it

478
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,200
includes lots of instances of but not

479
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:23,110
but is not exhaustive but instances of

480
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,279
organizations where that have sort of

481
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:30,189
child subdomains that that probably

482
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,539
shouldn't involve x.509 issuance just

483
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:32,320
because the parent is authorized or

484
00:25:31,539 --> 00:25:35,470
because one of the children is

485
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,090
authorized so so so yes is an issue the

486
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:38,200
authorization is very similar to doing a

487
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,209
wild card

488
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,970
and I wonder once again which since we

489
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,529
failed at D bound this may be there may

490
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,970
be some subtle differences between this

491
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:48,730
and actually issuing a wild card sir

492
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,769
itself and maybe there's another cut we

493
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:51,940
need on the PSL so be good to talk to

494
00:25:50,769 --> 00:25:58,509
folks for working on that hoping selfies

495
00:25:51,940 --> 00:26:00,220
list yeah all right well I will say it's

496
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:02,590
very heartening to see detailed

497
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:04,919
esthetical discussions of dns on friday

498
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:04,918
afternoon

499
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:12,020
yeah sure okay so we will we'll confirm

500
00:26:10,179 --> 00:26:14,910
on the list and

501
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:23,970
submit sometime after the holidays yep

502
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:25,710
all right next okay and so so this one

503
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:27,360
was presented last time around and

504
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,440
subdomains was part of this last time

505
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,270
around but we split her out into

506
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,650
separate draft so what this does is

507
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:33,270
describes how acne can be integrated

508
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:35,640
with multiple other structural

509
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,740
mechanisms primarily ESG based ones

510
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:43,320
which brewskis based on top of on teep

511
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:45,990
next slide so documents a few different

512
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,820
use cases acne integration est active

513
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:50,190
integration risky acne integration with

514
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:52,740
a variation of risky which is risky

515
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,020
default card registrar acne integration

516
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,480
with teep and Alec and I are working on

517
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,160
a new draft keep updated shows how acne

518
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,220
integrated with this as well and the

519
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,670
fact we think that acne doesn't really

520
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,620
fit well into into baseline teep and

521
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:09,960
acne needs the tip extensions that we've

522
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,429
defined and number five and that's

523
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,680
primarily around peak as he is 10

524
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,730
because he is seven handling and CSRF

525
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:19,500
crude hunting etc next slide

526
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,910
what's changed acne subdomains has been

527
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,980
split out into a separate dock and

528
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:24,480
whiskey cloud rights for our use case

529
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,520
has been added but it's pretty much the

530
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,450
same as brewski from an acne perspective

531
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,450
next slide

532
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,639
okay so est NTP used you can't eat those

533
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,260
specifications define how the client

534
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,480
interacts with the EC or the teep server

535
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,460
but they do not specify it's explicitly

536
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,250
out of scope how the est or teep server

537
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:46,410
interacts with the backend CA and what

538
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,120
this draft does is glue the two together

539
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:49,710
and show how acne can be used as that

540
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:54,479
integration between either the est or

541
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:56,160
the teep server and the acne CA next so

542
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,170
the slide here this summarizes what an

543
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,970
est integration could look like on the

544
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:02,190
left hand side we have pre-authorization

545
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:04,050
of a parent domain so I'm reverting the

546
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:07,200
subdomain draft here so on the left hand

547
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,419
side the est RA is doing

548
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,110
pre-authorization of a parent domain and

549
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:14,790
the on the right hand side when a client

550
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:17,340
that's called a pledge here when a

551
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:20,100
client or a pledge is doing a simple

552
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,570
enroll against the est or a the East er

553
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,340
a can turn around and do an acne

554
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:27,840
integration and get a search you'd for a

555
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:29,809
subdomain identifier after parent to me

556
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,649
and it's previously authorized and

557
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:34,320
what's missing here

558
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,179
but doesn't really integrate impact this

559
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,309
integration per se but it's documented

560
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,450
in the draft and not here is declined

561
00:28:38,309 --> 00:28:41,070
should really be doing a serious or

562
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:43,200
attributes request response first and

563
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,080
it's document in the draft just not

564
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,490
shown in the slide I don't think I've

565
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,610
shown on this slide next slide

566
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:52,799
yeah I haven't shown explicitly the the

567
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,330
tip College Law but the tip call floor

568
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:59,190
looks very similar to this and it's in

569
00:28:54,330 --> 00:29:00,600
the it's in the draft next slide and so

570
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,340
especially from this again is some

571
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,418
security considerations are missing and

572
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:09,299
but this doesn't require any changes

573
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,980
whatsoever to es T or T pop date and it

574
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,720
doesn't require any changes to Acme it's

575
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,790
just informational and stitches showing

576
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,530
how you stitch you two together and the

577
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,149
integrations do span across tree working

578
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:19,980
groups

579
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:23,669
anima acme and emu so we're wondering

580
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,440
Curtis leaves is there interest in so

581
00:29:23,669 --> 00:29:27,540
the questions for the room is history

582
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,130
interest in continuing this work what do

583
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:32,570
we do next and if anyone is interested

584
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:35,340
in adopting it where should we adopt it

585
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,260
so we have the precedent with the TN

586
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,049
auth T an auth list that was you know

587
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,740
heavily developed over by stir and put

588
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:45,360
here because it was sort of a challenge

589
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:48,299
had have the other working groups

590
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,540
expressed any opinion the said see what

591
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:53,309
Acme says but the both in you and anima

592
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,049
are interested so they want to see they

593
00:29:53,309 --> 00:29:58,168
were progressing but don't know where it

594
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:59,309
lives so they they deferred if we don't

595
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:01,140
want it they may take it up because I

596
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:02,850
want to progress it is that emu said

597
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:05,720
they may take it up with those

598
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:05,719
dissenters okay

599
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:10,290
co-author on this and involved in all

600
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,840
those working groups I think that that

601
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:17,280
that we felt that the things that we're

602
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:21,149
doing were more technically Acme things

603
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:22,950
and we really need we really will come

604
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:26,070
to your group easier than you'll come to

605
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:29,580
our group to give us input so we would

606
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:33,450
rather do it here then in our group that

607
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:37,250
was our feeling at the time okay I have

608
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:37,250
a clarifying question

609
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:49,049
well the the draft the draft in number

610
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,870
five there is that that's required in

611
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:54,030
order to make this work with oh maybe I

612
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:58,590
think it will make that it'll make the

613
00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:00,240
client to each subsequent I don't have a

614
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,520
cleaner integration with you so I don't

615
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,380
think it's strictly required but what's

616
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,350
missing from t p-- what's missing Retief

617
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:08,909
is if the acne server turns around and

618
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,459
says i'm going to issue a circle just

619
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:14,190
not yet your statuses the status is

620
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,200
pending or yeah and there's no way

621
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,390
currently in t p-- for the t p-- servers

622
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:21,570
a signal back to supplements we try

623
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:23,340
later and that is in EST it's not in t

624
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:25,740
p-- that's added in the teapot there's

625
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,620
so the other users don't need a change

626
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,140
to accommodate the pending right but but

627
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,820
t p-- just does it would time out and

628
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:34,260
died or something you know we're doing

629
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,809
with the validation t p-- can like

630
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,640
there's no explicit way for baseline

631
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:40,620
teeth to signal to the client that i

632
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,380
should we try and is this

633
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,719
this is retrying t p-- as i get over a

634
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:48,690
reasonable acceptance and t p-- is that

635
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,830
like later or is this it hasn't gone to

636
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:54,600
the working group yet it well so draft

637
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,740
five has not been adopted yet but

638
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,209
there's not there's been nothing

639
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:59,549
controversial said about the

640
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,470
enhancements to draft five for improving

641
00:31:59,549 --> 00:32:02,908
peak is he is ten seven handling adding

642
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,630
to retry mechanism adding to see it's

643
00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:05,940
all right okay

644
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,380
so there's no black you're doing it

645
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:10,559
that's that was the main question okay

646
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:12,210
thank you so high vroom engine lui i may

647
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,918
not have it remember you're right so

648
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,179
just gonna kind of correct me but to emu

649
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,820
I didn't hear the conversation back and

650
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:19,650
forth so he knew there was interest and

651
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:21,360
and kind of work but we punted the

652
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,039
discussion about what to do which

653
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,149
working we want to do it actually to

654
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:31,980
here okay all right is that a thumbs up

655
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:38,280
gotcha thanks Joe okay how many people

656
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:39,750
have read the document couple maybe we

657
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,240
need to get a little more discussion

658
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:45,760
before yeah definitely I think we need

659
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,930
more

660
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,280
especially since there's so many you're

661
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:50,530
working verbs kind of been yeah or what

662
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:53,139
the coordination so alright so let's

663
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:54,490
continue the discussion maybe we'll have

664
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:02,380
a target for you know getting the

665
00:32:54,490 --> 00:33:04,390
adoption by or at Vancouver you're

666
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:08,800
unsure further seems to be a little bit

667
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:11,050
of overlap potentially with start

668
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:15,990
allegation on the CSR

669
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:22,000
on the CSR side maybe we should talk

670
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:25,060
okay so let's have some discussion of

671
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,650
the content in the in perhaps other you

672
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,440
know cross working group integration on

673
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:35,170
the mailing list and we will reconsider

674
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:40,720
this by the next idea and yeah I believe

675
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:41,980
that's the last one yeah so okay this

676
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,360
the last presentation this is something

677
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:44,680
else that came up an annuity currently

678
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,850
been discussed in the email are not

679
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:49,990
directly related to any of these two

680
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:52,080
presentations and but there's a

681
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:56,020
conversation ongoing DME mailer about

682
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,939
documenting clear best practice

683
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:59,590
recommendations to supplicants for how

684
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:04,720
they should check the identity search

685
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:07,480
that an each server presents to it there

686
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:13,840
are various drafts to find in eath that

687
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:16,750
specify for example key usage bits he

688
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:19,840
key usage bits for each servers to

689
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:22,600
specify does a draft that specifies and

690
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:24,100
an other name of an nai realm that a

691
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,190
server can present in his identity

692
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:29,830
search and accordingly drafts to specify

693
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:32,379
that a server presents an S or V ID as a

694
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,850
name and as identity search and

695
00:34:32,379 --> 00:34:36,250
obviously public CAS will not issue any

696
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:38,049
of those three and so we're just looking

697
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,230
in EMU for best practice recommendations

698
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:42,730
for what a supplement should check and

699
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,530
depending on whether it's presented with

700
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:47,770
a private CA certificate or a root

701
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:49,929
Republic CA certificate and and we'd

702
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:52,960
really like somebody from a public CA to

703
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,610
help write those recommendations we

704
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,530
think we know what they should be or we

705
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:58,720
need somebody from actually run the

706
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:59,580
public's here to help with that so we're

707
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,040
looking in for health

708
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,210
in you with them drafting those best

709
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,190
practice recommendations what a

710
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:07,290
subsequent should do when it is

711
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:08,430
presented with an each server identity

712
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:10,800
search and how would you check the

713
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:16,980
fields in the server identity search so

714
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:21,770
we're looking for a help and did you

715
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,770
also discuss it with lamps not yet ok

716
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:29,070
Jenna

717
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,360
so yeah lamps will also be a good place

718
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,890
bring it up on their mailing list or

719
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,450
speak to us there to figure out how to

720
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:36,930
do it because that's where a lot of the

721
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:38,580
CAS hang out ok and I said can you

722
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,899
remind me if you had an EKU in mind

723
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,130
excuse me

724
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:45,210
you did write not server off that would

725
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,650
be fantastic by the way

726
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:52,590
um ok so you have an EKU in mind

727
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:59,010
and the problem is commercial ca's won't

728
00:35:52,590 --> 00:36:00,660
issue won't issue it yeah that yeah so

729
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,370
there's some kind of recommendation to

730
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,779
the lawn garden if you have a private e8

731
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:06,000
then it might make sense objectives

732
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:07,740
field selling see a public CA been

733
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,540
presented ended that's an EKU though

734
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:13,500
right so public see you can't verify the

735
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:17,460
SSID the SSID is not an EKU it's um Sam

736
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:18,990
right yeah um I thought you were also

737
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,140
talking a little bit

738
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:25,649
I was hoping anyway that you would talk

739
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:29,040
about using a different EKU other than

740
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:31,170
server awesome well well if if you're if

741
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,360
the supplicant knows it's presented or a

742
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:35,280
private CA then it makes sense to check

743
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,260
in EKU but if it knows it's presented

744
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,280
with a identity cert that signed by one

745
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:40,380
of the public see is there is absolutely

746
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:42,210
no point in checking with this field it

747
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:45,120
can only really check for a DNS name and

748
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:48,500
it's it's hammering out exactly what the

749
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,500
best practice recommendations should be

750
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:53,009
that my clear Deb I was hoping you were

751
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:56,009
coming to tell us that there was some

752
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:58,430
magic ek use that public CAS are happy

753
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,780
to accept and we should use one of those

754
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:03,779
that that's not that doesn't sound to be

755
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,650
the case but so I do want to point out

756
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,270
that I'm not associated with a public CA

757
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:11,520
but maybe you just knew everything about

758
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,440
all of them you know I don't know so I

759
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,759
was hoping you had

760
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,530
hidden secret knowledge that you're

761
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:25,319
gonna share with yeah we won't go in we

762
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:30,240
won't go into that yeah right now I'm

763
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,740
only associated with privates he is this

764
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,299
is Daniel con Gilmore I'm just gonna

765
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,790
repeat what I think I just heard but I

766
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,430
think I just heard is we don't believe

767
00:37:35,790 --> 00:37:40,650
as the community of technical people who

768
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:43,529
work with these authorization systems

769
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:46,319
that it is possible to use the web PKI

770
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:48,480
with anything that the EKU field is

771
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:50,609
meaningful because we cannot possibly

772
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,069
hope to change any of it is that what

773
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:55,828
I'm here no no no what we're saying is

774
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:59,579
that like there's a specific EKU for

775
00:37:55,829 --> 00:38:02,369
that defines this key is for eeep over

776
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:03,839
LAN so there's two issues right one is

777
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:06,210
the EKU and the other one is the

778
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,500
identity and so the identity they want

779
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:12,810
to put in this is a private non

780
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:15,060
verifiable identity the SSID right so

781
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:17,369
that's the big problem from a commercial

782
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,750
CA point of view because they issue a

783
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,060
cert was something in there that they

784
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:22,619
can't validate they get in trouble and

785
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:23,700
somebody beats up on them and you

786
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:29,550
probably know who that will be

787
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:31,980
so I've heard it it's fun well me not

788
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:33,660
really so so that's the first problem

789
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,390
the identity problem I believe is the

790
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,578
big problem the little problem is in EKU

791
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:43,500
and I'd like to see the EKU change

792
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:45,720
because I've had is it so but they're

793
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:49,770
not yeah yeah be nice if they used it

794
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,930
right so and that's a small problem so

795
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,250
that's just it that's just you know

796
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:56,940
working through the process of getting

797
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:59,069
it like you able to get one of those

798
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,050
right it's it's already it's already

799
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,520
defined it's already there it's just a

800
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:06,180
matter of changing the process so that

801
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,250
you can actually get one the bigger

802
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,500
problem is the identity piece but see

803
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,750
even if you change the process that you

804
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,430
can get one and it takes X number of

805
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:16,200
years for a public CA to actually issue

806
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:18,270
who had a certificate when EKU saying

807
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:21,060
it's used for Ipoh over LAN then what we

808
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:23,490
had a supplement to do now so the

809
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:25,259
advantage of the different EKU is it

810
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:26,819
allows you to identify that the

811
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,080
verification process is differ

812
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:30,990
from your verification process that's

813
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:35,549
used for sure the the server off yeah

814
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,979
and so that way a if a public CA wants

815
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:40,320
to issue something like that as long as

816
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,340
they don't also issue it with the server

817
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:46,230
auth EKU then they're not violating what

818
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,360
they claim they would be doing right

819
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,070
which is rechecked for server off in the

820
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,510
following way you've got a separate

821
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:53,520
thing yes you do need to define how you

822
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,780
verify that identity there mm-hmm but

823
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,130
you're no longer are worried that

824
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:58,170
someone's going to use one of these

825
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,000
certificates in this other context where

826
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,550
they shouldn't be allowed to use it so

827
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,150
if we think that that that CA is king

828
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:07,440
can't issue an alternate EKU then we

829
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:09,770
have really done something terribly

830
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,880
wrong because we've boxed them out of

831
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:13,980
operating the space and asking them to

832
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,680
use it as certain asking them to use

833
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:18,810
server auth is a mistake because it puts

834
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:20,640
them back in the soup of having to

835
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:22,410
juggle these these different demands

836
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,460
they get from the tab form so it's not

837
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:25,470
that it's not a decant

838
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,850
it's that they currently don't so

839
00:40:25,470 --> 00:40:28,049
because they currently don't what we

840
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,940
Michael it's a chicken and egg problem

841
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:33,600
we're not a big enough market for them

842
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:36,270
to care so we have to find a way to flow

843
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:38,790
through their existing market mechanism

844
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:42,210
which sucks but the alternative is that

845
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:43,470
either we have clients that get our man

846
00:40:42,210 --> 00:40:46,590
in the middle because they they're

847
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:50,100
easily they'll bind to any public name

848
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:51,420
right or we have private CAS that we

849
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:53,700
have to monitor leakin figure into

850
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,860
clients which defeats the whole zero you

851
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:58,560
know touch point right so we have this

852
00:40:55,860 --> 00:41:00,750
this thing like you know yes we want to

853
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,000
use the technology as you say right but

854
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,910
we're not yet we we don't have enough

855
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,890
enough leverage to actually make it

856
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:10,500
happen so what are we gonna do we're

857
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:12,750
basically wind up you know pin zero zero

858
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,630
zero again right that's what happens if

859
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,290
we can't go forward you know I mean pin

860
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,700
zero zero zero

861
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:22,380
yeah okay so the space is ugly right

862
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:26,220
it's not just kept for him it's kept for

863
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:28,110
him plus I saw the trust orb right so

864
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:30,060
it's like like it's kept form plus it's

865
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:32,640
Microsoft out you know it's all it's all

866
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,960
of that right you can't so the fact that

867
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,879
we even having this conversation means

868
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,380
that we need we need to document some

869
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:40,270
guidelines for a supplicant implements

870
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:45,640
right right so code

871
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:48,070
yeah exactly so yeah this is just

872
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,740
Holloway I think that this is kind of a

873
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:56,280
mess and I don't know that there's an

874
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:58,959
easy way out but there is one thing that

875
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:01,000
many you're like four or five years ago

876
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,180
the Wi-Fi Alliance was working on some

877
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:07,150
hotspot 2.0 thing where they did I

878
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:13,109
believe there is a CA that issues

879
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:14,740
certificates for hotspots which might be

880
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,320
what you want

881
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,919
I don't know but might be something to

882
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,640
look into

883
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:32,550
okay so I guess we'll bring it to lamps

884
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:37,270
and bring through mirrors this is really

885
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:39,880
from Java you from Europe is there a

886
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,370
chance for public CS doing anything

887
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:48,910
without C before I'm telling them it's

888
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:57,940
okay I'll volunteer somebody from a

889
00:42:48,910 --> 00:43:01,120
public CA to answer that question okay

890
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:07,300
any other discussion all right thank you

891
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:08,890
on any other business all right if you

892
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,390
have the blue sheets bring them up if

893
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,400
you haven't signed come up to it the

894
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:14,230
blue sheets are thank you all as I said

895
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,570
it was encouraging to see some nice

896
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,650
technical discussion and we'll see you

897
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:23,099
on the lists in in Vancouver thank you

898
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:23,099
[Music]

899
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,470
yeah

900
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,829
if you have the blue sheets raise your

901
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:36,099
hand and bring them up or let Max come

902
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:36,099
to you

903
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:42,020
it's a clipboard it's got blue paper on

904
00:43:40,849 --> 00:43:50,900
it you should all know what they look

905
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:56,710
like but this time look don't make me

906
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:56,710
bring up the note well again okay

907
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:12,480
you
