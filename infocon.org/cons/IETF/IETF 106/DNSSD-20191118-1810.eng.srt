00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:15,440
to the folks in the back of the room

3
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:55,430
we're about to get started please take

4
00:03:15,440 --> 00:04:01,150
your seats all right so welcome back to

5
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:03,920
DNS service discovery just very quickly

6
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,380
for those of you who weren't at the

7
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,280
previous session or any other session

8
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:13,220
this is covered by the note well if you

9
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,859
haven't done so please read it if you

10
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,228
have several years ago read it again

11
00:04:15,859 --> 00:04:20,230
it's not that interesting but it's

12
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,460
really important

13
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:26,120
the two main points that I always

14
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,580
highlight are your IPR requirements so

15
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,740
if you know about patents relates to

16
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:33,229
this stuff there are rules that you need

17
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:35,600
to follow and also we will be enforcing

18
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:38,409
the ITF code of conduct which generally

19
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:51,950
covers being nice to one another so

20
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:55,090
without further ado Christian otherwise

21
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:55,090
the anvil is gonna miss you

22
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:11,900
there's a human that controls it I think

23
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:14,690
okay do that thing okay so we have a lot

24
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:18,590
of time to discuss DNS SD privacy

25
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:20,740
requirement in fact we have spent a lot

26
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:26,419
of time on that already

27
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:29,660
the I started this work and dannielle a

28
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:35,620
case I came to work with me a couple of

29
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:35,620
months after that in March of 2016 and

30
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:44,090
it went through various iterations in

31
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:46,849
the group and eventually we decided cut

32
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:48,739
off years later to not not really push

33
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:52,520
for solution because we could not get

34
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,729
consensus on the solution but we excised

35
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:58,490
from the proposal of a solution the

36
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:02,630
analysis part which was basically the

37
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:07,039
privacy requirement and the general

38
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:09,469
consensus at the time that was in 2018

39
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,810
was that this requirement were useful

40
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,180
because it was interesting to be stuck

41
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,930
in the ground to a record before saying

42
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,849
hey when you do discovery and especially

43
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,010
if you are using a multicast protocol

44
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:25,820
whatever it is and you have to be

45
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:29,210
concerned about requirements and if I

46
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:32,360
understand correctly the working group

47
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:36,229
last call on this draft is

48
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,419
almost finished our yes so we started

49
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:44,508
the working Alaska a few weeks ago and

50
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:46,520
it extends to the end of this week so

51
00:06:44,509 --> 00:06:48,830
you still have a couple of days to

52
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:52,150
explain why it's great and we should we

53
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:58,750
publish it or not

54
00:06:52,150 --> 00:07:02,688
so what study that effort is that when

55
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:05,300
mdns genesis the in general but mdns in

56
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:09,319
particular is the one so noisy and leaky

57
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:12,409
protocol it was done to be in quakes

58
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:16,400
your configuration etc but the use of

59
00:07:12,409 --> 00:07:20,360
broadcast and the use of identifiers in

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,359
the broadcast allows people to track who

61
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:25,069
is doing what and when and that

62
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,259
generally a bad idea so you can have

63
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:29,479
some kind of a bad act or there it's

64
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,590
there and the bad actor will be

65
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:35,779
listening and and you could extract the

66
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:38,419
fact that someone is contacting someone

67
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:41,440
or that what address what they are doing

68
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:44,599
what an application set up which is

69
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:49,879
further off for all kinds of mega data

70
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:54,830
acquisition and tracking so what we want

71
00:07:49,879 --> 00:08:07,339
to do is private discovery in which

72
00:07:54,830 --> 00:08:10,008
those bad actors that are listening in

73
00:08:07,339 --> 00:08:12,919
which the bad actors cannot gather

74
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:17,659
information by merely watching the

75
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:19,339
exchanges and we we went for values kind

76
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:21,500
of solutions there are value solutions

77
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:24,110
to that thing it's one of those problems

78
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:27,969
in which you you could slice it in

79
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:27,969
different ways I am not particularly

80
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:35,299
attached to one solution of the idea

81
00:08:33,078 --> 00:08:39,169
that this one should be recognized and

82
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:41,809
we should try to solve it we as I said

83
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:44,910
we excise the requirements from the

84
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:47,579
draft that we add before

85
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:51,350
and we've already presented that who was

86
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,010
in the London ITF a year and a half ago

87
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:54,510
yeah okay

88
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,319
so you you must have seen those slides

89
00:08:54,510 --> 00:09:00,390
already okay so we we went through the

90
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,180
anything the three big scenarios of

91
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:05,880
discovery the first scenario is when you

92
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,709
want to find the printer or when you

93
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:12,689
want to find a fixed device whatever it

94
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:14,280
is and in that scenario basically you

95
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,050
don't care that people discover that

96
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,670
there is a printer on the network

97
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:20,969
because of course there is a printer at

98
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,870
the network but what you do care is that

99
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:26,460
it'd be better if you did not identify

100
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,160
who is using the printer at what time

101
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:34,620
and that's that's really the requirement

102
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:36,180
there to give an example of how mdns for

103
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,180
example doesn't completely meet that

104
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:45,260
requirement mdns in order to participate

105
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:48,510
the guy was doing the discovery as to

106
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:51,689
initiate and DNS and to do that they

107
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:53,580
have to broadcast their host name on the

108
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,920
local network and that broadcasting of

109
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:58,260
the host name is worth tracking you so

110
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,120
that it's easily fixed it's not hard to

111
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,120
do but it's not done yet

112
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:10,620
the real requirement for discovery is

113
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,449
for peer-to-peer scenarios and I say for

114
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,820
example the head the airport scenario

115
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,830
you're in an airport lounge and you are

116
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,380
preparing a presentation with a

117
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:24,810
colleague and you are discovering each

118
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:27,600
other it'd be better if the people who

119
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:30,060
are also in the air for F of launch did

120
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,390
not immediately identify was doing what

121
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,969
I mean because that might reveal that

122
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,400
you have is cover operation going on and

123
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:42,690
finally okay thanks as you know about ID

124
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:44,459
so here whoever in this scenario SD we

125
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:46,620
got a piece of feedback that the the man

126
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:49,110
in the heart was not identified properly

127
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,480
in the in the picture as the bad actor

128
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,640
so not in the heart is hiding in the

129
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:57,120
background is listening what's happening

130
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,410
and because all these message are sent

131
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,300
in clear text

132
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:04,920
you can see them on the network and it's

133
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,170
obvious how you see them in with a

134
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,770
multicast but even if they are sand as

135
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:13,219
GNSS deal with the DNS SD server as long

136
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:17,910
as you can get the flow of messages

137
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:20,820
you're going to identify that David here

138
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,709
is looking for stores laptop name and

139
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:26,340
and finding it on the network and and

140
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:30,080
you can discover that so that that's the

141
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:32,880
kind of stuff we want to not happen and

142
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:36,990
there is the third scenario is a variant

143
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:40,020
of that with wearable devices if you

144
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:44,310
have wearable devices and you use this

145
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:46,439
kind of discovery scenarios to send

146
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,349
broadcast messages to find them and to

147
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,000
initiate communications not only do we

148
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,010
discover that there is this

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,770
communication but you can track the

150
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,830
person doing that like if in order to

151
00:11:55,770 --> 00:12:02,340
for your watch to discover your your

152
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:05,400
iPhone the iPhone ask to broadcast its

153
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:09,810
presence on the waves then that becomes

154
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:12,060
a beacon that anybody can touch and so

155
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,959
these are basically the scenarios and

156
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,609
the purpose of the draft is just to

157
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,080
delineate those scenarios delineate that

158
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:24,300
we have a problem and effectively get

159
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:27,330
that on the record to commit ourselves

160
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:30,180
to fixing it later or by whichever ways

161
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,050
adequate and that's pretty much where we

162
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:36,390
are and and basically my might say hey

163
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,729
hey we have been trying to bang that

164
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:44,670
message for some time now are we done

165
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:46,130
yet I mean can we publish it and so can

166
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:50,160
we

167
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:55,430
so could we have a show of hands for who

168
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,430
folks who have read this draft

169
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:09,680
yes could we ask you to just say a quick

170
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:14,250
word if use of your opinion on is this

171
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:18,140
good to go or if you have concerns Chris

172
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:21,420
well appo I think it's good go thank you

173
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:23,490
Jim what work yeah so if I had any

174
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:27,560
substantial feedback then I would have

175
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:44,760
posted it on the mailing list so yeah

176
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:47,459
thanks yeah okay so I think we're gonna

177
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,360
let the working group last call go until

178
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:55,200
the end of the week and or I forget the

179
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,600
exact date that it's running too but so

180
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:00,830
sometime I think either end of this week

181
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,480
or next week and see if we have any

182
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,010
anyone speaking up before then but

183
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,640
otherwise I think we're good to go and

184
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:15,689
ready to submit this is G ok thank you

185
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:19,970
very much thank you Christian and so

186
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:24,390
that is a current state of the art from

187
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:26,820
privacy we might have more in the

188
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:29,430
pipeline once this is published but I

189
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:32,070
think that's it for now does anyone have

190
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:37,979
any other topics do you want to discuss

191
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:40,950
so those who might be able to adjourn no

192
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:48,589
um I think he's saying that he's read

193
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:48,589
the draft thanks Ted

194
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:58,290
all right then we might have Daniel so

195
00:14:54,230 --> 00:15:01,440
Daniel MeeGo Erickson I just have a

196
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:04,230
comment regarding the first scenario so

197
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,900
one thing is concerned how we make the

198
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:10,440
discovery but I'm looking at who's

199
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,089
become being connected to the printer is

200
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,329
another thing

201
00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:17,610
would say there is a DNS part as well

202
00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:19,739
even though you're using TLS maybe you

203
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:24,120
can sister this IP is connected to that

204
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:27,360
one sir well you will know that someone

205
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,850
is doing a TLS connection to the printer

206
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,649
and hopefully it's a TRS connection and

207
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,470
it doesn't give the text of the document

208
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:36,569
in the clear of it okay you will know it

209
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:40,050
is a printer because that's not a secret

210
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:41,729
when you are in this hotel lobby and

211
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:44,099
they have a print of all which you use

212
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,839
it's there you know it's there that's

213
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,749
you're not trying to hide the fact that

214
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,839
there is a printer what you want to not

215
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:55,259
disclose is who exactly is using the

216
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,959
printer so suppose that you are using

217
00:15:55,259 --> 00:16:00,209
say MAC address randomization so you

218
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:03,540
cannot be identify your MAC address or

219
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:07,160
by your IP address you want to not have

220
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:09,870
the discard protocol is speed art

221
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:14,939
identifiable information racket like a

222
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:24,660
host name or something okay

223
00:16:14,939 --> 00:16:28,019
thank you all right I think we're then

224
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:30,029
ready to adjourn we heard may have beat

225
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:32,160
a record in terms of shortest ITF

226
00:16:30,029 --> 00:16:36,149
session ever congratulations everyone

227
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:40,469
and we will hopefully be seeing a lot of

228
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:42,929
you in Vancouver but most importantly on

229
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:45,809
the list before then for those of you

230
00:16:42,929 --> 00:16:47,309
that haven't read this draft please find

231
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:50,579
it in your heart to do so maybe on your

232
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:53,819
plane ride home and even if your email

233
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:56,099
just says yes this is fine this helps

234
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:58,050
reassure us and the ADEs that this

235
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,660
document is ready to move forward so

236
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,979
even if you don't have any feedback if

237
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,129
all your feedback is it's fine please

238
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:07,880
just say so like a short one-liner all

239
