1
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,870
[Music]

2
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:26,200
I think we're getting ready to start

3
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:38,690
yeah we're getting ready to start and I

4
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,500
want you to know I'm noting the people

5
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:43,970
that aren't here that should be this is

6
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,890
because me and AC had sort of the

7
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,459
gentleman's back going on how many would

8
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:55,429
come I said we'd be lucky for 20 a C

9
00:03:49,459 --> 00:04:00,890
thought 40 you're getting closer you're

10
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:16,280
in you're in the right place you can

11
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:16,979
bring your friends and family to well

12
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,179
Jeff's here

13
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:27,480
guess we can at least go through the

14
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:31,230
know well ok ok so this is the second

15
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,840
session the else our working group we

16
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:37,140
have a shorter agenda this time let's do

17
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:42,049
the agenda bashing first we are just no

18
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:53,159
welcome first I yeah no well first so

19
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:58,550
this is the note well supposed to read

20
00:04:53,160 --> 00:05:04,350
it all basically means by participating

21
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:19,760
in this meeting you're making an IETF

22
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:19,760
contribution okay so we have a short

23
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,910
yeah yeah yeah it was shorter I was

24
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,620
gonna get people a chance to complain

25
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:30,900
about the agenda but we have yang some

26
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:37,230
yang updates followed by a couple more

27
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:38,789
presentations and first up is Tony does

28
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:45,200
anybody want to bash the agenda it

29
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,200
changes no okay

30
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:19,629
all right thank you so this is talk

31
00:06:17,619 --> 00:06:20,529
about our yang model for dynamic

32
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,539
flooding

33
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:25,839
apparently yang models are now required

34
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,539
for everything so we attempted to jump

35
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:32,199
in and do one please note that both of

36
00:06:28,539 --> 00:06:34,959
us are yang novices so we have no idea

37
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:39,849
what we're doing please be gentle we're

38
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:42,430
happy to fix whatever let's see there's

39
00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:45,969
a link to the current draft we are

40
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:49,990
spinning it as fast as we can go which

41
00:06:45,969 --> 00:06:53,949
is not very fast we're trying to cover

42
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:56,319
both OSPF and is is with this we are

43
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:58,839
modeling all of the new TVs that we've

44
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,089
added all the config and all the user

45
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:06,069
interface that we're dealing with so

46
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:09,129
some of us have to deal with open config

47
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:12,209
and when we bounced things around

48
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:15,879
internally we got criticized for using

49
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:18,669
IETF oriented models and we're asked to

50
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:21,579
provide open config models instead and

51
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:25,240
so you'll see in the comments that we

52
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:29,369
try to support both IETF and open config

53
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,369
at the same time which is a trick

54
00:07:30,899 --> 00:07:35,469
so I'm not going to go through all of

55
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:38,889
this because it gets really boring very

56
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:44,289
quickly but basically we tried to cover

57
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:47,169
everything this covers the dynamic

58
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:53,099
flooding capability subtil v2 router

59
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:56,049
capabilities relatively straightforward

60
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:59,259
the config stuff all of the various

61
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:03,639
knobs for the configure here enabling

62
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:07,319
the dynamic flooding is this object and

63
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:10,419
status information so you can suck out

64
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:13,870
everything that's going on this gives

65
00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:14,799
you the list of paths that the system

66
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:22,120
has learned

67
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:25,180
from the area leader so this is a list

68
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,770
of topology so you can just see exactly

69
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:31,150
what's going on the dynamic flooding and

70
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:43,838
I think that's it

71
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:45,579
so any questions cool thank you ACA no I

72
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,930
just want to make a point that this is

73
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:49,959
uh interesting

74
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:52,149
I didn't review it very much but this is

75
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,489
the first time we have both is is and

76
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:57,010
OSPF yang model in the same draft which

77
00:08:54,490 --> 00:09:00,910
so it's new new grounds but I mean I'm

78
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:04,470
good because we have a funding the

79
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,469
funding draft has both of them

80
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:40,160
hello everyone they see eunjin I'm just

81
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,370
gonna give a quick update about some

82
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:46,660
young models so I'm gonna cover nine

83
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,660
trucks in two minutes

84
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:56,540
first of all OSPF and ice has base

85
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,840
modules after five years the good news

86
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:04,370
is both of them are family united her

87
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:08,210
cues unfortunately we have some

88
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:10,490
dependencies on the PFD module so we'll

89
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:14,420
have to wait until a little bit to

90
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,630
publish them but the model is both of

91
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:21,050
them are pretty much that and here are a

92
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,840
list of active contributors and so

93
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:27,290
during the last call process we actually

94
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:33,230
go through several revisions and fix

95
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:36,170
other issues one major change we did see

96
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,010
you know in OSPF and as we have lost

97
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:43,699
Flags field and we used to use this

98
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:46,870
field to say oh one flag another flag

99
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:50,840
but we figure out those things are not

100
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:54,440
augment able so we change loss from type

101
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:57,050
beats to an identity this is one major

102
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:59,480
change during the last CalPERS s if you

103
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,979
are interested please take a look at the

104
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:07,460
models here list somehow is done as an

105
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,940
example so it's really just use change

106
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:14,950
the type so it's easier for augmentation

107
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:20,570
later so the modules can be augmented

108
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:24,950
and then the next two is post OSPF and

109
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:29,570
ISS module four segment routing with all

110
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:32,240
the drafts related with OSPF and ISS

111
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:34,970
protocols are being published these two

112
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,670
I in the pipeline to be published so the

113
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,250
plan is we will publish the base SR

114
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:44,050
model in spring first and then this two

115
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:46,790
will follow and so this give you an last

116
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:54,290
opportunity to reveal them and

117
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:57,500
if you have any please so the changes

118
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:00,319
we've done so far know the both of these

119
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,820
models have been stable for some time so

120
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,980
the change we've done so far is

121
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:07,250
basically just change everything to

122
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,300
match what we've done in the peso SPF

123
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:16,820
and the ISS model and we expect to

124
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:21,380
publish this to very soon and we have

125
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:23,090
two new working group document exam did

126
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:25,310
you you want to talk a little bit about

127
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:32,390
that meeting we had with this rv6 young

128
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:36,290
model offers on the last night so that's

129
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:40,370
about the OSPF and ice ice ice our model

130
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:43,430
because this to augmenting the segment

131
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:45,920
routing pace model and this week the

132
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:47,959
author so far the segment routing the

133
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,640
segment routing and pure ice module had

134
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:56,260
a meeting with the SRA six model authors

135
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:59,990
and we make sure we align our

136
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:03,380
configurations and our also some comment

137
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,480
effort definitions so then we can

138
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:08,570
provides the base module we make sure

139
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,370
everything is aligned and then we next

140
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:14,210
step will be progress the protocol

141
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:17,030
specific module we will start request

142
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:19,970
will make one more changes make the

143
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:24,640
alignment and will request the base call

144
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,640
this module last call in spring

145
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:36,138
so the new working group document the

146
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:38,899
OSPF these three extended RSA this one

147
00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:42,050
is actually very important because all

148
00:13:38,899 --> 00:13:45,230
the new OSPF with these three features

149
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,628
will have a dependency on this module if

150
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,410
they are using the new extended error I

151
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:54,079
say format and the plan is to progress

152
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:57,399
this one after once we're done with the

153
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:02,989
base OSPF module and then we have the

154
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:07,970
OSPF young augmentation version one so

155
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:11,600
this one is right now we have I think

156
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:16,220
four modules included we this time we

157
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,769
added that the new OSPF is Ricky module

158
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,930
and we also have other modules included

159
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:25,819
this one so far I think the plan is to

160
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:28,219
keep these four modules in this one

161
00:14:25,819 --> 00:14:32,300
document if there are more features that

162
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:35,269
need to be augmented to OSPF later go to

163
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:39,609
another augmentation document public

164
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:48,829
illusion to just to keep all the modules

165
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:52,279
up-to-date this is a new document is

166
00:14:48,829 --> 00:14:57,008
OSPF very segmented hyung is for the

167
00:14:52,279 --> 00:15:01,519
OSPF III but for segmenting MPI's

168
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:04,819
feature and this one well augment the

169
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:10,370
base OSPF segment routing data module

170
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:12,399
and all included all those theories so

171
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:15,529
people who are interested in

172
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,350
implementing this feature please take a

173
00:15:15,529 --> 00:15:21,649
look we didn't have this in the base

174
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,339
segment all team model because this one

175
00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:27,170
needs the OSPF v3 extended RSA so we'll

176
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:29,740
need to progress that one first and then

177
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,740
this one

178
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:40,589
okay so with that the OSPF augmentation

179
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:43,589
modules were introduced that we started

180
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:46,049
last ITF and this idea is already

181
00:15:43,589 --> 00:15:49,649
working group document and this one is a

182
00:15:46,049 --> 00:15:54,299
new one with we are doing for ISS we are

183
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:57,629
doing these same activities for ESS so

184
00:15:54,299 --> 00:16:04,919
this page listed all the RFC's published

185
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:11,329
in ISS thinks 2016 right now this draft

186
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:15,059
only has the minim remaining lifetime

187
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:20,218
included being this module and chris has

188
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:26,519
a another one he will present later was

189
00:16:20,219 --> 00:16:29,209
the reverse my shape Chris will present

190
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:32,699
later that's in a separate document and

191
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:35,429
will keep next time we next revision

192
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,639
will I'd be probably consider adding the

193
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:41,309
multi instance of hot and if you see any

194
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,649
ISS feature that's now covered yet

195
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:50,879
please let us know and if you need it

196
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:53,339
we'll add it so for this module that we

197
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,309
have so far in the document is just the

198
00:16:53,339 --> 00:17:00,719
minimum remaining left hand i scoured

199
00:16:56,309 --> 00:17:02,939
RFC 7 9 87 it's very simple one please

200
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:05,669
take a look and send us their comments

201
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:09,749
if there is signing sorry only has like

202
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:12,499
a notification to say there's something

203
00:17:09,749 --> 00:17:12,499
you need to repot

204
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:25,140
okay so the next one the very last one

205
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:29,040
is the data model for SSI sorry six so

206
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:31,080
the SRA 6ss document is already a

207
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,540
working wolf document and this one

208
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:38,449
defines the young module for that

209
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:41,909
document it defines the configuration

210
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:44,520
how to do the locator sighting and how

211
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:47,640
to you also include the faster rerouting

212
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,570
features exact Shore please review it

213
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,570
and send us your comments and the next

214
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:56,580
step for this one we'd like to request

215
00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:11,550
the working group adoption for this

216
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:14,730
draft and that's it hi Randy I have a

217
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:20,659
question for the chairs actually do we

218
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:25,290
have a yang module augmentation plan or

219
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,360
it's coming together like yeah we so I

220
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:31,710
had like done like the reverse metric

221
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:35,310
one before we sort of agreed to try to

222
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:38,130
do this in in bunches which is where

223
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:41,310
these augmentation version 1 things came

224
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:43,830
from yeah

225
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,980
so the it's you know that that's what

226
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:50,040
we're looking at now but you know you

227
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:52,620
you also see that there's other modules

228
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:56,430
there you know that aren't included in

229
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:58,320
that so I think we're sort of just worth

230
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,240
learning right it's a work in progress

231
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,220
and trying to figure out what the best

232
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:08,760
ways to do this are I you know

233
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,440
personally I wasn't a fan

234
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:13,740
I don't know if this is with my chair

235
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:17,780
hat on or I'm I remember remember happeh

236
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,700
I wasn't a big fan of the Augmented but

237
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,370
you know but other people seem to like

238
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:27,450
that idea so I you know I was willing to

239
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:28,168
go with the flow on that yeah you're

240
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:32,009
grabbing them

241
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:33,690
go ahead hi-yah asa enemy alert or not I

242
00:19:32,009 --> 00:19:37,080
don't know we're not in complete

243
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:41,399
agreement I'm in hoping to get it all

244
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:46,199
done and I did not want to say because

245
00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:47,518
didn't work for SNMP it's a and I don't

246
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,919
see why it would work that much better

247
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,109
well yang is a lot easier to augment but

248
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:55,080
I meant was to make anybody who did a

249
00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:56,460
draft also do the yang augmentations

250
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,850
right in that draft that's the

251
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:03,869
idealistic approach we haven't taken

252
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,939
that to put such a barrier on graphs we

253
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:09,749
can discuss that for future functions

254
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:11,489
but because we have people doing we have

255
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:14,970
people that are contributed that aren't

256
00:20:11,489 --> 00:20:20,429
don't know yang and now we have we have

257
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:21,690
we have so separate so we are so so for

258
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:23,220
better or worse right now we're doing

259
00:20:21,690 --> 00:20:25,289
separate drafts unless we change that

260
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,940
with augmentation okay so what I'm

261
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:28,769
getting from you guys is that we have

262
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:33,149
those documentation drafts which may

263
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:36,749
group several features but in reality as

264
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:39,959
a working group we are gonna do whatever

265
00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:41,639
so that's what I was gonna say is it

266
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,029
this is our first shot at this right

267
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:46,619
we're trying it out I mean I don't think

268
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:48,389
there's any danger in doing it sort of

269
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:51,629
both ways and figuring out which which

270
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:54,139
works better I mean my general thinking

271
00:20:51,629 --> 00:20:56,428
is that certainly for complex features

272
00:20:54,139 --> 00:21:00,600
you know it makes more sense to have a

273
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:02,730
standalone draft right because you know

274
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,449
I think I what I thought about the

275
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:08,340
augmentation the Augmented model was

276
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:10,080
that just picking up all these little

277
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:13,678
bits here and there that got left out of

278
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,210
the base model right I still I still

279
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,940
think it makes sense to have a separate

280
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,109
draft like if you have a major feature

281
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:21,059
you know either

282
00:21:19,109 --> 00:21:22,559
as AC said it might be hard to put it in

283
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:23,700
the same draft but if you're not going

284
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,850
to put in the same graph to have a

285
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,940
standalone pairing with it right like a

286
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,459
sister drafters Chris Bowers with

287
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,159
juniper perhaps a reasonable compromise

288
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,090
would be something like you know they

289
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:42,060
can be in separate drafts the yangko new

290
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:43,350
feature and yang model for new feature

291
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:46,500
separate drafts you know different

292
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:48,330
expertise but you know maybe a

293
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:50,970
requirement of working group last call

294
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,679
is that at least the yang model is at a

295
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,290
level that it's adopted as a working

296
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,720
group document some kind of staged

297
00:21:55,290 --> 00:22:01,850
approach that could make everyone happy

298
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:03,900
I remember that sounds reasonable to me

299
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,639
you know I mean because you're not

300
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,840
you're not blocking it going forward

301
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:11,210
you're saying at least you've made some

302
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:14,490
progress on this other one - yeah yeah

303
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,990
yeah well we'd like to solicit other

304
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:18,060
opinions on the West speaking as a

305
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:22,950
working group member I think that that's

306
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:26,220
reasonable to expect that for my

307
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:29,040
personal opinion I think if it's a large

308
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:32,400
feature we don't want the Yamada to

309
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:36,350
delay the publication of that trapped at

310
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:39,600
all an RFC so if it's a small feature

311
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:42,270
you make more sense if it's possible to

312
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:44,969
include among yamato in the same draft

313
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:48,330
if you don't know how to do it you can

314
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:52,740
ask any of us for help we'll be happy to

315
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,270
provide the Yamada so speaking is a

316
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:56,940
working group member last time this came

317
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,850
around I I thought that we could have a

318
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:02,040
you know sort of a localized Jang doctor

319
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:05,939
you know or yang experts in the LSR

320
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:08,129
group I know the problem is we get so

321
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,420
these author lists gets so big but you

322
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:11,480
know these things aren't hard to write

323
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,650
for people that have written them and

324
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:15,030
you know if you're if you're working on

325
00:23:13,650 --> 00:23:16,740
if there was a group of people you could

326
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,480
go to and say you know we're authoring

327
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:20,910
this draft would you like to join as an

328
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,280
author - to put the yang stuff in there

329
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,440
I mean it shouldn't be hard to do that

330
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,190
but you know this is just brainstorming

331
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,120
on my part unlike how we might do that

332
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:32,190
right so the reason I was asking is

333
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,989
because maybe I had missed the

334
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:36,540
discussion and there was over here some

335
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,150
plan but I think that it's important

336
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,420
that we discuss and if we get to a

337
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:45,450
conclusion of requiring or not or

338
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:50,370
whatever it is that way you know and if

339
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:51,510
there's no specific planned it's good to

340
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,459
know that there's no specific plan -

341
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:54,770
right there's not a requirement that we

342
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:56,510
have a plan

343
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,590
but if we need to discuss something it

344
00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:01,179
would be important for it to be

345
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,530
discussing on the list yes thank you

346
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:07,550
yeah I just have one more thing I think

347
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:09,820
or with our yang models of this

348
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:12,678
especially yang models of this

349
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,360
significance this size as the LSR I

350
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,240
think we're ahead of most of the other

351
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:21,350
working groups so what we do might you

352
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:32,710
know be a harbinger for other working

353
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:32,709
groups in the routing area thank you

354
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,250
take your next no I've got

355
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:16,149
keep it in the tap

356
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:16,129
yeah okay well why don't we see if we

357
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,060
bring less yeah let me see if I can

358
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:21,800
bring the next one this is is it just me

359
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:24,010
that has this particularly bad luck with

360
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,010
this thing

361
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:39,910
okay les thank you for Oh

362
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:14,760
okay I'm West Ginsburg at the last ITF

363
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:20,670
we had a couple of presentations talking

364
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:27,840
about issues associated with increasing

365
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:30,660
the rate of flooding and since there

366
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:34,070
were some two different points of view

367
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,110
that were presented since that time

368
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:40,050
myself and my co-authors have issued

369
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:44,780
this draft is also another draft that

370
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:44,780
was authored by Bruno and several others

371
00:27:49,910 --> 00:28:02,100
okay so going back to the base

372
00:27:57,270 --> 00:28:06,420
specification this is what ten five

373
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:11,159
eighty nine says about flooding and the

374
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:15,740
key takeaway here is that flooding was

375
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:18,630
intended to be an interface independent

376
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:20,630
parameter there are some special

377
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:23,490
considerations that were done for

378
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:25,290
broadcast and it's kind of the one that

379
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:29,970
everybody remembers where ten five

380
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:32,370
eighty nine said roughly 33 milliseconds

381
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:36,650
between sending LSPs on a broadcast

382
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:38,939
interface but 10 589 did not actually

383
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:43,370
specify this for point-to-point

384
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:46,500
interfaces but in most implementations

385
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:54,239
today have applied this to all

386
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:58,350
interfaces why is obviously 33

387
00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:02,880
milliseconds roughly 33 LSPs per second

388
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:06,000
on a particular interface it's

389
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,070
relatively slow or significantly slow by

390
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,810
today's standards and if you have a

391
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,100
large network and you're now talking

392
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:12,960
about

393
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:15,509
for example if you have a node that has

394
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,250
hundreds or a thousand neighbors and

395
00:29:15,509 --> 00:29:19,889
that node goes down that means you've

396
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,149
got a thousand Ellis bees that have to

397
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:24,750
be flooded network-wide

398
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:27,600
well you do the math and if your rate

399
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:30,330
limited to 33 per second on on the

400
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,699
interface it's going to take 30 seconds

401
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:35,240
or more which is a significant amount of

402
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:39,779
time so that's why we're all looking at

403
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:42,299
what can we do to what happens if we

404
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:45,080
increase this rate significantly what

405
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:47,370
issues do we have to deal with

406
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,668
convergence consists of a number of

407
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,639
steps one the nodes that are adjacent to

408
00:29:50,669 --> 00:29:56,100
the topology change have to detect the

409
00:29:52,639 --> 00:29:59,879
topology change they then update and

410
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:02,580
flood their LSPs as the LSPs are

411
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:05,370
received on other notes the network they

412
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:09,120
run a new SPF and then you update the

413
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:16,289
forwarding claim steps 2 3 & 4 need to

414
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:21,229
be done network wide so what we're the

415
00:30:16,289 --> 00:30:24,629
aim of flooding is really to get a

416
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:29,940
consistent link state database network

417
00:30:24,629 --> 00:30:33,509
wide as fast as possible and this quote

418
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:38,279
here from 10 to 5 89 indicates how 10

419
00:30:33,509 --> 00:30:43,919
589 originally thought about this and it

420
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:46,919
was well at each interval you look at

421
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,659
all of the LSPs that are still need to

422
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:51,450
be sent and you keep track of this on a

423
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:54,750
per interface basis and you send them

424
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:56,759
all ok the the pacing interval that was

425
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,649
associated with broadcast interfaces was

426
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:00,870
never actually specified to be applied

427
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:06,989
to point-to-point interfaces but most

428
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:09,508
implementations have done so clearly if

429
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:12,090
we're going to to achieve convergence

430
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:14,789
one of the limiting factors is how

431
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:16,760
quickly can we get the same length state

432
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,370
database on every node in the network

433
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,669
[Music]

434
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:23,918
so again the goal of flooding in the

435
00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:28,240
abstract is let's do it as fast as

436
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:31,840
possible why do we do pacing well we

437
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,730
have to deal with some real issues there

438
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,470
are other things being sent on interface

439
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,640
there are other things that the router

440
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:41,740
is doing so we have to allow for the

441
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,390
fact that there are other types of

442
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:47,169
packets that need to be sent on the

443
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:49,419
interface and it's conceivable that you

444
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:52,600
know obviously pricing analysis an

445
00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:54,580
update to an LSB just the you know

446
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,350
receiving it getting it up to the

447
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,039
control plane having the protocol

448
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,689
operate on it takes time and it's if you

449
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:06,240
send them too fast it's possible that

450
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:06,240
you're going to overwhelm your neighbor

451
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:15,570
so let's talk about the consequences or

452
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:19,840
the tools that we have to deal with

453
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:22,720
faster flooding this is just a little

454
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,820
example of bandwidth is not a major

455
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,070
consideration here these are just

456
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:29,439
numbers about what happens if how much

457
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,090
bandwidth do we consume if we go up to a

458
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,570
hundred per second or a thousand per

459
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:40,480
second flow control so if I start

460
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:46,408
sending LSPs to my neighbor at a much

461
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:49,299
faster rate it's possible due to

462
00:32:46,409 --> 00:32:52,299
whatever else my neighbor may be doing

463
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:59,020
at that time that there may be periods

464
00:32:52,299 --> 00:33:01,990
where he gets overwhelmed so if this

465
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,500
happens occasionally this is not a major

466
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:06,340
issue

467
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,529
if this happens consistently we've got a

468
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,389
significant problem what does it mean it

469
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:13,779
means maybe you've got a no to the

470
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:16,929
network that is underpowered and simply

471
00:33:13,779 --> 00:33:20,440
can't deal with the network at the size

472
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:23,860
that this particular network is or

473
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:25,600
perhaps it's configuration is such that

474
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,539
it's doing more work than it should be

475
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,250
doing or it should needs to be in

476
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,740
another position the network where it

477
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:33,110
doesn't

478
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:35,570
have so many routes there various things

479
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:40,370
that you could do but this is not a

480
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:45,439
state that is conducive to optimal

481
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:47,719
operation of the network as far as flow

482
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,940
control is concerned of the position

483
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:52,130
that we're presenting here we already

484
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,530
track the put the base protocol update

485
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:57,530
process already tracks for each LSB

486
00:33:54,530 --> 00:34:00,379
that's been updated like we keep track

487
00:33:57,530 --> 00:34:03,350
of the set of interfaces that we need to

488
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:06,770
flood it on have we received an

489
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:11,810
acknowledgment for that so the update

490
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:14,179
process is completely reliable if you

491
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:16,159
want to do flow control it's easy enough

492
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:19,280
to do flow control from the standpoint

493
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,830
of the transmitter because you can keep

494
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,480
track of how many LS B's you have sent

495
00:34:21,830 --> 00:34:27,168
out on this particular interface that

496
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:31,360
are still pending acknowledgment so this

497
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:33,469
is an algorithm that we've proposed for

498
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:37,760
handling flow control I'm not going to

499
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:40,250
go through the details but it's

500
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,649
basically if I have too many of

501
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:48,020
outstanding LSPs that haven't been

502
00:34:42,649 --> 00:34:52,460
acknowledged I start to slow down and so

503
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:54,859
I don't overwhelm the neighbor so that's

504
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,240
one flow control is one tool to do to

505
00:34:54,859 --> 00:35:01,310
deal with faster flooding

506
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,319
there's also packet prioritization most

507
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,859
implementations today or at least a

508
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,890
number of them have already prioritized

509
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:12,560
receiving hellos over receiving snps and

510
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:17,569
Ellis B's why do we do that we do that

511
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:21,500
because we don't want to if we if we get

512
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:24,170
a burst of LSPs and that causes us to

513
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:25,280
drop our adjacencies that means we're

514
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:29,920
going to have to generate it even more

515
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,920
LSPs so it just exacerbates the problem

516
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:37,459
what we need to do here is to prioritize

517
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:40,220
the reception of snps over LS B's

518
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:44,430
because snps provide the acknowledgment

519
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,308
for LS B's and if we drop snps

520
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:49,169
then potentially we're doing needless

521
00:35:47,309 --> 00:35:51,119
retransmissions of LSPs we've already

522
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:52,559
sent it to the neighbor he's already

523
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,539
received that he's already acknowledged

524
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,119
it but we lost track of the fact that he

525
00:35:54,539 --> 00:36:01,410
acknowledged it so this is another tool

526
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:06,289
that we can use to help make using

527
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:06,288
faster flooding operate more smoothly

528
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:17,450
minimizing LSB generation so ice is as a

529
00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:21,839
TLV space protocol we have in the base

530
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:24,180
specification up to 255 LS B's / or 256

531
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:30,119
LS B's per level that can be generated

532
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:32,160
by a given node if I have and I'll use

533
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,990
the example here you know get a bunch of

534
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,270
neighbors and I've got them distributed

535
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:42,118
into three different LS B's as I've

536
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:44,670
shown here only if one of the neighbors

537
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:50,240
goes down I've got two strategies that I

538
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:52,589
can use to update the LS B's just to

539
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,890
distribute this information to the rest

540
00:36:52,589 --> 00:37:01,140
of the network with method number 1 so

541
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:05,538
in this case a neighbor number 3 went

542
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:09,450
down neighbor number 3 was in LSP 0 I

543
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:14,450
simply remove neighbor number 3 from LSP

544
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:18,720
0 and I flood LSB 0 method number 2 I

545
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,899
decide well gee now neighbor number 3 is

546
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,839
gone I can fit all of my neighbors into

547
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,980
2 LS B's whereas before I needed 3 LS

548
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:30,960
B's so I'm gonna shift everything and

549
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,849
compact it but when I do that I pay a

550
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,880
heavy price because now I've got to

551
00:37:32,849 --> 00:37:39,140
flood 3 LS B's I've got to flood the

552
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,510
update to LSB 0 the update to LSB 1 and

553
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:46,170
I've got to purge LSB - that's no longer

554
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:50,849
has any content in this except at scale

555
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:53,309
this exacerbates the flooding problem by

556
00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:55,010
an order of magnitude and I think we've

557
00:37:53,309 --> 00:37:57,359
for those of us who have done

558
00:37:55,010 --> 00:37:58,140
implementations and dealt with scale

559
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:01,680
we've learned this

560
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:05,220
lesson the hard way in some cases so one

561
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:08,279
of the lessons here is don't try to

562
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,200
compact your LSPs unnecessarily try to

563
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:12,480
minimize the number of LSPs that you

564
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:17,098
need to update when a topology change

565
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:20,250
occurs redundant in flooding there's a

566
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:22,859
number of mechanisms available to reduce

567
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:26,309
redundant flooding when you have a

568
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:28,650
highly mesh network one of them requires

569
00:38:26,309 --> 00:38:31,170
no protocol extensions whatsoever you

570
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:32,849
just make a local decision and say I've

571
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:35,160
got parallel links to the same neighbor

572
00:38:32,849 --> 00:38:38,910
I don't need to flood this LSP update on

573
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,859
all the links I just want to make sure

574
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:44,490
that each of my neighbors has received

575
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:46,890
the update on at least one interface we

576
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:50,009
have mesh groups which is been around

577
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:52,859
for quite a few years it's a bit

578
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,079
laborious to deploy but it is a tool

579
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:58,380
that is available and now we have the

580
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,329
dynamic flooding draft that's a working

581
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:05,160
group document that allows us to

582
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:06,589
calculate an optimal flooding topology

583
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,788
[Music]

584
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:18,240
jumbo frames the unit of flooding for

585
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:24,930
ISS is an LSP traditionally LSPs are

586
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:27,450
limited to 1492 bytes because the the

587
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:31,410
maximum LSP size that you can send has

588
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:35,160
to be less than the MTU of any interface

589
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:37,649
in the network that is used for is is

590
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:42,930
why is this true because Isis does not

591
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:44,369
support fragmentation if you can if you

592
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:48,299
have a network that supports jumbo

593
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:51,690
frames you can increase the LSP MTU size

594
00:39:48,299 --> 00:39:53,640
to 4k for example this reduces the

595
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:56,519
number of LSPs that each node generates

596
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:58,618
and reduces therefore reduces the number

597
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:01,258
of LSPs that need to be sent when a

598
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:05,269
topology change occurs reduces the total

599
00:40:01,259 --> 00:40:05,269
size of the LSP database

600
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:12,250
so this is a summary of things that we

601
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:14,650
can do to allow us to support a much

602
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:16,900
faster flooding rate and we're one I

603
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,720
think we should be encouraging vendors

604
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:24,310
to support faster flooding this is

605
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:26,830
clearly needed for networks at scale we

606
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:30,640
need to emphasize that the flooding rate

607
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,290
is not a per interface parameter the

608
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,430
goal of flooding is to get things

609
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:40,870
flooded as fast as we can metric wide

610
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:44,259
and not try to tune this you know to a

611
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:47,350
particular neighbor used transmit base

612
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:51,190
flow control to make sure that we don't

613
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:55,480
overwhelm the neighbors prioritize SNP

614
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:57,490
reception minimize LSB generation reduce

615
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:59,040
redundant flooding when use jumbo frames

616
00:40:57,490 --> 00:41:03,189
when you again

617
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:05,080
the the other comment I'd make before

618
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:08,530
opening it up to questions or comments

619
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:11,560
we wrote this draft it's intended to be

620
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:14,590
an informational draft as I said there's

621
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,150
a competing draft in the same space

622
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,640
we'll have to see where the discussion

623
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:23,670
goes as far as the differences in the

624
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,960
two drafts I'm not totally convinced

625
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:28,570
that at the end of the day we need a

626
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:29,950
draft regardless of what the consensus

627
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,170
of the working group is this could be

628
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:34,120
something that we just it's good to have

629
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:37,090
the discussion publicly whether we

630
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:40,509
actually need to publish as a standard

631
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:42,400
be it informational or standards track I

632
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:48,310
think is also something that the working

633
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:51,550
group should consider that's it muna

634
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:53,560
decline orange so since since you

635
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,660
explicitly acknowledge said so

636
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:01,210
discussion is related to draft or the

637
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:02,890
crime fruiting Espina so let's recap

638
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:09,100
that the good of the drop is about

639
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:11,290
floating point full point so I think the

640
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:15,759
problem is big enough and complex enough

641
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:20,160
on we don't need to to look at

642
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,010
independent or to another point such as

643
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,470
with reducing rhythm fooding yes I agree

644
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:28,049
it's good we have a working document

645
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:30,470
working on that for example I think it's

646
00:42:28,049 --> 00:42:33,779
off to granola I think it doesn't bring

647
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:36,118
to put it in the discussion minimize the

648
00:42:33,779 --> 00:42:41,099
number of regeneration yes please let's

649
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,720
do that again it's Auto canola I think

650
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:46,619
we should focus on including which is

651
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,930
already a big boy got a point on which

652
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,390
had a lot of discussion on thank you for

653
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:54,149
Jeff also big shot in in Vancouver it

654
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:56,879
was really a pool were sworn many many

655
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:58,500
Clements on the list so I think we

656
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,410
should focus on floating so what is

657
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,599
flooding I have a set of information

658
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:08,549
that I need to send to you that's all I

659
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,020
think who we are in agreement that we

660
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:17,670
want to do flooding as fast as possible

661
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:20,309
ice are we yes okay thank you

662
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:24,230
I think we are coming to an agreement

663
00:43:20,309 --> 00:43:28,760
that we are fine to you flow control

664
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:34,559
your neighbor that means your interface

665
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:37,500
okay so that's good and so it's already

666
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:42,119
a good improvement if you can come to

667
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:45,839
slide four I don't want to spend too

668
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:47,789
much time on what we disagree okay so

669
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,630
that that's when it's really wrong to my

670
00:43:47,789 --> 00:43:52,920
comment I think we should focus on on on

671
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:56,160
what we're trying to do which is

672
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,829
flooding I don't think breaking

673
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,170
convergence in the description is AB

674
00:43:58,829 --> 00:44:04,020
food I'm quite the contrary I think it's

675
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:06,750
awful it's it's a it's a largely

676
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:09,569
different subject and if we talk about

677
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:12,329
convergence who are going to talk about

678
00:44:09,569 --> 00:44:14,670
packet loss we are going to try to order

679
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:17,339
the cro-magnons in the network but

680
00:44:14,670 --> 00:44:20,220
convergence is about updating the Vibha

681
00:44:17,339 --> 00:44:23,308
it's completely it's largely very

682
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,189
largely different about flooding and

683
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:27,410
it's important because

684
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:28,880
for conventions as I was proposer a long

685
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:32,538
time ago but all the hot fever

686
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,970
I knew we can see that we would like for

687
00:44:32,539 --> 00:44:37,369
authorship for corner drones to have an

688
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,990
order within the network and that could

689
00:44:37,369 --> 00:44:40,849
be beneficial to delay the order

690
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:44,750
depending on the type of topological

691
00:44:40,849 --> 00:44:47,539
Channel okay you know but that's not

692
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:49,130
what we want for flooding and for

693
00:44:47,539 --> 00:44:51,380
flooding we don't want two delays of the

694
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:53,599
flooding we want don't want to order the

695
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,990
flooding we want to fruit the

696
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,849
information on there with information we

697
00:44:56,990 --> 00:45:03,919
can try to do something intelligent for

698
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:06,440
conversions but I'd rather not discuss

699
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:12,410
that subject at the same time and don't

700
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:14,869
think it's helpful so with that so I

701
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:18,859
think we're we're in total agreement

702
00:45:14,869 --> 00:45:21,410
here okay I think what we really want to

703
00:45:18,859 --> 00:45:23,720
discuss here is how can we flood as fast

704
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:25,848
as possible okay there are other tools

705
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:29,240
in the toolkit to deal with convergence

706
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:31,099
issues so we're in agreement so the

707
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,828
points we are not fully on agreement but

708
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:36,349
we are going to work on it is is a doing

709
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:39,589
throw controller so our neighbor or per

710
00:45:36,349 --> 00:45:41,990
interface an array I think that doing

711
00:45:39,589 --> 00:45:45,770
some explicit for flow control with your

712
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:48,140
neighbor is safer on better on that we

713
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:56,299
have a disagreement but I'll leave that

714
00:45:48,140 --> 00:46:00,259
point to Tony I have to say ditto and

715
00:45:56,299 --> 00:46:03,259
echo everything so the only thing that

716
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:06,770
I'd like to talk about is the precise

717
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:09,049
algorithm and I hope we agree that what

718
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,839
we are trying to do when we say as flood

719
00:46:09,049 --> 00:46:17,980
as fast as possible we are trying to

720
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:17,980
maximize good put do we agree with that

721
00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:28,309
so so it's a qualified yes I'm not sure

722
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:31,368
where you're going next that's do we

723
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:34,190
agree that flooding as fast as possible

724
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:37,380
does not mean dumping the entire LSD be

725
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:41,430
as back-to-back package yes we agree

726
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:44,460
good so we're trying to flood maximize

727
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:47,940
good put in getting a actual transfer

728
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:51,269
between two notes and now this boils

729
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:56,660
down to a control theory question right

730
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:59,669
how can we maximize that good book now

731
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:02,629
because we are in a situation where we

732
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:04,859
don't know the exact character disk

733
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:07,979
characteristics and their dynamic

734
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:13,049
characteristics of the receiver we have

735
00:47:07,979 --> 00:47:15,390
to make some estimates and the question

736
00:47:13,049 --> 00:47:19,559
then becomes how do we estimate what the

737
00:47:15,390 --> 00:47:22,650
receiver is doing your algorithm depends

738
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:28,979
to depend on the lack of acknowledgments

739
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:31,499
and uses no other information the

740
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:34,229
alternate proposal is to provide more

741
00:47:31,499 --> 00:47:37,288
information from the receiver that can

742
00:47:34,229 --> 00:47:43,979
give us more data about what the correct

743
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:45,869
amount of throughput is so if we I mean

744
00:47:43,979 --> 00:47:47,308
if we want to start talking about you

745
00:47:45,869 --> 00:47:48,749
know the details because it's obviously

746
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:52,109
is one of the points of difference

747
00:47:48,749 --> 00:47:53,729
between the the two drafts and probably

748
00:47:52,109 --> 00:47:57,450
the most significant point of difference

749
00:47:53,729 --> 00:48:00,269
um we can do that I don't know if you do

750
00:47:57,450 --> 00:48:01,919
you want to have that discussion now I'm

751
00:48:00,269 --> 00:48:03,479
very happy to have that discussion now

752
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,700
or we can do it on the mailing list I

753
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:07,529
don't care okay that the points I would

754
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:09,689
make in regards to the receiver base

755
00:48:07,529 --> 00:48:14,219
flow control that's that's in the draft

756
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:17,009
you've co-author are two things one I

757
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:20,489
think it's what you've proposed is that

758
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:25,019
the receiver be able to signal his

759
00:48:20,489 --> 00:48:27,900
neighbor you know here's you know here's

760
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,629
what I could handle or you know please

761
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:33,630
slow down or some kind of message to

762
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:36,539
that effect which requires signaling

763
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:41,180
from the data plane to the control plane

764
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:45,569
about the the queue size if you will of

765
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:50,069
on a per interface basis of a particular

766
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:52,470
set of protocol packets

767
00:48:50,070 --> 00:48:54,750
I find that very challenging for any

768
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,549
platform to implement so from a

769
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:00,240
practical standpoint I'm very concerned

770
00:48:56,550 --> 00:49:03,000
that even if we could agree that this is

771
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:04,589
you know they have the best solution I

772
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,930
don't know how practical it is to

773
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,960
implement the second point I would make

774
00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:14,990
is the time when you need the signalling

775
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:18,570
is when you're actually overloaded and

776
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:20,700
that's the time it in it requires you

777
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:24,000
know sending another hello back to your

778
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:26,339
neighbor to say hey slow down and that's

779
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,620
the very time when you're more likely to

780
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:31,380
be dropping packets so I'm also

781
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:35,790
concerned about that so your first

782
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:38,220
question so I had a little chat with a

783
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:40,140
number of our hardware people and as you

784
00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:42,959
know we're mostly based on merchants

785
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:45,779
silicon it turns out that actually

786
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:50,280
looking at the queue lengths coming up

787
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:52,920
to the CPU is actually quite trivial it

788
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:55,560
is a register read yes but you're

789
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,690
talking about for a particular protocol

790
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:00,120
there are many packets that are punted

791
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:03,180
from data plane to forwarding or to

792
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:06,270
control planning is that not just is

793
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:09,930
eyes packets and we're not talking here

794
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:13,230
about hellos we're talking specifically

795
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:14,730
about LS B's so I mean there's there's a

796
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,500
lot of detail here in terms of the

797
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,060
information that has to go from the

798
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,100
forwarding plot or the data plane to the

799
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:21,180
control plane exactly part of the

800
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:25,110
problem

801
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:29,490
so some implementations have been able

802
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:32,310
to segregate packets to a very very fine

803
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:35,970
grain detail okay so some

804
00:50:32,310 --> 00:50:39,930
implementations have been able to

805
00:50:35,970 --> 00:50:43,589
separate LSPs from IIHS for example some

806
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:46,919
implementations do not okay we need to

807
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:48,980
kind of support both fortunately the

808
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:52,560
good news is that an implementation

809
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:55,950
knows whether it has got that level of

810
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:58,650
segmentation or not and can report on

811
00:50:55,950 --> 00:51:02,220
the relevant queue regardless of how

812
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:03,759
much that segmentation is happening okay

813
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:07,019
but you're proposing an ask

814
00:51:03,759 --> 00:51:10,299
question with my chair hat on is there

815
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:13,328
you don't like you don't like their

816
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:14,619
proposal but could can't your proposal

817
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:16,029
and their proposal actually live

818
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:18,459
together I'm thinking I'm basically

819
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:21,609
going off what Tony just said you know

820
00:51:18,459 --> 00:51:23,529
if it's very easy given your hardware to

821
00:51:21,609 --> 00:51:25,689
determine packet types in your queue

822
00:51:23,529 --> 00:51:27,909
right and to be able to get the

823
00:51:25,689 --> 00:51:28,449
information needed then that's easy to

824
00:51:27,909 --> 00:51:31,389
implement

825
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:37,199
if not then couldn't they fall back to

826
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:39,759
to your proposal I'm just wondering

827
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,969
obviously if you don't need if you can't

828
00:51:39,759 --> 00:51:44,979
provide the information you can't so yes

829
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:46,779
falling back to that proposal is a fine

830
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:48,638
thing right it's better than where we

831
00:51:46,779 --> 00:51:50,199
are today okay but I mean they live -

832
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,689
they would live together you're not

833
00:51:50,199 --> 00:51:54,159
gonna get into some isolation and we

834
00:51:52,689 --> 00:51:57,189
would need that for backward

835
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,239
compatibility anyway well so Chris if I

836
00:51:57,189 --> 00:52:02,078
understand you correctly what you're

837
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:04,119
suggesting is that we define a

838
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:09,029
transmitted based flow control which

839
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:09,029
everybody can implement and for those

840
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:15,039
implementations that can support the

841
00:52:12,459 --> 00:52:17,469
detection of the you know received queue

842
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:19,359
length and send that they can use the

843
00:52:17,469 --> 00:52:23,130
extensions that are defined in the other

844
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:25,839
draft which are then become optional and

845
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:27,999
then you have to define what happens

846
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:29,649
when you're using if you're going to use

847
00:52:27,999 --> 00:52:31,689
the transcript base flow control by

848
00:52:29,649 --> 00:52:33,819
default and if you happen to get the

849
00:52:31,689 --> 00:52:37,589
receiver based how do you decide how

850
00:52:33,819 --> 00:52:41,380
they interact I suppose that's possible

851
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:44,799
it seems like a reasonable compromise -

852
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:46,630
your second point we never want to get

853
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:50,409
into a situation where the receiver is

854
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:53,319
congested regardless of what's going on

855
00:52:50,409 --> 00:52:57,399
we never one get to the point where our

856
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:58,630
receive queue has zero free entries that

857
00:52:57,399 --> 00:53:00,669
means we're going to start dropping

858
00:52:58,630 --> 00:53:03,729
packets and that's guaranteed to hurt

859
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:07,288
good book so what we know is that we

860
00:53:03,729 --> 00:53:10,779
want the transmitter to keep that queue

861
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:13,689
somewhat full right we always want to

862
00:53:10,779 --> 00:53:15,789
have work available for the CPU because

863
00:53:13,689 --> 00:53:17,670
we can't be guaranteed of getting about

864
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:20,160
the rate exactly right

865
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,750
but we never want that queue to fill up

866
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:32,519
because then we are over running

867
00:53:21,750 --> 00:53:36,569
congesting and wasting work do you agree

868
00:53:32,519 --> 00:53:38,910
with that I'm after what's practical

869
00:53:36,569 --> 00:53:42,509
here okay I think we both have the same

870
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:45,839
goal I'm not totally convinced that the

871
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:49,230
receiver side flow control is practical

872
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:52,410
well let me ask you this if I could tell

873
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:56,869
you that I could receive one LSP per

874
00:53:52,410 --> 00:54:00,420
millisecond could you do that for me

875
00:53:56,869 --> 00:54:03,599
well so you know part of you know part

876
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:07,230
of what we're talking about here is the

877
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:10,289
goal is to flood the set of LSB changes

878
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:15,089
Network wide quote-unquote as fast as

879
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:20,069
possible okay I would submit in most

880
00:54:15,089 --> 00:54:22,109
cases there's no need to flow control

881
00:54:20,069 --> 00:54:24,450
won't actually kick in there are

882
00:54:22,109 --> 00:54:26,490
obviously some cases where you know we

883
00:54:24,450 --> 00:54:29,629
get a large number of else visited in it

884
00:54:26,490 --> 00:54:34,078
it may kick in but I think in general we

885
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:39,119
probably don't have to pace LSPs for 95%

886
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:42,720
of the topology changes so if I've got

887
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:45,180
three LSPs to send are you telling me I

888
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:47,549
need to pace them at the interval that

889
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,200
you know we've we've somehow decided

890
00:54:47,549 --> 00:54:52,410
whether it's sense from the receiver or

891
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:55,230
imposed at the transmitter or are you

892
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:58,140
suggesting only when I get to 500 or

893
00:54:55,230 --> 00:55:01,079
whatever the magic number is so I

894
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,390
certainly agreed that there this is most

895
00:55:01,079 --> 00:55:11,820
important when there is a significant

896
00:55:03,390 --> 00:55:15,180
LSD be change so

897
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:17,790
Am I is there something I haven't

898
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:21,029
responded to yet you're looking like

899
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:23,850
some I say if the receiver could specify

900
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:29,580
a rate what's the problem with complying

901
00:55:23,850 --> 00:55:31,230
with that so I think that this goes back

902
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:33,360
to my concern that I think it's very

903
00:55:31,230 --> 00:55:39,210
difficult for the receiver to specify a

904
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:40,980
rate I mean it's even you don't need as

905
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:43,950
I've expressed I think it's difficult

906
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,660
for a receiver even at to detect the

907
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:49,470
peak conditions that communicate them to

908
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,920
the control plane when it's needed to do

909
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,910
so

910
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:56,100
trying to pre calculate you know Here I

911
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:58,859
am everything's quiet I'm looking at my

912
00:55:56,100 --> 00:56:01,620
configuration I'm looking at the size of

913
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:03,450
my LSB DB I'm looking at all of the

914
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:04,980
other protocols that are running all of

915
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:07,470
the other features are running somehow

916
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,410
I'm supposed to figure out how many is

917
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:11,850
is LSPs I can support on a particular

918
00:56:10,410 --> 00:56:15,330
interface I think that's a pretty

919
00:56:11,850 --> 00:56:18,319
complex problem I think that's actually

920
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:23,160
relatively easy to solve empirically

921
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:28,080
given a given platform with a given Q

922
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:31,470
depth and given CPU it seems like a

923
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:34,980
simple task would show quickly how many

924
00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:36,660
LSPs you could absorb if you if I size

925
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:40,050
was the only thing running on the box

926
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:41,940
that used that Q then I think we could

927
00:56:40,050 --> 00:56:45,450
agree but there's there's countless

928
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:47,910
things that that use that same Q well it

929
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:51,540
should not be countless I'm exaggerating

930
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:54,660
perfectly okay hopefully there is some

931
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:59,100
separation in this day and age otherwise

932
00:56:54,660 --> 00:57:02,339
you're subject to dos attacks but given

933
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:06,390
that there is some clear queue depth

934
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:08,910
depth then there's certainly a rate that

935
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:11,009
you should not be exceeded and that's

936
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:12,930
useful information to the transmitter

937
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:15,750
well all right I guess the the point

938
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:18,390
that we're not in consensus on is I

939
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:20,190
think the problem is more complex and in

940
00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:23,009
order to make sure that you don't get

941
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:25,100
over over overflow you're going to be

942
00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,290
overly conservative and

943
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:30,040
you advertise to your neighbor that's

944
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:30,040
that's my concern

945
00:57:34,030 --> 00:57:39,530
it's Peter from Cisco I just want to

946
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:41,120
make the comment on the distributed

947
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:43,400
system there's no single queue to

948
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,440
monitor you have queue on a line card to

949
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:48,200
your queue between our line card and our

950
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,900
P you have Q and R P we're going to look

951
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:53,120
at all these queues and as you said lies

952
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:55,790
I mean these queues are not just for us

953
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:59,029
they are shared with other traffic I

954
00:57:55,790 --> 00:58:03,380
don't see a simple way how we can figure

955
00:57:59,030 --> 00:58:04,940
out the rate that we can retain it's a

956
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:08,150
silliness beginners working to remember

957
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:11,990
I just as just a point of reference we

958
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:14,650
looked at this we had lots of problems

959
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:17,990
with quiff earlier earlier OSPF

960
00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:23,450
implementations and in the mid early

961
00:58:17,990 --> 00:58:27,770
2000s guy from AT&T T Research published

962
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:30,290
to draft RSC for - - - - and we did not

963
00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,820
because of these complexities we made

964
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:35,720
all we made a number of recommendations

965
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:38,690
but they didn't involve explicit / /

966
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:43,520
neighbor or / interface flow control and

967
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:45,230
since implementations have done that the

968
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:52,690
problems have pretty much gone away in

969
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:56,390
OSPF just I can't help but think about

970
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:58,370
Hanks proposal was it last

971
00:58:56,390 --> 00:59:01,129
IETF or the one before just doing it

972
00:58:58,370 --> 00:59:03,560
over TCP I mean I think you're

973
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:05,930
introducing a whole other set of issues

974
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,520
that need to be discussed so yeah I just

975
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:09,440
I'm gonna you know I'm thinking about

976
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:14,300
saying we don't know what rate to send

977
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,080
and then we've got convergence yeah we

978
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:18,050
don't know that right

979
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:20,270
I like the way that AC as a individual

980
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,850
contributor got up and spoke at the mic

981
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:24,650
as opposed to was that an individual

982
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:27,520
contributor comment or yeah I think he

983
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:30,230
did that because he's on the draft right

984
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:32,720
okay but even even otherwise I think

985
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:34,400
that's actually a pretty good practice

986
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,379
so do I need to walk all the way down

987
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,890
there you know that Mike is actually a

988
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:41,650
good mic as well as a substitute

989
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:43,529
on camera as a presenter yeah yeah

990
00:59:41,650 --> 00:59:50,260
anyway so I think that would actually

991
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:52,510
help a lot so Chris Bowers I just had a

992
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:53,950
comment about you know when when I

993
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:59,319
originally worked on the draft with

994
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:59,799
Bruno the the idea was that that I had

995
00:59:59,319 --> 01:00:03,009
in mind

996
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:06,970
wasn't the dynamic adjustment of this

997
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:08,680
received value and I even I believe

998
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:11,230
there's still text in the draft that it

999
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,569
talks about that so a fallback you know

1000
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:18,150
even if you're you don't believe you're

1001
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:21,720
able to you know for whatever reason

1002
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:28,049
compute dynamically what your maximum

1003
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:31,000
receive rate should be it you know by

1004
01:00:28,049 --> 01:00:33,038
advertising no value by saying we just

1005
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:34,569
can't advertise any value we're really

1006
01:00:33,039 --> 01:00:37,720
putting it back on the service providers

1007
01:00:34,569 --> 01:00:40,299
to individually test every single

1008
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:44,379
hardware platform and software release

1009
01:00:40,299 --> 01:00:47,890
and say and vendor and set the value

1010
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:50,980
themselves and I think we can possibly

1011
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:53,500
do a little better than that you know

1012
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:58,059
we're they are using extremely

1013
01:00:53,500 --> 01:01:01,299
conservative values now you know a value

1014
01:00:58,059 --> 01:01:04,299
that says look I'm on a really you know

1015
01:01:01,299 --> 01:01:08,319
a method that says I'm gonna release you

1016
01:01:04,299 --> 01:01:10,630
know limited platform I'm going to you

1017
01:01:08,319 --> 01:01:12,819
know use this current value like 33

1018
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:17,589
milliseconds or something I'm on a

1019
01:01:12,819 --> 01:01:20,410
stronger platform in general and I you

1020
01:01:17,589 --> 01:01:23,558
know I figure out I have you know only

1021
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:25,529
10 interfaces then I'm gonna go well

1022
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:28,839
it's probably okay for me to go down to

1023
01:01:25,529 --> 01:01:31,180
five milliseconds something something

1024
01:01:28,839 --> 01:01:35,380
along those lines and that value doesn't

1025
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:37,240
change over time it's like a you know

1026
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:39,220
configure eight you know changes maybe

1027
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:41,879
as you change configuration and number

1028
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:45,788
of interfaces that seems like a a

1029
01:01:41,880 --> 01:01:48,849
reasonable you know advertised value it

1030
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:51,940
could be you know it doesn't need to be

1031
01:01:48,849 --> 01:01:53,830
in a TLV per se but it makes

1032
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:57,160
deployment of this so much easier for

1033
01:01:53,830 --> 01:01:59,259
service providers that's that's my so

1034
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:03,190
just a quick question if I can put you

1035
01:01:59,260 --> 01:02:06,640
on the spot instead of me so what do you

1036
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:09,160
do when for example they they enable

1037
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,870
another protocol or they extend the

1038
01:02:09,160 --> 01:02:13,060
operation of another protocol which is

1039
01:02:10,870 --> 01:02:16,900
also going to consume some of the same

1040
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:19,960
resources the estimate the estimate that

1041
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:24,670
you would probably want to be using for

1042
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:28,090
this the value this static value you

1043
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:31,120
know should should assume okay you've

1044
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:35,760
got sort of a maximum amount of BGP

1045
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:40,480
going on or whatever but but again that

1046
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:43,990
you know that we do that testing and be

1047
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:48,570
willing to you know publish that value

1048
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:51,069
in a TLV at least in some you know some

1049
01:02:48,570 --> 01:02:53,530
some scenario is better than the current

1050
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:57,160
situation where they're choosing the

1051
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:58,900
worst conservative values yeah ii might

1052
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,450
I mean I want to reinforce what you're

1053
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:03,610
saying because in my experience

1054
01:03:00,450 --> 01:03:06,370
nobody Tunes these values the vendor you

1055
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:08,560
know has them and they're all kind of

1056
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:10,720
the same order of magnitude that's right

1057
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:15,160
okay nobody's oh so if we want people to

1058
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:19,120
be able to lower them then we we have to

1059
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:24,940
be willing to to say okay at the very

1060
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:28,210
least this value is reasonably safe now

1061
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:30,940
you know your your flow control

1062
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:35,080
mechanism of you know not acting the

1063
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:37,000
SNMP s could then kick in for example

1064
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:40,299
but but at least being willing to

1065
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:42,760
advertise some information now so that

1066
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:44,140
we can at least get below the values

1067
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:49,980
that have been in the network for 10

1068
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:52,390
years or 20 years is you know statically

1069
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:55,510
you know in a relatively static manner

1070
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:57,490
would be quite useful so I think we all

1071
01:03:55,510 --> 01:03:59,380
we obviously all have the same goal we

1072
01:03:57,490 --> 01:04:02,049
all think flooding is much lower than it

1073
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:04,900
needs to be and and we want to be more

1074
01:04:02,050 --> 01:04:05,710
aggressive I think well all we're trying

1075
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:08,289
to debate

1076
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:14,260
what's the safest way to do that I think

1077
01:04:08,289 --> 01:04:15,609
oh good I was gonna say we'd probably

1078
01:04:14,260 --> 01:04:21,309
have to move on to the next presentation

1079
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:23,950
but it looks like perfect yeah we had we

1080
01:04:21,309 --> 01:04:26,200
had some more time on the agenda today

1081
01:04:23,950 --> 01:04:28,299
some slack time so we let that

1082
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:33,089
discussion go I we won't be able to do

1083
01:04:28,299 --> 01:04:33,089
that for every presentation

1084
01:05:25,109 --> 01:05:32,790
here each as the prism for the prefix

1085
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:35,579
unreached more adjustment it's narrow

1086
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:40,020
nice mm Senora and the solution for

1087
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:42,720
accents really started as a sort of the

1088
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:46,800
first technologies for inter area

1089
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:50,069
you know normally for inhaler the item

1090
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:54,359
video of them make the summary or test

1091
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:55,950
at a quadrotor are the believe me if you

1092
01:05:54,359 --> 01:06:00,480
reporter wrote American summer Otis and

1093
01:05:55,950 --> 01:06:01,020
the one node in my area help you in

1094
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,349
failure

1095
01:06:01,020 --> 01:06:07,710
the know the other the other area beyond

1096
01:06:04,349 --> 01:06:10,589
you will be notified immediately at Evo

1097
01:06:07,710 --> 01:06:14,130
dependent the other mechanism to detect

1098
01:06:10,589 --> 01:06:14,910
the failure of the node so this is

1099
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:19,050
phenomenal

1100
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:22,790
icing et exist in the ipv4 sick Network

1101
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:26,280
but I do be extra extra paid for the

1102
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:30,300
unit future for the IP ipv6 or s every

1103
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:32,670
sixth Department another scenario it

1104
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:35,790
also for the inner area is in for the

1105
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:38,339
link failure in our improvers failure in

1106
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:43,470
prisoner it is not a failure in certain

1107
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:46,700
the sonorities link leader so easier to

1108
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:50,220
link Allah to connect one note p.m.

1109
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:53,240
disconnected the amount of the ABR

1110
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:56,848
daughter for example you know I are true

1111
01:06:53,240 --> 01:07:00,240
can't reach reach to reached out to the

1112
01:06:56,849 --> 01:07:02,880
node Tito but it because it is still

1113
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,200
under ties the summary or trace you all

1114
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:10,930
know that we all still seek

1115
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:14,560
reach the unreachable enrichment node so

1116
01:07:10,930 --> 01:07:17,790
the traffic could put people in DC

1117
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:21,490
grandpa will be dropped by The Artful

1118
01:07:17,790 --> 01:07:24,310
the the traffic should be rerouted to

1119
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:29,290
the other eight yards but you know in

1120
01:07:24,310 --> 01:07:33,390
current current situation there is no

1121
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:36,820
solution to or the city or ISA the

1122
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:39,339
service analogies for the inter area you

1123
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:45,070
know in this area the the packbow area

1124
01:07:39,340 --> 01:07:46,900
for grammar error 0 also to some snap

1125
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:51,130
neurologists this summer discovered the

1126
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:54,670
authors of the notes prefix so if the

1127
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:59,610
node failure can failure humidity in the

1128
01:07:54,670 --> 01:08:02,680
same area the the iron node receives the

1129
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:04,990
samurai test it cover the field and

1130
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:07,569
notice the prefect so if you're still

1131
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:08,229
seeing cuz the field is Odom you will be

1132
01:08:07,570 --> 01:08:15,160
reached

1133
01:08:08,230 --> 01:08:18,130
so the summer some other Bank has a bank

1134
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:21,849
a program or the harvesting parable we

1135
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:24,970
all cannot cannot bypass the field note

1136
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:29,710
this is a traditional for the perfect

1137
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:32,950
and reach unreachable so based on this

1138
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:37,290
novel he'll propose some solution the

1139
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:43,779
the first thing is for the interior

1140
01:08:37,290 --> 01:08:46,240
Irish both notion this curvy now for

1141
01:08:43,779 --> 01:08:50,139
OSPF and the wise we help define the

1142
01:08:46,240 --> 01:08:53,710
horrific or later theology so we went to

1143
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:58,120
Ulysses tell we all use this information

1144
01:08:53,710 --> 01:09:01,830
to notify the other Luther in the other

1145
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:04,470
area that one perfect is unreachable for

1146
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:08,950
example you this is a rich graph even

1147
01:09:04,470 --> 01:09:12,820
not t-too filled it will will be

1148
01:09:08,950 --> 01:09:14,740
detected by the ABR rotor are poor and

1149
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:18,340
are harmful

1150
01:09:14,740 --> 01:09:21,950
another right I wrote her r2 and r4

1151
01:09:18,340 --> 01:09:24,490
you're not we announced not only the

1152
01:09:21,950 --> 01:09:26,809
summer days but all but also the

1153
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:33,319
peripheral unreachable not going to be

1154
01:09:26,810 --> 01:09:36,530
abbreviated to QA LSA on this ratio this

1155
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:38,299
LSA will be flooded to other area so

1156
01:09:36,529 --> 01:09:41,359
when the deceiver your honor

1157
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:44,140
earlier this year this hello si you to

1158
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:50,089
feel generative our black hole wrote

1159
01:09:44,140 --> 01:09:53,810
that it is conservatively cannot reach

1160
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:57,230
the third node there are some condition

1161
01:09:53,810 --> 01:10:02,660
to to discover the condition for

1162
01:09:57,230 --> 01:10:08,030
generated in a pap POA under the under

1163
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:10,790
the axle on the POA another solution is

1164
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:11,870
for the intro very here introduced to

1165
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:14,510
you for integer

1166
01:10:11,870 --> 01:10:17,120
there are also some cities and some

1167
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:21,110
rodent your tower still the node of your

1168
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:23,720
link prefix so in such situation we went

1169
01:10:21,110 --> 01:10:27,410
to the if you don't know the median the

1170
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:31,100
aerial receive this information his Bo

1171
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:33,800
and find the field know that is funny

1172
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:38,030
really in the scope of the summer days

1173
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:40,520
it also will generate automatically with

1174
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:44,540
the black hole Road to the fuel note of

1175
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:47,570
your links this such black hole will

1176
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:52,610
clip in Georgia service it's based on it

1177
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:54,380
converted so we have some discussion

1178
01:10:52,610 --> 01:11:01,700
with Peter on the lens

1179
01:10:54,380 --> 01:11:04,340
yesterday and and and some content for

1180
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:08,260
the over consideration you know control

1181
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:10,640
sonography just uses the most simple

1182
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:14,600
situation folder for the POA

1183
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:17,210
generate and consume you pal syrup there

1184
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:20,560
may be some at least complex the

1185
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:23,810
situation is a longer line network so

1186
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:28,130
currently we just and some more

1187
01:11:23,810 --> 01:11:31,100
conservative folder for the QA

1188
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:33,320
the reason the first thing is the API

1189
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:35,870
returns for the hello value to the

1190
01:11:33,320 --> 01:11:40,610
configure the max of the summary this is

1191
01:11:35,870 --> 01:11:42,080
least value just the key would describe

1192
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:44,059
it amongst a number of the detail that

1193
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:47,449
we treat each ball are unreachable

1194
01:11:44,060 --> 01:11:51,139
address of each for each one each summer

1195
01:11:47,449 --> 01:11:53,780
root so when the unreachable perfectly

1196
01:11:51,139 --> 01:11:55,760
is less in a mess then the API wrote

1197
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:59,389
reveal another unauthorized the Sam

1198
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:02,840
Rogers the PA unreachable address is

1199
01:11:59,389 --> 01:12:05,389
less in mass then the AVR really instead

1200
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,659
under has the detailed reachable orders

1201
01:12:05,389 --> 01:12:11,600
only so there are some cities and the

1202
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:17,000
unreachable others are and the reach

1203
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:20,210
modulus will post two more in the math

1204
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:22,940
so in such it here we make a single

1205
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:27,050
solution just advertise the summer days

1206
01:12:22,940 --> 01:12:30,888
with the magnetic so decreases the value

1207
01:12:27,050 --> 01:12:33,679
of the recent some roaches and the from

1208
01:12:30,889 --> 01:12:38,090
receiver side the serial cable a black

1209
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:42,050
hole root for for predefined the time

1210
01:12:38,090 --> 01:12:46,960
interval I am after the service based

1211
01:12:42,050 --> 01:12:49,550
and these field note of your prefix is

1212
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:56,449
converted the this black hole wrote

1213
01:12:49,550 --> 01:13:00,409
Tempe the record so for X of a which we

1214
01:12:56,449 --> 01:13:02,239
also welcome the comment from the expert

1215
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:05,120
and we also will come further more

1216
01:13:02,239 --> 01:13:08,750
complex in order to be not covered and

1217
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:11,030
we also welcome the caller from other in

1218
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:14,300
there to put for this I think is such

1219
01:13:11,030 --> 01:13:26,120
city is also exist in the in the DC

1220
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:29,690
Network okay a sender Cisco Systems so

1221
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:32,179
the the the do this effectively I mean

1222
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:35,509
in independent you have to know what you

1223
01:13:32,179 --> 01:13:36,590
expect in that range because because

1224
01:13:35,510 --> 01:13:38,389
otherwise you don't know what you're

1225
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:41,810
missing because because of the timing

1226
01:13:38,389 --> 01:13:44,210
you know the sequences so are you are

1227
01:13:41,810 --> 01:13:45,860
you gonna map that any place where you

1228
01:13:44,210 --> 01:13:48,199
summarize that the ABR's are you know

1229
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:51,530
are you in a map what you're expecting

1230
01:13:48,199 --> 01:13:53,419
so you know what pieces are missing like

1231
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:55,820
say you first cut when you first come up

1232
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:57,770
if you first come if the ABR first comes

1233
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,940
up and he's already missing around in

1234
01:13:57,770 --> 01:14:04,639
that range he doesn't know that it's

1235
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:06,650
missing normally we just because there's

1236
01:14:04,639 --> 01:14:09,340
a normal city reason not to know

1237
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:12,440
consider come up right there you know

1238
01:14:09,340 --> 01:14:15,800
normally ABR account find that that's a

1239
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:19,669
terrific leave is him I wanted to see

1240
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:22,190
with LSA update you know he can it can

1241
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:24,469
come here which link of each node in

1242
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:27,049
Museum this is enormous it even maybe if

1243
01:14:24,469 --> 01:14:33,280
it if it can come up maybe there are

1244
01:14:27,050 --> 01:14:33,280
other artists it cuz iterate the later

1245
01:14:33,489 --> 01:14:38,690
Isis Peter from Cisco so as you said I

1246
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:40,790
mean we you had a chat about this there

1247
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:42,500
are multiple issues here first of all

1248
01:14:40,790 --> 01:14:44,900
you announce something is unreachable

1249
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:46,580
how long is it going to be there it's

1250
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:48,888
going to be unreachable forever if it

1251
01:14:46,580 --> 01:14:51,699
never comes back so you have to time out

1252
01:14:48,889 --> 01:14:54,260
the information at certain point if the

1253
01:14:51,699 --> 01:14:57,049
address that you make unreachable it's

1254
01:14:54,260 --> 01:14:59,570
not coming up as well you know if

1255
01:14:57,050 --> 01:15:02,300
behavior loses a connectivity to many of

1256
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:03,949
the prefixes now you basically lost the

1257
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:05,270
summarization effect because you are

1258
01:15:03,949 --> 01:15:08,210
going to advertise all of them is

1259
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:11,090
unreachable so there are multiple issues

1260
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:13,340
with this I I see the problem you are

1261
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:15,679
trying to solve the question is whether

1262
01:15:13,340 --> 01:15:18,820
this is the right solution I'm not

1263
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:18,820
convinced at this point

1264
01:15:20,739 --> 01:15:26,419
Watkins Burke so I share all the

1265
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:29,120
concerns that Peter expressed and I know

1266
01:15:26,420 --> 01:15:33,940
we we did talk about this privately the

1267
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:35,959
other points I would make is to from a

1268
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:37,789
procedural standpoint

1269
01:15:35,959 --> 01:15:40,760
you're actually violating some existing

1270
01:15:37,789 --> 01:15:42,800
protocol specifications it's currently

1271
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:48,199
not legal to send the router idea of

1272
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:49,479
zero and this is completely non

1273
01:15:48,199 --> 01:15:51,799
backwards compatible

1274
01:15:49,479 --> 01:15:53,389
there's no implementation today that

1275
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:55,939
would interpret a prefix reachability

1276
01:15:53,389 --> 01:15:58,280
advertisement is as indicating negative

1277
01:15:55,939 --> 01:16:00,590
reach ability so it would require a

1278
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:02,749
forklift upgrade I think the problem

1279
01:16:00,590 --> 01:16:04,489
space is interesting and I think it's

1280
01:16:02,749 --> 01:16:06,709
it's good for the working group to

1281
01:16:04,489 --> 01:16:11,178
discuss the problem space I'm not sure

1282
01:16:06,709 --> 01:16:13,188
this is the best solution you know for I

1283
01:16:11,179 --> 01:16:16,219
think further solutions will be deployed

1284
01:16:13,189 --> 01:16:18,979
in culture race so the mix was no the

1285
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:22,099
year the network is so supported such

1286
01:16:18,979 --> 01:16:25,610
feature you know they saw them seeing

1287
01:16:22,099 --> 01:16:28,280
scenes are seeing either this or for the

1288
01:16:25,610 --> 01:16:38,959
for the generator on the floor that is

1289
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:40,999
here okay thanks our judgment obviously

1290
01:16:38,959 --> 01:16:41,479
we need more discussion on this one on

1291
01:16:40,999 --> 01:16:47,438
the list

1292
01:16:41,479 --> 01:16:47,439
yeah you can initiate it okay thanks

1293
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:08,730
just just before you get started I've

1294
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:13,030
only been fleetingly following the

1295
01:17:08,730 --> 01:17:16,169
enhanced VPN solution but it's not yet

1296
01:17:13,030 --> 01:17:19,630
adopted is it in other working groups

1297
01:17:16,170 --> 01:17:23,500
Indies or in case is a firmer case

1298
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:26,530
adopted and in spring we presented

1299
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:29,200
yesterday and we caught some feedbacks

1300
01:17:26,530 --> 01:17:33,700
maybe you make some change and ask for

1301
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:38,110
the adoption ok ok ok this is a update

1302
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:40,120
of the IGP extensions Philippian plus so

1303
01:17:38,110 --> 01:17:42,639
some background first to the VPN pass

1304
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:44,260
framework is describing the t's draft

1305
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,540
which provided a layered architecture

1306
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:49,600
and there's a candidate technologies in

1307
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:51,970
each layer and the purpose is to cover

1308
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:55,330
the use cases of nano slicing and other

1309
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:57,700
genera scenarios and is the semi routing

1310
01:17:55,330 --> 01:18:00,340
based the solution is defined in the

1311
01:17:57,700 --> 01:18:02,260
draft in spring and which this draft

1312
01:18:00,340 --> 01:18:04,900
basically is tennyson routing to

1313
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:07,210
identify the network topology and the

1314
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:09,160
nano resources allocated to a virtual

1315
01:18:07,210 --> 01:18:11,080
network so this is the data opening

1316
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:12,670
mechanism for the which can be

1317
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:15,640
applicable for the transport network

1318
01:18:12,670 --> 01:18:17,920
slice for this document

1319
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:20,800
its main it defines the IGP mechanism

1320
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,650
and extensions for the SR based of a pin

1321
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,720
class the purpose is to for the

1322
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:27,580
distribution of the required attributes

1323
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:31,120
to post the nettle nodes and the

1324
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:33,160
controller and in this version we also

1325
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:36,180
take the control plane scalability into

1326
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:39,130
consideration and for the controlling

1327
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:44,680
analysis we have another draft in T's we

1328
01:18:39,130 --> 01:18:48,310
can take a look at that one ok here is

1329
01:18:44,680 --> 01:18:51,340
the methodology first the functionality

1330
01:18:48,310 --> 01:18:53,110
required for IGP is to advertise and

1331
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:55,480
track to the in from attributes of

1332
01:18:53,110 --> 01:18:57,519
different to virtual networks and they

1333
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,769
also need to compute the routing

1334
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:03,010
forwarding tables for each portion

1335
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:05,230
network so we think for the IGP

1336
01:19:03,010 --> 01:19:07,630
the flexibility and scalability is

1337
01:19:05,230 --> 01:19:10,120
important and we need to consider it

1338
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:12,940
the beginning of the design so as we can

1339
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:15,040
support the for the 5g network slicing

1340
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:18,489
deployment in different scenarios and

1341
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:22,269
the phases like we can have a consistent

1342
01:19:18,489 --> 01:19:25,449
solution for tens hundreds of thousands

1343
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:28,179
of nano slices so basically basically

1344
01:19:25,449 --> 01:19:31,120
the design is we provide proposed multi

1345
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:33,340
dimension networks last definition so

1346
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,349
that we think the nano slice is defined

1347
01:19:33,340 --> 01:19:37,810
as a combination of a several key

1348
01:19:35,350 --> 01:19:39,880
attributes like the topology attributes

1349
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:41,770
and the resource attributes we may also

1350
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:44,770
have other attributes in the future it

1351
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:46,840
can be added as needed and the second

1352
01:19:44,770 --> 01:19:48,940
point is we can decouple the

1353
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:51,370
advertisement and the processing of

1354
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:53,259
different attributes in the control

1355
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:57,760
plane so that we can improve the

1356
01:19:53,260 --> 01:20:01,030
scalability and reduce overhead okay

1357
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,489
here's an example when we can see this

1358
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:06,750
topology on the top based on this

1359
01:20:03,489 --> 01:20:10,150
topology this is a neural network we can

1360
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:11,980
define T for the topologies using the

1361
01:20:10,150 --> 01:20:14,739
existing technology like a multi

1362
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:16,780
topology of LaSalle go in this example

1363
01:20:14,739 --> 01:20:19,750
we have two different two sub topologies

1364
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:23,670
define depends on this under a topology

1365
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:26,770
and the second step is we can use

1366
01:20:23,670 --> 01:20:29,290
another identifier called the resource

1367
01:20:26,770 --> 01:20:32,620
ID so I define the different groups of

1368
01:20:29,290 --> 01:20:35,440
resources allocated to different like a

1369
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:38,949
service or network slice so that we can

1370
01:20:35,440 --> 01:20:40,960
have several Metro slices have the same

1371
01:20:38,949 --> 01:20:43,269
topology by the way it's different the

1372
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:46,090
group of the resources based on these

1373
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:47,710
two steps we can build it a combination

1374
01:20:46,090 --> 01:20:51,540
of a topology and the resource could

1375
01:20:47,710 --> 01:20:55,389
generate the customized virtual networks

1376
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:57,400
okay here are the extensions to IGP the

1377
01:20:55,389 --> 01:20:59,440
first is we need to advertise the

1378
01:20:57,400 --> 01:21:01,138
definition of that I would call the

1379
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:07,210
transfer narrow slice in this version

1380
01:21:01,139 --> 01:21:09,489
basically it is can contains 132 page

1381
01:21:07,210 --> 01:21:12,510
global identifier for the transfer

1382
01:21:09,489 --> 01:21:16,059
narrow slice and it can also carry

1383
01:21:12,510 --> 01:21:18,340
optional sub t RVs currently we have two

1384
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:22,980
optional sub t io is defined which is

1385
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:22,980
the topology and the resource here

1386
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:29,320
okay here are the encoding of the sub

1387
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:32,960
theories for the topology information

1388
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:35,059
advertisement we think we can reuse the

1389
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:38,170
audience apology and a flash I'll go to

1390
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:41,450
identify the topology which is power

1391
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:43,670
belongs to a narrow slice like we have

1392
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:47,150
the MT ID and algorithm filled in this

1393
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:51,620
sub tre we also use the flats to control

1394
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:54,679
which field is used as topology

1395
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:56,390
identified and the second sub theory is

1396
01:21:54,680 --> 01:22:00,370
the natural resource sub goe

1397
01:21:56,390 --> 01:22:03,620
in this one we use a new 32-bit global

1398
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:07,010
significant identifier to identify the

1399
01:22:03,620 --> 01:22:11,180
group of resources allocated to a in the

1400
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:13,160
network okay

1401
01:22:11,180 --> 01:22:15,350
the following slides we showed how to

1402
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:17,410
advertise the topology attributes and

1403
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:20,750
the resource attributes independently

1404
01:22:17,410 --> 01:22:23,809
the first is that we can reuse a multi

1405
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:26,840
topology for the topology advertisement

1406
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:28,820
because we have the MPR and it can be

1407
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:30,530
used together with a segment routing to

1408
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:33,200
define the network topology and

1409
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:36,800
advertise the topology specific C's

1410
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:38,720
locators attributes and second option so

1411
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:42,460
we can also consider reduce flux algo

1412
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:46,760
based to root for to define the topology

1413
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:49,640
constraints for a virtual network this

1414
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:52,280
is also applicable to similarly named

1415
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:54,560
eurozone as a v6 and you can define that

1416
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:57,019
algorithm specific assays and locators

1417
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,150
so we think for this topology ID

1418
01:22:57,020 --> 01:23:04,160
attribute advertisement we can use

1419
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:06,019
either option okay for the resource

1420
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:07,940
attribute advertisement here we also

1421
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:11,570
reuse the existing technology with

1422
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:14,269
necessary extensions here we can see we

1423
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:16,940
use that hello to bondo mechanism is

1424
01:23:14,270 --> 01:23:20,120
extensions to advertise the resources

1425
01:23:16,940 --> 01:23:23,389
associated with a particular Network

1426
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:26,090
slice and we can see in this case we

1427
01:23:23,390 --> 01:23:29,510
consider a subset of the net link

1428
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:32,300
resource as a physical virtual member

1429
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:34,969
link of a layer 3 interface so for the

1430
01:23:32,300 --> 01:23:37,940
layer 2 a pound of mechanism we

1431
01:23:34,969 --> 01:23:40,190
to define your flight like we flag to

1432
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:42,830
indicate whether the inter member dink

1433
01:23:40,190 --> 01:23:47,030
and administrating is a virtual physical

1434
01:23:42,830 --> 01:23:50,269
link and another extension is a new

1435
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:55,340
resource ID TL sub Q is defined to

1436
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:57,640
advertise the identifier of this subset

1437
01:23:55,340 --> 01:24:00,380
of resource in the link and this

1438
01:23:57,640 --> 01:24:02,660
information will be advertised together

1439
01:24:00,380 --> 01:24:07,370
with the existing T attributes for each

1440
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:10,580
member Inc okay okay that's all for this

1441
01:24:07,370 --> 01:24:12,890
the extensions and we would like to hear

1442
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:17,120
the feedbacks and we will refine this

1443
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:19,940
document I'm just insurance or similar

1444
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:22,160
comment provided in spring I don't think

1445
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:24,799
you should be defined what network slice

1446
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:27,469
or network topology slice is you should

1447
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,870
refer government documents that's going

1448
01:24:27,469 --> 01:24:32,480
to be the product of design team number

1449
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:35,269
0 and I think you've heard it before VPN

1450
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:38,239
is so much which I do not really BPL

1451
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:41,989
give it less controversial name VM for

1452
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:47,080
example might be good clarify this terms

1453
01:24:41,989 --> 01:24:47,080
in the next version make it more clear

1454
01:24:47,710 --> 01:24:54,110
blue burger as T's co-chair just to be

1455
01:24:51,830 --> 01:24:57,410
clear we do have a draft on framework

1456
01:24:54,110 --> 01:25:00,530
for enhanced VPN yeah we don't have any

1457
01:24:57,410 --> 01:25:02,330
drafts on slicing solutions yet we do

1458
01:25:00,530 --> 01:25:07,460
have a design team that's looking at a

1459
01:25:02,330 --> 01:25:10,040
framework for slicing the solution

1460
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:12,469
that's described here is nothing more

1461
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:14,600
than an individual draft and has no more

1462
01:25:12,469 --> 01:25:22,160
than individual draft standing in T's as

1463
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:26,900
well um from entitlement for I think for

1464
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:31,040
the future networking the resources is

1465
01:25:26,900 --> 01:25:34,160
OE so to be information so to be tripod

1466
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:40,810
or Freudian VD in the ITV network so

1467
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:43,730
every node can Raziel required the sauce

1468
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:46,810
long command for the kind of parties are

1469
01:25:43,730 --> 01:25:50,980
interrupted I think the the

1470
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:55,120
follow follow you the owner follow

1471
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:57,250
follow Tron should be included for why

1472
01:25:55,120 --> 01:26:03,700
and where this information come from and

1473
01:25:57,250 --> 01:26:09,640
why why you need to fly to him okay okay

1474
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:12,130
I love improv avi I wanted to ask a loop

1475
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:13,870
worker to clarify this okey so it's for

1476
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:16,900
my point of view I see that the VPN

1477
01:26:13,870 --> 01:26:18,820
placer are already defended is a slice

1478
01:26:16,900 --> 01:26:20,469
framework why do you sing that they are

1479
01:26:18,820 --> 01:26:24,250
some know slicing for a walk I'm not

1480
01:26:20,470 --> 01:26:27,369
sure what what what's the point

1481
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:27,369
[Music]

1482
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:32,950
Lou burger I'll defer to the chair is

1483
01:26:31,810 --> 01:26:34,740
how much of a conversation you want to

1484
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:37,870
have about the teas working group but

1485
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:42,910
the in the teas working group we have

1486
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:45,190
the VPN plus or enhanced VPN framework

1487
01:26:42,910 --> 01:26:47,050
as a working group document it does

1488
01:26:45,190 --> 01:26:49,839
mention that slicing is a potential use

1489
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:53,260
case for that technology it is not

1490
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:56,260
something specific to slicing we also

1491
01:26:53,260 --> 01:26:58,060
have a design team that's looking at the

1492
01:26:56,260 --> 01:27:00,700
slicing framework and they've yet to

1493
01:26:58,060 --> 01:27:02,890
produce their recommendation into a

1494
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:07,150
working group so that's that's where it

1495
01:27:02,890 --> 01:27:10,120
stands so yeah I mean we're gonna listen

1496
01:27:07,150 --> 01:27:12,790
to the teas co-chair when we're hearing

1497
01:27:10,120 --> 01:27:18,370
about like what it's an individual draft

1498
01:27:12,790 --> 01:27:21,460
and you know this I think that we need

1499
01:27:18,370 --> 01:27:23,790
to wait maybe for the teas working group

1500
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:26,200
to be selecting at least a direction

1501
01:27:23,790 --> 01:27:29,230
technology's going and this shouldn't be

1502
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:32,320
us our Shin muses it like an end-run to

1503
01:27:29,230 --> 01:27:34,929
try to present you know things that

1504
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,330
should be first decided on and teas here

1505
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:39,970
you're gonna be doing TLV extensions and

1506
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:41,530
stuff to support a technology right this

1507
01:27:39,970 --> 01:27:45,580
isn't this isn't a place you're gonna

1508
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:50,410
get a blessing on a technology that

1509
01:27:45,580 --> 01:27:52,630
needs to come out of teas hobby I wanna

1510
01:27:50,410 --> 01:27:55,000
under one point I think addition in fact

1511
01:27:52,630 --> 01:27:57,700
this of the BPM class offering worker

1512
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,900
two years ago we already when I assume

1513
01:27:57,700 --> 01:28:03,349
you may know this is the history of this

1514
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:05,750
the draft I sing from this is a sight

1515
01:28:03,350 --> 01:28:09,680
from Leah so the side meeting on it who

1516
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:11,630
that are ttw Gianna dent who the then to

1517
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:13,580
the tears of working guru but I think at

1518
01:28:11,630 --> 01:28:15,560
the beginning you know they say you the

1519
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:18,440
other beginning they see you the slice

1520
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:21,110
oriented a solution from that point I

1521
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:23,870
think that is already clarified as a

1522
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:25,549
beginning so I I don't understand at the

1523
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:28,690
point I think now they are talking about

1524
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,690
this not what I see

1525
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:37,070
I think this proper will help the

1526
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,440
implementation of the network strategy

1527
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:41,389
and butter you know it is not a point to

1528
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,259
the net for strategy and you know there

1529
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:47,210
are at least in other technology for

1530
01:28:44,260 --> 01:28:49,310
implementations NATO study so we get

1531
01:28:47,210 --> 01:28:52,310
which technology will be selected by the

1532
01:28:49,310 --> 01:28:54,740
networks identities are topical you know

1533
01:28:52,310 --> 01:29:00,920
it is I think it should not coupled with

1534
01:28:54,740 --> 01:29:03,080
the networks rezian selection thanks I

1535
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:06,050
yeah we are gonna wait for the t's

1536
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:07,970
design team the other thing you you

1537
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:10,850
realize that there's another draft that

1538
01:29:07,970 --> 01:29:14,390
was committed presented a few IETF Segoe

1539
01:29:10,850 --> 01:29:18,230
with different terminology where they

1540
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:21,050
were using that yeah it was I don't

1541
01:29:18,230 --> 01:29:23,660
remember the name of the the lady who

1542
01:29:21,050 --> 01:29:28,550
presented it but it was it was also how

1543
01:29:23,660 --> 01:29:30,559
you could do is slicing and or with you

1544
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:32,510
know that and then the terminology was

1545
01:29:30,560 --> 01:29:36,080
different in that draft it might have

1546
01:29:32,510 --> 01:29:39,290
been okay yeah I can I can look it up

1547
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:41,750
yeah nice you included them in the work

1548
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:43,430
yeah maybe another opportunity we can

1549
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:47,000
also look at the terminologies or

1550
01:29:43,430 --> 01:29:51,110
whether we make it or generic and so

1551
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:53,060
that we don't rely on this design team

1552
01:29:51,110 --> 01:29:58,160
or entities and make it a generic

1553
01:29:53,060 --> 01:30:00,830
solution for set of scenarios ensure

1554
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,720
you're addressing particular layer in

1555
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:05,780
the transport slice you don't address

1556
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:07,370
all of it and it's one of the possible

1557
01:30:05,780 --> 01:30:10,190
solutions it's definitely not going to

1558
01:30:07,370 --> 01:30:13,519
be exposed not bound to consumer of it

1559
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:15,230
so don't make it more generic because it

1560
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,300
shouldn't be there's going to be more

1561
01:30:15,230 --> 01:30:19,759
generic definition that's going to use

1562
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:23,060
this kind of technology below it but not

1563
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:28,700
this is not it it's really reasonably

1564
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:32,630
small parts of it right so in fact here

1565
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:34,730
I I problem my concern because I I don't

1566
01:30:32,630 --> 01:30:37,250
think this is a good way to talk about

1567
01:30:34,730 --> 01:30:39,349
the name I think we always talk about

1568
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:41,600
the use of slicing like this when the

1569
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:43,520
framework here I sing you will taller

1570
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,980
this one I think that is clear

1571
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:48,380
maybe later do you 3gpp you say please

1572
01:30:45,980 --> 01:30:52,040
read for our architecture the network

1573
01:30:48,380 --> 01:30:56,390
slicing proposed by 3gpp I don't see

1574
01:30:52,040 --> 01:31:00,019
Melissa you look good away okay I think

1575
01:30:56,390 --> 01:31:03,410
we're out of time right do you want to

1576
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:05,810
separate how you so summarize we have

1577
01:31:03,410 --> 01:31:09,889
some I know we have some we're gonna go

1578
01:31:05,810 --> 01:31:14,890
through the minutes and and look at what

1579
01:31:09,890 --> 01:31:14,890
we have a calls for it option and and

1580
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:20,300
I'm I think we have one working group

1581
01:31:18,680 --> 01:31:21,860
class called the request for working

1582
01:31:20,300 --> 01:31:27,950
group class called I look at that

1583
01:31:21,860 --> 01:31:31,160
and we also are looking for ways forward

1584
01:31:27,950 --> 01:31:34,040
for first of all to make sure since we

1585
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:37,430
have the two giraffes in the first

1586
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:40,400
session the ttz and the area proxy for

1587
01:31:37,430 --> 01:31:45,220
is is look at whether or not we actually

1588
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:45,219
need to do this in terms of requirements

1589
01:31:46,720 --> 01:31:53,780
those are yeah I mean I was I I won't do

1590
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:56,540
the presentation I mean you know it's

1591
01:31:53,780 --> 01:31:59,660
gonna load now it's like I was actually

1592
01:31:56,540 --> 01:32:01,670
going to see if the ask as a presenter

1593
01:31:59,660 --> 01:32:05,150
if the working group one she would have

1594
01:32:01,670 --> 01:32:08,270
to reverse metric but I didn't present

1595
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:11,540
it so I don't think we need we could

1596
01:32:08,270 --> 01:32:13,700
have a call on that draft without having

1597
01:32:11,540 --> 01:32:18,199
it presented oh yeah well just do it on

1598
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:19,460
the list I guess but

1599
01:32:18,199 --> 01:32:21,110
so we don't have time and nobody wants

1600
01:32:19,460 --> 01:32:23,210
to see that yang mano presentation

1601
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:29,139
nobody wants a stylist a over for that

1602
01:32:23,210 --> 01:32:29,140
so I think we're done thanks everyone

1603
01:32:29,980 --> 01:32:40,509
yeah and again you know I'd encourage

1604
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:42,919
everybody especially offers to move

1605
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:45,410
discussion along on the list about your

1606
01:32:42,920 --> 01:32:48,290
drafts it seems like we have a lot of

1607
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:51,980
work you know a lot of theory of

1608
01:32:48,290 --> 01:32:54,019
activity right before the IETF if we

1609
01:32:51,980 --> 01:32:56,209
could keep the momentum going that we

1610
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:57,949
have before the IETF and during the ATF

1611
01:32:56,210 --> 01:33:23,960
through the whole period would get a lot

1612
01:32:57,949 --> 01:33:33,009
more done based on the bits you can use

1613
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:33,010
right but if I didn't think it did
