1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,460
yeah yeah don't worry it's friendly crab

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:25,369
yes okay so you're all warmed up well

3
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,960
you know right the whole idea is if you

4
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:34,940
can find that community of people who

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:39,500
want and the shared interest new club

6
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:39,500
[Laughter]

7
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,980
you can pull it I you know there's a bit

8
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:53,600
of a vetting process of like you know

9
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,349
how are you different and are you

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,350
reinventing wheels

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:11,830
what is the to see from the camera like

12
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:15,650
I haven't but I feel like there's a

13
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:30,560
there may be or have been somebody else

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:32,180
involved in the heme looting LPC okay

15
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,680
that's not written I'm kind of a

16
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,680
transport - that's why

17
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:46,250
yes listen it's not that is that is in

18
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,990
fact important to some people but that's

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:52,430
not you know when I say transport I'm

20
00:01:47,990 --> 00:02:00,320
talkin TCP UDP yes which we call the

21
00:01:52,430 --> 00:02:02,480
test port area yes well I mean you know

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,020
they're just labels is this your first

23
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:23,530
night but you did they have like an

24
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:26,240
orientation only just barely works but

25
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:29,720
well there's versus there's a good

26
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:33,070
document called the Dow of the idea okay

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,090
that yeah that was yeah yeah it's

28
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:38,989
there's like there's a bunch of keywords

29
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:40,730
you know in the community and unpacked

30
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:42,980
some of those at least understand in

31
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:45,190
what to conclude when these it's the

32
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,190
shared

33
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,569
[Music]

34
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:19,810
yeah the process here is is different in

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:21,970
some fundamental way yeah and it's you

36
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:25,480
know it is an organization that's that

37
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:33,370
sort of research as its DNA and so

38
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:49,269
there's research sometimes may be things

39
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:52,150
like routing documents slowly so I think

40
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:55,150
basically so the goal of this session is

41
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:57,400
to help identify people who will have

42
00:03:55,150 --> 00:04:01,810
something that they want to work on to

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,910
help identify collaborators and yeah

44
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:25,390
yeah and so you know if you're you're

45
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:26,890
bringing you know one thing that I think

46
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:41,830
the whole sessions gonna run probably

47
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:44,800
about an hour and 15 minutes so there we

48
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:46,270
go okay you are 12 out of 17 so you

49
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,410
you're probably about 45 minutes in

50
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,460
maybe maybe oh well you probably got

51
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:55,180
time to go ahead and grab some food and

52
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:58,979
come back you know don't worry about it

53
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:58,980
okay nice meeting you Nick

54
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,529
[Music]

55
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,630
[Music]

56
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:35,710
okay folks let's get started it's about

57
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:39,910
five after we've got 17 talks tonight

58
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,979
and it's probably gonna take us I think

59
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,130
probably a little bit over an hour to

60
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:46,840
get through them usually things move

61
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,130
pretty quickly would somebody mind

62
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,130
closing the door at the back of the room

63
00:05:50,729 --> 00:05:57,370
thank you all a so my name is Erin Falk

64
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,289
this is the hot RFC lightning talk

65
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:01,720
session if this is the first one of

66
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:04,990
these that you've been to let me just

67
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:09,430
explain very briefly what it is the idea

68
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:11,590
here is to give a forum for folks who've

69
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,700
got something that they want to work on

70
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:20,289
an opportunity to find collaborators and

71
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,450
to do it in a way that makes that's sort

72
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:26,469
of an efficient use of time lets us get

73
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:29,050
through a lot of ideas so we see things

74
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:31,720
that are advertisements for boss which

75
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,850
are new work coming into the IETF or

76
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,370
folks who've just got an idea might not

77
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,970
be at the boss stage or have a

78
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:41,919
particular paper or a topic or a

79
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:45,970
research area that they're looking for

80
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:47,200
people who share that interest so I

81
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,240
think you're going to see a wide range

82
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,550
of stuff tonight

83
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,750
we try to do this at every ITF and so if

84
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:55,290
you're inspired

85
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,980
next time feel free to shoot an email

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:02,260
the link here has a little bit of

87
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:05,140
context for the session and contact

88
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:08,560
email address for me and so feel free to

89
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:10,690
reach out so I think that I've probably

90
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,070
spoken long enough and so Tommy's gonna

91
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:15,070
be our first speaker let's bring on

92
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,170
Tommy oh sorry one format thing so the

93
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,909
talks are restricted to last no more

94
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:20,980
than four minutes when the speaker

95
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:24,280
starts I start a little timer when the

96
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:25,960
timer quacks were using the Lars Eggert

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,729
time management rules which is that when

98
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,820
you hear the timer quack I would like

99
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,380
everybody in the room to clap so I'm

100
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,450
gonna count on you for help this is how

101
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,969
we stay on schedule

102
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,469
great get warmed up very good okay

103
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:43,650
please welcome Tommy Pali our first

104
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:43,650
speaker Tommy you got the clicker yep

105
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:50,440
works all right your honor

106
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:52,510
all right hello everyone I'm Tommy from

107
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,300
Apple and we're going to talk about DNS

108
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,500
privacy it's maybe a controversial topic

109
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,200
but I think it's one that's very

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,290
interesting so this is what DNS

111
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,250
traditionally looks like you have a

112
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:04,840
resolution that you often do to your

113
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,700
local resolver you connect to the name

114
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,159
that you get from that some people are

115
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,080
concerned that the local resolver may be

116
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,640
seeing things and be able to profile you

117
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,630
in ways that you don't want if you don't

118
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:18,640
trust it so one approach to solve this

119
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,440
is say oh we trust some other resolver

120
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,270
in the cloud a lot more so let's do that

121
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,160
people have concerns about this too

122
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:26,169
because how do we know we trust that and

123
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,419
that also can see everything you do and

124
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:32,860
it's another point that can also be

125
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,809
monitoring you so we have a proposal

126
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:36,969
that we're calling adaptive DNS privacy

127
00:08:34,809 --> 00:08:38,500
to try to have more different resolvers

128
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:41,169
in the mix we want to be able to

129
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,960
discover many decentralized OU servers

130
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:46,510
we want to be able to designate doe

131
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,070
servers for given domains so that you

132
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,080
can say what you should be using for a

133
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,730
certain set of names we also want to

134
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,930
discover what the local policy is so

135
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,850
that we can do the right things on the

136
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:57,489
local network and then have a good

137
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,250
algorithm for how to use all of our DNS

138
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:02,320
queries so you can get something looks

139
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:04,030
like this lots of possible options that

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,300
can coexist and hopefully make sense

141
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,150
together that give us privacy without

142
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,380
tying us to one option there is of

143
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,689
course an interesting question of how do

144
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,189
you bootstrap this system especially if

145
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,890
you don't want to just use the local

146
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:19,110
resolver without just trusting someone

147
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,760
else instead for this we have a second

148
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:22,920
document which you may be interested in

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,390
it's called oblivious doe it takes

150
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,120
inspiration from the work on oblivious

151
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:29,280
DNS it allows you to proxy doe queries

152
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,130
in order to mask your client IP address

153
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,790
so that no one DNS server knows both

154
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:37,650
your IP address and your query content

155
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:39,360
picture kind of looks like this you have

156
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:42,180
one more hop in here but it gives you

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,890
really good privacy properties so that

158
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,170
creates a whole ecosystem around this

159
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,670
that we can hopefully improve DNS

160
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,189
privacy for everyone and have it be very

161
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:53,280
scalable and something that even the

162
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,720
local networks can participate in so if

163
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,579
you want to learn more about this or get

164
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,590
involved we're gonna be talking at the

165
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,300
ABCD Boff we're also going to be

166
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,100
presenting this work in more detail

167
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,099
about how the protocol works at deprive

168
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:07,020
we have two documents here and we also

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,690
have a github where we really welcome

170
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:12,449
any issues or pull requests that you

171
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:14,280
want to have get a discussion going we

172
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:17,790
want to solve this issue for operating

173
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,260
systems in general and anything we can

174
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:22,579
do to make this situation better we are

175
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:29,340
open to so please participate thank you

176
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:31,080
Thank You Tommy so let me just point out

177
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,090
that all the slides and contact

178
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:35,160
information are posted on the meeting

179
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,140
material site so if you want to download

180
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:40,680
anything for the contact to show up at

181
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:46,949
the stuff feel free all right

182
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,870
so Simon you the afternoon everyone my

183
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,750
name is - Anil I'm from Shanghai

184
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:54,270
University it's America I to be here to

185
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,660
share work with you our work is deadline

186
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:59,540
we're transport protocol as we all know

187
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:02,219
the entire Internet is becoming

188
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:04,560
real-time more and more applications as

189
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:06,840
deadline requirements for their data

190
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,650
transmission such as video conferencing

191
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:12,660
and cloud vr gaming the deadline of this

192
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,180
application can be divided into two

193
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,459
categories the first one is if the

194
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,750
application is push based then the

195
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,090
deadline means the one-way

196
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:25,690
anytime and if the application support

197
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:28,840
based then the deadline means the rtt

198
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:32,350
and those applications are transferring

199
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,110
data in block affection like the frame

200
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:38,770
in the video conferencing the block is

201
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:41,920
the minimal minimal processing units of

202
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:46,930
application and the deadline is also

203
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:50,199
means the block completion time this

204
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:52,199
these applications are early generating

205
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,040
and the transference transferring

206
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,260
multiple multiple blocks concurrently so

207
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:02,860
different blocks of different importance

208
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,500
to the user experience like in some

209
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:08,020
scenario of video conferencing the audio

210
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:11,950
data may be more important than the

211
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:14,439
video data however existing transport

212
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:18,190
protocol like support for these

213
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:21,970
transmission requirements even though

214
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:25,180
such some researchers has proposed the

215
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,680
deadline concept or in various protocols

216
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:32,739
like a CDP and some modified a TCP but

217
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,870
they have their problems the first first

218
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,570
one is that they are hard to deploy

219
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:39,940
second they are they have no

220
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:42,760
optimization for the deadline

221
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:45,280
transmission they may be just drop some

222
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,700
stale data and the third one is that

223
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:51,670
they like support for pool based

224
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:55,930
transmission as a result applications

225
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:59,229
are forced to to their own customized

226
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:02,160
the solutions like specified for video

227
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,380
conferencing these solutions are in

228
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,350
cross-layer fashions and these efforts

229
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:11,050
are very complex and redundant so we

230
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:14,380
need a transport protocol to provide a

231
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:17,349
deliver before deadlines device our

232
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:21,130
solution DTP spewed on top of quick and

233
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:24,280
is very easy to deploy it can rebuild

234
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:27,850
EDP both in transport layer and HTTP

235
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,589
layer and way TTP provides

236
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:32,509
block based the data transmission

237
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:35,220
instead of quick stream

238
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:39,389
application can mark their days how is

239
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:41,490
priority and the deadline parameters you

240
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:45,839
can see in the figure in the figure is

241
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:48,600
our architecture the EDP will schedule

242
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,329
block transmission order based on the

243
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,670
deadline priority and the natural

244
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:56,370
convention and it will also drop some

245
00:13:53,670 --> 00:14:00,719
low priority or still blocks if

246
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:03,449
necessary and we also apply redundancy

247
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,819
for some kill packets of a block to

248
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:08,219
about the transmission delay the

249
00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:10,759
congestion control is responsible for

250
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:15,089
controlling the RTT below the deadlines

251
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:18,120
and about we can talk about the

252
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:20,040
implementation of DDP later maybe after

253
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,319
just how to habit I have seen if you are

254
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,399
interested and then you can also refer

255
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:28,319
to our draft here is some part of our

256
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,980
evaluation results that we can talk

257
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:33,899
about it later if you are interested and

258
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,589
we are looking for some co-operators to

259
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:40,499
develop application based on the DDP and

260
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:42,779
do some for the job if you are

261
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:45,420
interested please catch me during this

262
00:14:42,779 --> 00:15:05,100
week or you know me at least advice and

263
00:14:45,420 --> 00:15:10,199
you can learn more about our Stephen

264
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:12,179
Christian is our next speaker ok so hi

265
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,459
everyone I am Steven from the university

266
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:16,290
of glasgow and together with mark who's

267
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:18,029
somewhere in the audience we've got a

268
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:20,160
couple of drafts are looking at formal

269
00:15:18,029 --> 00:15:21,470
languages and how they're used in the

270
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,879
IETF

271
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:25,980
so broadly what we want to try and do is

272
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,110
to use formal and structured languages

273
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:30,449
to improve the quality of the standards

274
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,920
that are produced at the ITF so want to

275
00:15:30,449 --> 00:15:33,269
either generate documents that are

276
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,550
written using formal and structured

277
00:15:33,269 --> 00:15:37,439
languages or we want to try and extract

278
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,719
structured elements from within the

279
00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:41,610
documents themselves and once we've done

280
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,799
that we can then use to link that can

281
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,850
maybe generate parser code for the

282
00:15:43,799 --> 00:15:47,079
protocol that's being specified

283
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,630
or approved properties about the

284
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:51,099
protocol or perhaps just generate the

285
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,779
examples that are within the document

286
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:56,230
from the document itself so that they're

287
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:57,490
consistent within the same document now

288
00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,190
the particular draft that I'm working on

289
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,560
is trying to describe machine readable

290
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:04,329
format for specifying the syntax of

291
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
protocol data units and for the most

292
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,649
part that looks very much the same as

293
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,600
the way we're specifying the format for

294
00:16:08,649 --> 00:16:13,600
binary protocols at the moment so we've

295
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,459
got a packet header diagram followed by

296
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,250
a sort of description list of each field

297
00:16:15,459 --> 00:16:19,089
that's in that packet header diagram and

298
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,279
essentially what the drafters trying to

299
00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:23,980
do is to bring some consistency to this

300
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,420
so if we all use the same format then we

301
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:27,670
can develop some tooling that can

302
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,259
extract these diagrams from the draft

303
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:31,660
and then we can start to do some

304
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,759
interesting things with that so first of

305
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:36,160
all we can do some sort of simple checks

306
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,440
a simple but effective check so we can

307
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,600
check that the diagram matches the

308
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,880
description list and quite often it

309
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,319
doesn't and perhaps we're interested in

310
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,290
whether we can maybe generate some

311
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:49,319
partial code from the definition of the

312
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,120
protocol itself

313
00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:53,500
no the draft that mark is working on is

314
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,779
quite different

315
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:58,000
so he's proposing that you write your

316
00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:01,120
internet drafts using asciidoc which is

317
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,880
a markdown variant and the same file as

318
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:06,520
that as your internet draft you then add

319
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,640
a formal description of the protocol

320
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:11,619
written in idris so with dependent and

321
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,630
linear types as I say this is Mark's

322
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,729
draft so if you have questions about

323
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:17,049
that you should ask him but what that

324
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,520
then gives you then is the ability to

325
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,349
generate an XML RFC v3 file that has

326
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,549
examples that are correct by

327
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:29,199
construction you have definitions and

328
00:17:27,549 --> 00:17:31,960
formal languages like a BNF that have

329
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,960
been verified and you get a formal proof

330
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:40,000
of that application of pastels law and

331
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:42,220
much more now we're aware that there's a

332
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,570
lot of other languages other formal

333
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:48,669
languages that are used in the ITF

334
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:49,960
things like yang or ABN F or C D DL and

335
00:17:48,669 --> 00:17:52,299
so beyond these sort of narrower

336
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,860
projects and drafts that we've got we

337
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:55,600
want to try and bring about a broader

338
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,939
discussion about the use of formal

339
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,219
languages in the ITF to do that we're

340
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,419
going to have an informal side meeting

341
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:04,149
we're going to have that on Thursday

342
00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:06,580
night it is a clock at the winery at

343
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:08,799
James that's just across the road from

344
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,049
the venue you could downstairs into the

345
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,580
courtyard if you're planning to come

346
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:14,740
along then send us an email and we'll

347
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:15,908
make sure we don't miss anyone and if

348
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,740
you're interested in the work but you

349
00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:19,870
can't come along again send us an email

350
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:24,549
I'm printers in the hallway and we'd

351
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:28,750
love to discuss it thank you Thank You

352
00:18:24,549 --> 00:18:30,269
Steven why not bug next speakers Philip

353
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,510
Helen Baker

354
00:18:30,269 --> 00:18:35,919
folks in the back here okay raise your

355
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:39,908
hand if you're having trouble hearing

356
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:43,500
the speaker not me I'm getting real

357
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:43,500
close okay so people are fine alright

358
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,940
hello I'm Phil ham Baker and I'm here to

359
00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:52,059
talk about the math mesh mathematical

360
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,630
mesh off tomorrow Monday morning first

361
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,629
thing

362
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:58,269
after breakfast so the objective of the

363
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:03,220
mesh is to make computers easier to use

364
00:18:58,269 --> 00:19:07,000
by making them more secure so use

365
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:09,970
security to make the process easier for

366
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,590
the user for a change and the basis for

367
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:14,950
this is that first of all we're going to

368
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:20,168
cryptographically connect together every

369
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:23,019
device that alice owns so that her her

370
00:19:20,169 --> 00:19:24,970
phone her tablet or laptop etc and all

371
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:26,980
our IOT devices all have a

372
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:30,340
public/private key pair on them and

373
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:34,210
we've got messages that can flow between

374
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:36,279
them to manage all that and so whenever

375
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:39,010
we want to set up a communication

376
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:41,980
between those devices or with another

377
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:45,940
party we've got the public and private

378
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:49,480
key there as the basis for to be able to

379
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:51,880
do that so there are three core problems

380
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,669
that we address in the mesh provision

381
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:56,409
the private keys of the device provide

382
00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:01,539
the means to obtain the corresponding

383
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:05,919
public key and to secure data at rest so

384
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:07,389
oh so security today what we have to do

385
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,539
is we've got a whole bunch of different

386
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:13,600
applications about SSH PGP and all that

387
00:20:10,539 --> 00:20:16,410
stuff and they're all silos

388
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,090
they're all law unto themselves and

389
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,900
security tends to fall down between the

390
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:25,209
cracks between applications we need to

391
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,120
be able to join all those applications

392
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,340
together into one security

393
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,639
infrastructure and the mesh is a

394
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:37,330
proposal for that infrastructure so what

395
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,730
we have here is a picture of the mesh in

396
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,449
the large and as you can see there are a

397
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:45,820
lot of moving parts there this is a

398
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:48,760
platform and it's architected as such

399
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:51,040
because you know I'm a systems guy so

400
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,470
the mash mesh itself is that green box

401
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,740
in the middle and that rests on three

402
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:59,770
core technologies UDF which is the

403
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:00,450
naming technology PGP fingerprints on

404
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:03,970
steroids

405
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:07,540
Deir which is a cryptographic message

406
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:11,230
syntax blockchain in Jason with

407
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:14,639
encryption and meta cryptography which

408
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:19,600
is a way of going beyond the crypto in

409
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,980
PGP and Bruce Schneier Bluebook yeah

410
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,860
most of us have been using the same

411
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,410
crypto for 25 years they developed a

412
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:28,870
whole load of stuff in the 90s that we

413
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,810
don't use here I want to start using

414
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:34,300
some of that and I'll be talking about

415
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:36,610
how we can do that in the buff so

416
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:38,470
there's a lot of stuff here and a lot of

417
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,290
applications that could be built on top

418
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:44,650
of it I've gotten the mesh for the

419
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:47,050
purposes of the buff and starting a

420
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,290
working group we're proposing to focus

421
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,810
on just warm and the one I'm proposing

422
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:56,170
that we start off with is providing a

423
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:59,409
end-to-end secure way of managing

424
00:21:56,170 --> 00:22:02,740
passwords so we provide an end-to-end

425
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:05,200
secure password vault on every machine

426
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,320
that the user has that is their

427
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:11,230
ubiquitously so they can start using

428
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:12,460
long and strong passwords because

429
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,330
they're going to be available on

430
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:20,160
everything that they're going to use so

431
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:23,710
we can get away from this problem and

432
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:26,680
you know you've all seen this

433
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:31,360
the problem here is the shortest

434
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:34,240
password that is secure is far longer

435
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:37,270
than any user could ever be expected to

436
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,810
learn and you cannot get round that with

437
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,100
any algorithm hack or whatever I can go

438
00:22:40,810 --> 00:22:42,730
through the math of why that's not

439
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,730
possible

440
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:55,120
we've got to get away from passwords and

441
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:55,930
the mesh provides a way to do that okay

442
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,449
thank you

443
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:08,230
so our next speaker is Samuel Marais did

444
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:10,720
I get that right sorry I tried so hello

445
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,900
I'm sorry from the federal University of

446
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:22,420
fugitive from the lab net and I'm going

447
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:35,260
to present you see on the nope look at

448
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:38,230
one point so I'm going to present my

449
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:42,129
proposal of extinction to the mother of

450
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:45,010
C so the problem is that the more FC is

451
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:47,320
not efficient against movin are given

452
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:51,460
our abilities this is not exactly a

453
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:55,600
problem because of mirth because they

454
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:58,120
are this is not the proposal but a new

455
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,270
vulnerability King can use a whitelist a

456
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:06,340
traffic by the mud and this needs a

457
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:08,770
femur or a mud update by the

458
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,439
manufacturer in the problem of the point

459
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:14,220
of a point of your security if that is

460
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,580
that we have only one point of failure

461
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,110
that is the manufacturer so distant can

462
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:24,250
take a long time to be done by the

463
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:27,040
manufacturer they may exist no more or

464
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:30,580
or can just decide do not fix the bug or

465
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:33,220
solve the problem so the good part and

466
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:36,040
the good part of the history is that the

467
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,960
security of the operation center every

468
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:40,670
time discover and school

469
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:43,460
affirmation about botnets and all the

470
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:46,490
vulnerabilities and we can use this

471
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:52,310
information the behavior of the botnet

472
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:56,750
or or vulnerability to protect ourselves

473
00:24:52,310 --> 00:25:00,710
and another important to stick holder in

474
00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:04,250
this part is the ISPs that has their

475
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,490
amended if being used by DDoS traffic

476
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:09,860
and other unwanted traffic and in the

477
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,290
other part of the stakeholders the end

478
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:16,129
user won't protect a security security

479
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:21,020
and privacy so the proposed extension is

480
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:24,050
chose to use they about vulnerabilities

481
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:28,280
in this case we are talking about

482
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:31,310
botnets and the data about botnet is

483
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:35,270
being collected by honey pots they see

484
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:38,590
this sock collect the data and process

485
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:42,680
and make a fire just like the mod file

486
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:45,050
but describing the in botnet network

487
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,670
communication between the botnet network

488
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:55,129
description and making available by AB

489
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:59,990
savage HT HTTP just like the mud server

490
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:03,800
and in the in the end user can use this

491
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:07,520
data can configure his home gateway to

492
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:11,750
consume this data and the home gateway

493
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,740
will match the botnet traffic and IOT

494
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:18,610
devices traffic to address the

495
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:23,240
vulnerabilities to the devices that are

496
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:26,620
exposed and in the critical case the

497
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:30,920
blocks or ask to the end users the

498
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:35,270
administrator of the network ask for a

499
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:38,360
block or an auto only alert so in the in

500
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:41,810
the end the the blocks are done and the

501
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:44,179
vulnerabilities are blocking so thank

502
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:46,220
you very much for the attention if you

503
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:50,090
have any question or interest on the

504
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:52,810
discussion this is my mouse and I'm here

505
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,810
by other week

506
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:05,840
Thank You Savior okay our next speaker

507
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:08,360
is Richard Lee thank you I'm Richard Lee

508
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:14,090
and thanks to Alan vulcanizing this

509
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:17,629
event is quite useful and so people are

510
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:20,720
always smart about the past sometimes

511
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,700
they are also smart about now it's very

512
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,100
dangerous to say something about the

513
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,300
future it's a big especially for

514
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:33,500
something as dynamic as unit and as

515
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:36,770
hugely scale as internet but fortunately

516
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:41,150
or unfortunately I'm now on that Angeles

517
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:43,190
zone now today is released so before I

518
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:46,250
talk about the future let's take a look

519
00:27:43,190 --> 00:27:47,840
a brief look at the kernel image so

520
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,600
Indonesia has been really really

521
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,060
successful but it's called hard it's

522
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:56,449
based on a few principles concepts and

523
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:59,290
technologies fundamentally it's based on

524
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:03,200
something called statistically

525
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:06,680
multiplexing so the major purpose is to

526
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,410
maximally utilize the link on the

527
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:13,610
protocol stack party it's evolving idea

528
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:16,790
today that's more or less capture their

529
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:19,340
corners like a protocol stack except in

530
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:23,740
POS its message the being sit somewhere

531
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:27,409
and internet is huge but it's built by

532
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,290
sweet switches and routers from these

533
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:33,440
switches and routers you can only expect

534
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,250
no more than we can three types of

535
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,070
capabilities

536
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,060
one is the effort that's the most

537
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:43,100
popular are mostly used and default

538
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,460
second tip serve especially for the some

539
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:49,459
like voice video applications you can

540
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,160
expect no more than a the classes of

541
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,980
services another one is chocolate

542
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:58,150
annealing in current it's based on

543
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:00,740
chapter stealing Express departs and

544
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:03,490
mean hi we can also provide some

545
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:07,210
guarantee

546
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:10,350
but not stupid and sometimes if your

547
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:14,260
needlework is broken can provide some

548
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:17,020
fast reload but if we look at history of

549
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:19,960
all the internet protocols you Caesar

550
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:21,610
the mostly use the particles are pretty

551
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,419
old it's only the more than one

552
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:28,870
generation for example like ipv4 is

553
00:29:25,419 --> 00:29:35,679
still a like you stay mostly used states

554
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:38,949
already 20 38 years even for ipv6 it's

555
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,929
only 24 years so it's all generation if

556
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,049
you have a baby and now it's already

557
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:46,240
public graduate from university so and

558
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:48,460
many people especially from academia

559
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,610
they are thinking can we do something

560
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:55,330
inside the network so that's about the

561
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,879
canary so and as I said earlier it's

562
00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:02,168
really predictable you know about some

563
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:05,860
saying the future he'll I mean ITT there

564
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:08,440
is a Folk School on nano work 2030 they

565
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:11,080
have worked the formal for one year or

566
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,130
so they have identified something and

567
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:18,960
this triad to summarize it the first one

568
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:22,529
is that very large volume and tiny

569
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,330
instant communications for example

570
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:28,149
holographic fiber communications and you

571
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:31,000
may or may not know that right now we

572
00:30:28,149 --> 00:30:35,709
are starting to deploy 5g one

573
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,159
application is air via a RV is next to

574
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:43,570
radio communication but what we will be

575
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:45,760
after a aria so people tend to agree the

576
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:49,450
holographic type of communications will

577
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,220
happen sooner or later and for example

578
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:54,429
we could have spotted something called a

579
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:58,179
holographic teleport so that we require

580
00:30:54,429 --> 00:31:01,299
really short latency and after meeting

581
00:30:58,179 --> 00:31:04,799
please ask me why the latency should be

582
00:31:01,299 --> 00:31:07,929
as low as like seven milliseconds and

583
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:09,610
also very large volume it will be a few

584
00:31:07,929 --> 00:31:21,670
hundred

585
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:28,629
oh okay thank you Richard our next

586
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:30,910
speaker is Liang King good evening

587
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,830
everyone i'm leon from china mobile and

588
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:36,670
i'm going to talk about computing first

589
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:40,149
networking today so i start with some

590
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:42,420
background so edge computing very very

591
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:45,580
popular nowadays and emerged by the

592
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,730
introduction of 5g cool network which

593
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,020
actually intrinsically supports this and

594
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,030
i'll start with some facts in china

595
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,970
mobiles we have more than six hundred

596
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:56,920
rows of CDN and those known can be

597
00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:59,200
upgraded to virtual at CDN which have a

598
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,910
common interaction layer and then

599
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,130
actually can naturally upgrade it to

600
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:07,090
edge computing nodes so we're talking

601
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:09,100
about from the city level to county

602
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:11,439
level and even to the unset level of the

603
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,870
infrastructure layer we are going to see

604
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,910
more than maybe tens of thousands or

605
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:18,330
maybe hundreds of thousands knows that

606
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:20,890
used to be only router based

607
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:24,159
infrastructure but nowadays is going to

608
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:26,280
be integrated router and then back to

609
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,310
back with some IT infrastructure

610
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,379
installed so the network original are

611
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,960
designed to optimize connectivities and

612
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:37,090
we treat cloud the data centers are

613
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,340
users of the network users of our

614
00:32:37,090 --> 00:32:41,740
connectivity but nowadays if we have the

615
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:43,600
district district the distributed manner

616
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,790
of edge computing deployed we're

617
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,560
actually talking about changing the role

618
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:50,080
of edge computing or cloud computing to

619
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:52,810
be the from the user of the network

620
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,280
becoming a part of the network so seeing

621
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,230
the characteristic of edge confusing

622
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,110
it's actually very limited in terms of

623
00:32:56,230 --> 00:33:02,260
resource and it requires heat or genius

624
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:03,969
require resource distributed because not

625
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:07,030
all the edge computing nodes can have

626
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:08,920
GPU or other Asics capabilities but some

627
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:11,350
of application really require that and

628
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:14,230
we have other requirements like we need

629
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:17,830
to dynamically distribute the traffic to

630
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:19,840
overcome the the outcome of the limited

631
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,030
resource caused by the edge computing

632
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,379
node so the question raised here is how

633
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:25,000
does the network

634
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,010
helped application to find the optimized

635
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,950
edge computer note and how does Network

636
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:33,820
help as computing knows to offload the

637
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:36,690
traffic so that's what siphon is

638
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:39,429
designed for so it actually designed to

639
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:42,040
be able to distribute computing resource

640
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,320
status across the network so we can use

641
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,750
that status to do habit routing habit

642
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,240
algorithm considering the computing

643
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,750
status and the network status together

644
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:54,730
so it helps at computing to provide

645
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:57,640
local insensitive equivalence services

646
00:33:54,730 --> 00:34:00,340
and dynamic traffic computing offloading

647
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:03,910
and also seamless switchover between

648
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:06,159
edge nose with flow affinity so we're

649
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:08,080
going to talk about this more in this

650
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:13,290
meeting and we have a site amazing holes

651
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:16,179
in the morning on Thursday in room VIP a

652
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:18,219
from starting from 8:30 so welcome to

653
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,110
join us and have a discussion and there

654
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:21,668
are three draft after the uploaded on

655
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,040
the website and if you're interested

656
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:26,080
have a look and if you have any further

657
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:28,149
information that you need further

658
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:32,659
information please don't not be hazarded

659
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:34,529
to cut me thank you very much thank you

660
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:46,090
[Applause]

661
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:48,940
next speaker is usually hello Joe I'm

662
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:51,820
going to talk about single slide only so

663
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:55,899
this this is about loops local

664
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:59,170
optimizations on path segments loops is

665
00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:02,890
sorry the the goal of looms is to

666
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,380
provide a local in network recovery over

667
00:35:02,890 --> 00:35:07,629
some specific segments to optimize the

668
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:12,570
packet delivery a very typical user

669
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:17,770
scenario is over the when there might be

670
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:21,220
multiple overlay segments and for

671
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:24,520
certain segments there are higher loss

672
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:28,209
compared to the others and it des

673
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,270
contributes to the overall loss most in

674
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:34,390
that case we possibly can provide a

675
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:37,030
so-called local in network recovery by

676
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:40,120
either retransmission or FEC

677
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:43,180
so we had above in last IDF meeting

678
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:46,839
there was quite a strong interest

679
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:50,049
showing that the standardization of the

680
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:55,090
work who was required so we are going to

681
00:35:50,050 --> 00:36:00,540
meet in in this meeting to discuss more

682
00:35:55,090 --> 00:36:03,760
detailed design issues well include the

683
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:06,340
encapsulations and the detailed

684
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:13,000
retransmission operations possibly

685
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:16,450
sketch FEC version then clearly outlined

686
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,910
the work to be done in loops so who

687
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:21,850
might be interested of course the

688
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:23,379
transport protocol designers in this

689
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:25,509
time because we are going to attach a

690
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:28,570
little bit more on the encapsulation so

691
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:30,790
Tunnel protocol designers and also the

692
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:34,900
FEC experts you are all welcome to join

693
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:39,070
us and the time will be on Tuesday

694
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:42,370
morning in the room Orchard there are

695
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:45,310
three drafts available so you can have a

696
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:52,029
review if you are interested so thank

697
00:36:45,310 --> 00:37:00,730
you thank you you can next speaking

698
00:36:52,030 --> 00:37:02,230
Sofia Sally Charlie okay hello my name

699
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:04,090
is Sofia celli and I'm going to present

700
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:09,420
you about the version 4 of the of the

701
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:09,420
record messaging protocol arm for this

702
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,840
okay so for this first one of the

703
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,360
questions that we are was actually

704
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:20,610
wanting to talk about is worthy of the

705
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,350
record messaging protocol is and what is

706
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:24,450
this basically this is the protocol that

707
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:26,580
provides into an encryption for users

708
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:28,620
who are having a conversation between

709
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,170
two participants and it was created in

710
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:33,450
2004 but Makita bodies of young golf and

711
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:35,310
an Eric Brewer and what it aim is to

712
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,439
give three important properties which

713
00:37:35,310 --> 00:37:39,210
was forward security and desiccation and

714
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,740
most importantly deniability

715
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:42,780
in the sense that what I said that he

716
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:44,759
wanted to provide into an encryption and

717
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:47,280
also to provide security in the case

718
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,260
that one of the long-term keys was

719
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,270
compromised he wanted to provide the

720
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,760
security that if it was compromised and

721
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,440
messages when exchanged in the past were

722
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,510
actually not compromised if one of the

723
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,640
keys was compromised and it also wanted

724
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,500
to provide the property of deniability

725
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,470
in the sense that there was no way to

726
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,540
create proof of authorship if someone

727
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:08,399
managed to compromise the conversation

728
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:10,890
but of course what he as I said was

729
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,930
created in 2004 and since there's a lot

730
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,450
of cryptographic things have happened a

731
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,549
lot of cryptographic properties and

732
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,259
definition have changed so that is why

733
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:23,460
we're creating the bastion for of this

734
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:24,990
cryptographic protocol as I said we are

735
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:26,880
doing the passion for of this protocol

736
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,859
because we wanted to obtain some of the

737
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,660
cryptographic primitives that were

738
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,880
previously done in the previous versions

739
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,460
of out here and what we wanted to do is

740
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,200
obtain the different properties at the

741
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,100
different different definition of

742
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,319
deniability

743
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:42,660
that the protocol had in the sense that

744
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,220
we wanted to update the definition the

745
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,410
durability as right now there's

746
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,439
different versions in the academic part

747
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:51,299
of cryptographic or how to define

748
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:53,100
deniability and we wanted to also update

749
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:55,080
the different cryptographic primitives

750
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:57,089
that were used and we also wanted to

751
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,670
update the protocol to new network

752
00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:02,760
models in which people were actually

753
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:04,590
wanted to have our online and offline

754
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,560
way of communicating so we wanted to

755
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,540
obtain of that so basically what out

756
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:11,580
here how it looks like is basically you

757
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:13,590
have a two participant communication as

758
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,120
I said in which Alice and Bob want to

759
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:17,160
talk to each other they would request to

760
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,569
have an OT up conversation that is

761
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:20,569
further a process in which they

762
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:22,760
authenticate each other in a Dinello

763
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:24,800
way by exchanging the long term keys and

764
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,750
also by generating a shared secret and

765
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,460
by then the eye shadow actually to

766
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:30,350
exchange the message in we teach each

767
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:32,390
other by using the lover ratchet and

768
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:34,130
using encryption keys that will be used

769
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,040
per message only so no keys will

770
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:38,960
actually be compromised so basically

771
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,400
right now what's the state of oti in it

772
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,110
special voice that we finish the

773
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,600
specification in the sense that we

774
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:46,880
finish the cryptographic specification

775
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,930
we are still doing an implementation on

776
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:50,060
C and in :

777
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,129
and some people are actually also doing

778
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:53,960
this implementation with Java and : and

779
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,970
some people are interested in doing of

780
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:58,700
actually doing an implementation once

781
00:39:55,970 --> 00:40:00,410
this shop what we want to do on what I

782
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:02,120
am presenting right now is that it will

783
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:03,920
be really interesting to have an RFC

784
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,319
there has been some interesting in the

785
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,390
past to do an RFC for previous version

786
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:11,150
of all ta v3 but we think that is very

787
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:14,299
important to actually do a passion for

788
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:17,150
of the RFC about here because this is

789
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:19,340
something that's Korean secure messaging

790
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:21,350
applications I actually based upon like

791
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,030
the signal protocol so actually having

792
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,339
an specification of the authorization

793
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:27,020
for in this current form would be

794
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:30,080
actually something very interesting for

795
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:31,670
the secure message in world if you want

796
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,430
to learn more please check out of repos

797
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,080
that you can see here and thank you very

798
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:38,120
much you can reach me on my Twitter

799
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,810
account or the Twitter account or vote

800
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,810
here thank you

801
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:49,490
Thank You Sofia okay

802
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:53,210
next speaker is Bob Moskowitz and Steve

803
00:40:49,490 --> 00:41:04,490
card well Bob brings his own staff

804
00:40:53,210 --> 00:41:06,050
excellent hi I'm Stu he's Bob so I'm

805
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:07,819
gonna motivate he's going to talk about

806
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,500
the work in the host identity protocol

807
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,750
to try to get the job done so

808
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,790
fundamental problem is gap between

809
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:15,410
physical space and logical space I see

810
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:16,759
an unmanned aircraft there I don't know

811
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:19,819
who it is I don't have any way to

812
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,740
contact the operator if some emergency

813
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:25,160
situation arises and I need to contact

814
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,540
the operator how can I do that so in the

815
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,460
United States the Federal Aviation

816
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:30,380
Administration is expected to propose a

817
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:32,270
rule next month other civil aviation

818
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,510
authorities in other countries are doing

819
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,160
the same

820
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:38,500
there was some work done in ASTM

821
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,660
International just last week we were

822
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,300
there they released their first version

823
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:43,810
of the standard it's good as far as it

824
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,210
goes

825
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:48,609
but it does not make the information

826
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:50,740
immediately actionable it doesn't make

827
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:52,240
it trustworthy it doesn't allow me to do

828
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:55,299
a one button press and get in contact

829
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,359
with the operator and so we're looking

830
00:41:55,300 --> 00:42:01,210
at taking various IETF standardized

831
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:03,310
protocols leveraging them to address

832
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:08,320
this application and I'll leave the

833
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:10,350
details to Bob what's needed here in

834
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,810
extremely constrained environment

835
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:16,330
Bluetooth 4 is a basic minimum bluetooth

836
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:19,060
for broadcast messages is the mineral

837
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:21,160
basis for the communication extremely

838
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:24,369
constrained message format extremely

839
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:25,930
constrained content what can we do we

840
00:42:24,369 --> 00:42:28,990
need to provide trust with the identity

841
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,940
to pair with physical location data it

842
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,580
turns out that the host identity tags

843
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:35,650
which are valid IP v6 dresses can be

844
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,859
used over this broadcast medium boot

845
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:42,160
Bluetooth to promote to provide provable

846
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:45,369
ownership by using the host identity for

847
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,710
the signatures give us full mobility and

848
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:49,300
multihoming

849
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:51,430
when we need to communicate directly to

850
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:54,190
the operator however we find where that

851
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:58,480
operator is just tell them please abort

852
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,760
your mission now timing on this can be

853
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,740
very very critical as drones these

854
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:05,470
things can move quickly in the airspace

855
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:07,720
or they may be hovering so secure

856
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,850
registration protocol is also needed to

857
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:12,850
be able to register the devices on a

858
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:15,640
first-come first owned the ID so that

859
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:18,540
you say I had this ID for this device it

860
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,220
may be long-lived the hobbyist has an ID

861
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,310
long-lived a delivery company may have

862
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:27,189
the ID for every single delivery mission

863
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:30,600
so that the people cannot observe to say

864
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:33,850
oh this is a UPS craft this is a of

865
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:37,150
Amazon craft so forth so we expect both

866
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:39,640
sorts of environments what we're doing

867
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,490
right now we have the US use case draft

868
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,020
which is out that's two authored and for

869
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,720
myself I bought through the hierarchal

870
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,920
hits draft as well as extension for the

871
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,290
the

872
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:51,700
raishin protocol as well as getting

873
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:53,290
together the new crypto we're going to

874
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:55,808
need for this lightweight environment

875
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:58,029
new in terms of what we've used but it's

876
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:02,020
NIST approved crypto stuff it's been out

877
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:04,900
for a little while I'm using a EDSA kmac

878
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:09,579
c-sharp see shake k AK while that's

879
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:12,010
waiting for the light crypto competition

880
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:14,650
to finish we're looking at actually

881
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:16,630
signing messages these broadcast

882
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,700
messages because there's no state these

883
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,339
are messages coming out on a broadcast

884
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:24,368
we had a hackathon on yesterday and

885
00:44:21,339 --> 00:44:27,130
today we made some progress Adams doing

886
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:28,720
some great work of coding and expect to

887
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:32,140
see him in the cold lounge to continue

888
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:34,569
working during the week while he can we

889
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:38,920
need to progress these drafts a lot more

890
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:42,040
testing both here and coming up stewing

891
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:43,599
and and Adam are located at the the

892
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,150
Griffiths Air Force Base or the old

893
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,510
Griffis base the UAS test site for the

894
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:51,910
FAA or they'll be doing testing there we

895
00:44:49,510 --> 00:44:54,069
need to lay as on with ASTM to get what

896
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,540
we're doing into there that the we're

897
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:58,049
expecting a Reb of their document

898
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:00,759
because the fa rulemaking we're hoping

899
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:03,250
we need to look at how we can get very

900
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:06,339
very tight objects working on these very

901
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:16,240
constraint requirements using c4 and the

902
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:27,549
rest Bob Susie thank you Bob okay our

903
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:30,479
next speaker is Paul Condon yes but the

904
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:32,829
microphone is on the fists down there so

905
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,760
but you can yeah you can stand up here

906
00:45:32,829 --> 00:45:39,280
if you want okay

907
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,079
I'm Paul Condon I've been talking about

908
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,059
data center congestion control the last

909
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:44,470
couple of us and I'm trying to find

910
00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:46,660
where's the best place where we can get

911
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,819
more interest more people more review of

912
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:50,890
our dress and development of them I

913
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:52,480
showed this picture last time but I

914
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:55,660
liked it so much I wanted to show it

915
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,380
again data center congest ins different

916
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,480
unique then the congestion we

917
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,420
experienced in the big I internet so

918
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,420
there's much difference delay bandwidth

919
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:11,010
different switches architectures the

920
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:13,420
networks are much more homogeneous

921
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:16,299
there's a lot of high-speed links with

922
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:19,210
compute and storage that's very in close

923
00:46:16,299 --> 00:46:21,309
proximity and the traffic profiles are a

924
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:24,010
little bit more predictable a little bit

925
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:25,809
more understood and there's typically

926
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,599
fewer people managing these things maybe

927
00:46:25,809 --> 00:46:30,910
even one set of people so the congesting

928
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,390
management can be different in a data

929
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:36,129
center so you know where should we

930
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,500
consider these things if you look at the

931
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,770
ICC RG we could say yep they're they're

932
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,299
Charter does mention data centers as a

933
00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:46,000
possible starter there they're often

934
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:48,040
quite full with their agenda all the

935
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:51,460
congestion work that standards track is

936
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:53,020
certainly going on in TS vwg but perhaps

937
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,549
maybe this is some of these topics or

938
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,309
research oriented so perhaps a new

939
00:46:54,549 --> 00:47:00,549
research group is worth it so let's talk

940
00:46:57,309 --> 00:47:01,869
about it we have some drafts to talk

941
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:04,299
about we have a side meeting that's

942
00:47:01,869 --> 00:47:05,920
coming up so a couple of the key

943
00:47:04,299 --> 00:47:09,130
questions that we're trying to answer

944
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:12,369
this time around what are needed from

945
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:15,460
NYX themselves to do better congestion

946
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:17,020
control there's a draft on an open open

947
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:19,720
congestion control framework where we

948
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:22,930
can negotiate capabilities in a more

949
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,250
open fashion and and try to determine

950
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,950
how the network and the NIC can work

951
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:28,900
together how can the network itself

952
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:30,609
actually participate in congestion

953
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:33,339
management in a different way or a more

954
00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:35,770
enhanced way one thought is about

955
00:47:33,339 --> 00:47:38,980
configuring that parameters are very

956
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:41,710
complicated so can we use AI in a way to

957
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,990
help model that there's a draft on that

958
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,390
and

959
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:46,220
of course shortcutting the whole control

960
00:47:44,390 --> 00:47:50,029
loop could could really reduce some of

961
00:47:46,220 --> 00:47:52,279
the reduce some of the delay in getting

962
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,650
congestion and pressure on some of our

963
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:56,180
buffers so there's a fast feedback draft

964
00:47:54,650 --> 00:47:58,369
as well there's some other interesting

965
00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,049
topics like maybe should we be measuring

966
00:47:58,369 --> 00:48:01,940
things differently in the data center as

967
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:06,080
well so we have a couple of drafts to

968
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:09,050
review discuss join us we have a non

969
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:11,630
working group mailing list our DMA CC we

970
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:15,890
you can subscribe to that and we have a

971
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:18,800
side meeting on Tuesday morning and VIP

972
00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:26,020
a so look forward to following on with

973
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:26,020
these discussions okay thank you Paul

974
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:35,569
our next speaker Nicholas Hart

975
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:39,680
ooh Nicholas I'm noticing you 16 sides

976
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:41,420
and four minutes so good luck sixteen

977
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:45,250
slides in four minutes which button is

978
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:49,040
the forward button it's the right arrow

979
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:49,490
that's it yeah yeah okay I'll go real

980
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,650
quick

981
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:57,350
I won't a very lightweight I'm an

982
00:48:54,650 --> 00:49:00,500
academic closer at length on they can't

983
00:48:57,350 --> 00:49:03,980
hear you can you hear me near-field

984
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:05,869
start the clock again my name is Nick

985
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,450
Hart I'm from England from Lancaster

986
00:49:05,869 --> 00:49:10,600
University I'm an academic I'm a

987
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,779
researcher I'm not your PhD student

988
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:13,220
anyway

989
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:15,109
I'm going to talk about the later people

990
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:18,319
approach me I just gonna give you some

991
00:49:15,109 --> 00:49:21,759
ancient history the academic view of my

992
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,340
topic which is something that God called

993
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:26,810
RCP route control processing what I

994
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,190
mentioned doing automating BGP

995
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:30,170
programmable internet routing is what

996
00:49:28,190 --> 00:49:32,420
I'm calling it in the academic world we

997
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:33,260
see that nothing really has changed for

998
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:35,180
maybe a decade

999
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:36,920
I feel confident that's not the case and

1000
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,569
the reason I'm here tonight is to invite

1001
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,310
people to come up and tell me what it is

1002
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:43,880
that we on the academic side don't get

1003
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:45,890
so this is what we see so in 2004

1004
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,690
someone came up with a bright idea that

1005
00:49:45,890 --> 00:49:49,190
you could invent a a God box that would

1006
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,380
take control of an entire transit

1007
00:49:49,190 --> 00:49:53,720
network you'd flip all of the bgp

1008
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:55,040
connections all the AI all the internal

1009
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,509
ibgp mesh onto

1010
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,880
this box and of course if the box went

1011
00:49:56,510 --> 00:50:00,530
down your network went down this was the

1012
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,990
kind of academic idea of how to make

1013
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:05,300
networks better um needless to say this

1014
00:50:02,990 --> 00:50:07,009
didn't fly this next slides from the

1015
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,480
same paper and I'm putting that up

1016
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:10,760
because I'm gonna come back later on and

1017
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,790
add my overlay to it to make it show how

1018
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:15,140
I can hopefully make a network change to

1019
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,180
where we want it to be without it having

1020
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,890
to take it apart first from the same

1021
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,990
paper that their idea was to stage

1022
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:22,549
firstly they take the god box in the

1023
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,439
middle but the god box wouldn't talk to

1024
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,380
the external peers who just talked at

1025
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:28,670
internal once but still brace the mesh

1026
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:30,590
the second idea which is really the

1027
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:34,850
first slide is that they basically take

1028
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:35,990
control of everything i RS CP same idea

1029
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:37,580
a bit better

1030
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:39,350
they've got route reflectors in there

1031
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,230
and this one's interesting because it's

1032
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:44,930
non intrusive but in fact that doesn't

1033
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:47,240
do much more than just optimize IDP

1034
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:49,069
paths which is pretty much what you can

1035
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,419
do without that art solution when they

1036
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,590
want to do anything brilliant then they

1037
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,960
take over and you'll see the big black

1038
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:56,030
lines are just physical links there data

1039
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:57,770
paths not control inks so that's the

1040
00:50:56,030 --> 00:50:59,000
world that the academics still live in

1041
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:00,980
there's been no real change in that

1042
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:02,390
there's another slide here all these

1043
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,580
people doing there's people like

1044
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,170
Jennifer Rexford from Princeton and a

1045
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:09,279
whole bunch of people from AT&T wrote

1046
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:11,750
this stuff twelve fourteen years ago so

1047
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,700
so my take on this is that cannot be the

1048
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:16,460
end of it why did this not go anywhere

1049
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,919
and so I kind of tried to encapsulate

1050
00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,480
why that didn't work and I think the

1051
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,640
problem was going back in in those days

1052
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,830
you couldn't get enough external routing

1053
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,400
State without without breaking into the

1054
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:28,040
ebgp

1055
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:29,480
feeds so the first question is how can

1056
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,160
you do that and I think we can solve

1057
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:32,600
that today there's it's no secret how

1058
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:33,980
are we going to do that and then the

1059
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:35,540
second question which they didn't really

1060
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,160
address is if they knew that they could

1061
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,390
do something better how would they

1062
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,310
actually push that into the network

1063
00:51:38,390 --> 00:51:42,080
without again breaking the mesh so those

1064
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:43,610
are the two two sides of it the third

1065
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:45,140
piece is how do you know what it is you

1066
00:51:43,610 --> 00:51:48,710
want to do but for me that's a different

1067
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,600
problem so here's the strategy and this

1068
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:52,550
is so simple I kind of feel like people

1069
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:54,950
must be doing this but on the academic

1070
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,570
side we don't see it so to get that

1071
00:51:54,950 --> 00:51:59,029
external routing state you can either

1072
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,740
look at BMP the problem BMP is some

1073
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:03,050
implementations seem not to be reliable

1074
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:04,729
but some ad path seems pretty much up to

1075
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:06,080
the task and most of them the route is

1076
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:08,150
out there if the border routers can do

1077
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,900
that today and the second solution and

1078
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:11,090
I've already heard tonight

1079
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:13,040
people say yeah we do that but but we

1080
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:14,390
don't know this on academic side is just

1081
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:16,040
pick the second best route and push it

1082
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:18,770
out there with higher preference um

1083
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,570
not difficult I thought about trying to

1084
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:23,660
extend BGP but that's not a bright idea

1085
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:25,520
not unless you remember the ITF so

1086
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:26,779
here's my diagram so that was the one I

1087
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,060
put up at the beginning and there's the

1088
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:30,950
mesh my blue path is me pulling into my

1089
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,870
god box all of the additional path

1090
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:34,339
information and the second piece is

1091
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:35,750
pushing it back out again by just

1092
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,850
sending routes with high local

1093
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:39,560
preference all of this sounds really

1094
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:41,120
simple and I'm looking forward to people

1095
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,759
telling me that actually I'm just behind

1096
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:45,980
the times or I'm crazy and it doesn't

1097
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,770
work for the following reason but any of

1098
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:56,960
that input would be truly welcome so I'm

1099
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:58,580
new to the IGF I don't interact NIC

1100
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,380
since this is your first IETF meaning

1101
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:02,720
take one moment and tell people how they

1102
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:05,660
should if they want to collaborate with

1103
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:07,609
you how should they reach you um my

1104
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:09,980
accent is unique so you'll spot me on

1105
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,430
the dance floor my email address is

1106
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:12,680
there

1107
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:15,410
I'd love to suggest a bar a bar meeting

1108
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:17,270
but I don't know where to go so maybe

1109
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,680
somebody will take you to a bar I'll be

1110
00:53:17,270 --> 00:53:20,630
I'll be in the routing group meeting

1111
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,549
work so hopefully if there's anyone out

1112
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,890
there can tell me more than they will I

1113
00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:28,010
thank you much thank you our next

1114
00:53:24,890 --> 00:53:29,270
speaker is Mauro I'm not even gonna try

1115
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:35,960
your last name or because I'm gonna

1116
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:41,330
butcher it so I apologize in advance did

1117
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:43,670
the microphone okay my name is Mauro

1118
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:50,660
coach Elia and come from Italy Takumi

1119
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:54,920
Talia explicit in band measurement is

1120
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:57,620
the topic of this short speech the first

1121
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:03,220
case of a special measurement is the

1122
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:06,770
spin beat spin beat is a RTT measurement

1123
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:09,049
it is implemented on quic protocol the

1124
00:54:06,770 --> 00:54:11,810
spin beat idea is to create a square

1125
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:15,710
wave signal on the data flow using a

1126
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,240
beat whose length is equal to L tt an

1127
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:19,910
observer in the middle

1128
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,580
whatever is located that can measure the

1129
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:26,930
end-to-end ITT only measuring the line

1130
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:29,569
on the square wave the new idea that we

1131
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:31,940
propose is the round-trip packet loss

1132
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:35,840
measured on production traffic between

1133
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:38,330
client and server how it works the

1134
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,150
client makes a train of production

1135
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:44,270
packets using the packet loss bit and

1136
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:46,490
these market packets bounces between

1137
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:50,300
client and server to complete the two

1138
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:52,790
rounds between client and server client

1139
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:54,920
and server reflects market packets by

1140
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,230
marking production packets flowing in

1141
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,630
the opposite direction a new server

1142
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:03,050
comes to the market packets during the

1143
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:06,320
two rounds and comparing the numbers can

1144
00:55:03,050 --> 00:55:08,720
measure the feet de los ISM the main

1145
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:12,260
problem is the different speed between

1146
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:15,589
the two direction upload the download so

1147
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:17,840
we use a token system to have the same

1148
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:24,890
speed of market packets in the two

1149
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:26,900
direction okay how it works the client

1150
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:29,000
generate the Train of market packets

1151
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:32,420
using the packet was beat the server

1152
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,460
reflects these packets the client

1153
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:38,510
reflects the market packs again and the

1154
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:43,150
server again reflects so we completed

1155
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:47,480
two two rounds between client s error

1156
00:55:43,150 --> 00:55:53,540
not all the packets are market maybe you

1157
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:57,290
can see this is the opposite case when

1158
00:55:53,540 --> 00:56:00,100
the speed is different is more in one

1159
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:05,210
direction towards the other direction

1160
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:09,560
okay the server the server is put in the

1161
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:12,140
middle he can only count the pockets the

1162
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:15,220
pockets of the first train is compared

1163
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:18,640
to the parts of the second train so the

1164
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:21,950
packet loss is statistically measured

1165
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:24,440
statistica's because is the round-trip

1166
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:27,350
is between the server and not between

1167
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:31,270
the client and the server but status is

1168
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:31,270
the main things the same things

1169
00:56:36,339 --> 00:56:42,920
how to know more we have an academy

1170
00:56:39,859 --> 00:56:47,770
quick measurement and spin damper in

1171
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:52,660
cooperation with Erickson the draft was

1172
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:57,710
presented will be presented in a TS w

1173
00:56:52,660 --> 00:57:01,098
meeting Thursday and tomorrow we will be

1174
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:03,740
present in the academia P our with the

1175
00:57:01,099 --> 00:57:08,690
spin dump demo the mailing list is

1176
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:12,649
possible to use the t SW g many lists or

1177
00:57:08,690 --> 00:57:17,050
dial it may - as a maraca cheerio fabula

1178
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:37,520
europe if your color and ricardo system

1179
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:40,760
tomorrow okay so this connected to

1180
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,540
Tommy's first talk in the beginning so

1181
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:47,480
in the IETF IRT F we have gotten used to

1182
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:51,020
using the term considerations for

1183
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:52,339
something well that is actually what we

1184
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,839
haven't really thought enough about in

1185
00:57:52,339 --> 00:57:55,660
the beginning but actually turned out to

1186
00:57:53,839 --> 00:58:00,080
be very important for example like

1187
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:03,980
security human rights perhaps and so

1188
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:07,580
this is another say topic that I think

1189
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:12,710
it's very important so well the tussle

1190
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:15,348
between internally control points and

1191
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:19,609
the issue of conciliation and

1192
00:58:15,349 --> 00:58:22,670
centralization so after the well in the

1193
00:58:19,609 --> 00:58:25,400
post Snowden area our response to the

1194
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:31,040
emulation was okay we have to rethink

1195
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:35,540
our stance on encryption and and privacy

1196
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:38,900
and basically made a decision okay that

1197
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:40,640
we want to ramp up our so encryption

1198
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:45,800
work we've so we knew before it's

1199
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,879
terribly important but so we improve TLS

1200
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:49,730
we are doing things

1201
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,010
quick for example so in also defending

1202
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:54,710
this against a lot of criticism so very

1203
00:58:52,010 --> 00:58:56,900
important work on the other hand we know

1204
00:58:54,710 --> 00:59:00,350
that in there are other problems that

1205
00:58:56,900 --> 00:59:06,040
are be concerned so so surveillance

1206
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:11,150
based economies platforms attract users

1207
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:13,520
all across the web and so at some point

1208
00:59:11,150 --> 00:59:15,320
it's even the case that the technology

1209
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,660
that we are producing to for example

1210
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,940
protect the users against on past

1211
00:59:17,660 --> 00:59:22,759
attacks where I could actually be used

1212
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:25,130
against the users in some circumstances

1213
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:30,580
so for example well we can protect the

1214
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:33,190
say connection the channel from on pass

1215
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:35,720
surveillance but it doesn't keep

1216
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:38,810
platforms of course from you know

1217
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:41,830
collecting profile data trading this and

1218
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:43,910
even even trading this was say

1219
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:49,130
instituting that I actually on the pass

1220
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:52,069
so we all are aware of that and so we

1221
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:54,530
have started to react to this so we are

1222
00:59:52,070 --> 00:59:56,780
rethinking or in enlarging the the

1223
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:58,340
threat model we are kind of trying to

1224
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:01,040
establish some principles so what it

1225
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:03,530
means to develop technology for the user

1226
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,860
we are rethinking is there something

1227
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:11,360
wrong with our technology perhaps and so

1228
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:13,760
I'm I want to invite you to say a bit

1229
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:16,580
broader discussion on this topic so to

1230
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:19,280
look at the the bigger picture

1231
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:21,620
so some of these problems they're not

1232
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,970
caused by internet technologies per se

1233
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:25,100
so that you have to understand and say

1234
01:00:22,970 --> 01:00:28,069
how the web works how the economy works

1235
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:30,259
in that space so we talk a lot about you

1236
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:33,770
know consolidate Conservation Center is

1237
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:37,490
Asian recently of course you know some

1238
01:00:33,770 --> 01:00:40,880
some particular topics that create quite

1239
01:00:37,490 --> 01:00:44,060
some sensation but I think it's really

1240
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:45,950
important that we try to take a step

1241
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:48,680
back and try to see the bigger picture

1242
01:00:45,950 --> 01:00:50,810
so what role are we playing what role is

1243
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:53,210
our technology stack playing in the

1244
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:56,420
bigger system so consider technical and

1245
01:00:53,210 --> 01:00:58,310
economic factors so one topic here for

1246
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,680
example is control points in the network

1247
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:02,990
so of course we don't like

1248
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:05,629
the ship on the other hand we need some

1249
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:08,868
control points so right now some of

1250
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:10,730
other technologies I used in a ideal way

1251
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:14,569
so DNS for example is used a lot to

1252
01:01:10,730 --> 01:01:16,910
implement control so there's something

1253
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:19,670
that we can probably improve there also

1254
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,420
when we say for the user so what does it

1255
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:22,640
actually mean

1256
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:25,460
so from an application they provide our

1257
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:27,200
developer perspective we say actually we

1258
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,700
cannot trust the infrastructure the

1259
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,009
underlying network the underlying

1260
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:44,689
operating system on the other hand we

1261
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:46,730
could can the user has anybody seen an

1262
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:50,930
unattended laptop nearby there appears

1263
01:01:46,730 --> 01:01:55,430
to be one missing okay Nick seems to

1264
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:56,808
have misplaced his laptop sorry Nick

1265
01:01:55,430 --> 01:02:01,430
it's probably around here somewhere

1266
01:01:56,809 --> 01:02:11,150
everybody else has one our next bigger

1267
01:02:01,430 --> 01:02:15,589
is Jake Holland Jake Jake really

1268
01:02:11,150 --> 01:02:18,770
Oh laptop sound excellent but speaker or

1269
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:20,119
not okay moving right along maybe we'll

1270
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:37,520
come back to Jake

1271
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:39,770
next speaker David Oliver last year so

1272
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:42,650
these are lightning talks but I'm going

1273
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:45,079
to TLDR the TLDR for you since I'm at

1274
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:47,059
the very end we've been working in a in

1275
01:02:45,079 --> 01:02:49,309
an area called pluggable transports

1276
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:51,470
where we're we're trying to provide

1277
01:02:49,309 --> 01:02:53,390
solutions for people who are subject to

1278
01:02:51,470 --> 01:02:56,089
pervasive monitoring and surveillance

1279
01:02:53,390 --> 01:02:57,740
and and censorship and we've been

1280
01:02:56,089 --> 01:03:00,890
working on this for quite a while and

1281
01:02:57,740 --> 01:03:03,709
and for five six years now and and so

1282
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:06,290
we're interested in in what's coming and

1283
01:03:03,710 --> 01:03:08,960
what's going how active the sensors are

1284
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:10,430
and how active our community is and and

1285
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,069
we're looking at a couple new issues

1286
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:14,450
that have that arise now that much work

1287
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:19,040
has been done and things are

1288
01:03:14,450 --> 01:03:20,660
constantly changing so we've at this IEF

1289
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:23,720
we've been doing work on usability

1290
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:25,670
related issues that how users see these

1291
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,049
technologies come out and how they try

1292
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,750
to integrate them in the work that they

1293
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:32,540
do and then we're also looking here to

1294
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:35,780
the future a little bit on how we use

1295
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:38,630
how the devices that we use can help can

1296
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:40,810
help in making these technologies these

1297
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:43,579
transport technologies these these

1298
01:03:40,810 --> 01:03:47,150
circumvention technologies more usable

1299
01:03:43,579 --> 01:03:49,670
and more efficient so here's a brief

1300
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:51,140
update on the status of some of the

1301
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:53,869
pluggable transports that have been

1302
01:03:51,140 --> 01:03:56,990
developed and used over the last number

1303
01:03:53,869 --> 01:03:58,430
of years some of these have some not

1304
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:00,140
mentioned here sort of fallen by the

1305
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:02,629
wayside these are the ones that are

1306
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:05,779
still active that provide different

1307
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:09,260
sorts of technologies to avoid evade

1308
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:10,760
censorship one of the biggest problems

1309
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,770
that we now have with so many

1310
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:15,170
technologies in the in the field is

1311
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:16,820
reaching a network peer that understands

1312
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:20,270
the kind of communication you're trying

1313
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,950
to do and so how users understand how to

1314
01:04:20,270 --> 01:04:24,890
interact with bridges with these

1315
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:26,868
communications bridges is a big problem

1316
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:29,660
and we're working on user experience

1317
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:31,579
solutions for that how you select and

1318
01:04:29,660 --> 01:04:33,470
find the right bridge at rendezvous with

1319
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:35,300
it and then lastly which form a

1320
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:39,250
pluggable transport you need for the

1321
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:41,569
kind of surveillance regime you're in

1322
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:44,390
this machine learning stuff is really

1323
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:46,250
brand new it becomes stems out of some

1324
01:04:44,390 --> 01:04:48,920
work that's being done by a larger group

1325
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,900
who monitor how these technologies are

1326
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:52,520
used in in the field we're sort of

1327
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:55,430
mobile device experts so we're

1328
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:58,040
interested in how mobile devices can can

1329
01:04:55,430 --> 01:05:01,520
help us in in this effort but also do so

1330
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:04,190
in a privacy-preserving way we've

1331
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:06,319
involved in a little hackathons thing

1332
01:05:04,190 --> 01:05:09,470
today working on setting up an

1333
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:11,930
environment to start doing more research

1334
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:12,439
in in in the user experience with these

1335
01:05:11,930 --> 01:05:15,919
things

1336
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:18,260
we'll be at that at the hackathon happy

1337
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,140
hour hack demo happy hour here tomorrow

1338
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:23,210
night you can come over and see us our

1339
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:26,750
work is encapsulated on a nice website

1340
01:05:23,210 --> 01:05:27,480
called pluggable transports info and we

1341
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:29,400
do have an

1342
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:31,950
draft out there that starts to talk

with who is running a some sort of a

1354
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:06,589
test a bit for the blockchain technology

1355
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:09,330
and I'm I'd like to briefly update that

1356
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:22,340
discussion on the synthetic our finest

1357
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:27,000
technology and could you try this yes so

1358
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:28,920
today you deploys a decentralized that

1359
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,420
finest technology if you need to be

1360
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:33,900
involved to create a healthy ecosystem

1361
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:36,330
for cetera as finance or like is a lady

1362
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:38,550
a question and there are many people

1363
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:39,630
need to be involved to discuss how it is

1364
01:06:38,550 --> 01:06:45,740
implemented

1365
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:48,930
and interesting thing was happen

1366
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:52,009
decided I was shown in the last IT

1367
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:55,649
airside meeting I have allowed to have

1368
01:06:52,010 --> 01:07:00,060
along side of you that is doing all the

1369
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:04,140
I any such group and interesting is that

1370
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:07,140
on the g20 it is trends to discuss about

1371
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:12,049
this in the ITF but deep at the g20

1372
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:16,470
meeting the league leaders agreed that

1373
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:18,510
just playing early elected things do not

1374
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:22,649
work they realize that and that they

1375
01:07:18,510 --> 01:07:25,260
need to communicate with some other

1376
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:27,660
stakeholders included tech community to

1377
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:29,460
how to implement the decentralized

1378
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:32,368
technology that is a little interesting

1379
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,080
sec i think so

1380
01:07:32,369 --> 01:07:36,270
the their focus is of course the

1381
01:07:34,080 --> 01:07:37,950
consumer protection and the prevention

1382
01:07:36,270 --> 01:07:41,160
of the use of the technology for the

1383
01:07:37,950 --> 01:07:43,680
criminal activity or whatever so we have

1384
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:46,470
we need to respond to these activities

1385
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:49,230
so last four months since the last I

1386
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:51,799

01:07:49,230 --> 01:07:54,089
workshops including a DFA workshop at

1388
01:07:51,799 --> 01:07:56,549

1392
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:07,589
what's going on and what we want to do

1393
