1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:14,500
thank you and we should be another one

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,500
careful Reeves taker

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,020
you

4
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,750
Oh

5
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:57,570
I said we did a mistake and you want

6
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:57,570
here but okay anybody else also enter

7
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:07,030
sure thank you and speaking also

8
00:01:04,089 --> 00:01:12,670
supposed to the unit content and all the

9
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:21,940
slides already uploaded interior of a

10
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:29,380
PSP this is publicly shared polishing

11
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:39,039
and Harris this is a meeting at Inga we

12
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:41,470
have the 720 key trade and first the SAT

13
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:47,470
of Monaco and to plan that's the working

14
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:51,489
with token image update the second is

15
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:56,140
grasp it I also the working of cooking

16
00:01:51,489 --> 00:02:01,509
the young church will be added for the

17
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:03,360
new chatter town square and then that's

18
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:21,900
the information dissipation in

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:27,160
augmentation and ASA environment and you

20
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:30,660
know what we what we need and I have

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:41,050
your size oh sorry yeah okay good okay

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:44,790
thank you yeah and then we have the

23
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,790
issue for the agenda today

24
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:54,690
once right okay and that's the cleaned

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,970
up at the world I will mark and Rashad

26
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:05,030
and played for the working group now

27
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:15,209
stories we have a after copy but three

28
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:22,260
for the they s a p-trap to already

29
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:33,840
submit or ISP homes and we still have

30
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:38,548
one single discard and also brass key is

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:44,069
already on the circus where she and

32
00:03:38,549 --> 00:03:48,780
still have to discuss hopefully we could

33
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:51,569
you know fish that onyx neatness Oh

34
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,359
because eternally for press key we

35
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:58,018
actually has to finish that before we

36
00:03:54,359 --> 00:04:02,220
can really process the lots following up

37
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:07,349
work and then we have the cross a guy

38
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:11,690
about twitter twitter we article then

39
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:16,978
that one is I believe which state

40
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:20,820
impurity a working group stage and we

41
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:26,700
have a constraint virtual adopt last

42
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,300
year and all these tapes which we could

43
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:33,889
ship

44
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:36,759
okay okay so we are into the

45
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:36,759
first

46
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,500
which

47
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:57,149
these folks

48
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:23,430
no the case is this never cannot turn

49
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:23,430
out the what we were uploaded

50
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:13,820
that's a pro week Pete

51
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:42,380
all right welcome to the neverending ACP

52
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:47,700
token so in ITF 105 basically we updated

53
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:52,020
the ACP document to version 20 and at

54
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:54,740
that point in time there was the video

55
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:59,580
from the security Directorate

56
00:07:54,740 --> 00:08:01,740
outstanding and the the Jen art was also

57
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:05,550
not closed so that was an oversight by

58
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:07,500
Alicia so that was closed and then I try

59
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:09,960
to work with the remaining discusses

60
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,060
from Bankhead book and he also taken

61
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:16,710
over the review of I referred all her

62
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:19,320
the other security AE but I hadn't

63
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,830
received any any response after I hear

64
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:28,290
from him so there were some delay on his

65
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:31,530
side pin I had in 20 in the feedback set

66
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:34,890
there were 2 discussion points left open

67
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:39,390
from my side that I had to do I try to

68
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:42,480
answer them in 21 which I posted before

69
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:46,620
the deadline for IKEA on 6 didn't so the

70
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:49,770
first one is one that we discuss also in

71
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:53,910
IKEA 105 and that was the use of RCA 22

72
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:57,079
address as the object to encode ACP

73
00:08:53,910 --> 00:09:00,949
information in the ACP certificate and

74
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:03,990
basically after the discussion in 105

75
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,880
the conclusion from the working with C 2

76
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:08,250
has been met with one stick with this

77
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,040
because it had shown all the benefits

78
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,530
now I'll get back to that point at the

79
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,230
little bit later and then I try to close

80
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:19,020
all the open encryption detail gaps and

81
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:22,260
that's basically what's in SS 21 I

82
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:25,680
wanted to quickly go through those so

83
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:30,450
basically in the ACP certificates there

84
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,250
were a lot of updates me reading through

85
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,820
a lot of documents trying to ensure that

86
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:38,380
we have the right requirement

87
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:40,240
about RSA and EC BH support in these

88
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,150
certificates and ultimately the

89
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,240
high-level gist of the requirements is

90
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,310
as little as possible but also that we

91
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,140
can leverage the new technology so we

92
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:51,959
must do RSA because it's still more

93
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:55,000
widely used and the latest standards

94
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:59,410
security track RFC's are referred to

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:02,080
also are asking for RSA as a mess ec th

96
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,880
would be better because it achieves you

97
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:08,620
know with shorter key links the same

98
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:11,650
security but we would reasonably only be

99
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,300
able to do it in networks where the

100
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,949
certificates are only used within the

101
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,050
ACP so that you know that all the

102
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:19,180
devices would be able to support it so

103
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,979
it's not widely enough spread if we

104
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:23,650
wanted you to use these certificates for

105
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,080
other authentication like applications

106
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:27,910
running within the ACP so and that's

107
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,010
basically what the text says in so many

108
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,620
words and all these magical details

109
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,300
likely elliptic curve sizes and all that

110
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,190
stuff was hopefully correctly stolen

111
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,120
from other RFC's that are at upcountry

112
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:42,250
and the feedback from them in verbally

113
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:47,590
when I mention here seem that this is

114
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:49,630
fine 6:7 security associations simply

115
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:54,580
added that we must have a perfect

116
00:10:49,630 --> 00:11:00,330
forward security and also everyone know

117
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:03,100
about the fact that we made for go

118
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:05,890
actually encryption in the secure

119
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,260
channel protocol is a secure channel is

120
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,880
defined to leverage underlying layer 2

121
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:12,670
security Association like for example

122
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,550
mexic and then the secure channel itself

123
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:18,040
might only be required for the

124
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:21,420
authentication and the derivation of the

125
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:24,160
underlying layer 2 encryption function

126
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,500
so in that of course would avoid us to

127
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:32,170
duplicate encryption efforts that were

128
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:35,670
already doing it air 2 and so now I have

129
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,670
a two person I think

130
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:54,130
so so then also um TLS for brat so that

131
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:57,160
was not specified in before and then

132
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:59,140
being the expert on TLS suggested some

133
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,870
specific profiles of which I selected

134
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:07,420
also the minimum hopefully equally a

135
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:14,440
sufficient subset in support of also AES

136
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:16,750
and then our RSA and EC DHA GCM wala

137
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,060
counter mode also is known to be better

138
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,310
so basically because we don't have

139
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:24,189
backward compatibility needs for graphs

140
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:25,869
with all the new it's it's hopefully

141
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,470
sufficient to have the very small things

142
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:34,360
other details also stolen from other

143
00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:36,370
typical security documents so but kind

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,850
of to me sounded good but then when I

145
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:41,649
looked at the process I kind of woke up

146
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:42,010
to learning something new that I didn't

147
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,519
like

148
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:48,010
so the ihe reviewers we had since I - 13

149
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,959
is are listed here right so originally

150
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:52,810
the document was own factor in Anderson

151
00:12:49,959 --> 00:12:56,529
and then we had all these survey used

152
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:59,500
from the iesg members listed there and

153
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,060
the problem is that the process I didn't

154
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:03,760
understand and that seemingly all -

155
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:07,329
nobody else you know was actively

156
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,089
working on is that when an isg member

157
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:11,170
leaves the isg his vote for the count

158
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,540
turns into a pumpkin

159
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:16,569
so it's uncounted anymore so the total

160
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:18,969
number of reviews we need is not reached

161
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:21,670
anymore and besides we would have also

162
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:25,570
needed a new owner beside karim anderson

163
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:27,339
or kind of casting the guest vote and

164
00:13:25,570 --> 00:13:30,880
taking the process to the next step like

165
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:33,550
you're not moving it in the end so all

166
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:37,420
that kind of turn up when i brace the

167
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:38,890
question with the is g and the reason

168
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:40,630
why we don't have an owner by the way is

169
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:42,790
that the logical owner would be the AG

170
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:47,589
of the group Ignace but he had to recuse

171
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:49,240
himself from the document and so the new

172
00:13:47,589 --> 00:13:53,230
owner to be selected would also have to

173
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:56,210
define the process so what's the current

174
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:58,370
status so the security review

175
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:00,170
needs to be closed Benjamin said that he

176
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:02,899
pretty much likes all the things except

177
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,729
for IPSec parameters seem to be missing

178
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:07,310
one or two pieces he is not an expert on

179
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:09,110
that but he's given me the specific name

180
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:11,089
of a person I should work with for

181
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:13,640
whatever IPSec parameters may be missing

182
00:14:11,089 --> 00:14:15,230
I hope not much and then he wanted to

183
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:18,050
actually discuss with the working group

184
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:20,870
the RFC 822 address and I told him that

185
00:14:18,050 --> 00:14:22,790
I think this this would be so important

186
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:24,200
that we'll make a slot for him but he

187
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,240
doesn't have time right now but he'll

188
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:28,490
have time tomorrow so that's basically a

189
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,980
slot that we need to discuss the ACP

190
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:33,350
domain information element with him so

191
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,690
the proposed new ad owner of the

192
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,940
document is going to be Erik Venky I was

193
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,459
talking yesterday with him he can only

194
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,430
finish his review in January but in

195
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:45,410
December to prepare for that and he

196
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,060
would then be submitted to the IHG

197
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:48,860
hopefully he could already start getting

198
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:53,779
two additional reviewers beyond him that

199
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:55,610
we need right now and I'll also push out

200
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:58,880
another revision right now this week

201
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,060
just to summarize the changes since we

202
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:04,880
entered the is G in - 13 because there

203
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,160
is a lot of textual change but it's you

204
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,459
know 95% of that is a lot more

205
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,890
explanation but in a very few small

206
00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:15,349
limited technical changes I think for

207
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:18,020
other stuff in those were refinements so

208
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,760
really no major technical change but if

209
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,980
you do add if obviously there's a lot of

210
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,540
texture change so and then of course I

211
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,670
started to bitch about the process right

212
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:27,170
so talk to Felicia and raise the case

213
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,300
and data tractor that you know somebody

214
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:31,699
gets alerted because seemingly you know

215
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:34,630
people like me not aware of the process

216
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:37,279
and isg also not following up on

217
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:42,020
basically already in time reassigning

218
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:44,439
additional videos all right any

219
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:50,270
questions

220
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:55,339
okay looking forward to it this is for a

221
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:58,730
ticket so by next two years oh yeah yeah

222
00:15:55,339 --> 00:16:04,279
we'll have a big celebration I know you

223
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:08,120
ate everybody for that it's crazy and we

224
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:10,360
then we could have full rfcs at the same

225
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,360
time

226
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:50,200
education okay well I saw for the first

227
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:56,780
ideas okay

228
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:59,450
this should be fairly short thank you so

229
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:02,720
just a quick reminder for people to

230
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:04,670
reread that draft recently it talks

231
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,550
about a model in which there is a

232
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:10,300
functional library called by autonomic

233
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:13,970
service agents that communicates by some

234
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,569
inter process communication magic with

235
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:19,640
the core functions of the grasp

236
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:21,319
implementation and underneath those core

237
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,180
functions there is going to be one or

238
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,310
multiple demons it could depending on

239
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,890
the implementation model and those

240
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:32,480
demons do things like listening for X

241
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,850
unexpected unicast communications and

242
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,840
listening for multi costs and so on and

243
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:41,270
there are going to be some various

244
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:45,409
caches so that's the model in which we

245
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:51,080
are working the function library is the

246
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:54,350
what the user would see just a little

247
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,470
bit so the recent changes to the

248
00:17:54,350 --> 00:18:00,409
document that we have improved the

249
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:02,270
discussion of layering to make it more

250
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:05,390
correspond to what was on the picture

251
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:08,030
than it did before mentioned the

252
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:11,260
necessity for a demon or multiple demons

253
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:13,760
which is an implementation detail

254
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,890
improved the description of asynchronous

255
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,780
operations in particular adding some

256
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,450
discussion of callbacks which were not

257
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,639
mentioned before

258
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,290
one of the reasons for that is my skill

259
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,860
set doesn't include event loop

260
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:30,370
programming or callbacks it includes my

261
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:32,389
skills that includes threading which I

262
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,600
personally use a computer scientists

263
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,120
find much more satisfying than event

264
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,620
loops and callbacks but hopefully now

265
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:42,850
the document covers both ways of

266
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:46,010
implementing the asynchronous operations

267
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:48,500
we were asked for more explanation of

268
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:50,750
the two nonces that appear in the API

269
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,180
when that explanation is in the text

270
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:56,030
basically the aasa' nonce is a way of

271
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,950
saying yes I am the same autonomic

272
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:01,160
service agent that caught called you 10

273
00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:04,040
minutes ago and the session nonce is a

274
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,860
way of tracking a session when there are

275
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,960
multiple sessions going on in parallel

276
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:13,310
which is fairly standard in fact in in

277
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:15,440
an event loop environment at Michael's

278
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:18,919
request we added an age limit parameter

279
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,780
to the discover primitive because in

280
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,250
fact he's absolutely right it's useful

281
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:24,320
to be able to say I don't want to hear

282
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:26,150
about the result that was discovered 10

283
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:29,750
minutes ago I only I want a fresh one

284
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:36,200
and we clarified a bit of the text about

285
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:37,880
the dry run feature of off grasp not the

286
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:45,430
feature itself but how the feature is

287
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:48,050
represented in the API so next steps

288
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:50,300
this is an informational document it

289
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:54,379
says it's a conceptual outline of an API

290
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:58,340
for a grasp it's not meant to be a tight

291
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:04,880
spec you can't code directly from it at

292
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:08,649
least I can't and it's not at all clear

293
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,970
to me that this stage in the life of our

294
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,500
software that it would be even be a good

295
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,160
idea to define anything like a

296
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,200
definitive spec for an API which in any

297
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,310
case isn't something the IETF is very

298
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,800
good at so our belief is that as an

299
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,200
informational document this is

300
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:31,330
pretty much as good as it gets and it's

301
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,330
ready for a working group law school

302
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,370
well maybe there isn't a victim that's

303
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:41,930
the last one yeah

304
00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:44,560
so that's really all I wanted to say and

305
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:46,970
it's the chairs decision whether we

306
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:50,360
start that discussion now or on the list

307
00:20:46,970 --> 00:21:05,960
or what can I see a show of hands with

308
00:20:50,360 --> 00:21:18,320
who has read the document so who thinks

309
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:30,380
this is ready for last call so I believe

310
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:34,790
the okay yeah I registered there was a

311
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:41,030
reviewer from wampum but you know most

312
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:43,070
of his comes addressed I believe so yeah

313
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:44,750
I mean bingo we got good comments from

314
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:46,879
Michael and from Guangdong and I think

315
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,680
we addressed both of them that was the

316
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
intention

317
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,820
yeah so if the people who thought they

318
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,770
read it and thought and didn't put their

319
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,770
hands up for ready for Law School

320
00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:03,850
I would like to hear the reasons why

321
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:07,639
email is better okay

322
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:10,310
yeah we should ask this question does

323
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:12,590
anybody hear your hands sinks this

324
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:19,090
document is not really for working group

325
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:22,419
must go okay so we'll confirm that

326
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:26,389
meninist and there will be two weeks

327
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:28,790
period for the working for Vasco whether

328
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:29,300
that's you know next week or the week

329
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:36,500
after

330
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:38,649
yeah okay that's great thank you steer

331
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,650
you

332
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:48,039
yes or is it that's a chair yeah but we

333
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,039
should fun today

334
00:22:50,830 --> 00:23:05,360
given how this is working group stuff I

335
00:22:53,270 --> 00:23:07,460
didn't allow to sit yes okay so a couple

336
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,439
years back we started the new charter

337
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:15,980
process as well and that actually

338
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:18,830
finished in September sixth when the

339
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:20,960
second Charter was approved so I wanted

340
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:24,379
to talk a little bit about what that

341
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:29,600
means for us so first just a quick

342
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:31,730
rundown over the Charter I it's actually

343
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,199
three slides so I I think I don't want

344
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:35,150
to necessarily read the first two slides

345
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,909
because they're mostly the explanation

346
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:42,799
for people who are kind of not engaged

347
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:45,169
in the working group so let me skip to

348
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:47,750
basically the third slide which is

349
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,250
pretty much defining the scope of the

350
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,840
second Charter and I think we should

351
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,600
read through that one as a reminder for

352
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:56,270
us so the scope of possible work items

353
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,860
are as follows additional work are

354
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,840
subject to extra approval from the

355
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:01,459
responsible ad

356
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:03,799
so first extensions to the a and I

357
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,270
including all variations of a II and I

358
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:07,039
deployment such in virtualized

359
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:10,700
environments information distribution

360
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:12,440
within an autonomic network a and I OMP

361
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,840
operations administration management

362
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,090
provisioning interaction with yang based

363
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,689
mechanism defining the domain boundary

364
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:22,490
and membership management of the domain

365
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:25,159
second one support for autonomic service

366
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,679
agent so that's basically beyond the a

367
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,720
and I so that's why we can adopt this

368
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,850
now including design and implementation

369
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,860
guidelines for a say lifecycle

370
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:36,408
management authorization coordination of

371
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:40,309
ASI oops and I think there is missing

372
00:24:36,409 --> 00:24:42,380
here in this slide a new section brueski

373
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,658
features including proxies enrollment at

374
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:46,750
a adaptions over various network

375
00:24:44,659 --> 00:24:49,309
protocols variation of ultra formats

376
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,260
generic use of autonomic network and new

377
00:24:49,309 --> 00:24:52,700
grasp extensions options for them

378
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,309
including bulk transfer

379
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:57,440
an SSD interworking autonomic resource

380
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,259
management autonomic SLA assurance

381
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,309
autonomic multi-tenant management

382
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:03,710
autonomic network measurement and

383
00:25:01,309 --> 00:25:06,049
finally integration with network

384
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:08,330
operations entries including autonomic

385
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:11,269
discovery connectivity to knock yung

386
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:14,480
based Ani or a SA management and

387
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:17,989
reporting autonomic functions from notes

388
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:21,080
to Knox so that's basically a really

389
00:25:17,989 --> 00:25:23,359
good set of areas where we can explore

390
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,269
work so let's try to see where we stand

391
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,549
with the work so as a reminder of where

392
00:25:26,269 --> 00:25:30,019
we stand with at least working group

393
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:33,049
adopted work right now it's we've got

394
00:25:30,019 --> 00:25:35,090
two RFC's we've got these three

395
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:38,779
documents that are waiting for the next

396
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:41,299
two documents the ACP and brewski and we

397
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:43,759
have two of these working group

398
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:45,350
documents right now we just heard the

399
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:46,940
grasp API and there's also the

400
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:48,889
constraint ultra document that we

401
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:55,429
already adopted because they already fit

402
00:25:48,889 --> 00:25:57,049
into charter round one so um we also

403
00:25:55,429 --> 00:25:58,820
have milestones and I think they're

404
00:25:57,049 --> 00:26:02,149
Ignace there there was something

405
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,629
miserably bad happening in transferring

406
00:26:02,149 --> 00:26:07,668
before 105 I put milestones in and when

407
00:26:05,629 --> 00:26:09,139
I was looking them up right now a lot of

408
00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:14,659
them look like there is a mixture

409
00:26:09,139 --> 00:26:17,389
between dates that were meant for call

410
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:20,210
for adoption and the actual submission

411
00:26:17,389 --> 00:26:22,100
to the iesg which was always meant to be

412
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:24,919
about a year after adoption for the

413
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:27,469
working group so somehow would be good

414
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:29,929
if we can sit down and try to fix these

415
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:33,379
ones because the red ones are kind of

416
00:26:29,929 --> 00:26:35,899
seemingly not correct so this appears

417
00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:37,609
just to be a technical thing you decide

418
00:26:35,899 --> 00:26:40,100
what dates you realistically expect

419
00:26:37,609 --> 00:26:43,100
those to have and and that can be fixed

420
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,769
but I thought to remember that we we

421
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,049
always had the milestones for adoption

422
00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:49,999
and they're completely missing if we

423
00:26:48,049 --> 00:26:52,039
want to give up on adoption and just

424
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:54,830
saying because you know if we don't

425
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,619
adopt then this admission to is G is

426
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:59,418
kind of milestones I had the discretion

427
00:26:57,619 --> 00:27:01,879
or a discretion of the working group

428
00:26:59,419 --> 00:27:03,830
okay so this is for you to decide what

429
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:06,860
do you want to achieve right and then I

430
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:09,470
did put all the milestones for

431
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:11,600
adoption and then kind of about a year

432
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,669
later for each of them from my

433
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,769
understanding talking to the authors for

434
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:18,080
submission to isg so there is a lot of

435
00:27:15,769 --> 00:27:20,960
missing and the dates of these so in any

436
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,879
case right I just wanted to let the

437
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,980
working group know that this is these

438
00:27:22,879 --> 00:27:28,899
milestones are I think not correct right

439
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,899
now so we'll kind of need to fix them

440
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:35,899
okay so now what are the target draft

441
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:40,460
for working through the adoption so the

442
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:43,369
ones that we did mention in in the

443
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,549
discussion for the Charter are exactly

444
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:48,889
the information distribution over grasp

445
00:27:45,549 --> 00:27:50,720
that's going to be presented here the

446
00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:53,119
guidelines for developing autonomic

447
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,369
service agents and the constraint

448
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:58,279
adjoined proxies so basically we're

449
00:27:55,369 --> 00:28:02,480
going to you know ask for their adoption

450
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:05,330
as well for the joint proxy I haven't

451
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,009
seen Peter yet and I sent an email out

452
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:14,439
to him figure out because there was not

453
00:28:07,009 --> 00:28:17,210
even a presentation scheduled but well

454
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,950
he is registered to be here in person

455
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,580
but he hasn't arrived that's what I read

456
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,869
from the attendance list so we'll see

457
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:27,830
but otherwise we'll just take it to the

458
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:29,658
list that's fine of course so that would

459
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,330
result with the two ones that we're

460
00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:34,909
having right now in a first round of

461
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:36,529
follow-up documents in fund five drafts

462
00:28:34,909 --> 00:28:39,440
for the working group but of course

463
00:28:36,529 --> 00:28:41,799
there is more so here is basically the

464
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:45,980
documents that are currently not expired

465
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:49,999
and associated with the animal working

466
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,100
groups so for the ones being presented

467
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:55,249
here obviously you know express your

468
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:57,379
opinion about how much you think they're

469
00:28:55,249 --> 00:29:00,529
already in state ask for adoption if you

470
00:28:57,379 --> 00:29:03,080
think that's appropriate right now and

471
00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:05,090
as the working group member please you

472
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:07,580
know consider when you know we have a

473
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:09,499
list of more documents to be adopted

474
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,269
which ones you think would be highest

475
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:13,490
priority so that we also make sure that

476
00:29:11,269 --> 00:29:15,649
we work on the things and you provide

477
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:18,080
the feedback to that is most important

478
00:29:15,649 --> 00:29:19,699
for you there are more expired documents

479
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,230
so for the authors of those are please

480
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,660
refresh

481
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:25,630
and then if you if you want to have them

482
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:27,760
taken up now with the new charter if you

483
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:30,160
have any I think that all the documents

484
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,919
that we had reasonably discussed in the

485
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:35,770
past and that expired because they were

486
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:38,559
out of charter I think 90% of them would

487
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:40,570
be within the Charter I think there are

488
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,639
several from the same author so the

489
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:45,970
author should pick what they would like

490
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,280
to work on first but I think certainly

491
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:50,110
what we didn't do in the Charter was put

492
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,610
together priority lists of what we would

493
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:53,469
like to work in brewski and I think that

494
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,030
would be a good discussion to have

495
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:56,559
tomorrow when we're talking more about

496
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:59,799
the different brewski drafts and where

497
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:03,970
they are but actory

498
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:04,750
um before we doing too much for the

499
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,020
brewski

500
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:11,010
discuss I would ask the question toward

501
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:14,260
Michael how long do you think the Persky

502
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:31,929
document will take to be ready for

503
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:39,220
public I mean out of the is t4 RFC with

504
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:41,799
the luster to discuss okay yeah if if

505
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:45,130
that's the case I don't have any problem

506
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:50,379
but you know given the history we have

507
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:54,100
the non process with the frisky and ASAP

508
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:57,160
I'm not really confident unless by

509
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:59,020
myself I mean I think maybe to rephrase

510
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,290
your question is there even a risk in

511
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:03,879
adopting brewski enhancements as long as

512
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:07,120
brewski isn't done right I think we can

513
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,650
make a bet whether any change that could

514
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,178
still happen through the ice to review

515
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:11,710
of brewski would have an impact on this

516
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:14,320
other documents but I would think in

517
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:15,700
many in most cases of my understanding

518
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,840
about these follow-on documents that

519
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:21,370
wouldn't even be the case I sincerely

520
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,168
believe that there will be no

521
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:28,389
significant technical bits on the wire

522
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:32,290
changes that the only possible risk is

523
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:33,639
that there may be some significant

524
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:37,539
technical operation

525
00:31:33,639 --> 00:31:39,248
no comment about dr. it hurts when I

526
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:43,139
don't do when I lift my arm

527
00:31:39,249 --> 00:31:45,459
please don't lift your arm right so

528
00:31:43,139 --> 00:31:48,458
that's the only thing someone will come

529
00:31:45,459 --> 00:31:49,809
up with a this doesn't work it since we

530
00:31:48,459 --> 00:31:51,969
don't like this blah blah blah I says

531
00:31:49,809 --> 00:31:53,709
we'll just don't do that right no can't

532
00:31:51,969 --> 00:31:55,119
we'll cross and text out or something

533
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:57,999
I don't know that's the only thing I can

534
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,849
see at this point and I think that after

535
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:06,159
August and September 's endless threads

536
00:32:00,849 --> 00:32:08,759
that we're done with that ok so I think

537
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:17,589
there's no risk of adopting new things

538
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:33,599
that way ok thank you ok I guess we can

539
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:47,529
move to the next distribution so that's

540
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:50,079
all sir so my name is Archer I can

541
00:32:47,529 --> 00:32:52,619
presenting for the audience so we have

542
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:55,178
this document around for quite a while

543
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:59,168
and this document essentially describes

544
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:01,899
the way how grass can be extended such

545
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,909
that we can do information distribution

546
00:33:01,899 --> 00:33:07,619
or let's say it is some kind of

547
00:33:03,909 --> 00:33:10,479
publish/subscribe service within a and I

548
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:14,529
so what we actually did we defined two

549
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:16,239
specific modules inside there so in in

550
00:33:14,529 --> 00:33:18,339
the other you would have essentially an

551
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:21,159
information distribution sub module

552
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:23,049
let's say which has three sub modules

553
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:24,329
additionally and all that is then broken

554
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:26,739
down to past

555
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:28,989
Isis who usage of synchronization

556
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:31,719
messages across all through extensions

557
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:36,399
of trust so this is what is described in

558
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:38,049
the draft now specifically in the latest

559
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:40,418
version to version 12 that we uploaded

560
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:42,399
recently we have extended some classes

561
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:44,169
in the queue management sub module which

562
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,539
is probably not very important to

563
00:33:44,169 --> 00:33:47,580
discuss right now what's more important

564
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:50,430
I guess is

565
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:52,470
the question of the relevance to the

566
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,910
rich heart ring so that what Turrell is

567
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,350
presented before you have seen

568
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:57,330
information distribution as one of the

569
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:59,730
key points in the reach out at aneema

570
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:02,820
and this document actually addresses

571
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,850
this information distribution in a

572
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:07,409
specific way so while we can discuss the

573
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:09,000
quality of the document certainly

574
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:10,889
rewrite it improves the language and all

575
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:13,350
the things the toriel things can be done

576
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:16,379
a lot to this document it's by far not

577
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:17,819
finished I would say that we need this

578
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,040
document to become a working group

579
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:22,620
document and this is the major point

580
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,179
essentially so we can we can refine many

581
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,759
technical things we can even see you

582
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,739
know where whether we are using grasp as

583
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:30,030
we should whether there are alternatives

584
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,040
to this but we have a requirement

585
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:34,350
session which identifies why we needed

586
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,120
at all how it can be done so all the

587
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,679
things somehow I think are relevant to

588
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:40,620
the information distribution question in

589
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,529
general and therefore we would like to

590
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:46,109
actually ask the group and the audience

591
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:49,470
whether this document could be adopted

592
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:56,910
as the working group document as opposed

593
00:34:49,469 --> 00:35:03,450
to the personal contribution as now any

594
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:05,730
more questions no Chava I haven't read

595
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:08,310
the draft recently but in what you

596
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,840
mention as updates is it that you

597
00:35:08,310 --> 00:35:14,190
consider our information type to be

598
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,780
relevant to events only or no the point

599
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,210
is that we have some kind of

600
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,760
understanding of Raza either

601
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,990
instantaneous transfer but let's say you

602
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:24,510
already know to whom you want to send

603
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,979
information okay then essentially the

604
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,380
node can directly say these are my

605
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:29,850
recipient notes and then essentially it

606
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:32,100
can go this can be implemented with

607
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:34,290
grass without many changes today okay

608
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,339
music synchronization messages then

609
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,750
again you can have a completely

610
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:38,460
different model where you can say okay I

611
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,110
have some information that is somehow of

612
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,880
relevance to all notes but I don't know

613
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,830
which notes because I don't know where

614
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,570
which AFS will be essentially interested

615
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:47,130
in that and maybe even though it's

616
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:48,630
joining later I could be interested in

617
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,190
this information still did not expire

618
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:52,320
and then we have some kind of a

619
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,840
publish/subscribe model and for this

620
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,260
different types of events we have

621
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:00,300
different cues and the events actually

622
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,460
more account for the second time because

623
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:04,790
we need some kind of motif

624
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:06,170
right and just clarification again the

625
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:10,580
question again

626
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:13,220
is it necessarily by need to grasp or we

627
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,690
can have order sonication mechanism so

628
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:18,830
there is information that's a good

629
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:21,080
question so the point is I think the

630
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,910
answer is probably no okay

631
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,920
this document does the following we

632
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,790
first discuss what needs to be done and

633
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:28,070
why we actually need the information

634
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:31,430
distribution as you know supported

635
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:33,410
service from the other and not just on

636
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,970
some kind of random thing because right

637
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:37,399
now it's undefined and we clearly have

638
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,569
it as a need you know just for intend

639
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,040
distribution for example we always

640
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:44,570
discussing this but now it's in the

641
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,790
Charter so we then went on to define

642
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:48,170
also a specific implementation but this

643
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:50,720
is probably a specific implementation

644
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:52,730
which I guess we can discuss later but

645
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,290
we need some kind of document like that

646
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:56,270
to start this discussion and to have

647
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:57,560
people contributing agree I think at

648
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:59,030
some point we will have to make a

649
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,859
decision in the working group about

650
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,780
whether we stick the two aspect together

651
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:05,569
but needs to be distributed and how

652
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:07,700
versus the specific implementation or

653
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,800
link to grasp so cross has of course a

654
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,299
maintenance - yeah symmetry we may

655
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,550
decide that it's better to take both

656
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,230
together exact so in principle yes but

657
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,180
grasp has of course obvious advantage of

658
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,950
already being there and somehow being

659
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:20,540
natural is suitable for some things and

660
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:23,149
we do not you know it's it's kind of

661
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:25,070
signaling protocol very generic and we

662
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:27,470
do not mean to use it for bulk transfer

663
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,570
of data but we certainly mean to use it

664
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:31,220
so to say as notification that oh there

665
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:33,280
is a new information element available

666
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:37,029
right or you know download it there

667
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,030
something like you yep

668
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,660
my comment on that last point is that

669
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:49,450
what I discovered of the various toys

670
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,569
I've been building with grasp is that

671
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:56,950
the discovery mechanism is actually

672
00:37:51,569 --> 00:38:00,819
pretty good when you want to actually do

673
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:03,460
something which isn't it in grasp terms

674
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:05,710
of negotiation or a synchronization it

675
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,329
gets a bit clumsy which is why I

676
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:09,460
recently added a trick to my

677
00:38:07,329 --> 00:38:12,010
implementation where you could hand the

678
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,829
session over with just send receive

679
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:19,029
calls as if it was normal TCP or TLS and

680
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:21,250
I think that is the way we could play

681
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:24,250
this to say protocols that don't need

682
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:34,089
gross don't use grasp but they can use

683
00:38:24,250 --> 00:38:36,010
the discovery features both with the

684
00:38:34,089 --> 00:38:39,430
hats of the working group participant

685
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:42,099
and as as an energy member now it is

686
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:45,788
particularly about API and extensions of

687
00:38:42,099 --> 00:38:50,069
the API given that the base EPA document

688
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:53,200
is informational and it talks about

689
00:38:50,069 --> 00:38:55,930
topics which are much closer to the

690
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,629
implementation details than the protocol

691
00:38:55,930 --> 00:39:03,339
specification details but certainly will

692
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:06,630
raise questions in energy of why we are

693
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:10,599
trying to document something like that

694
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:12,400
there is for several years there have

695
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:17,549
been discussions coming from either side

696
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:20,400
on documents which specify use cases

697
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:24,339
applicability and things like that and

698
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,880
while there is no strict single answer

699
00:39:24,339 --> 00:39:32,349
to that in general such documents they

700
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:34,000
are not seen to positively and not with

701
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:35,650
this I'm not saying what you're doing is

702
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,980
plain wrong the question that I'm

703
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:41,680
raising is what is the value of

704
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:45,130
specifying implementation details of the

705
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,160
API IDF certainly is not a place to

706
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:50,529
standardize implementations and for that

707
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,149
the vendor that that wants to do that

708
00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:53,570
they don't need ATF they they need a

709
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:55,160
market for that and

710
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:00,350
market will decide whether that API is

711
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:02,390
applicable or not trying to specify the

712
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:05,290
protocol mechanics and the functionality

713
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:10,220
of that certainly is within the scope

714
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:12,350
now there the way how I see the CPI

715
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,850
document and extensions to that they are

716
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:17,600
going find deeper into the

717
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:19,400
implementation domain again I'm not

718
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,720
saying that this is wrong but I'm just

719
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:26,120
saying that this will raise questions so

720
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:29,299
what benefits you see going this path is

721
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:32,410
this really needed what is not why it is

722
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,000
not enough just to standardize the

723
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:36,350
basically protocol mechanics and the

724
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,480
recommendation guidelines

725
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,400
why do you really need to specify you

726
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,260
can ask you a question are you talking

727
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,130
about the API guidelines or are you

728
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,100
talking about the information

729
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:49,250
distribution it within this context I'm

730
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,230
talking about the both aha I can

731
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,450
obviously not answer both but I can only

732
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,310
answer for that part for that part I'm

733
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:59,480
not sure about the information will be

734
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:01,130
bit that we need to see but what we

735
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:03,380
actually specify is part of the

736
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,880
functionality of the Ani which we

737
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:06,590
believe is required for information

738
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,050
distribution so we have grasped there

739
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:11,480
which is required to set out the Ani and

740
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:13,760
it's working already right and if we

741
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:16,370
want to have some kind of pub/sub

742
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,780
service or this information distribution

743
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:20,810
in general then we need some additional

744
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:22,970
bits and flags within grasp which are

745
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:24,850
absolutely not api relevant but which

746
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:27,770
are relevant to the protocol on the wire

747
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,990
that is what is being specified then

748
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,640
again again in this document we do

749
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:33,680
firstly analysis of requirements we say

750
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,980
yes that's why we need it and then we

751
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:38,509
specify a solution as we just said we

752
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,310
could discuss probably the you know

753
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,020
details of the solution but certainly

754
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:44,029
it's about the protocol on the wire

755
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,160
because we need to enable an additional

756
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,160
functionality completely I would say

757
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,210
orthogonal to what is so far in there

758
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,410
it's not only about opening

759
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,360
communication channels or secure

760
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:56,180
communication channels right but it's

761
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:59,480
about storing some data within the

762
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,399
autonomous network infrastructure for

763
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,140
some short while or for longer while and

764
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,770
so on it's about the pops-up integration

765
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:05,770
inside of it

766
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:12,869
so it's not only about ApS that part I

767
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:16,049
so I think we both understand that but

768
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:17,970
if if we read the document without this

769
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:21,960
prior understanding this question

770
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:26,149
naturally arises and if you look from a

771
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,150
perspective of ayesha review there are

772
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:30,598
those who are not following what is

773
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:33,750
happening here certainly will raise that

774
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:36,390
question so maybe this needs to be

775
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,799
explained rather detailed in in the

776
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:40,170
scope of the document what it is trying

777
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:42,900
to define and what it doesn't try to

778
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:43,950
define okay understood in any case the

779
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,470
document for me

780
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:48,779
from my perspective the co-author is not

781
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:50,819
yet ready for any kind of a house calls

782
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:52,619
so we absolutely need to revise it

783
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:54,480
several times several rounds because

784
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:55,950
this is obviously probably this is true

785
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,299
if this is the impression that the

786
00:42:55,950 --> 00:43:07,078
reader is getting then we need to get

787
00:42:57,299 --> 00:43:11,369
rid of this indeed yeah with my working

788
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:15,630
groups chair Adam actually has opening

789
00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:18,569
impose document they stand on along API

790
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:23,940
document is informational document which

791
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:27,329
provides some you know extra information

792
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:30,089
and - how may may

793
00:43:27,329 --> 00:43:34,230
you know implement the grasper and how

794
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:38,819
that may help the you know Apple a year

795
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:43,079
asa to use it so that's useful but for

796
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:46,558
this document I'm with you I

797
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:50,640
I think this document shouldn't depends

798
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:54,359
on the you know grasp API document or

799
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:58,170
all the API I just look at through your

800
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:02,609
document there's a not part machine you

801
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:06,480
know in the cross a P I and how to

802
00:44:02,609 --> 00:44:09,538
integrate with grasp api which i think

803
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,490
is we shouldn't do that okay yeah

804
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:14,369
understood you are doing a standard

805
00:44:11,490 --> 00:44:16,799
document and to reference a lot to our

806
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:17,819
informational document which which is

807
00:44:16,799 --> 00:44:19,369
not right

808
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:21,799
so I

809
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:24,589
say that part of information is still

810
00:44:21,799 --> 00:44:30,079
useful but move that from the main

811
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:39,380
document maybe into the appendix what

812
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:41,569
are the degree so how precisely that is

813
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:43,730
done is for working group to decide but

814
00:44:41,569 --> 00:44:45,950
what should happen is that it very

815
00:44:43,730 --> 00:44:48,230
clearly states the scope of what it

816
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:50,749
tries to define and what it doesn't try

817
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:59,359
to define clear comment taking yeah

818
00:44:50,749 --> 00:45:02,328
understood so to answer Ignace a

819
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:05,119
question about the api starting first um

820
00:45:02,329 --> 00:45:08,809
i think one of these principles that I

821
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,539
always you know expected a anima and a

822
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:13,670
and I to help with but which I think we

823
00:45:11,539 --> 00:45:16,579
haven't really well spoken out is the

824
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:18,829
ability to actually decompose the so far

825
00:45:16,579 --> 00:45:21,069
very oft monolithic software in a

826
00:45:18,829 --> 00:45:23,359
network device to be composed of

827
00:45:21,069 --> 00:45:26,630
interoperating components from different

828
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:28,999
vendors so one way for example to think

829
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:31,880
about the API document in a term that I

830
00:45:28,999 --> 00:45:33,859
think would make it a lot more amenable

831
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,549
to you know this resistance force

832
00:45:33,859 --> 00:45:39,970
against api's is if you know the API was

833
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:42,079
specified in something like a rest

834
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:44,359
specification as opposed to the more

835
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,130
informal approach that we have chosen in

836
00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:47,989
the document and then I think it would

837
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:49,670
become very clear that just because the

838
00:45:47,989 --> 00:45:52,339
two components the provider and the

839
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:53,690
consumer of the API are sitting on the

840
00:45:52,339 --> 00:45:55,279
same system it's still an

841
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:57,829
interoperability issue that we want to

842
00:45:55,279 --> 00:46:03,410
solve right so that's my answer the the

843
00:45:57,829 --> 00:46:05,869
second is for for your document I think

844
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:07,339
that I've only superficially read it so

845
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:09,859
I'll need to spend more cycles on that

846
00:46:07,339 --> 00:46:14,569
but it seems to me that it also only

847
00:46:09,859 --> 00:46:16,339
gives very coarse guidelines as there

848
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:18,650
are some extensions right so that's

849
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:20,119
basically a real specification part but

850
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:22,249
there is not even a single let's say

851
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:25,519
example interoperable solution you could

852
00:46:22,249 --> 00:46:26,959
build out of that right not always right

853
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,508
not notwithstanding the fact that

854
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,460
obviously the idea of this document is

855
00:46:29,509 --> 00:46:34,080
to allow multiple different independent

856
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:36,510
you know information distribution

857
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:38,940
solutions to be built it might be

858
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,490
helpful to have let's say the minimum

859
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:45,240
single reference one included in the

860
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:46,729
document to basically you know make it

861
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,560
clear that we're really talking about

862
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,420
integration at two levels generic things

863
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,310
to be applied to multiple solution and

864
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,550
then one example maybe that's that's a

865
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,619
solution yes so to the second comment I

866
00:46:56,550 --> 00:47:00,660
guess we wanted to do something like

867
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,700
that that's why we adopted grasp because

868
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,589
by by essentially saying grasp can do

869
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,020
this in extending Ross we are going for

870
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:08,550
something quite standard as at least as

871
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,200
some kind of minimum you know

872
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:12,869
denominator which is common then to an

873
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,609
Ani then there could be other like maybe

874
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:16,619
out-of-band ways for information

875
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:19,109
distribution as well where grasp could

876
00:47:16,619 --> 00:47:20,700
be just setting up the channels okay so

877
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:22,230
this is also possible but the indeed I

878
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:24,480
understand and I fully agree that this

879
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:25,859
document is not ready for publication we

880
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,750
need more contributions to this that's

881
00:47:25,859 --> 00:47:30,540
exactly the point so fight somehow you

882
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:32,940
know a personal draft which is more or

883
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,650
less evolving with the authors we never

884
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,230
received any kind of review or comments

885
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:38,790
from the community okay so please do not

886
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,440
be surprised obviously we do not know

887
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:42,810
how the community understands what we

888
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:44,520
are trying to write and yes the language

889
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,670
has to be improved in this 4k that's for

890
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,670
sure

891
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:52,530
so maybe maybe one suggestion for the

892
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,030
API document in and we can take it

893
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,850
offline it's just brainstorming right I

894
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:59,580
mean we have some successful work about

895
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:02,490
api's and taps right and they also don't

896
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,799
have you know a concrete API but they're

897
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:08,759
all abstract api's and I think that was

898
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,040
also the goal of what Bryan's document

899
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:13,890
is trying to achieve so as not to you

900
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:16,020
know forego different intentions like

901
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:17,310
rest being a possible one but shouldn't

902
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:19,800
be constrained to that so I was only

903
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,690
giving rest as an argue example but

904
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:25,950
maybe we can you know seek the help of

905
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:29,430
taps to basically ask them what minimum

906
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:33,990
formalism they you know think is

907
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:35,910
necessary to basically achieve that

908
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:39,390
level of standard that we currently have

909
00:48:35,910 --> 00:48:42,060
there is that with that I know I mean as

910
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:45,950
I said we can take it offline but if

911
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,950
there is expertise maybe we can use it

912
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:59,730
right so just the the standard one who

913
00:48:54,040 --> 00:49:05,020
has read this document one two three

914
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:09,580
doesn't count two three four okay who

915
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:13,410
thinks it's ready for adoption okay

916
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,410
thank you we'll take it to the list

917
00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:56,490
so what's the next you see okay this is

918
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:58,140
supposed to be tied to a particular

919
00:49:56,490 --> 00:49:59,569
draft but I won't really be talking

920
00:49:58,140 --> 00:50:03,779
about it very much

921
00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:06,349
and it will come back to the question

922
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:12,810
that Ignis raised a little while ago but

923
00:50:06,349 --> 00:50:15,960
explicitly recent changes to the

924
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,940
document none we've had quite a small

925
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,220
amount of feedback except at the very

926
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,320
beginning and that in my opinion is why

927
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:28,919
we need to discuss the more abstract

928
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:33,410
question of an anima ecosystem so why do

929
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:33,410
we need one we in a very general sense

930
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:42,390
deployable autonomic network needs more

931
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,240
than an ACP and grasp it needs to

932
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:47,089
achieve management goals that the

933
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:52,680
network operation center cannot achieve

934
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:54,420
manually otherwise why are we here my

935
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,790
opinion that requires a library of

936
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:59,359
autonomic service agents and if we're

937
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,859
using the grasp model and our library of

938
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:06,390
grasp objective definitions and it

939
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:10,770
requires tools to deploy and oversee the

940
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:13,029
ASA's we have some documentation

941
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:15,310
it's sort of addressed some of these

942
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:18,340
questions including the one I'm Thea

943
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:23,980
reticle II talking about I won't read

944
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:28,390
out the list um but we got no clear

945
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:31,840
working group goals in that area in my

946
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:35,500
opinion and then we have the question of

947
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:38,710
what ecosystem issues can the IETF

948
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:42,940
tackle missing standards operational

949
00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:45,280
guidance implementation guidance and

950
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:47,670
what he what issues are out of scope for

951
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,670
the IDF and who should be encouraged to

952
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:57,060
deal with them so I think this is a

953
00:51:51,670 --> 00:52:01,090
generalization of Ignis if we just stop

954
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:05,020
you know at the on the word protocol we

955
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:06,820
in the sense of the industry then

956
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:11,530
nothing will happen so someone has to

957
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:13,060
make this ecosystem stuff happen but

958
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,780
there's a limit to what we can do in the

959
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:21,700
IETF and that means in practice is a

960
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:25,780
limit to what the isg will will will let

961
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:28,410
through the ballot there's other IETF

962
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:31,630
work we might want to consider that

963
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:36,839
conference in an autonomic Network net

964
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:39,910
confer over ACP that conf over grasp I

965
00:52:36,839 --> 00:52:42,130
just added this line this week use of

966
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:44,770
muds for authorization in an autonomic

967
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:47,230
network so the concrete examples of

968
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:52,300
things probably need to play nicely with

969
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:54,580
an autonomic network which are going on

970
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:58,510
to to efforts that are going on in the

971
00:52:54,580 --> 00:53:01,750
ops area working group that's all I want

972
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:04,359
to say I want a little bit guidance from

973
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:06,940
the working groups to where we should

974
00:53:04,359 --> 00:53:10,290
take any of this topic and both the

975
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:10,290
chairs want to go to the microphone

976
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:16,930
Michael Michael Richardson so I had a

977
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:18,790
question I guess you're working along

978
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:21,368
Apple days ago and someone wants to know

979
00:53:18,790 --> 00:53:23,558
about the animo stuff what's that all

980
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:26,619
about right

981
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:28,299
and you know I realized I didn't have a

982
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:31,599
really good elevator pitch at the moment

983
00:53:28,299 --> 00:53:35,729
um but the question that they asked was

984
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:40,749
is this going to permit permissionless

985
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:46,868
ipv6 network extensions in in the same

986
00:53:40,749 --> 00:53:50,799
way that we typically an ugly Lee you

987
00:53:46,869 --> 00:53:53,199
know plug not for forced into v4

988
00:53:50,799 --> 00:53:54,969
networks and just extend them without

989
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:59,920
permission right because it's gonna let

990
00:53:54,969 --> 00:54:01,509
us do this with v6 and look I said gosh

991
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,869
that would be really good it's a good

992
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:07,630
result wouldn't it right isn't that what

993
00:54:04,869 --> 00:54:12,489
homeless were trying to do

994
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:14,529
yes exactly so the the part of the and

995
00:54:12,489 --> 00:54:17,890
whether we succeeded or not is a good

996
00:54:14,529 --> 00:54:21,329
question but maybe the permission

997
00:54:17,890 --> 00:54:23,859
lessness of the of that not for for

998
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:27,400
scenario that it was completely

999
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:32,078
permissionless and also unmanageable was

1000
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:34,269
a bad thing okay but maybe we need to

1001
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:35,589
find some intermediate point and so I go

1002
00:54:34,269 --> 00:54:37,508
back and I was sitting there looking

1003
00:54:35,589 --> 00:54:41,078
your list of slides and so what happened

1004
00:54:37,509 --> 00:54:46,029
with our address assignment AAS a spec

1005
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:48,009
it's it's in mr. FL that's where it is

1006
00:54:46,029 --> 00:54:51,939
okay it's in miss Roth okay right okay

1007
00:54:48,009 --> 00:54:55,119
so for a long time I was in limbo but

1008
00:54:51,939 --> 00:54:59,469
how it's going to Hill right so so my

1009
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:01,179
take on the stuff and in sort of not so

1010
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:06,219
terrible that reach are during took so

1011
00:55:01,179 --> 00:55:09,119
long and I guess in the end I actually

1012
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:13,569
think we need to take a brick a breath

1013
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:16,119
we need to let our queue empty also that

1014
00:55:13,569 --> 00:55:17,910
our mine you know our collective minds

1015
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:21,819
kind of empty with some of the issues

1016
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:24,098
and we also need to let some of the

1017
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:30,759
running code catch up to the whole

1018
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:35,890
scenario and so I would ask our area

1019
00:55:30,759 --> 00:55:37,240
directors and ASG to please not take our

1020
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:41,740
lack of activity

1021
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:44,560
is a sign that we have no work to do but

1022
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:48,750
rather that we're too busy working to

1023
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:51,009
bother talking about it for a while

1024
00:55:48,750 --> 00:55:54,900
fair enough that's my opinion

1025
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:57,700
okay you agree it's the topic matters

1026
00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:01,030
yes I think the topic matters I also

1027
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:03,100
want a point that I think that that the

1028
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:06,810
many of the participants in this working

1029
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:10,360
group have have gone through forcible

1030
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:12,430
job changes or employer train jizz with

1031
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:14,140
the result that there's at least a

1032
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:15,609
couple major vendors that are

1033
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:17,470
essentially not in this room anymore

1034
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:20,530
mm-hmm okay so that's a pretty

1035
00:56:17,470 --> 00:56:22,359
significant thing and the argument for

1036
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:25,750
why we need standardization if we only

1037
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:30,040
don't have any as many large vendors in

1038
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:31,600
the room is maybe a good one but I don't

1039
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:38,560
think it's I mean I think we still

1040
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:43,779
important so as soon as ACP is in your

1041
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:45,790
name sir Tallis yeah so I'm not doing

1042
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:49,180
anything right now and until basically

1043
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:51,520
the ACP document is out of the iesg

1044
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:53,680
queue but then the answer would be that

1045
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,940
I'm still coming from what I known to be

1046
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,919
working from pre standard

1047
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:58,480
implementations and what I think is

1048
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,700
fundamental and that's pretty much the

1049
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,160
DNS SD for service discovery of

1050
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:05,109
important you know services in existing

1051
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,420
network so really the pragmatic stuff I

1052
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:09,310
think that allows you know people with

1053
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:11,470
existing networks to see the biggest

1054
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:13,480
value as opposed to the things that I

1055
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:15,430
find cool like all these you know how do

1056
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:18,460
i structure Asin these things which are

1057
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,259
more researchy which I love but I don't

1058
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:23,470
think that they necessarily give us the

1059
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,700
you know shortest term extraction you

1060
00:57:23,470 --> 00:57:26,560
know with the industry which

1061
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:28,390
unfortunately is very backward facing

1062
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,640
well that's just my personal opinion

1063
00:57:28,390 --> 00:57:32,920
that's one of the reasons why I did the

1064
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:36,160
experiment with interfacing respected

1065
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:37,930
Iain SSDs you know not even hard to do

1066
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,290
no no but I think you raised a much

1067
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:43,299
longer set of things and all I was

1068
00:57:41,290 --> 00:57:44,830
saying is my preference is to you know

1069
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,810
work on the things that hopefully give

1070
00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:48,430
us a more immediate affection to you

1071
00:57:46,810 --> 00:57:50,730
know not the most forward-looking

1072
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,859
networks but the ones that one in here

1073
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:57,320
the incremental think you know what the

1074
00:57:52,859 --> 00:57:57,319
last document on my slide was the

1075
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:06,030
diaphragm Vict because you shall mention

1076
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,850
that the animal is a guillotine

1077
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:10,980
so I've got two questions one continues

1078
00:58:08,850 --> 00:58:13,560
because animal is lost

1079
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:16,200
I killed him then I think the

1080
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:19,290
implementation and obligation scenarios

1081
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:21,210
are very important then can you give

1082
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:24,630
some examples for the application

1083
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:28,109
scenarios and implementations another

1084
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:30,660
quality is because animal is legacy

1085
00:58:28,109 --> 00:58:33,029
demon and if they want to be lazy shield

1086
00:58:30,660 --> 00:58:35,520
between the animal and at a i/o

1087
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:41,460
anniversary learning then my question

1088
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:43,340
that my talk religion example scenario

1089
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:48,300
was already mentioned which was the

1090
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:51,060
address assignment mechanism where here

1091
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:54,810
where the RFC is stuck waiting to be

1092
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,190
published but you know we we did that

1093
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:58,830
right at the beginning because it was

1094
00:58:56,190 --> 00:59:03,150
one of the use cases that emerged in the

1095
00:58:58,830 --> 00:59:05,970
original buff that led to the formation

1096
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,560
of the working group and and the idea

1097
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:10,200
there would be that there will be no

1098
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:14,100
more need for manual address assignment

1099
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:18,230
within an enterprise network because the

1100
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:21,359
anima stuff would just go away and do it

1101
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:23,369
so you you could find that draft which

1102
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:26,160
is sitting in the RFC editors queue and

1103
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:27,869
you could find some code which I wrote

1104
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,629
to implement it a couple of years ago

1105
00:59:27,869 --> 00:59:32,340
and we just you know it's all part of

1106
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:35,760
the queue that we've been talking about

1107
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:38,240
for forgetting our work finished in

1108
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,430
terms of use of AI and machine learning

1109
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,799
as far as I'm concerned that's still a

1110
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:45,390
research topic which the NMR G is

1111
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,760
looking at I don't know how we'd

1112
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:50,549
integrate it I feel that we should do

1113
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,950
right but I don't know yet how we would

1114
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,780
do it yeah I agree with you that it

1115
00:59:52,950 --> 00:59:57,089
should be should be there

1116
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:59,400
the idea there would clearly be that you

1117
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:02,670
would have an autonomic service agent

1118
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:06,359
that would be connected to the AI system

1119
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:08,490
and could talk to other autonomic

1120
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:11,000
service agents that were not connected

1121
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:13,589
to the AI system so you have to have

1122
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:17,550
almost certainly a central resource for

1123
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:20,130
the AI which is used by distributed

1124
01:00:17,550 --> 01:00:21,990
systems and we can easily do that if we

1125
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:28,280
only knew what we would be doing with

1126
01:00:21,990 --> 01:00:33,950
the AI I would like to comment on that

1127
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:35,790
when we did our reach other way actually

1128
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:41,669
leaves the AI

1129
01:00:35,790 --> 01:00:48,690
out of scope intentionally and actually

1130
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:51,660
as brown also explained 80s possible

1131
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:57,900
you know we here's the machine learning

1132
01:00:51,660 --> 01:01:02,609
or AI mechanism with sit in the some

1133
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:05,910
certain autonomic service agent but

1134
01:01:02,609 --> 01:01:07,109
that's nothing to do with the protocol

1135
01:01:05,910 --> 01:01:11,810
or the

1136
01:01:07,109 --> 01:01:17,340
signaling we are standardized here so

1137
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:19,970
basically that just means some logic for

1138
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:22,890
favoured by the machine learning or AI

1139
01:01:19,970 --> 01:01:25,709
use the anima

1140
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:29,160
infrastructure if that's the case of

1141
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:33,170
waste spotted but we're not going to you

1142
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:36,420
know really discuss how the algorithm

1143
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:40,350
algorithm or machine learning algorithm

1144
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:44,570
to be applied you know through through

1145
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:51,029
the signaling or the autonomic Network

1146
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:54,619
distributary Brian can you go back one

1147
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:54,619
or two slides up please

1148
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,840
no slide three please

1149
01:02:02,070 --> 01:02:06,270
at the point when you say requires a

1150
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:09,330
library of a size I will say I agree

1151
01:02:06,270 --> 01:02:11,339
with that I think we're on e ma he's

1152
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:14,730
right now we have developed some

1153
01:02:11,339 --> 01:02:17,339
protocols framework different things

1154
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:20,099
that are useful now we need to have a

1155
01:02:17,339 --> 01:02:24,089
bit more like the guy before but

1156
01:02:20,099 --> 01:02:25,530
examples use cases application areas so

1157
01:02:24,089 --> 01:02:28,380
I think this is important to understand

1158
01:02:25,530 --> 01:02:30,089
what what could be then the require the

1159
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:32,300
summarization requirement or the

1160
01:02:30,089 --> 01:02:36,000
sanitation needs to address different

1161
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:38,280
areas so maybe we need some kind of use

1162
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,930
case document so a phase where we try to

1163
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:42,690
see what are the application of what

1164
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:45,810
could be the types of Aiza I'll just

1165
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,940
finish on that is also because but on

1166
01:02:45,810 --> 01:02:49,980
that thing that we need to have use

1167
01:02:47,940 --> 01:02:51,900
cases for me this is where we reach a

1168
01:02:49,980 --> 01:02:54,300
bit the limit of what I ATF is used to

1169
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:57,770
do with respect to your question and in

1170
01:02:54,300 --> 01:03:00,980
ecosystem because then

1171
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:03,050
aisa for the security space Oryza in IOT

1172
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:05,300
or is it and then this is not anymore

1173
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:09,050
a NEMA or even anymore it's a bit like

1174
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:11,780
cross cross area or even application

1175
01:03:09,050 --> 01:03:14,240
space that can be copied outside IETF so

1176
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:17,270
for me this is we need to investigate

1177
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:19,970
that this could be channeled in the ayah

1178
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:23,090
in the working group through a set of

1179
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:26,118
documents or discussion points but I am

1180
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:28,250
Not sure the IETF I mean to develop an

1181
01:03:26,119 --> 01:03:29,570
ecosystem understood the IHF is the

1182
01:03:28,250 --> 01:03:31,880
right place for that and I'm saying it's

1183
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:34,400
not feasible but I don't have good

1184
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,550
example is in mind we have I think we

1185
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:41,030
talked some years ago some couple of

1186
01:03:37,550 --> 01:03:42,110
IETF ago about having also more

1187
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:44,330
implementation which may be

1188
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:47,660
participation to the ATF a cation or

1189
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:51,619
open source projects which can be also a

1190
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:54,410
way to make an ecosystem live and an

1191
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:57,380
final point final comment I think for

1192
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:58,970
this discussion I'm not sure we have yet

1193
01:03:57,380 --> 01:04:02,000
a good description or a good

1194
01:03:58,970 --> 01:04:03,549
understanding of what Asia is or could

1195
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,960
be

1196
01:04:03,550 --> 01:04:08,960
because it's essentially functionally

1197
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:12,590
oriented and to bring back to the

1198
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:15,020
question of the use of AI or machine

1199
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:18,410
learning inside this essence it's valid

1200
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:23,000
question and then it opens all bunch of

1201
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:24,529
discussion about this kind of how to

1202
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:27,650
describe an essay in terms of

1203
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:30,290
capabilities to analyze feelings to take

1204
01:04:27,650 --> 01:04:32,000
decisions so this aspect of cognition

1205
01:04:30,290 --> 01:04:35,090
intelligence which is really not the

1206
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,660
place for IETF I mean maybe more iron

1207
01:04:35,090 --> 01:04:41,420
chef but so this a bit not it's a bit

1208
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:45,560
blurred that's exactly why I have this

1209
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:47,900
question about what can we do yes I

1210
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:50,359
probably for this note should be sitting

1211
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:53,750
up front but I think just a general note

1212
01:04:50,359 --> 01:04:56,119
to you know all the co-authors of the

1213
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:58,160
current drafts or drafts to be looking

1214
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:59,540
into this problem right I mean they're

1215
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:01,399
there a lot of other working groups

1216
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:03,650
where there could be you know help and

1217
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:06,200
interest in in what we specifically are

1218
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:07,970
doing so when I started the DNS stuff of

1219
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,549
course also went to the DNS working

1220
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,689
group as I said maybe you know for API

1221
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:13,190
things something

1222
01:05:11,690 --> 01:05:15,319
taps could be helpful right I think

1223
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:17,540
there is nothing stopping us from

1224
01:05:15,319 --> 01:05:19,609
proposing to talk about the subjects

1225
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:21,319
that were interested in in what we think

1226
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:23,960
is the best working group to you know

1227
01:05:21,319 --> 01:05:25,730
create more feedback or also you know in

1228
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,560
these other examples that were showing

1229
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:29,990
that that may have the use cases and

1230
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:32,000
create you know more advancement through

1231
01:05:29,990 --> 01:05:34,490
that so that's definitely also some

1232
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,319
additional work for authors not simply

1233
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:38,810
thinking that we can operate in a silo

1234
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:48,259
but you know create contacts elsewhere

1235
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:51,710
in the idea a remark more it's a about

1236
01:05:48,260 --> 01:05:54,260
what aces are or could be I usually take

1237
01:05:51,710 --> 01:05:56,390
the comparison with a virtual network

1238
01:05:54,260 --> 01:05:58,339
function or network function I could see

1239
01:05:56,390 --> 01:06:00,290
a parallel between an ASA and network

1240
01:05:58,339 --> 01:06:01,640
function but typically network function

1241
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:03,529
this is not really IETF which is

1242
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:06,589
developing network functions you go to

1243
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:09,829
there are many other places where people

1244
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:11,720
are building or proposing those

1245
01:06:09,829 --> 01:06:15,230
functions and also the require the

1246
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:17,868
standardization needs on these network

1247
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:20,810
functions it's a I mean needs to be

1248
01:06:17,869 --> 01:06:23,450
clearly understood and defined and this

1249
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:25,640
is part of I mean one point I will have

1250
01:06:23,450 --> 01:06:28,220
in my presentation on what could be some

1251
01:06:25,640 --> 01:06:30,348
somatization nodes for that now I think

1252
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:33,230
that's a very interesting comparison

1253
01:06:30,349 --> 01:06:35,630
because the reason why things like vnfs

1254
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:38,300
are so managed to to the largest X tends

1255
01:06:35,630 --> 01:06:39,710
to be you know something the ITF can

1256
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:42,079
ignore is because it didn't really

1257
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:44,450
change you know the api's and the

1258
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,089
protocols use but it just changed the

1259
01:06:44,450 --> 01:06:48,980
shape of the individual notes right from

1260
01:06:47,089 --> 01:06:51,680
hardware to software whereas what we're

1261
01:06:48,980 --> 01:06:54,380
trying to do is decompose you know the

1262
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:57,040
the monolithic system and create you

1263
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:59,690
know it would be between the aasa'

1264
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:02,210
interoperating interfaces and being able

1265
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:03,980
to compose that right so that in the end

1266
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:05,359
something for example what what you've

1267
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,490
been doing in terms of defining

1268
01:07:05,359 --> 01:07:09,380
dependencies right and and and these

1269
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:11,299
complex management operation that we

1270
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:12,950
can't solve right now that they can be

1271
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:14,240
done easier for example right so from

1272
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:17,660
that perspective I think is the

1273
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:20,060
explanation why what we're doing might

1274
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:22,640
have a lot more need and opportunity to

1275
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:24,290
be done in the ITF as an you know new

1276
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:25,549
interoperating extend routes things then

1277
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:31,640
what traditional Vee

1278
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:34,520
have done so far big-nose McDonough's

1279
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:36,410
now main thing is I'm really happy that

1280
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:40,640
this type of a discussion is happening

1281
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:43,069
and this is clearly needed now let me

1282
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:47,540
expand a little bit on that with with a

1283
01:07:43,070 --> 01:07:50,540
few say rules for assumptions first this

1284
01:07:47,540 --> 01:07:52,160
is ITF working group not IRT F working

1285
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:54,410
group and therefore the deliverables

1286
01:07:52,160 --> 01:08:00,740
should be say tangible engineering

1287
01:07:54,410 --> 01:08:04,009
components now IETF is good at working

1288
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:07,660
on components now and that that is what

1289
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:11,470
the individual working groups produce

1290
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:14,180
IDF is not that good and working on

1291
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:15,709
combining those components together and

1292
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:19,970
then building something like a system

1293
01:08:15,710 --> 01:08:22,160
that's one second thing my impression

1294
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:24,830
from from from especially reading the

1295
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,450
slide that is in front is that it is at

1296
01:08:24,830 --> 01:08:29,029
this point of time it's a question more

1297
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:30,679
about the requirements and understanding

1298
01:08:29,029 --> 01:08:32,330
the problem space and where that problem

1299
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:34,970
lies

1300
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:36,979
and only then trying to address the

1301
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:40,130
components which can be addressed here

1302
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:43,490
in some other working group right now it

1303
01:08:40,130 --> 01:08:46,609
sounds like we are trying to find the so

1304
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:48,649
we're trying to use the solutions that

1305
01:08:46,609 --> 01:08:50,200
we already have the fragments and then

1306
01:08:48,649 --> 01:08:52,990
try to find out the problem for that

1307
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:57,559
this doesn't seem to be practical

1308
01:08:52,990 --> 01:09:01,189
in my view there needs to be an outreach

1309
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:04,010
into the user community to understand

1310
01:09:01,189 --> 01:09:05,719
what the problems are the way how ACP

1311
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:08,420
started it started with a very narrow

1312
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:12,440
but a very specific problem right and

1313
01:09:08,420 --> 01:09:15,620
therefore it resulted in in a tangible

1314
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:19,339
and employable solution if we are trying

1315
01:09:15,620 --> 01:09:22,040
to look into broader scope overall into

1316
01:09:19,339 --> 01:09:24,589
into say all these autonomic nodes now

1317
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:28,430
without having a detailed understanding

1318
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:31,850
of a problem space I think this belongs

1319
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:34,670
or not belongs but turns much more into

1320
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:37,310
IRT of type of work than ITF type of

1321
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,730
work so this is something that in my

1322
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:44,109
view is the first step to end the

1323
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:46,599
stand what is the problem space then so

1324
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:48,430
I said problem space into the components

1325
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:52,960
which can be worked either here an

1326
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:55,750
animal or maybe somewhere else so it

1327
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:59,739
appears that some some dispatch style

1328
01:09:55,750 --> 01:10:01,840
mechanism well some areas have dispatch

1329
01:09:59,739 --> 01:10:03,400
style groups which bring in the new

1330
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,260
incoming work and all sorts of other

1331
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:08,549
things and they try to distribute and

1332
01:10:05,260 --> 01:10:12,790
find the home for that maybe something

1333
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:14,860
like that is needed there were similar

1334
01:10:12,790 --> 01:10:19,320
discussions in here this meeting to

1335
01:10:14,860 --> 01:10:21,849
about the IOT IOT systems or work more

1336
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,290
on a more broader scope than just an

1337
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:26,590
individual product the protocols and

1338
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:31,480
components in IOT domain I think this

1339
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:34,690
has a lot of binding together and maybe

1340
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:38,379
that could be one place where both the

1341
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:41,379
anima and I which he related topics are

1342
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:43,480
being discussed and and and of sliced

1343
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:46,720
for the further work but the starting

1344
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:49,299
point at least in my view appears that

1345
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:51,280
we need to reach out to the potential

1346
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,620
user base of of these deliverables

1347
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,360
potential deliverables to understand

1348
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:58,690
whether what we are trying to do is a

1349
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,049
problem for them and whether we

1350
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:06,580
understand what is a problem for them

1351
01:11:01,050 --> 01:11:10,510
now this is definitely not ITF community

1352
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:12,430
now we have severe problems of operator

1353
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:15,580
participation in 90f and that will not

1354
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:18,970
get better anytime soon therefore this

1355
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:21,190
is an outreach question the question to

1356
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:24,160
what what organization of what venue do

1357
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:27,400
we need to outreach and again I think

1358
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:29,980
this is one of the topics that needs to

1359
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,049
be addressed first before trying to do

1360
01:11:29,980 --> 01:11:33,820
something on a protocol work yes we are

1361
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:37,780
engineers and dealing with protocols

1362
01:11:33,820 --> 01:11:40,690
it's fun and easy but the fundamental

1363
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:47,860
question is what do we need to do from a

1364
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:49,540
problem perspective okay we're now

1365
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:52,699
reaching the point of catching up with

1366
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:55,729
the end of the slot time for this last

1367
01:11:52,699 --> 01:12:00,530
so if I may the answer is they need a

1368
01:11:55,729 --> 01:12:03,550
tangible demo okay and and may say that

1369
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:07,070
sends you the ietf but the point is that

1370
01:12:03,550 --> 01:12:08,599
that's the next step for the work and we

1371
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:12,558
can't come back to the rest of the stuff

1372
01:12:08,599 --> 01:12:16,010
until we get those guys excited and that

1373
01:12:12,559 --> 01:12:19,219
requires work that that is of a

1374
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:21,170
different kind right so that's all so

1375
01:12:19,219 --> 01:12:23,329
that's why I'm saying please don't shut

1376
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:25,249
us down if we doesn't look like we're

1377
01:12:23,329 --> 01:12:27,709
actually doing something at the IETF

1378
01:12:25,249 --> 01:12:28,760
because it's just not happening here it

1379
01:12:27,709 --> 01:12:31,369
can't happen here

1380
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,380
for a little while until we have as you

1381
01:12:31,369 --> 01:12:35,049
say the operator has come in and get

1382
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:39,469
excited

1383
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:41,360
alright so now I'm joking I will not

1384
01:12:39,469 --> 01:12:42,829
shut down the working group while it is

1385
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:45,499
meeting because it was already a

1386
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:47,030
precedent and that would be a clone but

1387
01:12:45,499 --> 01:12:49,249
what I'm saying we might not need to

1388
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:51,590
meet but that doesn't mean we're not

1389
01:12:49,249 --> 01:12:53,809
gonna meet we're inactive is what I'm

1390
01:12:51,590 --> 01:12:57,829
trying to say okay we might not need

1391
01:12:53,809 --> 01:12:59,360
face time as much for a little while but

1392
01:12:57,829 --> 01:13:01,369
but we have a lot of documents that are

1393
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:02,869
it that are still processing and we

1394
01:13:01,369 --> 01:13:04,699
probably might need face time for that

1395
01:13:02,869 --> 01:13:07,579
but we might not be adding new documents

1396
01:13:04,699 --> 01:13:10,369
because we just it's it's just not it's

1397
01:13:07,579 --> 01:13:12,079
just not ready yet right you are the

1398
01:13:10,369 --> 01:13:14,268
working group you have reach at it you

1399
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:17,599
have your milestones now it is for you

1400
01:13:14,269 --> 01:13:19,639
to work on those milestones well if if

1401
01:13:17,599 --> 01:13:22,219
you are looking at an ad who will guide

1402
01:13:19,639 --> 01:13:24,999
you for all of that I think I can help

1403
01:13:22,219 --> 01:13:29,139
but this is for you to do that

1404
01:13:24,999 --> 01:13:31,999
once we are six years old with you the

1405
01:13:29,139 --> 01:13:34,489
milestones dates then probably the

1406
01:13:31,999 --> 01:13:36,619
question of shutting this might be

1407
01:13:34,489 --> 01:13:41,089
raised but there are no such intentions

1408
01:13:36,619 --> 01:13:42,739
at this point of time so this was a

1409
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:45,349
great philosophical discussion we need

1410
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:47,749
to come to the close of this I wanted to

1411
01:13:45,349 --> 01:13:52,340
remind that the starting point of all of

1412
01:13:47,749 --> 01:13:56,780
this was the draft that is talking about

1413
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:58,340
the guidelines for ASAS and I think as

1414
01:13:56,780 --> 01:14:00,800
much as we understand that this is at

1415
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,709
the fringes of you know the actual

1416
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,380
ability to create interoperating running

1417
01:14:03,709 --> 01:14:11,150
code but really at the starting point

1418
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:14,179
of that well we want to make a call for

1419
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:15,440
adoption after this meeting so just for

1420
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:23,330
the people in the room who has read the

1421
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:26,239
document on two six seven the ASI

1422
01:14:23,330 --> 01:14:33,730
guidelines okay who think it's ready for

1423
01:14:26,239 --> 01:14:33,730
adoption two three four okay thank you

1424
01:14:34,150 --> 01:14:39,409
yeah of course like all the time right

1425
01:14:37,340 --> 01:15:00,560
whatever we do in the room this will

1426
01:14:39,409 --> 01:15:04,879
take over okay thank you

1427
01:15:00,560 --> 01:15:07,400
so I would like to present work that is

1428
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:10,010
being done in a another group in Etsy

1429
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:12,170
some not representing this group I'm

1430
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:14,210
participating in this HC group but it's

1431
01:15:12,170 --> 01:15:16,370
real individual view so don't take this

1432
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:18,320
as an official communication but I think

1433
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:21,050
it's related to the discussion as

1434
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:23,570
initiated by Brian on this a cycle

1435
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:25,639
system and I mean how to approach this

1436
01:15:23,570 --> 01:15:27,290
and maybe the fact that other groups are

1437
01:15:25,639 --> 01:15:31,010
doing something could could help us in

1438
01:15:27,290 --> 01:15:33,350
this process so just very quickly I have

1439
01:15:31,010 --> 01:15:35,330
a lot of slide but I will not present

1440
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:36,770
all of them this is in the slides for

1441
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:38,900
your reference if you want to look a bit

1442
01:15:36,770 --> 01:15:40,730
more but to give you some context so

1443
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:43,400
it's either SM it's an industry

1444
01:15:40,730 --> 01:15:44,690
standardization group in at C stands for

1445
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,920
zero touch network and service

1446
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:48,739
management so you can see with the

1447
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:50,600
relationship with anima it was created

1448
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:52,489
roughly two years ago it has been

1449
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:55,070
renewed for second two years terms

1450
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:58,190
recently so we trillion again for two

1451
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:59,630
years the main objectives and to end

1452
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:02,259
automated network and service management

1453
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:06,380
architecture that has been already

1454
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:08,860
provided to be supporting both with the

1455
01:16:06,380 --> 01:16:11,360
Greenfield and broomfield environments

1456
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:13,040
doesn't need to reinvent everything but

1457
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:14,750
to try to collaborate a lot with open

1458
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:17,239
source projects especially for instance

1459
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:20,270
onap which is the main contour part of

1460
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:25,070
this is G and also other standardization

1461
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:27,650
for the ietf EGP PSMA everything that is

1462
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:29,870
irrelevant for that I'm so created

1463
01:16:27,650 --> 01:16:32,059
foundation for diverse open such groups

1464
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:33,140
to produce interoperable solutions the

1465
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:35,810
idea is really to have something

1466
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:39,560
workable after links if you want to have

1467
01:16:35,810 --> 01:16:42,170
more documentation so this may look a

1468
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:44,930
bit complex but again the idea is not to

1469
01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:48,590
go into the data market texture but just

1470
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:51,050
to explain a few aspect of that so the

1471
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:55,220
group has been developing a framework

1472
01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:56,690
architecture one of the some of the key

1473
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:59,900
elements it's a service based

1474
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:02,929
architecture we are more used to see a

1475
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:04,879
functional based architecture so there

1476
01:17:02,930 --> 01:17:06,590
are some good advantages to that and

1477
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,500
especially if we think about a Z as

1478
01:17:06,590 --> 01:17:13,430
agents or services we could see a good

1479
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:16,550
fit with some potential reuse of these

1480
01:17:13,430 --> 01:17:18,320
aces in this architecture so you have

1481
01:17:16,550 --> 01:17:21,410
management services this is the atomic

1482
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,570
entity by providing a management service

1483
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:25,930
that is offered service based approach

1484
01:17:23,570 --> 01:17:28,940
and the management function is a

1485
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:31,310
implementation that is providing the

1486
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:34,280
user role to consume or produce a

1487
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:36,770
service so this is quite also software

1488
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,960
we hunted approach integration fabric is

1489
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,700
in fact a bus to connect all these

1490
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:44,870
services on the management functions

1491
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:48,139
together and so to provide also some

1492
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:50,480
utility services to discover to register

1493
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,190
to connect different forms of

1494
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,870
communication patterns can also be

1495
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:55,190
provided by the integration fabric so

1496
01:17:53,870 --> 01:17:56,809
the idea is really to provide a lot of

1497
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,910
Independence between the components and

1498
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:01,450
not to have each of the companies to win

1499
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:04,040
and then to implement different

1500
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:05,570
communication interfaces or discover

1501
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:07,850
interfaces but to rely on the shared

1502
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:11,900
components cross domain that has

1503
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:13,900
services this is to be able to collect

1504
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:15,860
data of course if you want to have

1505
01:18:13,900 --> 01:18:17,929
automation and close the loops you need

1506
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,580
to know what's happening so to collect

1507
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:21,380
data collect data from multiple sources

1508
01:18:19,580 --> 01:18:23,809
but also share those data between the

1509
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:26,300
different consumer of those data this

1510
01:18:23,810 --> 01:18:28,490
relates well to the work that I was

1511
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,680
mentioning and so this to make this

1512
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:32,750
available through this bus website

1513
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:33,950
typically or whatever form you would

1514
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:36,860
like to support

1515
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:39,620
management domain this is since as LSM

1516
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:41,960
aims to be applicable end to end I mean

1517
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:44,059
typically different network segment so

1518
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:45,590
administrative network so there is this

1519
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:47,810
notion of domain this is where

1520
01:18:45,590 --> 01:18:49,280
arbitrarily whatever deployment you will

1521
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:51,980
group your services and functions

1522
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:53,960
together so if you say I have a mobile

1523
01:18:51,980 --> 01:18:55,730
run a type of domain and it connects

1524
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:57,500
with the core domain and transport and

1525
01:18:55,730 --> 01:18:59,419
cetera so but each of the functions will

1526
01:18:57,500 --> 01:19:00,710
be handle at the scale of the domain and

1527
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:02,060
then you have this end-to-end service

1528
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:04,400
management domain which is to provide

1529
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:05,990
the entrant service view where you will

1530
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:07,849
point to the different domains in order

1531
01:19:05,990 --> 01:19:12,889
to realized or your service deployments

1532
01:19:07,850 --> 01:19:15,100
and service management this is just I

1533
01:19:12,890 --> 01:19:17,860
will not go through these three slides

1534
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:19,850
highlighting a bit more the different

1535
01:19:17,860 --> 01:19:22,700
components of the management domain the

1536
01:19:19,850 --> 01:19:24,410
entering service management domain some

1537
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:26,540
typical services that have been also

1538
01:19:24,410 --> 01:19:27,710
specified in the architecture so you can

1539
01:19:26,540 --> 01:19:29,260
see for the different domains data

1540
01:19:27,710 --> 01:19:32,930
collection analytics intelligence

1541
01:19:29,260 --> 01:19:35,690
orchestration control integration fabric

1542
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:37,880
services also for registration discovery

1543
01:19:35,690 --> 01:19:39,740
data services type of of services

1544
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:44,060
storage persistent services so this is

1545
01:19:39,740 --> 01:19:45,730
typical type of services one link I

1546
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:49,580
would like to make now this can be

1547
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:53,799
partially seen as a component of aces so

1548
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:53,800
we can also borrow from that if needed

1549
01:19:54,280 --> 01:20:00,980
infant aggression fabric details so now

1550
01:19:58,670 --> 01:20:03,770
a bit relationship to the Ada and closed

1551
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:05,179
groups aspects so there have been so

1552
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:08,230
this notion when if this is an

1553
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:11,120
automation framework to rely not

1554
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:15,410
mandatory but at least to use a closed

1555
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,240
loop operation we are not binding to any

1556
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:19,070
form of closed loop model this is just

1557
01:20:17,240 --> 01:20:20,599
to illustrate with that type of hope it

1558
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:21,950
will work with map K where whatever

1559
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,240
number of steps you would like to

1560
01:20:21,950 --> 01:20:24,800
implement in your closed loop but it's

1561
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:26,990
just to show that the essential steps

1562
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,640
you need to observe you need to get

1563
01:20:26,990 --> 01:20:31,370
information from the environment from

1564
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:34,400
your managed entity then to analyze this

1565
01:20:31,370 --> 01:20:37,700
information to end up with different

1566
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,099
types of insights run some reasoning to

1567
01:20:37,700 --> 01:20:40,429
derive decisions decision plans what to

1568
01:20:40,100 --> 01:20:43,220
do

1569
01:20:40,430 --> 01:20:45,620
with the current situation and then to

1570
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:48,020
make an action selection decision of

1571
01:20:45,620 --> 01:20:49,430
this on this on these plans to

1572
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:50,990
actuate on the resources or to

1573
01:20:49,430 --> 01:20:53,090
reconfigure some some different aspects

1574
01:20:50,990 --> 01:20:55,760
and you have in the middle and knowledge

1575
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:57,260
component that is used to I mean be a

1576
01:20:55,760 --> 01:21:02,710
repository of different knowledge that

1577
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:04,490
can be read read or written from so the

1578
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:06,380
architecture have been published in

1579
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:08,650
August this year it's available publicly

1580
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:11,090
on the on this link

1581
01:21:08,650 --> 01:21:14,269
what more recently has happen also in

1582
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:18,410
June the the group has adopted three

1583
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:20,810
documents on closed loop automation so

1584
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:23,180
one document is called enablers this is

1585
01:21:20,810 --> 01:21:26,510
typically what are the generic

1586
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:28,760
components that compose a a closed loop

1587
01:21:26,510 --> 01:21:31,550
and how these components needs to

1588
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:34,340
interact together in order to be I mean

1589
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:37,700
very flexible and fulfill different

1590
01:21:34,340 --> 01:21:39,380
types of deployment use cases so this is

1591
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:43,730
where I see the most relationship with

1592
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:46,160
Asia in anima the second document on

1593
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:48,620
solution this is to take the generic

1594
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:50,930
enablers on specific use cases and then

1595
01:21:48,620 --> 01:21:53,750
to try to say if I need to deploy a

1596
01:21:50,930 --> 01:21:56,060
network slice and to enlarge cycle of

1597
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:58,580
network slice over different domains

1598
01:21:56,060 --> 01:22:01,940
what are the typical protocol that exist

1599
01:21:58,580 --> 01:22:04,760
today to fulfill this dis this use case

1600
01:22:01,940 --> 01:22:06,440
and to reuse the enabler specified and

1601
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:11,360
see if there are things existing in Fiji

1602
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:13,370
PP in HC in ITF in BBF to realize these

1603
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:15,290
solutions if there are some gaps this

1604
01:22:13,370 --> 01:22:17,210
will be pointed out could be developed

1605
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:18,920
in the less mo could be sent back to the

1606
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:23,330
different SEO s2 to make the necessary

1607
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:25,310
changes and the last documents is so the

1608
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:27,710
first two documents are specification so

1609
01:22:25,310 --> 01:22:30,140
equivalent of external tracked documents

1610
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:33,020
the last one is a informationally to

1611
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:34,850
report it's more to a study like

1612
01:22:33,020 --> 01:22:37,520
next-generation types of closed group so

1613
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:39,560
to open the door to more use of

1614
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:43,340
artificial intelligence and different

1615
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:44,540
levels of autonomy but also everything

1616
01:22:43,340 --> 01:22:46,250
that could not fit in the two other

1617
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:48,710
documents that will be a bit too

1618
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:52,640
immature will fit into these advanced

1619
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:56,240
topics current state use of activity so

1620
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:59,600
they are made mainly to two drivers in

1621
01:22:56,240 --> 01:23:01,519
the design work ultra naval multi-vendor

1622
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:01,790
closed-loop design so you can translate

1623
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:05,540
that

1624
01:23:01,790 --> 01:23:09,019
how to enable multi-vendor Aiza is a AAS

1625
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:10,519
a design and specification and closed

1626
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,220
loop spanning multiple domains so this

1627
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:15,140
is typically if you have a some

1628
01:23:13,220 --> 01:23:18,140
processes management processes assurance

1629
01:23:15,140 --> 01:23:20,840
loop or optimization loops that spans

1630
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:23,420
through a different domains operating

1631
01:23:20,840 --> 01:23:26,390
domains or technology domains and so the

1632
01:23:23,420 --> 01:23:29,210
interactions among the domains to

1633
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:31,700
realize this closed loop operation the

1634
01:23:29,210 --> 01:23:34,400
same one we are targeting some I mean

1635
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:37,090
working on some requirements and also

1636
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:39,139
the design modeling of the closed loops

1637
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:41,120
what's important here these are great

1638
01:23:39,140 --> 01:23:44,330
advise I mean that's usually we have

1639
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:46,370
this also in animal view of asa or close

1640
01:23:44,330 --> 01:23:48,470
to being a kind of integrated components

1641
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:50,090
what we are pushing in the rest time is

1642
01:23:48,470 --> 01:23:53,510
also to say now this needs to be a bit

1643
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:54,260
more disaggregated they constructed so

1644
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,880
that you can have the different

1645
01:23:54,260 --> 01:23:59,030
components and how to compose this

1646
01:23:55,880 --> 01:24:01,310
component will be a key a key aspect of

1647
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:02,780
these enablers enabling a synchronous

1648
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:05,330
operation between the components and

1649
01:24:02,780 --> 01:24:06,620
also enabling multiple input and outputs

1650
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:08,540
between the closed loop stages on

1651
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:10,700
function this is not the kind of single

1652
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:12,230
path in the closed loop you can really

1653
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:14,510
see the service based approach that if

1654
01:24:12,230 --> 01:24:16,759
you have a data collection service that

1655
01:24:14,510 --> 01:24:20,180
can be used by multiple analysis

1656
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:21,500
functions for multiple closed loops so

1657
01:24:20,180 --> 01:24:23,240
this is to address the the key

1658
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:25,220
challenges of interoperability and

1659
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:28,099
composition of closed loop in a region

1660
01:24:25,220 --> 01:24:30,170
rich even though environment there isn't

1661
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:32,780
true so progressing on the list of

1662
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:34,790
scenarios exchange between the closed

1663
01:24:32,780 --> 01:24:36,559
loop stages for different use case

1664
01:24:34,790 --> 01:24:38,330
provisioning of new resources and

1665
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:43,250
sensation of backup resources dynamic

1666
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:46,730
monitoring cetera there are also two

1667
01:24:43,250 --> 01:24:48,610
typical models that we try to use as for

1668
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:51,169
our fault process so a kind of black box

1669
01:24:48,610 --> 01:24:52,730
closed loop this is typically what we

1670
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:54,410
see most of the time and as we say it

1671
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:57,799
correctly in Asia is a bit seen like

1672
01:24:54,410 --> 01:25:00,830
this you interface with this closed loop

1673
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:03,490
through an agent process but still you

1674
01:25:00,830 --> 01:25:06,350
have to convey a certain type of

1675
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:08,269
semantics through these interfaces for

1676
01:25:06,350 --> 01:25:09,770
governance information how to set the

1677
01:25:08,270 --> 01:25:12,770
goals your permitting condition of the

1678
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:14,300
scope of this closed loop coordination

1679
01:25:12,770 --> 01:25:15,649
between the closed loop means also to go

1680
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:19,369
through this agent

1681
01:25:15,649 --> 01:25:21,229
in exchange of knowledge information the

1682
01:25:19,369 --> 01:25:23,058
output interface convey the other way

1683
01:25:21,229 --> 01:25:25,010
cover governance information such as

1684
01:25:23,059 --> 01:25:26,869
exposure of capabilities constraints and

1685
01:25:25,010 --> 01:25:30,079
requirements different actions that were

1686
01:25:26,869 --> 01:25:31,159
taken or the status reports again also

1687
01:25:30,079 --> 01:25:33,489
providing the knowledge that has been

1688
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:35,749
discovered or produced and reactions

1689
01:25:33,489 --> 01:25:38,478
this closed-loop manager closed-loop

1690
01:25:35,749 --> 01:25:39,919
agent is a logical function responsible

1691
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:41,510
for managing the closed-loop external

1692
01:25:39,919 --> 01:25:42,619
interaction so this is how to interface

1693
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:46,249
with something that is not the

1694
01:25:42,619 --> 01:25:48,558
closed-loop but we have also which is

1695
01:25:46,249 --> 01:25:50,449
more the the focus of the activity this

1696
01:25:48,559 --> 01:25:52,879
white box closed-loop model so this is

1697
01:25:50,449 --> 01:25:55,369
still represented as a single component

1698
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:57,979
but in fact we you can remove this this

1699
01:25:55,369 --> 01:25:59,419
Square this dotted square to imagine

1700
01:25:57,979 --> 01:26:00,979
that the different stages are really

1701
01:25:59,419 --> 01:26:02,389
independent functions and we need to

1702
01:26:00,979 --> 01:26:04,369
connect them to compose them so this is

1703
01:26:02,389 --> 01:26:06,379
why we have in that case the same

1704
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:08,629
interfaces as the black box was do but

1705
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:10,820
we want also to support way to compose

1706
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:12,800
the different stages the steps of the

1707
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:14,719
closed-loop and also to have a

1708
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:16,219
capability description and pairwise

1709
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:18,709
characteristic information between

1710
01:26:16,219 --> 01:26:22,699
acquisition analysis decision and

1711
01:26:18,709 --> 01:26:24,648
implementation now making a bit the link

1712
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:27,768
between this work of closed loop in zsm

1713
01:26:24,649 --> 01:26:31,010
and animal on the Aces can you come to

1714
01:26:27,769 --> 01:26:32,780
an end after the last Latin so roughly

1715
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,579
my understanding is that the closed

1716
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:36,768
loops that are being investigated in the

1717
01:26:34,579 --> 01:26:40,249
Risa equivalent of the autonomic service

1718
01:26:36,769 --> 01:26:41,899
agents in in in anima the resin will

1719
01:26:40,249 --> 01:26:43,969
develop specification for closed loop

1720
01:26:41,899 --> 01:26:47,239
automation so how these different stages

1721
01:26:43,969 --> 01:26:50,059
can interact using different forms of

1722
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:52,728
mechanism and what needs to be specified

1723
01:26:50,059 --> 01:26:53,629
for that so on your neighbors generic

1724
01:26:52,729 --> 01:26:55,489
components of the closed-loop

1725
01:26:53,629 --> 01:26:58,760
interaction patterns and composition

1726
01:26:55,489 --> 01:27:00,768
means for the solutions so applying on

1727
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:03,309
different use case those enablers and we

1728
01:27:00,769 --> 01:27:05,929
using standard based components or

1729
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:07,579
protocols and for the alvin's topic this

1730
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:10,249
is more to investigate next generation

1731
01:27:07,579 --> 01:27:11,840
close to design and operations and in

1732
01:27:10,249 --> 01:27:16,749
identify potential area for future

1733
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:16,749
sterilization so that's it

1734
01:27:19,989 --> 01:27:28,419
any questions all right thank you very

1735
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:32,530
much thank you

1736
01:27:28,420 --> 01:27:32,530
last speaker of the evening please

1737
01:27:42,929 --> 01:28:05,860
that's not the right slide right this

1738
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:07,590
would be very quick so I think we talked

1739
01:28:05,860 --> 01:28:10,690
about this is the last meeting briefly

1740
01:28:07,590 --> 01:28:15,249
yep we'll skip the topics list anyway

1741
01:28:10,690 --> 01:28:18,449
can you line it up so just reminder that

1742
01:28:15,249 --> 01:28:21,670
the scenarios were talking about ones

1743
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:26,650
not direct competition with the

1744
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:29,349
traditional ACP the theory is that a

1745
01:28:26,650 --> 01:28:31,388
simpler layer-2 solution to the ACP

1746
01:28:29,349 --> 01:28:33,639
could be used on a very small enterprise

1747
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:36,429
or in a large enterprise that actually

1748
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:38,679
wants to chop its network up anyway and

1749
01:28:36,429 --> 01:28:41,349
then therefore would be willing to use

1750
01:28:38,679 --> 01:28:43,840
over to ACP in each segment of the

1751
01:28:41,349 --> 01:28:46,269
network the other thing which is

1752
01:28:43,840 --> 01:28:48,820
different from the real ACP is that at

1753
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:51,670
least for a small network some degree of

1754
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:54,070
pre configuration of the ACP nodes would

1755
01:28:51,670 --> 01:28:55,630
be acceptable because of that that's

1756
01:28:54,070 --> 01:28:57,340
something that doesn't scale to a large

1757
01:28:55,630 --> 01:29:02,289
network but would be okay in a smaller

1758
01:28:57,340 --> 01:29:04,269
network so we have a list of

1759
01:29:02,289 --> 01:29:07,030
requirements for the layer 2 technology

1760
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:12,940
and the draft must support v6 must

1761
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:14,559
support letter multicast MTU size it

1762
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:17,259
must be able to isolate a set of nodes

1763
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:20,249
in other words in a CPG LAN in practice

1764
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:23,469
and there must be some secure

1765
01:29:20,249 --> 01:29:26,320
authorization mechanism for access to

1766
01:29:23,469 --> 01:29:28,360
that VLAN which most VLANs will provide

1767
01:29:26,320 --> 01:29:31,420
one way or another and a few other

1768
01:29:28,360 --> 01:29:33,459
requirements all of this was in the

1769
01:29:31,420 --> 01:29:37,420
document before I just wanted to mention

1770
01:29:33,459 --> 01:29:40,360
the updates since last time we added a

1771
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:44,889
discussion of Mexico which is got an a I

1772
01:29:40,360 --> 01:29:47,469
Triple E magic number it's the good news

1773
01:29:44,889 --> 01:29:49,689
is that it supports multicast including

1774
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:52,869
group authentication the point of our

1775
01:29:49,689 --> 01:29:54,000
group authentication is some trust one

1776
01:29:52,869 --> 01:29:58,139
trust also there

1777
01:29:54,000 --> 01:30:00,900
know that there is a single trust model

1778
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:04,560
that covers all the multi casting nodes

1779
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:07,259
I had it applies across all VLANs but

1780
01:30:04,560 --> 01:30:11,880
the ACP VLAN of kind of crispy isolated

1781
01:30:07,260 --> 01:30:13,830
from the data plane VLAN independently

1782
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,710
of maxixe although it's they're both

1783
01:30:13,830 --> 01:30:20,910
protected by mexic they're also separate

1784
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:22,380
VLANs so they remain separate we noted

1785
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:25,769
in the draft that you could actually use

1786
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:31,200
some security on a Wi-Fi segment as well

1787
01:30:25,770 --> 01:30:31,830
by using a dedicated ESS for the lair to

1788
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,050
ACP

1789
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:36,030
that wouldn't be very elegant and it

1790
01:30:34,050 --> 01:30:37,470
provides an interesting problem of how

1791
01:30:36,030 --> 01:30:43,139
you would do bridging between the

1792
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:47,070
written word and wireless networks so

1793
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:49,320
basically that's all I have to say I'm

1794
01:30:47,070 --> 01:30:51,269
not asking for working rip adoption at

1795
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:52,860
this time I just like to know if people

1796
01:30:51,270 --> 01:30:58,260
are interested or if we should simply

1797
01:30:52,860 --> 01:31:01,320
whether this document expire personally

1798
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:04,130
I'm quite interested in this work but as

1799
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:06,870
working groups here I'm not sure that's

1800
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:10,440
because that's layer 2 is not

1801
01:31:06,870 --> 01:31:15,480
technically idea for scope so I would

1802
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:17,210
like to get yes also I'm worried a

1803
01:31:15,480 --> 01:31:20,519
little bit whether we have enough

1804
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:22,740
expertise in our working group to handle

1805
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:25,580
such work I'm pretty sure we don't and

1806
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:28,950
we have to go outside for the expertise

1807
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:33,930
Mark Smith some for the Indian society

1808
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:35,460
for this ITF um I work in the v6 ops and

1809
01:31:33,930 --> 01:31:38,280
there are six main groups and one of the

1810
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:40,650
thoughts I've had about RV v6 is in

1811
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:42,450
addition to solving lots of addresses

1812
01:31:40,650 --> 01:31:44,400
problems potentially in the future

1813
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:47,760
people will actually build much bigger

1814
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:50,280
VLANs because there's there's it's been

1815
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:52,020
traditional do slash 24s which implies a

1816
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,840
limit of 255 nodes

1817
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:55,770
obviously v6 with such 64's can support

1818
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:57,570
much bigger than that

1819
01:31:55,770 --> 01:31:58,950
so I think the constraint on size of

1820
01:31:57,570 --> 01:32:03,509
VLANs will really just be multicast

1821
01:31:58,950 --> 01:32:06,780
traffic so potentially you know subnets

1822
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:07,890
with 5,000 nodes on them won't be that

1823
01:32:06,780 --> 01:32:10,980
unusual in the future

1824
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:15,150
I've in the past seen VLANs with 4,000

1825
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:17,759
ipv4 hosts on them so maybe that this

1826
01:32:15,150 --> 01:32:23,700
sort of fits in with that deploying 400

1827
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:24,480
switches that sort of solution a Remora

1828
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:27,480
for Mehari

1829
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:30,089
I think the your scenario is quite

1830
01:32:27,480 --> 01:32:35,790
interesting so in your mind how big

1831
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:37,650
campus is defined I spake well I'm no

1832
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:40,170
expert in this at all but I do notice

1833
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:41,820
that you the ants won't answer your

1834
01:32:40,170 --> 01:32:45,720
question is the network and the Swiss

1835
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:49,080
hotel is too big the network in the

1836
01:32:45,720 --> 01:32:51,240
Swiss hotel is too big all right it is

1837
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:54,420
why they've had to switch off ipv6 so I

1838
01:32:51,240 --> 01:33:08,309
think the the limit might be you much

1839
01:32:54,420 --> 01:33:10,620
lower than you might want okay so here

1840
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:13,170
you have said that it should support

1841
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:17,519
ipv6 packets yeah and this package

1842
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:19,920
should be like I don't know from the

1843
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:25,830
aisle two perspective it is just one

1844
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:28,980
half from for every ipv6 packets so for

1845
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:30,600
ipv6 is just adding local well we could

1846
01:33:28,980 --> 01:33:34,259
work with linked local actually yeah

1847
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:38,780
I've been the grasp is designed to work

1848
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:44,400
with with link local if it has to and

1849
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:44,610
ipv6 is a mandatory option or not all

1850
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:47,250
right

1851
01:33:44,610 --> 01:33:49,410
that was sort of a starting point for

1852
01:33:47,250 --> 01:33:51,720
anima there's probably no reason you

1853
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:54,769
couldn't distort this and make it work

1854
01:33:51,720 --> 01:33:59,040
over v4 but it's never been you know

1855
01:33:54,770 --> 01:34:03,300
designed board for us I mean pure out

1856
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:05,130
was signaling ways that IP yeah I don't

1857
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:07,560
know any real reason why I couldn't be

1858
01:34:05,130 --> 01:34:09,570
remapped to ipv4 but it's you know it's

1859
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:14,160
not written that way in any of the specs

1860
01:34:09,570 --> 01:34:16,650
I mean does not mean I don't mean to ask

1861
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:20,550
you before I mean only layer two

1862
01:34:16,650 --> 01:34:26,309
messages I don't know

1863
01:34:20,550 --> 01:34:32,310
so here I'm asking that if IP is it is

1864
01:34:26,310 --> 01:34:34,290
optional oh it is meant for uh I don't

1865
01:34:32,310 --> 01:34:36,660
quite see any benefit in running

1866
01:34:34,290 --> 01:34:39,150
directly over letter packets but I mean

1867
01:34:36,660 --> 01:34:43,849
I suppose it could be done what do you

1868
01:34:39,150 --> 01:34:43,849
have to do is give me the API so here

1869
01:34:46,910 --> 01:34:55,050
and so here you mean that we should have

1870
01:34:52,140 --> 01:34:57,330
for example the i/o to hire and then we

1871
01:34:55,050 --> 01:35:00,510
have the ipv6 header and I'll show you

1872
01:34:57,330 --> 01:35:01,670
and then you can like transport some

1873
01:35:00,510 --> 01:35:08,520
grass for signaling

1874
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:12,720
okay okay we're already five minutes

1875
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:14,640
over time for the social yeah so just

1876
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:16,110
just quick comment to repeat especially

1877
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:18,150
in the context of what you were saying

1878
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:19,650
the one thing I'd like to make sure if

1879
01:35:18,150 --> 01:35:22,349
we continue this work is to you know

1880
01:35:19,650 --> 01:35:26,400
make sure that readers understand that

1881
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:30,420
the ACP today already supports managing

1882
01:35:26,400 --> 01:35:32,639
a layer 2 network in terms of if the

1883
01:35:30,420 --> 01:35:35,490
service you want to bring is not routed

1884
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:37,020
network by the Metropolitan where X's

1885
01:35:35,490 --> 01:35:38,490
network for example where all the

1886
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:41,070
devices are meant to do layer 2

1887
01:35:38,490 --> 01:35:44,460
switching you can run the ACP and only

1888
01:35:41,070 --> 01:35:46,170
the ACP will be hop-by-hop routed and I

1889
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:48,660
think that's a very good starting point

1890
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:50,640
to support you know let's say I Triple E

1891
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:52,440
technologies you know it so I think I

1892
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:53,940
would want to make it clear that just

1893
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:55,620
because you want to support networks

1894
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,509
where the services are let's say I

1895
01:35:55,620 --> 01:35:59,010
Triple E technologies large switch

1896
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:01,260
networks we don't need to change

1897
01:35:59,010 --> 01:36:02,880
absolutely and and and these things that

1898
01:36:01,260 --> 01:36:05,190
you're doing here basically need to be

1899
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:06,780
viewed I think and discussed more in

1900
01:36:05,190 --> 01:36:09,839
that context in terms of what are we

1901
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:12,090
gaining if the ACP itself isn't layer 3

1902
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,950
but also there - and I think that goes

1903
01:36:12,090 --> 01:36:17,070
into the depth of different type of

1904
01:36:13,950 --> 01:36:19,620
product limitations and we understand

1905
01:36:17,070 --> 01:36:24,120
that but I think that that is a lot more

1906
01:36:19,620 --> 01:36:27,150
explanation required ok five minutes it

1907
01:36:24,120 --> 01:36:30,510
will go into the next next version so a

1908
01:36:27,150 --> 01:36:32,099
quick quick information update there is

1909
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:34,290
a less we are working group link state

1910
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:37,410
vector routing they're working on what

1911
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:41,040
called layer free discovery and liveness

1912
01:36:37,410 --> 01:36:42,750
and that is a mechanism for

1913
01:36:41,040 --> 01:36:46,110
bootstrapping latch fabric based

1914
01:36:42,750 --> 01:36:48,690
apologies I would recommend to take a

1915
01:36:46,110 --> 01:36:56,070
look into that you might find a lot of

1916
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:59,549
good ideas there thank you lsv our link

1917
01:36:56,070 --> 01:37:05,250
state vector routing okay that's in a

1918
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:08,880
minute so I will do so okay yeah that's

1919
01:37:05,250 --> 01:37:11,760
very short session today

1920
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:16,140
seven minutes overtime I'm sincerely

1921
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:18,540
sorry for that so enjoying your social

1922
01:37:16,140 --> 01:37:22,400
events tonight hopefully see you

1923
01:37:18,540 --> 01:37:25,500
tomorrow also afternoon session breaks

1924
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:27,740
Brisky session okay thank you thank you

1925
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:27,740
guys
