1
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:47,280
okay now we're on welcome to tease first

2
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,519
of two sessions I'm blue Berger

3
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:58,500
it's blonde biram and we have Matt

4
00:00:50,520 --> 00:01:01,260
Hartley somewhere in the ether and so we

5
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:06,509
are at the IETF as you all know and we

6
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:10,079
have process that governs everything we

7
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:12,780
say and relates to everything we say in

8
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,639
the session and how we contribute to the

9
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,990
IETF if you're not familiar with it

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,840
please take a look at the note well URL

11
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:24,210
it's at the bottom go there basically

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,619
anything you say in this session becomes

13
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:27,619
part of our permanent record

14
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:39,060
we're recording both video and audio and

15
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:40,939
the video is also going out to remote

16
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,889
participants and we do have a couple

17
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:46,678
please make sure to use the microphone

18
00:01:43,889 --> 00:01:49,199
and state your name when you come to the

19
00:01:46,679 --> 00:01:54,659
mic even if you come to the mic multiple

20
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,639
times we're taking notes via etherpad as

21
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,619
we usually do please take a look at the

22
00:01:56,639 --> 00:02:01,170
URL actually this is the wrong URL but

23
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:03,630
it'll point you to the right one you can

24
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,779
also get that off the the tools page or

25
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:10,919
the agenda please contribute to that

26
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:12,930
it's very helpful particularly if you

27
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,579
say something at the mic note that your

28
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,980
name is correctly captured and your

29
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,980
comment is particularly captured

30
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,230
I'm laughing at the temperature here we

31
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:31,690
have someone sitting in the front with a

32
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:36,880
blanket where it's 90 degrees outside

33
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:39,970
but inside it's a little chilly so since

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,100
the last our last meeting we've had no

35
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,359
new RFC's but we do have a couple of

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,940
documents that have gone through the

37
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,150
process are in the editor queue thank

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:51,130
you to those who've been patient with

39
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:53,230
our process sometimes there's a lot of

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:57,460
comments that have to be addressed as we

41
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:59,560
go through the iesg and it takes a

42
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,330
little diligence to get through and it

43
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:03,070
does pay off in in getting the documents

44
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:06,250
and we're looking forward to seeing

45
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:10,000
these new RFC's we have one document

46
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:12,910
that's going through iesg processing we

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,620
have yet we don't have any adoptions or

48
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,310
new errata that have come in since the

49
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,620
last meeting

50
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,270
we're meeting twice this time this is

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:24,430
the first session thank you for coming

52
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:31,440
the second session is shown here and

53
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:36,880
it's also in this room our agenda is

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:39,040
it's pretty tight there have been some

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,150
shuffling and some changes since the

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,340
first time that it was posted the

57
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:47,620
current agenda is also what's reflected

58
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:53,560
in etherpad and so we can follow along

59
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:56,050
with what's there and that's true both

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,320
for the first session and and the second

61
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:04,840
session and we expect both of them to be

62
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,970
pretty full oops here we go we've had a

63
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,490
liaison and a communication that's come

64
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:18,820
in one is on the OTN sanitization work

65
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:22,710
plan we had talked about doing a

66
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:26,140
response to this and we had asked

67
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:31,359
okay that was Daniela who's not in the

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:32,050
room to draft a response or he had

69
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,150
volunteered

70
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:38,620
do that we have yet to see anything

71
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:41,849
there so we'll well Pavan has already

72
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:44,830
sent a mail asking for an update on that

73
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:48,909
we've also received a communication from

74
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,919
Etsy and Daniel he's going to talk about

75
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:57,310
that remotely so hopefully he will show

76
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:59,080
at some point we'd like to remind the

77
00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:03,310
working group that we have an IPR

78
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:06,370
process that we follow both before

79
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:09,219
adoption and then before last call we

80
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,050
ask that all contributors and authors

81
00:05:09,219 --> 00:05:13,629
directly respond obviously anyone else

82
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:15,370
in the working group can respond but

83
00:05:13,629 --> 00:05:17,560
without a response from all contributors

84
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:23,740
and authors we don't move the documents

85
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:25,419
forward please do utilize the list we

86
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,770
definitely allocate time in here in

87
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:31,448
order of obviously working group

88
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:35,948
documents but also lists discussion

89
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:49,599
particularly on new topics and I think

90
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:53,460
that's it for this one we look at the

91
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,460
status of the working of documents next

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,630
these are the working group documents

93
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,270
that are not on the agenda today these

94
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:03,729
will be covered in the next few slides

95
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,639
first up is the a CT and yang document

96
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:09,039
this is the document that talks about

97
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:11,500
applicability of various young models

98
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,289
lacey TN there was one revision

99
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,529
published for this in august apart from

100
00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:18,818
fixing some material knits it also

101
00:06:16,529 --> 00:06:20,430
addressed comments that are raised by

102
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:23,740
seacams

103
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:26,860
transport NB IDT team this these

104
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:30,580
comments are sent to the list as far as

105
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,009
consensus for this draft course the

106
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,400
understanding was that we would wait on

107
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:39,159
that generic tea model drafts to

108
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,250
progress and then revisit this that

109
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:44,349
remains the current stance in the

110
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,770
meantime if there are any reviews please

111
00:06:44,349 --> 00:06:51,430
do send them in

112
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,289
next is the draft that talks about gmpls

113
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:56,289
signalling extensions for shared mesh

114
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:58,960
protection no new revision since last

115
00:06:56,289 --> 00:07:02,169
time there are still some open issues

116
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,998
that need to get our trust there was

117
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:07,688
some discussion at the last meeting

118
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:10,650
about sending a liaison to idat just

119
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:12,909
stating that we are working on this and

120
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,008
asking if they have any expectations

121
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:17,199
from this activity we're going to ask

122
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:19,270
each other to put that together we

123
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,059
haven't done that yet and we'll take it

124
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:25,479
from there

125
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:27,909
next is the PC native IP document there

126
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,339
was a revision published for this the

127
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,009
authors do do state that they have

128
00:07:30,339 --> 00:07:34,689
another round of updates before they can

129
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,509
say it's ready to progress to the next

130
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,849
state there's also some open discussion

131
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:42,909
that needs to be had about moving this

132
00:07:39,849 --> 00:07:44,319
from experimental to standards track Lew

133
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:47,259
and I will have further discussion on

134
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,919
that and then make a call before we take

135
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,919
it to the next stage

136
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:56,110
next is the PCC sea use cases document

137
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:59,379
no changes since last time I this

138
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:01,060
continues to be a living document the

139
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:03,310
currently there is no intent to take it

140
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,139
through the publication process but as

141
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:08,740
always we will revisit it in due course

142
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:10,990
of time for now please keep reviewing as

143
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:15,129
more and more use cases get added to

144
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:17,649
this living document next is the RSVP RM

145
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:20,080
our extensions document no changes since

146
00:08:17,649 --> 00:08:21,580
last time the author's claim that the

147
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,409
raft is stable but they do acknowledge

148
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,688
there is another round of update that

149
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:28,120
needs to be made in the meantime they're

150
00:08:25,689 --> 00:08:33,190
seeking feedback so please to give it to

151
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:37,328
them if they have any next is the SF

152
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,829
aware topology Model draft there were a

153
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:40,750
fair number of comments received for

154
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:43,149
this from Tom patch on the list

155
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,130
most of those caught addressed in the

156
00:08:43,149 --> 00:08:51,010
last version but there's still some

157
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:53,050
outstanding issues that need need a need

158
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:55,180
an update to cover those once that is

159
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:59,260
done the others are stating it can be

160
00:08:55,180 --> 00:09:01,270
taken to jung da-jung depressed review

161
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:05,350
next is the tea metric recording graph

162
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:07,210
we did start the pre last call i peopole

163
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:08,920
for this still waiting on a couple of

164
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,690
responses once those are in we should be

165
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,870
able to initiate the last call process

166
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:19,450
the last update and this deck is for the

167
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:21,190
key topology and tunnel modeling draft

168
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:23,260
is basically the tutorial document that

169
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,690
talks about how to ease use the various

170
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:29,260
models that we are producing this again

171
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:32,620
a living document there are few more use

172
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:34,360
cases in the pipeline so keep keep an

173
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,580
eye out for those as and when they come

174
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:39,390
and send him your reviews if you have

175
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:44,980
any that's all we have in this deck

176
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:48,330
first up is an update on the various T

177
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,330
models tarick

178
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:13,750
good afternoon I'm Tarek giving you a

179
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:20,410
quick update on the modelling drafts

180
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:23,320
that we're driving and Inti's so the

181
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,180
agenda is the updates and I'll go over

182
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,270
the open issues and the next steps for

183
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:33,430
each of the documents the first document

184
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:35,010
is that easy nte the current provision

185
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:39,069
is 22

186
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:43,540
this document covers two modules te and

187
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:47,470
t device the yang so the status is it

188
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:50,589
went and undergone a yang dr. review on

189
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:53,230
revision 21 we had received several

190
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:56,380
comments and we're working on addressing

191
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:59,410
them I'll be going over the plan to

192
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:03,070
address each comment that we received on

193
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:04,360
the next slide the next step is we will

194
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,790
be addressing the comments as I

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:09,780
mentioned and after that we'll be

196
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,689
requesting a working group master home

197
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:17,410
so for the first module we have received

198
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:21,280
a number of comments the first is to use

199
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:24,520
that derived from or self instead of

200
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,240
equality in when checks this is a more

201
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,530
elaborate an enhanced way and we accept

202
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:37,150
it and we will be addressing that there

203
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:41,230
is a comment of using groupings for for

204
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:42,970
single instantiation commonly you would

205
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,390
have groupings when you want to use it

206
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:48,600
multiple places it's possible that we

207
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:51,699
were thinking and in fact it is the case

208
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,290
some groupings are used externally by

209
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:58,570
other documents or modules so it doesn't

210
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:01,569
appear in our module but they're used in

211
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,690
other documents so this is under

212
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:06,820
investigation at the moment and we will

213
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:11,940
act on it accordingly

214
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:17,010
accordingly the other comment we have is

215
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:18,960
use of the leaf RAF with a relative path

216
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:21,569
this makes it difficult to reuse the

217
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,960
grouping so the suggestion is to use the

218
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:26,700
absolute path and that's fine we will

219
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,410
accept that and actually I take action

220
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,570
on it

221
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:32,280
consistency in the description for

222
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,160
example terminate the description with a

223
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:40,530
full stop makes sense total sense we're

224
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:44,420
gonna go and update that the metric of

225
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:47,610
melody - seconds was suggested to

226
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:51,930
replace it by milliseconds and that's

227
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:54,330
fine and we'll do that there is a

228
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:57,390
comment about Association object use in

229
00:12:54,330 --> 00:13:00,270
our model and on fixing the reference

230
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:03,569
and lastly we want to add meaningful

231
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:09,420
descriptions on the our pcs and we will

232
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:11,880
act on that the next module is the T -

233
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:16,740
device it also received a number of

234
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:20,220
comments again avoid you the the

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:24,270
grouping if it is single used that's

236
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,880
fine we will act on it the same comment

237
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:33,780
that we got about absolutely fraf versus

238
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:35,880
relative and redundant range expression

239
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,560
so there are cases where we are putting

240
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,620
a range where it doesn't make sense

241
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,890
that's already defined as 16 bits or 32

242
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:52,440
bits of the ranges dictated by how many

243
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:54,090
you know by the data type itself so the

244
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:57,600
last comment is to populate where we

245
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:59,520
have our pcs and notifications we we

246
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,010
either will remove that part if we don't

247
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,189
need it or will populate it it's under

248
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:04,189
investigation

249
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:11,310
so the second document is yank - RSVP

250
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,820
currently it's at revision 11 it has two

251
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:18,689
modules RSVP and RSVP extended this had

252
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:20,820
undergone a Yank doctor review we had

253
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:23,010
received comments and addressed all of

254
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:25,740
them in fact and there are no open

255
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:27,450
issues at the moment the next steps we

256
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,189
want to request a working group last

257
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,019
call

258
00:14:29,189 --> 00:14:35,699
and take it to iesg next so this is kind

259
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:47,249
of stable document that we want to

260
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:51,089
progress sure now is good so do you want

261
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:52,619
to press but I think the first question

262
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:56,189
is do you want to progress these as a

263
00:14:52,619 --> 00:14:58,679
set or individually so specifically this

264
00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,118
document and these two modules I think

265
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:04,079
they can progress on their own now

266
00:15:00,119 --> 00:15:05,579
they're RSVP specific they're not

267
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,128
traffic engineering there are the base

268
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,839
RSVP I don't think they need to wait for

269
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:15,660
the other ones okay that's my personal

270
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:20,179
opinion by the way all right and the

271
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:23,309
authors I think speaking for the authors

272
00:15:20,179 --> 00:15:27,029
okay thank you

273
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:30,809
the next document is RSVP - te it is

274
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:35,009
covering two modules are de te base and

275
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:38,189
the MPLS the status there are no open

276
00:15:35,009 --> 00:15:40,639
issues this hasn't been reviewed by

277
00:15:38,189 --> 00:15:42,410
young doctors yet so you want to ask

278
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,689
nicely

279
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,569
for our young doctor review on on these

280
00:15:45,689 --> 00:15:51,509
two modules we already put in the

281
00:15:48,569 --> 00:15:57,870
request and it's scheduled to be done by

282
00:15:51,509 --> 00:16:00,689
15th of December thank you and I think

283
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:04,350
this this is the the last document it is

284
00:16:00,689 --> 00:16:07,649
he - MPLS and it has a single module

285
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:10,439
there there is open discussions

286
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:13,290
incorporating MPLS DP constructs into

287
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:16,799
this module will work with Otello and

288
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:19,769
the team to see if we need another

289
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:22,429
document for this or another module or

290
00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:26,160
we incorporate it in the same document

291
00:16:22,429 --> 00:16:29,730
so the next steps would be to close on

292
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
this discussion and and see where we're

293
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,610
headed

294
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,529
and we will let the working group know

295
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:36,529
about what we come up with

296
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:44,760
so that's it thank you and happy to

297
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,760
answer any question you have

298
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,250
are there any reservations about moving

299
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:52,840
these documents to last call we'd like

300
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:54,520
to really these have been going on for

301
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,970
quite a while and they're pretty mature

302
00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,069
I know I have some technical comments

303
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,230
that I can certainly cover on the list

304
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:05,740
and I don't think blocks last call but

305
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:08,770
we definitely want to wrap these up so

306
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,510
if there's any comments on them from

307
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,180
people who have reviewed the documents

308
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:15,339
it would be good to raise them now if

309
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,230
you don't have comments and haven't read

310
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,958
it the documents recently please do and

311
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:23,920
expect that we're gonna have last call

312
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:26,050
as soon as we get the bits of updates

313
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,550
from the yang dr. one of the big

314
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:31,720
questions I had is whether to wait for

315
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:35,830
that and move them as a set or move them

316
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,300
as to sets its out it sounds like you

317
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:40,540
think we could probably move them as

318
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:43,540
either two or three sets yeah you know

319
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,940
maybe just the them go together yeah at

320
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:47,409
least two yeah maybe three yeah all

321
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,600
right thank you okay thank you

322
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,410
and although there's no comments so

323
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,409
that's okay

324
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:20,610
I'm assuming more from rotten monoxide

325
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,759
come here quick update to toe documents

326
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:28,439
when is the layer 3 tier topology model

327
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:32,759
and another one is the SRT tornados or

328
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,919
first let's look at this odd leery Tea

329
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:38,340
Party

330
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:43,200
so the status is that we don't have any

331
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,418
change instance last IETF we asked is

332
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,989
resolving the young doctors reveal

333
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:53,700
comments so editorial changes had been

334
00:18:48,989 --> 00:18:58,259
completed and we have send our responses

335
00:18:53,700 --> 00:19:02,909
to the questions they raised and we

336
00:18:58,259 --> 00:19:05,249
haven't heard a confirmation so we are

337
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:10,559
still waiting and we see that they will

338
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:13,980
have further questions one question from

339
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:19,230
the secant people they are doing some

340
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:21,899
augmentations to this model so the

341
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:24,779
question here is how to way to

342
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:32,908
documentation for the internet and I'm

343
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:38,629
amperes TP it was here but anyway so we

344
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:44,389
have two options we can either argument

345
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:48,719
the pace t the theater party model to

346
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:54,209
Internet and I'm curious at the same

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:57,179
level and the TE project packet

348
00:19:54,210 --> 00:20:04,109
extension which is defined in this

349
00:19:57,179 --> 00:20:07,590
document this is fine because the the

350
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:09,869
supporting model has this nice feature

351
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:14,488
you can do multiple inheritance so

352
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:20,220
another way to do this this is a we

353
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:26,009
asked them to argument the tea

354
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:29,840
eternity and impressed teepee models to

355
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,840
the packet extension

356
00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:37,919
I should think quick question about this

357
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,769
requirement just to clarify we're asking

358
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,070
for even a teat apology is it because we

359
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:47,340
want to set up Ethernet LS B's and if

360
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:52,559
yes do we have a way to set up Ethernet

361
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:57,168
LS B's you are asking that he departed

362
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,168
model specific questions here

363
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,209
Erica game and this air has been

364
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:14,909
clarified the last week we leaned into

365
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:17,309
the microwave in here well I see we

366
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:20,399
discussing Montreal talking about the

367
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:25,889
usage jobs isn't a teat apology which is

368
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:29,219
used to provide update information after

369
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:34,529
that the ethernet is configured into the

370
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:37,110
underlying cause not necessarily to be

371
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:40,590
RSP but the quality information should

372
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:43,529
be useful okay just to collect the

373
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:52,500
topology of Ethernet switches and links

374
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:54,990
is that something to our other generic

375
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:00,559
tea and the tunnel right sótano you're

376
00:21:54,990 --> 00:22:00,559
really not part of the Toyota model yeah

377
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:16,289
so the we had either option will work so

378
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:19,440
one option we required the out the key

379
00:22:16,289 --> 00:22:25,860
extension know that Ethernet extension

380
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:28,240
and MP RTP must have the packet

381
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,760
extension the other one

382
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:37,240
make what make it the optional the the

383
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:40,030
adoption can put in the packet options

384
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,910
and make it work so the question is do

385
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,800
we have any preference or we just let

386
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:51,430
the tea come people do whatever they

387
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:53,260
want to do you think about MPs CP

388
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:56,770
extension because you think you don't

389
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,220
need ampere ste topology correct spec it

390
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:05,100
is enough for NPS T we don't hire we

391
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,100
don't need have the and caste it apart

392
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:17,830
that's current situation unless unless

393
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:23,550
you find something we need to do that so

394
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,550
anyone has any opinions our preferences

395
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:34,330
I agree with that both option works but

396
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:37,750
I'm not sure whether we have so far any

397
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:40,210
quantitative evaluation on which whether

398
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:42,730
there are some common sections as a

399
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:45,790
general one so that we can we can use

400
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:52,270
use a more generic types rather than

401
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:55,470
make it a small pieces generic types of

402
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:55,470
types is here

403
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:09,530
so that actually packet extension only I

404
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:12,270
did a few structures for like

405
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,790
performance monitoring and some other

406
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:17,220
packets specific options is that nothing

407
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:20,100
to do with the labels and the fun way is

408
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,580
all the normal extension you're doing

409
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:25,889
for the ethernet it's a totally

410
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:31,110
independent so they don't interfere each

411
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:37,530
other right so that's why you have this

412
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:39,750
option right so so we can talk if no

413
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,540
other people don't have opinions just

414
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:53,820
that we can talk further and decided by

415
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:57,420
all the packet extension we defined in

416
00:24:53,820 --> 00:25:01,610
this the document the Tia technology

417
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:06,000
packet which is meant to be for both

418
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:09,540
Internet and unpressed TP so well this

419
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,110
this extension will cover the encoding

420
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:18,450
types of post packet and the ethernet

421
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:26,699
specified in RFC 3471 so we are not

422
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:33,450
trying to separate them all so beside

423
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:35,880
that we have currently have a te working

424
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:39,810
group that we have network slicing p90

425
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:41,210
and which is currently examines some of

426
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,909
the requirement

427
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,560
potentially could be applied to the

428
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:53,610
nursery to party in that happens will

429
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:57,760
incorporate them into the layers report

430
00:25:53,610 --> 00:26:00,639
model instead of slicing model

431
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,679
so that's it so we are trying to resolve

432
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:06,459
all the issues and never move forward

433
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:12,460
that's for this document the next one is

434
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:16,740
the SR and as RTE so the chain changes

435
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:20,019
very high since last time are the

436
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,679
alignments with the latest dependencies

437
00:26:20,019 --> 00:26:27,370
so when last time when we received the

438
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:32,860
uncocks review they had some comments on

439
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:38,610
the coping we used from the sprint I

440
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:42,879
start cameras our model so we send this

441
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:46,418
feedback to the authors in their model

442
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,649
and then they create on the changings

443
00:26:46,419 --> 00:26:52,960
and so they have put the change in their

444
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:56,260
grouping so we can pick up automatically

445
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:59,860
so in that case we just revert the

446
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:02,669
changes we did here in this model the

447
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:06,969
changes we are not belong here anyway so

448
00:27:02,669 --> 00:27:09,880
then we have some clean up then we are

449
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:13,720
continuing resolving the toxic review we

450
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:19,570
send all the replies still have another

451
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:23,919
confirmation yet then the next step will

452
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:28,720
be completed all those things and so we

453
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,700
keep eyes on the common second writing

454
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,130
model whenever they change anything we

455
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:40,529
need to the change accordingly

456
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:40,529
that's it thank you comments

457
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,570
yep a Thai speaking so on my command the

458
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:52,450
utility went into the first chapter so

459
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:56,169
uh given that option wine into selected

460
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:58,480
besides Ethernet and MC STP are there

461
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:04,570
any other packet technologists can use

462
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:08,590
this packet models the packet what

463
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:12,490
packet knowledge is what is yeah so

464
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:14,559
besides Ethernet and the TP packet

465
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:25,740
technologists can use this kind of you

466
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:35,440
know are currently we don't have other I

467
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:37,600
P native IP native so it's a that would

468
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:44,530
be yeah that's covered in the layers

469
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:47,939
right here right so what other

470
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:52,480
technologies are you thinking about I

471
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,940
don't know I just to say this kind of

472
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,850
picture because like them if this you

473
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,250
know our options negative besides

474
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:02,678
Ethernet and i'm just iridescent and

475
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:05,080
there's no other you know our pic

476
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:10,300
technology of can use this kind of model

477
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:12,250
so on why we chose to option one well I

478
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,780
was waiting for you as since your C camp

479
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,490
chair I was waiting for you to bring in

480
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,040
some technologies from there I know

481
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:20,440
there's some photo and at least some

482
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,210
thought on on wireless related to

483
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,940
microwave but that's not really a packet

484
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,070
technology but there is this boss that's

485
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:29,640
happening tomorrow on Raw where they're

486
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:33,250
talking about other wireless packet

487
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,690
engineered technology so I didn't know

488
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,470
if that's the way you were going but

489
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:38,860
they're you know there might be

490
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:40,929
something there you know I I wouldn't be

491
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:42,280
surprised if the the topic that's talked

492
00:29:40,929 --> 00:29:46,690
about in raw actually ends up in your

493
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:49,210
working group if not its own but ok

494
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:52,840
anyway I think maybe I we can have more

495
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:54,260
discussion don't say chemist and to get

496
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:56,389
more feedback

497
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:00,200
anyway we should you know make a

498
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:04,549
decision on these two options right sure

499
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,320
okay okay yeah let's call that yes one

500
00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:09,049
of the things that's causing me remains

501
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,428
key to be having some discomfort with

502
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:14,750
the second document and this comes from

503
00:30:12,429 --> 00:30:17,900
other documents that are showing up in

504
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:20,270
like debt net is what is really srte and

505
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:22,900
do we have a definition of it and you

506
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:25,850
know sort of squirts on the edge with sr

507
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,290
with srte topology because we're not

508
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:30,290
saying what service is going over the

509
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:34,280
topology so I think we're okay there but

510
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:36,230
if so this is an informal question to

511
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,370
the working group is how many would be

512
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:43,250
interested in working on a definition of

513
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:46,909
srte and what that would mean you know

514
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:48,440
we have policy SR policy but not a good

515
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:51,650
definition of sr team keep your hands up

516
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,390
for a moment so there there's probably

517
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:58,400
enough people to actually work in that

518
00:30:53,390 --> 00:31:00,380
so one of the questions for the work the

519
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,299
spring working group chairs is do they

520
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,190
want to do it in their working group or

521
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:08,240
in here so thank you for that

522
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:10,390
information that's a nice data point all

523
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,390
right

524
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:36,880
okay good afternoon I'm going to present

525
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,540
an update I'm sorry Bellotti speaking

526
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,090
from Nokia I'm going to present a big

527
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:47,920
tear guarding a young mother four-part

528
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:50,770
computation request well I'm sorry we

529
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:56,730
have some problem about the uploading of

530
00:31:50,770 --> 00:32:00,700
the of the draft because there is a

531
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:02,830
pending issue with the T eternal that

532
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,570
apparently was expired

533
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:11,260
I said they need to put a view and

534
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:15,669
yesterday we succeed - now there is a

535
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:18,100
line so III send a message and also the

536
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:21,300
text that the email for the working

537
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:27,070
group about the changes before there

538
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:31,600
okay so they did the changes as

539
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:36,010
basically providing a proposal not a

540
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,350
young model modification regarding one

541
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:42,940
of the basic issue that remain in the

542
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:45,159
list so to avoid - - to have the

543
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:53,140
possibility to request but computation

544
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:57,720
for protected tunnel so the day the

545
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:02,940
issue the the proposal is a addressing

546
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:07,720
two type of scenarios so the the request

547
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:12,640
to compute both working and protected

548
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:16,930
path for a tunnel that not exist yet so

549
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:19,120
Greene's field situation or to optimize

550
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:23,530
the situation and to compute the

551
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:27,969
protection part to add protection for an

552
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:30,730
existing tunnel we for this proposal we

553
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,580
take we took the into account the

554
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:37,170
feedback that we had in the previous

555
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:39,560
meeting about this issue

556
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:42,990
regarding the factor to have only one

557
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:47,100
request that encompass both protecting a

558
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:50,900
protected part or to have two different

559
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:53,760
Pat requests within the same Arab seek

560
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:58,440
and that the feedback from working group

561
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:03,240
was this dis option so dissing factor is

562
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:07,560
the table that we prepare and so we we

563
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,168
will enter to the option to and and with

564
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,880
this proposal what we made is that we

565
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:17,089
addressed the issue that the

566
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:23,130
disadvantage that for for option two

567
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:27,330
apparently is related to this dis option

568
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:32,250
so they need to define association

569
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:35,190
between part that has to be used in the

570
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:39,750
in the same tunnel and the duplication

571
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:42,840
of tunnel parameter per tunnel in case

572
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:46,489
you have multiple requests so basically

573
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:50,280
the proposal permits first to associate

574
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:55,399
multiple Pat requests that is intended

575
00:34:50,280 --> 00:35:01,350
to be used within the same tunnel and

576
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:03,259
the second is succeed to avoid repeating

577
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:07,200
the settled tunnel

578
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:12,510
third tunnel based for any funny

579
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:15,359
requested part and these consequently

580
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:17,940
permitted the server to easily

581
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,040
understand what are the attributes that

582
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,900
is related to the tunnel and what is the

583
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:29,190
attributes that is a configure third

584
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:31,680
part okay we do not made yet the yang

585
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:35,490
modification because first we would like

586
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,720
to add opinion of the working group on

587
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:43,560
the proposal so this is the basic yang

588
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:50,370
tree that would be as a consequence of

589
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:56,640
our totes and we basically

590
00:35:50,370 --> 00:36:04,859
the detangle Association structure that

591
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:08,759
is in fact is permit to associate paths

592
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:13,290
that are or referencing an existing

593
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:17,010
tunnel so when they when computing the

594
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:21,750
protection to add protection

595
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:27,650
add to an existing tunnel or referencing

596
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:31,230
an entry in the new list in which we

597
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:36,630
provided a list of Association

598
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:41,550
identifiers and so when the tunnel does

599
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:44,490
not exist you you can have this

600
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:47,250
association identifier between the

601
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,910
different requester to associate which

602
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:53,670
are to be associated with the same time

603
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:56,190
at the same time in the list are

604
00:36:53,670 --> 00:37:00,570
reported also all the lists of the

605
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:03,240
tunnel of the tunnel attributes that is

606
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:07,760
related to the tunnel to avoid the

607
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:11,660
problem to repeat for any computed part

608
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:16,770
the configuration of the same attributes

609
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:19,049
and the Association the tunnel

610
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:25,680
Association also provides information

611
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:30,240
about water about the role of the path

612
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:36,600
request is for so if it is a primary or

613
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:43,490
secondary part the the other another

614
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:46,460
part of the of the possibility is a 2f

615
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:51,140
destructor so the tunnel attributes that

616
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:54,060
addressed the collection of the

617
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:57,450
attributes related to the tunnel in case

618
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:00,450
you have the unprotected panel so you

619
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:03,779
have only single path not requested to

620
00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:08,759
associate any requests related to

621
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:11,970
tange added pointed so the server has

622
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:16,800
all in the information to create a

623
00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:21,660
tunnel in case for with energy

624
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:24,990
operational at a store and we already

625
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:28,910
added ended the document the possibility

626
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:31,410
to have disassociation of computed part

627
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:34,410
with the tunnel that has not yet been

628
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:36,779
created and so this is the case and the

629
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:43,799
server will have all the information to

630
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:47,100
know how to create the tunnel this is

631
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,940
also implied permitted to have a more

632
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:56,069
strength and alignment with with the

633
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:58,980
tettemer model ok this is the proposal

634
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:05,550
so the job the situation of the open

635
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:10,020
issue basically we have still 10 open

636
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:13,320
point but 5 are still related to align

637
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:17,910
with the discussion with the eternal a

638
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:21,300
group instead the 5 are specific for

639
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:25,589
path computation RPC but three out of

640
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:28,950
the them are all related to this issue

641
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:33,120
so we think that once that we have

642
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:38,100
solved it and this proposal can can be

643
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:42,240
providing in young we can have an easily

644
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:44,339
path to solve also the other issue that

645
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,549
are forbidden internal and the

646
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:50,700
directional pad with a symmetric part

647
00:39:47,550 --> 00:39:53,940
properties and and the other two issue

648
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,120
are one ended editorials or review of

649
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,610
terminology and the other is as soon as

650
00:39:57,120 --> 00:40:01,980
the young model is stable we would like

651
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:06,320
to have an example to introduce an

652
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,320
example for path computation request

653
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:15,090
so the next step is obviously we

654
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:17,550
continue operation with the T eternal

655
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:20,810
model outers because we have still

656
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:27,210
five opening shoe that you are painting

657
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:31,080
together with them and provide guidance

658
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:36,450
for technology specific so sync up with

659
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:40,770
your TN tunnel model outdoors and w.zahn

660
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:45,779
and flex grid obviously our plan would

661
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:51,630
be to require a young daughter review

662
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:56,310
for July meeting thank you

663
00:40:51,630 --> 00:41:09,540
I direct from juniper if you can go back

664
00:40:56,310 --> 00:41:13,320
to slide six feet six six okay so you're

665
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:17,279
defining the association ID here as

666
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:20,670
32-bit number we have defined an

667
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:22,860
association some something similar to

668
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:26,310
Association object that we all know

669
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:29,100
about it's already defined for our GP

670
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,040
but the idea would you would have an

671
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:35,910
association type as well what type of

672
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:44,029
Association you want is that carotid

673
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:47,190
nurse diversity to provide information

674
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:50,090
regarding which of the requested part

675
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:54,110
has to be associated with the same time

676
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:57,300
yeah but what kind of Association is it

677
00:41:54,110 --> 00:42:00,540
is it just one to one mapping or like

678
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,460
ownership or is it like I want to be

679
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:05,250
diverse from this tunnel

680
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,640
I want two paths that's diverse from the

681
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:10,350
Stano Derek the association is pointed

682
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,390
to one entry in the list below the

683
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:14,460
Italian Association list where you

684
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:17,040
provide the tunnel attributes and then

685
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,620
you say these paths should be part of

686
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:21,630
this tunnel and then there is a role it

687
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,130
has to be the primary path the secondary

688
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:26,370
part or the reverse primer or the

689
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:27,960
reverse secondary so that's the idea is

690
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,250
that with this patter associated by

691
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,290
being into a tunnel

692
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:33,630
not by okay may

693
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:35,970
I'm getting confused because with

694
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:39,360
Association there is a Association type

695
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:42,870
here it's just a Association employer

696
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:49,710
eternal as part of the saint tunnel okay

697
00:42:42,870 --> 00:42:52,710
me maybe renamed because it's okay we

698
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:56,090
can take it offline an aim is to provide

699
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:58,530
infrared that is going to associate yeah

700
00:42:56,090 --> 00:43:00,840
it's confused by the term Association

701
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,340
which refers which implies some

702
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:06,270
Association objects which is not the

703
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:09,960
case here okay thank you

704
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:11,670
maybe we need to better mean group I had

705
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,740
the similar question because in both be

706
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,660
seventies we have that Association so

707
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:18,660
bit confused by that but let's move on

708
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:21,410
the second is why is it a choice between

709
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:25,290
putting a reference to a tunnel or a

710
00:43:21,410 --> 00:43:26,730
tunnel Association because now I think I

711
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,529
get a little bit idea because you don't

712
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:31,080
think of this Association as a bigger

713
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:33,810
Association where we can associate LSPs

714
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:36,020
across tunnels as well but in your case

715
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:38,730
you want to do it only for one ton of

716
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:41,610
like is that what what's happening here

717
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:43,950
that's why it's a choice yes the choice

718
00:43:41,610 --> 00:43:47,340
you mean the choice for tunnel a

719
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:49,439
reference and Association Edie my

720
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:52,320
question is why limit inside the tunnel

721
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,020
only why can't Park computations be

722
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,670
associated across as well because in

723
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,070
both piece F and otherwise we have

724
00:43:56,670 --> 00:44:00,990
allowed that is there a particular

725
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:05,460
reason that you want to limit it only

726
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:08,759
for inside a tunnel the reason is that

727
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:13,080
we wanted to create the Association or

728
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:15,570
related today to return in other words

729
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:17,310
what I mean is in other protocols and in

730
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:20,210
the yang otherwise what we have we are a

731
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:23,070
much more generic Association concept

732
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:24,720
why it should we use the more generic

733
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,400
Association object because that's

734
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:29,310
something that we have already know how

735
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,530
to use and not define something very

736
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,220
specific to your yang that's the thing

737
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:40,080
that I want you to explore a little bit

738
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:42,270
okay and I agree with drove here I think

739
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,790
we should you know at least consider the

740
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:48,090
Association definition that we added in

741
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:51,900
the tunnel model if it applies here it's

742
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:56,190
more you know elaborate and William take

743
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,960
it off - okay we are already using the

744
00:44:56,190 --> 00:44:59,490
association from the tunnel model this

745
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,590
is because we want to associate that

746
00:44:59,490 --> 00:45:03,750
paths which are in the same tunnel and

747
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:06,060
in the tunnel model they are associated

748
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:07,950
by by the structure of the young model

749
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,480
and yet there are different entry is the

750
00:45:07,950 --> 00:45:11,939
same part request though you have to

751
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:13,590
find another way to say these two paths

752
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:23,400
are the primary secondary of the same

753
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:26,220
tunnel yeah yeah I think it would be

754
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,170
good to clarify if this is a different

755
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:32,520
Association than the existing

756
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:36,330
Association mechanisms may be pretty

757
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:39,150
mature at this point yeah maybe we can

758
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:42,240
describe better the the intention of the

759
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:45,150
DEA's situation either speaking at it is

760
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,040
a generic comment on here and tunnel we

761
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:48,780
have basically if I look at the latest

762
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,720
II tunnel model we have three ways to

763
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,600
associate paths one by putting pass into

764
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:56,160
the same tunnel one by associating all

765
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,880
the time all the paths between two

766
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,370
tunnels

767
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,800
this tunnel level Association and one at

768
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:04,440
a path level when associating two paths

769
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:06,240
of two different angles maybe we have to

770
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,040
find a way where to describe this either

771
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,299
here or in the part on the tunnel model

772
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,279
I'm trying to understand which one you

773
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:16,710
mean here and what oh we need all at all

774
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:18,180
the tree and the other two we are

775
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:20,190
inheriting from we are reusing the

776
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:22,200
groupings from theta from titania so

777
00:46:20,190 --> 00:46:27,750
it's it's implicit and yeah we need to

778
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:32,910
add or if you have two paths in the same

779
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:34,170
tunnel your protection metal inert if

780
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:42,920
you take it off one okay generic

781
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:42,920
mechanism support that already yeah okay

782
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,790
yes

783
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:12,560
hi everyone

784
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,920
I'll give you a quick update on set of V

785
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,320
and Yanks model that we have the model

786
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,480
that we are discussing is the VN the

787
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:24,110
first model is the ITF geunyang model

788
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,870
and then we have 2kpi telemetry model

789
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:29,960
which augments the t tunnel model and

790
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:33,549
the VN model and finally we have the

791
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:36,890
service mapping model which has first a

792
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:40,370
generic set of mapping types defined in

793
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:45,049
one yang model and then the l 3 sm l 2

794
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:47,330
sm and other and l 1 c sm augments those

795
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,910
with the generate grouping so i will go

796
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,580
through the updates in all these models

797
00:47:49,910 --> 00:47:54,859
the overall comment we did a bit of

798
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:57,110
editorial cleaner yang formatting

799
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:58,730
references all the style guide changes

800
00:47:57,110 --> 00:48:01,790
and thanks for everyone who gave

801
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:04,400
comments there we also move from word to

802
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:06,440
XML which was also a big task and that's

803
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,090
why if you look at hard if everything is

804
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:12,380
little bit like looks like the whole

805
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:16,220
document is updated ok so let's start

806
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:19,130
with V and yang so we know what it is

807
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,279
it's just it's a VN yang model at the

808
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:22,790
CMI it's between the the customer and

809
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,000
operator

810
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:29,990
it gives a very abstracted view of the

811
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:32,720
virtual network slice it relies on the T

812
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:35,120
topology abstract node and uses the

813
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,640
connectivity matrices to define how the

814
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:41,089
end-to-end connections are being

815
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:43,040
established we had a comment that we

816
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:46,820
discussed in the last meeting which was

817
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:49,460
Jana B&B established without having the

818
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:53,660
customer information that is I can set

819
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:55,370
up a p2p VN member without having

820
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,140
without attaching the customer

821
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:57,890
information at the time of the

822
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:01,220
uncreation

823
00:48:57,890 --> 00:49:03,560
and maybe have an ability to add the AP

824
00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,379
and the customer facing information

825
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:08,230
after the VN is already

826
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,430
established so we made sure that we can

827
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:13,420
support that

828
00:49:09,430 --> 00:49:15,190
of course the VN creation already had at

829
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:17,560
the time of VN creation you need to have

830
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:20,260
something called as an AP which is just

831
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:22,509
a shared logical identifier between the

832
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,030
customer and the operator so in the yang

833
00:49:22,510 --> 00:49:27,630
model we allow you to create an AP with

834
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:31,090
only a P information so that the second

835
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,520
requirement can be established so to do

836
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,590
that within the AP container we added a

837
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,590
node called PE which can have a

838
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:40,480
reference to the PE node and why are

839
00:49:38,590 --> 00:49:42,400
that you can create an AP with just the

840
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,830
P information and later on update it

841
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:48,640
with more customer information once you

842
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:50,920
have it so this kind of satisfies the

843
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,259
requirement that we got during the last

844
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:57,130
meeting so this is how the change looks

845
00:49:53,260 --> 00:50:00,340
pretty straightforward change just a

846
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:04,420
reference to the node ID so that's our

847
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:08,830
first document the next is the telemetry

848
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:13,650
this one has some a does two jobs it has

849
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:16,810
the performance one I have my notes

850
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:21,820
comments from the last meeting that

851
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:27,610
wasn't sure how they were addressed yang

852
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:29,110
yeah this is the one this is what we

853
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:31,510
kind of addressed or this was what

854
00:50:29,110 --> 00:50:33,160
jin-woo or raised we were we had it in

855
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:34,990
the slides we discussed back and forth

856
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,140
that we will handle this okay

857
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:42,160
is there do you think it's all addressed

858
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:44,049
this one is addressed yes is it was with

859
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:49,660
chin right yes in the room do you think

860
00:50:44,050 --> 00:50:52,320
that yeah he is yes do you think that

861
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,319
the issues are addressed

862
00:51:00,060 --> 00:51:08,410
yeah did you know ya already have

863
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:11,080
offline discussion with now with through

864
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:14,770
and I'm happy with the channel made

865
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:17,470
actually and Jessica wanted a sense of

866
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:23,910
the room for for this model to have a

867
00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:27,089
change yeah okay yeah good to go yeah so

868
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:31,270
the second model which is about the

869
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:34,030
telemetry this model we augment the tea

870
00:51:31,270 --> 00:51:36,009
tunnel model and the VN model with the

871
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:38,140
telemetry information again the

872
00:51:36,010 --> 00:51:39,220
telemetry information comes from T types

873
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:42,490
itself

874
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:47,740
we are augmenting it here and we also

875
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:49,569
have the scaling conditions as the

876
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:52,270
scaling conditions being set so those

877
00:51:49,570 --> 00:51:56,950
are the two things that this young model

878
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:59,680
does we did one change we earlier used

879
00:51:56,950 --> 00:52:01,270
to put the scaling condition the

880
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,109
operation type which is when you have

881
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:07,000
multiple parameters or how do I consider

882
00:52:05,110 --> 00:52:09,850
those multiple parameters whether it is

883
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:12,160
and or or we were putting it in an outer

884
00:52:09,850 --> 00:52:16,810
container we moved it inside that would

885
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:20,500
allow us to have mix of and and or for

886
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:22,360
multiple metric types so we can say that

887
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,610
delay should be like this and jitter

888
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:26,770
should or jitter should be like this

889
00:52:24,610 --> 00:52:30,610
while the bandwidth is something else so

890
00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:33,070
we can we have a flexibility of making

891
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:35,110
those changes another mistake maybe was

892
00:52:33,070 --> 00:52:37,360
there from the previous version where we

893
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,800
were not augmenting so now since we are

894
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,480
all menteng there is no need for us to

895
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,730
have a reference to the same tunnel that

896
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:46,420
you are anyway augmenting so those two

897
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:49,930
changes were done in the both the te KPI

898
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:53,170
and the VN KPI model we had one comment

899
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:56,200
on the mic last time which was about how

900
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:59,830
do we use can we use percentile or mean

901
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:02,710
especially coming from the stamp yang

902
00:52:59,830 --> 00:53:04,870
model we are currently relying on the

903
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:08,610
puffins performance metric attributes as

904
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:11,560
defined in T types and defining a new

905
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:12,290
metric we can at this stage we wanted to

906
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,750
avoid

907
00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,360
and we could not figure out how adding

908
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,940
it only for this model would help so I

909
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:22,910
had one small discussion with Greg that

910
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:24,440
what's the next step we could do I will

911
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:26,120
continue to have that discussion at

912
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,460
least in the text we will add that this

913
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:32,210
is just part of the problem that we are

914
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:34,070
only giving the telemetry from what we

915
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:35,660
can learn from the notes there cook

916
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:38,570
there are other techniques out there

917
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,000
such as end-to-end measurements etc

918
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:43,670
which can also be applied in the end

919
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,100
some kind of text I will at least add

920
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:48,380
and I will pass it through Greg that's

921
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:50,450
our current thinking when it comes to

922
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,670
adding new metric we want to avoid

923
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:54,830
defining new metric again we will get

924
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:56,600
into AI ppm and other working group

925
00:53:54,830 --> 00:53:58,430
space so at this stage we don't want to

926
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,069
go there but we can say that this is

927
00:53:58,430 --> 00:54:02,060
just part of the the telemetry this is

928
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:04,870
not everything there are other

929
00:54:02,060 --> 00:54:13,299
techniques out there as well any

930
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:13,299
comments on this okay so that was our

931
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:24,710
and the final I have Dan who's sitting

932
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:29,419
in the is in the back who who's also

933
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:33,350
active on a draft in net mod related to

934
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:36,170
event condition action framework and I'm

935
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:37,580
interested in your perspective on and

936
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:40,310
you're the authors of this drafts

937
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:42,440
perspective on how either that work can

938
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,480
be applied here or you could influence

939
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:49,640
that work basically that works doing a

940
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:52,960
generic mechanism for triggering actions

941
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:55,970
based on events that happen on the node

942
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:58,790
after you drew no no I want to listen

943
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:02,060
what do you have i I'll be honest that

944
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:05,180
just walked in I was just outside that's

945
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:07,820
the anything I I'm just going to also

946
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:12,740
add as a co-author of the ECA framework

947
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:16,120
opposed all that there is absolutely

948
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:21,169
applicability here if you're delegating

949
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:24,410
some event and condition to a device but

950
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:26,180
it could also be in in actn a device

951
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,399
might be the PNC a cell

952
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,759
that would enable some telemetry stream

953
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,740
in the event of some condition being met

954
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:37,340
whether it's packet loss or or some kind

955
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:39,350
of cue issue so yeah I think I think

956
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,010
there is some applicability yeah of

957
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:41,720
course

958
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,520
this work is a bit more advanced

959
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,339
although it's very specific it might be

960
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,500
good to help inform that work rather

961
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,260
than try to wait for that thing that's

962
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:57,170
not even a working group document yet to

963
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:59,720
be there to use yeah these change in

964
00:55:57,170 --> 00:56:02,690
from well way and we actually work

965
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:05,089
together with is a model job actually

966
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:07,990
work on the Issei mode of action we did

967
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:11,420
actually support this kind of logic test

968
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:15,049
we think it will be good idea to define

969
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:18,230
a basic model we can you know let this

970
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:22,490
job leverage some group in defining a

971
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:24,710
basic model maybe that will be a good

972
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:27,200
approach that but I haven't thought

973
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,750
about that how do you realize this yeah

974
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:31,790
yeah since this workers more advanced it

975
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:34,670
might be this will just help inform your

976
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:40,790
work as it moves in on thank you thank

977
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:44,090
thank you so last young model which is

978
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:46,250
our service mapping yang model this

979
00:56:44,090 --> 00:56:49,070
young model does a mapping between the

980
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:50,960
services and the various different ee

981
00:56:49,070 --> 00:56:54,530
models that we have so you can map

982
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:57,710
either to VN or t topology or te tunnel

983
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:59,240
and we had defined a t and service

984
00:56:57,710 --> 00:57:02,930
mapping types which is a generic

985
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:07,279
container and that is being used by a by

986
00:57:02,930 --> 00:57:10,910
augmenting various service model we also

987
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:12,350
added some things like availability and

988
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,930
isolation requirements which are

989
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,880
currently not there in the service model

990
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:20,149
itself and that can be used when you are

991
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,000
selecting and making decisions at the VN

992
00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:26,720
and the P topology level so that's how

993
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:28,670
your model looks the comment that we

994
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,709
that's kind of open and we had some

995
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:32,680
internal discussions now we want to get

996
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:36,050
a little bit feeling from the room

997
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:38,029
service model we have idea how to do

998
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,170
this but the requirement exists at the

999
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:42,559
network model as

1000
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:44,900
well you want a map from l3n em to

1001
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:50,180
whatever t tunnels are being used within

1002
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:52,369
my domain so technically this mapping

1003
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:55,190
what we have as a generate t and service

1004
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:57,799
mapping can easily be applied to l3 and

1005
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:59,839
M as well and all we need to do is

1006
00:57:57,799 --> 00:58:01,910
augment the l3 and M model with the same

1007
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:05,420
gender ik grouping that we have already

1008
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:07,819
defined and you could easily use it the

1009
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:11,059
question would be that it's not a

1010
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:16,430
service it's a network model do we do it

1011
00:58:11,059 --> 00:58:19,339
here do we ask L 3 nm folks to update it

1012
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:21,529
there or a new document something like

1013
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:22,640
that and whether this approach makes

1014
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:24,950
sense or not so those are the two

1015
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:27,348
questions related to l3 and M that I

1016
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:29,000
would have for the group maybe we can

1017
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:35,510
get a feedback on that first before I

1018
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:42,920
discuss the second one how many people

1019
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:46,460
are aware of the L 3 nm oh okay well

1020
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:55,760
there are how many of those are not

1021
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:57,829
authors we have someone at the bike I

1022
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:03,799
would like to clarify about the first

1023
00:58:57,829 --> 00:59:06,290
issue say this mod also applies to f3

1024
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:09,920
and them so are you referring to

1025
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:15,349
we should map we should map the layer 3

1026
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:17,119
sm 2 layer 3 and red or no we I'm that's

1027
00:59:15,349 --> 00:59:20,809
not the job of this model this is still

1028
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:22,730
T so we are mapping L 3 nm once you have

1029
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:26,750
an entity that in the network model this

1030
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:30,890
is my l3 VPN server network how do I map

1031
00:59:26,750 --> 00:59:32,740
to what are the te tunnels or or if it

1032
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:35,240
is in multi layer thing even te topology

1033
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:38,479
kind of information so I would in this

1034
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:40,520
case not have VM I would when I

1035
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,710
augmented make sure that the VN choice

1036
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:45,710
cannot be taken but T topology and T

1037
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:48,109
tunnel choice could still be used okay I

1038
00:59:45,710 --> 00:59:51,230
will also have the same preference to

1039
00:59:48,109 --> 00:59:53,290
make everything to select the T part and

1040
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,290
the

1041
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,550
Agron feral maybe this is the

1042
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:09,720
opportunity for a little advert for l3

1043
01:00:05,550 --> 01:00:11,790
nm obsidian maybe this is the

1044
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:15,029
opportunity for a little advert for l3

1045
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:20,308
nm at least you give some context so l3

1046
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:23,910
nm is a recently adopted document in the

1047
01:00:20,309 --> 01:00:28,260
ops area working group that is

1048
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:32,759
attempting to bridge the gap between the

1049
01:00:28,260 --> 01:00:38,240
way a customer requests a layer-3

1050
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:43,290
service and a way that the network

1051
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:46,680
delivers that service by partitioning

1052
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:50,940
their functional blocks for delivering

1053
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:54,480
the service and allowing the l3 service

1054
01:00:50,940 --> 01:01:00,020
to be expressed with a few network aware

1055
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:07,230
pieces in that sense it's very much

1056
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:10,290
behind the curtain and it's unclear to

1057
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,690
me whether you would need to also do the

1058
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:15,808
service mapping for that but it's also

1059
01:01:12,690 --> 01:01:17,819
unclear to me that you wouldn't I would

1060
01:01:15,809 --> 01:01:21,119
suggest the thing to do is to sit with

1061
01:01:17,819 --> 01:01:23,549
the authors of l3 nm explained to them

1062
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,579
what your service mapping does have them

1063
01:01:23,549 --> 01:01:29,640
explain to you what nm does and then try

1064
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:33,569
to see whether that matches or not yeah

1065
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:36,480
there's some issues with l3 nm in that

1066
01:01:33,569 --> 01:01:38,549
as you said it it's unclear what goes

1067
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,470
what the scope of it is and when it

1068
01:01:38,549 --> 01:01:42,509
starts bringing in things like the

1069
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:44,040
protocol details are the the routing

1070
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:45,900
protocol details

1071
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:47,579
it gets really confused because it's

1072
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,290
redefining things that are already in

1073
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:52,859
other models

1074
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:55,230
sorry modules rather than referencing

1075
01:01:52,859 --> 01:01:57,359
those and you know we seem to be going

1076
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:59,099
in a loop here of redefining things over

1077
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,980
and over again and this is doing it yet

1078
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:03,569
again and right having that sit down

1079
01:02:01,980 --> 01:02:06,450
it's probably a really good idea and

1080
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:08,940
probably pull in someone from the

1081
01:02:06,450 --> 01:02:10,290
routing working group as well because I

1082
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:12,660
think there's some deconfliction there

1083
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:14,520
that might want to happen yeah I'm sure

1084
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:21,660
that the intention is not to increase

1085
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:26,400
the entropy but yeah we shouldn't be

1086
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:29,910
redefining stuff we had an email

1087
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:32,849
exchange with Oscar and other authors of

1088
01:02:29,910 --> 01:02:35,310
l3n em they liked the idea they think

1089
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:37,140
it's needed even on the mailing lists

1090
01:02:35,310 --> 01:02:40,049
this question actually came up that

1091
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:43,259
whether this could be done so at least

1092
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:45,240
from the I will follow what Adrian

1093
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:47,579
suggested and have a little bit more

1094
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:49,709
in-depth conversation but at least at

1095
01:02:47,579 --> 01:02:52,650
the very high level on emails there is a

1096
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:54,630
consensus that this is done this is

1097
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:55,440
needed the question which I was where

1098
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:58,140
should we do it

1099
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,910
should we keep this more this document

1100
01:02:58,140 --> 01:03:02,910
which is right in front of you only

1101
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:06,868
focused on the service model and maybe

1102
01:03:02,910 --> 01:03:09,690
let the LC nm folks continue on to have

1103
01:03:06,869 --> 01:03:11,339
defined the l3 and M model plus the

1104
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:12,960
service mapping right there in the ops

1105
01:03:11,339 --> 01:03:15,569
area working group that's one approach

1106
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:20,400
another would be that we can can add it

1107
01:03:15,569 --> 01:03:22,109
here itself yeah I think keeping this

1108
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,339
working group in the loop right now is

1109
01:03:22,109 --> 01:03:26,040
the right thing and let's see what

1110
01:03:23,339 --> 01:03:30,230
happens when you have the l3 and M

1111
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:32,700
discussion and again include the routing

1112
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:37,319
working group maybe it all goes there

1113
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:40,169
you know what's I'm not saying what the

1114
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:44,160
right answer is yeah gotta be home hi so

1115
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:46,349
we have the presentation of the draft in

1116
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:51,450
last drogyn working group went well so

1117
01:03:46,349 --> 01:03:54,240
let's keep collaborating and I had one

1118
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:55,770
more pending commit Jeff as Jerry were

1119
01:03:54,240 --> 01:04:03,979
you okay with the redefinition of the

1120
01:03:55,770 --> 01:04:08,759
routing protocol the details in l3 mmm

1121
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:11,430
all right I'll have a chair okay anyway

1122
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:13,170
so the the last point which is which has

1123
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:15,589
a which is also a pending issue for us

1124
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:18,000
we define a term called availability and

1125
01:04:15,589 --> 01:04:19,470
we don't have a good reference for it

1126
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,130
this availabilities may be from the

1127
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:23,100
service

1128
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:25,080
ability point of view and more related

1129
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:28,440
to a service model it defines like no

1130
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:31,080
service is 99% on 99.99 that kind of

1131
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,150
thing we don't have a good reference for

1132
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:35,549
it so if somebody has any suggestion or

1133
01:04:33,150 --> 01:04:38,150
can point us to the right direction that

1134
01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:38,150
would be very helpful

1135
01:04:38,270 --> 01:04:49,410
Greg mercy City yes actually the thing

1136
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:54,510
is that with the term availability we

1137
01:04:49,410 --> 01:04:57,720
use it colloquially but at ITF we don't

1138
01:04:54,510 --> 01:05:02,850
have a definition for it

1139
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:07,560
there is one RFC on micro microwave

1140
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:12,330
links availability and I think we've

1141
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:15,690
done this work in C camp but it defines

1142
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:24,540
the availability which is very specific

1143
01:05:15,690 --> 01:05:28,290
for this technology I think that and I

1144
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:31,050
know some efforts that been done to to

1145
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:34,380
define availability for the packet

1146
01:05:31,050 --> 01:05:40,290
switching because the term has been

1147
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:43,950
defined in TDM and because if there is

1148
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:45,960
no data they fill in information so

1149
01:05:43,950 --> 01:05:49,049
basically it's a constant stream so

1150
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:52,670
that's why they it's easy for them to

1151
01:05:49,050 --> 01:05:56,400
express it I don't know any viable

1152
01:05:52,670 --> 01:06:00,660
definition for packet based technology

1153
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:06,780
availability and I would encourage to

1154
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:11,850
use another term we are running behind

1155
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:14,130
at this point no it's okay you know

1156
01:06:11,850 --> 01:06:15,779
where it's good to have discussion you

1157
01:06:14,130 --> 01:06:18,740
know if all you're doing is presentation

1158
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,740
we don't have to come here

1159
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:29,400
thank you

1160
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:32,260
this eating problem calling and

1161
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:34,690
presenting the jobs about the

1162
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:36,580
interworking of JMS consistent and

1163
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:38,800
centralized control control assisted

1164
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:43,600
first of all thank you all the others

1165
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:46,680
listed in disguise and this Java is

1166
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:49,299
about describing how the GMB are

1167
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:51,460
distributing control plan can be in the

1168
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:54,490
work with the centralized can control

1169
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,710
assistant in many different scenarios

1170
01:06:54,490 --> 01:06:58,810
for example the MIDI domain or

1171
01:06:56,710 --> 01:07:01,930
multi-layer service provisioning and

1172
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:05,320
recovery etc and main trends of this

1173
01:07:01,930 --> 01:07:09,370
version is the first first of all we add

1174
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:12,010
a new message about multi domain service

1175
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:17,430
provisioning which is the else be

1176
01:07:12,010 --> 01:07:20,830
stitching method defined in RFC 5150 and

1177
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:26,980
secondly I and myself as an author of

1178
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:31,360
this job and this is the background of

1179
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:34,470
this job we know we have been working on

1180
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:37,140
the GM has for many many years and

1181
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:39,700
because of the Sdn recently we

1182
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:42,279
introduced the centralized controller

1183
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:44,080
into the control control plane a lot of

1184
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:46,560
typical architecture is a CTA

1185
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:48,850
architecture we believe that this

1186
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:52,299
centralized control system and the

1187
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:55,660
distributed JMS control system are not

1188
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:58,480
competing to each other but they can

1189
01:07:55,660 --> 01:08:02,370
work together to make a better control

1190
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:05,710
now so we are trying to reveal the

1191
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:08,470
previous work to see how they came to

1192
01:08:05,710 --> 01:08:13,030
work together to make a better control

1193
01:08:08,470 --> 01:08:15,730
of the network and one of the most

1194
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:18,370
important sin always for the multi multi

1195
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:21,960
domain service provisioning we are try

1196
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:26,290
to wrap up with the existing methods and

1197
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:29,020
try to cast by into several methods

1198
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:32,319
although first one is about the with

1199
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:35,409
end-to-end EVP sessions which means that

1200
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:40,500
we run the end-to-end as you repeat

1201
01:08:35,408 --> 01:08:43,689
signaling to to create a multi-domain

1202
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:47,589
connections and use this into an SVG

1203
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:50,678
session to distribute the labels on the

1204
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:53,380
inter domain link and there further to

1205
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:57,880
some method the 1.1 in the latter is

1206
01:08:53,380 --> 01:09:02,310
about just simple simply around an SVG

1207
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:06,040
signal tool to create a connection and

1208
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:09,549
1.2 in the right path is up is about

1209
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:13,210
using the SPS teaching method and we can

1210
01:09:09,549 --> 01:09:15,850
create each in the each domain as field

1211
01:09:13,210 --> 01:09:19,480
segment and then use the stitching

1212
01:09:15,850 --> 01:09:23,980
method to create SP stitching to stitch

1213
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:25,988
the as we passed together this one point

1214
01:09:23,979 --> 01:09:32,259
two is added is newly added in this

1215
01:09:25,988 --> 01:09:35,678
version and further the second method is

1216
01:09:32,259 --> 01:09:38,279
about we stop in and two as the previous

1217
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:42,969
session so in this case we don't need to

1218
01:09:38,279 --> 01:09:46,810
say in the interpolation between domains

1219
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:49,299
using a CV PT but using the centralized

1220
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:52,810
controller system to the father in the

1221
01:09:49,299 --> 01:09:57,460
operation similarly we also have to a

1222
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:59,380
method the two point one is about if the

1223
01:09:57,460 --> 01:10:02,280
centralized controller do not have the

1224
01:09:59,380 --> 01:10:05,530
information of the inter domain link

1225
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:11,259
that the label of the in determining

1226
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:14,159
dental node can assign the label and

1227
01:10:11,260 --> 01:10:16,540
then use the centralized controller to

1228
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,780
distribute it this label to other

1229
01:10:16,540 --> 01:10:22,900
domains to create the end-to-end path

1230
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:26,139
and in the right side the to point to

1231
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:28,690
method we assume that the centralized

1232
01:10:26,139 --> 01:10:32,860
control controller system can be aware

1233
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:35,019
of the labels of the inter domain link

1234
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:38,799
in this case the centralized controller

1235
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:41,110
can distribute the can assign and

1236
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:41,949
distribute the labels on the inter

1237
01:10:41,110 --> 01:10:46,059
domain link

1238
01:10:41,949 --> 01:10:50,159
so each domain can simply create the

1239
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:50,159
paths a common in their domains

1240
01:10:52,320 --> 01:11:00,549
yeah so for the next step we believed we

1241
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:04,059
were pretty down about the multi-domain

1242
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:07,020
scenarios and the next step we'll try to

1243
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:10,090
figure out how to do the multi-layer

1244
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:14,410
provisioning protection and restoration

1245
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:18,670
and control controller reliability it's

1246
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:21,900
a quite a lot of work and we and we we

1247
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:24,490
want to get a feedback from the WG to

1248
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:29,530
help us to move this forward

1249
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:32,110
thank you are you looking for input for

1250
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:35,050
the working group as in more writers or

1251
01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:37,330
do you think your team you have a

1252
01:11:35,050 --> 01:11:38,110
sufficient number of people to to get

1253
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,360
that work done

1254
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:42,910
yeah yeah we can do that but if I know I

1255
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:44,920
have commas we are happy to hear that

1256
01:11:42,910 --> 01:11:46,240
yeah or someone wants to set a

1257
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:48,640
contribution they could always set it to

1258
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:51,490
the list right yeah yeah we would love

1259
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:54,820
to see this this work sort of moved

1260
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:57,730
towards completion it's pretty old

1261
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:59,710
concepts we've gone actually full cycle

1262
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:01,179
because we introduced ug MPLS what we

1263
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:03,820
were doing was figuring out how we can

1264
01:12:01,180 --> 01:12:06,690
displace centralized controllers so you

1265
01:12:03,820 --> 01:12:11,070
know we're going back and forth now so

1266
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:11,070
right thank you thank you

1267
01:12:12,630 --> 01:12:19,270
hi I'm Jen from Siena and actually I I

1268
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:21,340
have a question that with respect to a

1269
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:24,520
and you lean into the microphone okay

1270
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:29,110
I'm Jen from Siena and the question is

1271
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:31,270
with respect to OEM if I ping this

1272
01:12:29,110 --> 01:12:35,860
inter-domain LSP it will go across the

1273
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:38,260
domain and how can I do I am on an

1274
01:12:35,860 --> 01:12:41,110
individual segment versus the whole

1275
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:42,850
inter domain LSP I mean if you can

1276
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:44,980
expand on that you know what we're a

1277
01:12:42,850 --> 01:12:46,510
little over if you don't mind doing that

1278
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:48,519
on the list it's a it's a good

1279
01:12:46,510 --> 01:12:52,540
discussion but we do it on the list

1280
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:56,770
is that all right I mean it's a possible

1281
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:59,380
like or not to do om on the segment as

1282
01:12:56,770 --> 01:13:01,910
well as volume across the LSP yeah as it

1283
01:12:59,380 --> 01:13:05,150
possible you know and indeed

1284
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:06,340
or the configuration of OAM that's two

1285
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:09,320
different things

1286
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:12,680
for the OEM in the data I think with

1287
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:15,679
nothing change just as we have before

1288
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:19,280
and for the control plane I think we can

1289
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:21,530
continue the work to see if the anchor

1290
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:24,559
vibration signaling can be used in this

1291
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:29,030
scenario if yesterday right I believe is

1292
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:36,740
yes okay I'll mail my questions already

1293
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:42,530
okay okay thank you thank you and to be

1294
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:45,860
unfair for you yes hi afternoon everyone

1295
01:13:42,530 --> 01:13:47,990
so given the importance of sort of

1296
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:51,110
maximizing efficiency of some of this

1297
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:55,250
work at the ITF and using working group

1298
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:58,519
time efficiently this is really first of

1299
01:13:55,250 --> 01:14:00,710
all it's a relatively recent document we

1300
01:13:58,520 --> 01:14:03,470
started working on this the idea at

1301
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:06,890
least at the start of the year we're

1302
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:11,390
into our second version we want to try

1303
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:12,650
to highlight how operators can use some

1304
01:14:11,390 --> 01:14:14,630
of the yang models that are being

1305
01:14:12,650 --> 01:14:17,030
developed within the ITF we've got you

1306
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:20,240
know hundreds of young models thousands

1307
01:14:17,030 --> 01:14:21,860
of yang models even and what we need to

1308
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:25,190
do is actually show how we can combine

1309
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:27,889
these to deploy services so one of the

1310
01:14:25,190 --> 01:14:30,980
more recent discussions is how we use

1311
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:33,290
the actn framework and so essentially

1312
01:14:30,980 --> 01:14:35,480
the functional components the interface

1313
01:14:33,290 --> 01:14:41,000
is combined with the data models to

1314
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:44,959
deploy packet over optical services so

1315
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:48,770
these are essentially two layers one

1316
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:51,770
control via physical network controllers

1317
01:14:48,770 --> 01:14:54,430
for the optical domain split into two

1318
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:57,440
domains that are not directly connected

1319
01:14:54,430 --> 01:15:00,380
sitting on top of that we've got packet

1320
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:03,139
layer with additional sort of domain

1321
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:05,090
technology they're managed by domain

1322
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:07,370
physical network controllers that are

1323
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:11,920
connected across and into the main

1324
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:15,380
connection so essentially if that's our

1325
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:18,409
deployment model what we want to know

1326
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:22,130
kind of operators and vendors is how we

1327
01:15:18,409 --> 01:15:25,280
can use the data models that currently

1328
01:15:22,130 --> 01:15:28,880
exist for providing multi-layer services

1329
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:32,000
so packet over optical and furthermore

1330
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,250
this would be a set of procedures the

1331
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:37,550
data models what part of the data model

1332
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:39,980
that we will use and then things sort of

1333
01:15:37,550 --> 01:15:43,820
under consideration are operational and

1334
01:15:39,980 --> 01:15:46,638
security aspects as well so the two use

1335
01:15:43,820 --> 01:15:48,380
cases that are currently in the document

1336
01:15:46,639 --> 01:15:51,199
and we we didn't want to have a document

1337
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:53,360
that that sort of boiled the ocean we

1338
01:15:51,199 --> 01:15:56,540
wanted sort of two specifics scenarios

1339
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:59,839
the first is obviously the multi layer

1340
01:15:56,540 --> 01:16:04,130
but multi domain coordination and the

1341
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:06,320
second use case is recovery so when you

1342
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:07,730
detect failure how do you recover from

1343
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,369
that failure and sort of various

1344
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:13,299
permutations of that so if those are the

1345
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:16,610
two main use cases we've got sort of

1346
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:21,170
subsections of each of those so things

1347
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:24,348
like discovery of existing resources

1348
01:16:21,170 --> 01:16:26,780
you know links next hot neighbors etc

1349
01:16:24,349 --> 01:16:29,090
you know we will actually talk about in

1350
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:31,369
the document what protocol mechanisms

1351
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:33,469
are available how we set up the services

1352
01:16:31,369 --> 01:16:35,089
how we coordinate those you know what

1353
01:16:33,469 --> 01:16:36,889
data models what part of the data models

1354
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:38,809
are going to be used and in which order

1355
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:41,260
so essentially this document is a

1356
01:16:38,809 --> 01:16:44,150
cookbook that talks about setting up

1357
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:47,449
multi-layer services over sort of packet

1358
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:50,629
and optical domains using the context of

1359
01:16:47,449 --> 01:16:55,638
a CTN it's a very simple topology you

1360
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:58,820
see it on the slide here so to kind of

1361
01:16:55,639 --> 01:17:01,190
get to the point of presenting today

1362
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:04,130
what we want to do is encourage more

1363
01:17:01,190 --> 01:17:07,070
operator input so right now we've got a

1364
01:17:04,130 --> 01:17:09,260
good sort of blend of vendors we've only

1365
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:11,719
got one operator currently what we'd

1366
01:17:09,260 --> 01:17:14,270
like because this document really is is

1367
01:17:11,719 --> 01:17:16,699
is to highlight how we can actually

1368
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:19,699
deploy these services which data models

1369
01:17:16,699 --> 01:17:22,669
to use but also what gaps potentially

1370
01:17:19,699 --> 01:17:25,190
exist as well so please operators

1371
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:27,670
especially that you have multi-layer

1372
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:29,089
networks and ie every operator

1373
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:32,570
potentially

1374
01:17:29,090 --> 01:17:37,820
please have a read of the document see

1375
01:17:32,570 --> 01:17:41,210
if the current scope is suitable for

1376
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:43,070
your environment we already highlight in

1377
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:46,300
the current document what data models

1378
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:49,730
are candidates we will actually have

1379
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:51,800
examples code examples as well this may

1380
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:54,799
be a combination of rest cough Netcom so

1381
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:59,690
JSON and yang may have sort of xml

1382
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:02,720
schemas as well so questions for the

1383
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:04,790
room I would like to ask the chairs if

1384
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:07,730
we could just sort of have a quick show

1385
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:09,590
of hands to see who's actually read the

1386
01:18:07,730 --> 01:18:12,049
document especially if you're not an

1387
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:15,470
author oh okay let me ask the question

1388
01:18:12,050 --> 01:18:17,060
then thank you so can I ask if you're

1389
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:19,010
already a co-author of the document keep

1390
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:24,800
your hand down but who has actually read

1391
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:28,130
this document okay that's that's great

1392
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:33,110
and how many operators have read this

1393
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:35,420
document okay that it's slightly better

1394
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:37,460
but so we've got sort of two operators

1395
01:18:35,420 --> 01:18:40,010
that essentially read the document it'll

1396
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:41,630
be great to get more so really that's

1397
01:18:40,010 --> 01:18:44,930
kind of all I wanted to do was just to

1398
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:48,860
highlight the work let you know the

1399
01:18:44,930 --> 01:18:52,490
scope and we will continue to update the

1400
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:54,469
document yeah Ruth I drove here I really

1401
01:18:52,490 --> 01:18:57,320
would like if he have a little bit

1402
01:18:54,470 --> 01:18:58,880
better not do pio i applicability or at

1403
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,889
least in the title it is clarified

1404
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:05,750
what's the difference between the young

1405
01:19:00,890 --> 01:19:09,440
and Danny Lee's document and yours so so

1406
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:11,450
that other document essentially seems to

1407
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,339
focus more on the IP services and the

1408
01:19:11,450 --> 01:19:14,480
service mapping on top although of

1409
01:19:13,340 --> 01:19:17,320
course that's applicable for our

1410
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:20,360
document we are kind of that lower layer

1411
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:22,969
optical interaction so I think that's

1412
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:24,530
sort of sin initiative yeah yeah they're

1413
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:26,450
complementary rather than competitive

1414
01:19:24,530 --> 01:19:29,030
but if we need to make that clearer

1415
01:19:26,450 --> 01:19:31,280
that's yeah I agree with that that would

1416
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:32,990
do the documents are kind of focusing on

1417
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,059
this thing but as a working group should

1418
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:37,639
be how do we coordinate the two things

1419
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:42,910
and make sure that that P oh I can go

1420
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:42,910
forward easily okay yeah great

1421
01:19:43,970 --> 01:20:02,850
well that's it great thank you very much

1422
01:19:48,350 --> 01:20:07,920
keep watch on the work hi I'm Adrian

1423
01:20:02,850 --> 01:20:12,570
it's all my fault that's it so we have

1424
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,820
this design team working on looking at

1425
01:20:12,570 --> 01:20:18,570
RSC 3272

1426
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:21,420
which is ages old and somewhat

1427
01:20:18,570 --> 01:20:23,940
out-of-date in the way it uses terms and

1428
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:28,920
the fact that technologies come on quite

1429
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:31,019
a long way and a number of people

1430
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:34,710
including the chairs observed that many

1431
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:39,210
working groups using the term te without

1432
01:20:34,710 --> 01:20:44,870
any anything to point to so what we're

1433
01:20:39,210 --> 01:20:47,850
doing is a complete revision of 3272

1434
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:51,930
everything's up for grabs but we will

1435
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:54,510
inevitably use a lot of old text and

1436
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:57,690
then update things add new pieces and

1437
01:20:54,510 --> 01:21:01,080
try to streamline some of the historical

1438
01:20:57,690 --> 01:21:05,879
material and then the references were a

1439
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:10,830
bit ugly what we learnt is don't try to

1440
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:13,770
get old people to learn new tricks we we

1441
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:17,580
picked using github and markdown at the

1442
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:19,950
same time and the intersection of people

1443
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:23,280
who knew both tools in the design team

1444
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:28,320
was small and so we didn't make a lot of

1445
01:21:23,280 --> 01:21:32,580
progress we also had it running as a

1446
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:35,429
background task and we had a team leader

1447
01:21:32,580 --> 01:21:39,960
who was not properly motivated but it's

1448
01:21:35,430 --> 01:21:42,540
still open to bribes from the chairs we

1449
01:21:39,960 --> 01:21:45,090
also had a large team and and that tends

1450
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:48,050
to lead to waiting for everybody else to

1451
01:21:45,090 --> 01:21:48,050
do something first

1452
01:21:49,130 --> 01:21:55,270
and then we tried various management

1453
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:58,180
techniques but we didn't we didn't

1454
01:21:55,270 --> 01:22:00,220
do public humiliation until each night

1455
01:21:58,180 --> 01:22:02,860
EF meeting when I get to stand up and so

1456
01:22:00,220 --> 01:22:07,090
that works and maybe we should do it

1457
01:22:02,860 --> 01:22:09,660
more the way it worked was we posted a

1458
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:13,840
draft so we've actually done something

1459
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:17,260
and we've updated it as well what this

1460
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:20,920
essentially does is take 3272 puts it

1461
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:23,980
all into the new format and tidied some

1462
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,300
pieces a lot of the references were ugly

1463
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:29,169
and got cleaned up

1464
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:32,020
thank you lower and we tidied some of

1465
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:35,320
the text and added some small pieces of

1466
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:37,330
new text but that only sets us up to

1467
01:22:35,320 --> 01:22:41,530
know that there's a lot of new work to

1468
01:22:37,330 --> 01:22:44,680
be done we will I think change our

1469
01:22:41,530 --> 01:22:48,309
working practices and do that work

1470
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:51,400
we are already 30% too long without

1471
01:22:48,310 --> 01:22:54,640
having to edit our text so anybody who

1472
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:57,519
is good at operating marking blocks of

1473
01:22:54,640 --> 01:23:02,530
text and deleting them is is welcome to

1474
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:06,910
work with us we will need to be adding

1475
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:09,730
text for your favorite protocol how we

1476
01:23:06,910 --> 01:23:12,760
do this the design team will meet on

1477
01:23:09,730 --> 01:23:16,719
Thursday morning I hope to do some

1478
01:23:12,760 --> 01:23:20,080
actual active edits in the room and then

1479
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:21,880
hand out assignments to the team and

1480
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:24,940
then we will edit in the normal

1481
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:26,530
old-fashioned way of me holding the pen

1482
01:23:24,940 --> 01:23:28,990
and people telling me what they want

1483
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:33,340
changed and hopefully that'll be more

1484
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:35,429
productive and we will do then multiple

1485
01:23:33,340 --> 01:23:39,490
revisions to keep everybody up to date

1486
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:42,610
if you're interested in this join us by

1487
01:23:39,490 --> 01:23:46,980
sending email to the t's list to the

1488
01:23:42,610 --> 01:23:49,679
design team list or direct to me I

1489
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:51,820
suggest we need at least one more

1490
01:23:49,680 --> 01:23:54,100
substantial revision before we even

1491
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:56,200
talked about adoption I know this is a

1492
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:58,290
targeted thing for the working group but

1493
01:23:56,200 --> 01:24:06,469
I don't believe that this draft is is

1494
01:23:58,290 --> 01:24:09,410
meaningful for adoption thank you

1495
01:24:06,469 --> 01:24:31,400
appreciate the update we have five

1496
01:24:09,410 --> 01:24:33,260
minutes left for the Etsy update hello

1497
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,839
good afternoon so this presentation is

1498
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,810
likely to look a little exotic to the

1499
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:43,100
crowd here so I am working in both an AV

1500
01:24:38,810 --> 01:24:45,440
at Siena V and in ITF so I got here

1501
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,910
because the Nellie chica le couldn't

1502
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:49,040
present this year's also basically a

1503
01:24:46,910 --> 01:24:52,219
couple of months ago SECNAV Center

1504
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:56,050
liaison to ITF T's and this is the

1505
01:24:52,219 --> 01:24:59,420
presentation for this liaison basically

1506
01:24:56,050 --> 01:25:01,190
so there are several documents so for

1507
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:03,920
those who don't know it's en AV is

1508
01:25:01,190 --> 01:25:07,099
basically the major standard framework

1509
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:09,560
for telecom virtualization and there are

1510
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:12,199
a number of deployments in the real

1511
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:13,820
world this is something that is a big

1512
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:15,349
deal even though there's a lot of open

1513
01:25:13,820 --> 01:25:17,239
source that is also competing with it

1514
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:20,570
but this is something which is actually

1515
01:25:17,239 --> 01:25:22,129
deployed in the real world so Etsy nav

1516
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:24,259
does have a framework which is fairly

1517
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:25,640
comprehensive and there is there are

1518
01:25:24,260 --> 01:25:27,290
several documents are quite published is

1519
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:29,630
the one that you're looking at here I've

1520
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:31,760
had 22 was a report that tried to

1521
01:25:29,630 --> 01:25:34,820
understand how you could connect

1522
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:38,830
different data centers in different

1523
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:41,780
locations to deploy any v4 any of the

1524
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:44,900
network services across those different

1525
01:25:41,780 --> 01:25:47,630
locations this brought the creation of a

1526
01:25:44,900 --> 01:25:51,290
component that we call the wim the wide

1527
01:25:47,630 --> 01:25:54,410
area manager what wide area network

1528
01:25:51,290 --> 01:25:57,920
infrastructure manager sorry and this

1529
01:25:54,410 --> 01:26:01,460
component is is something that is being

1530
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:04,850
used here we have put this in this

1531
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:06,440
report and no that's the first version

1532
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:10,940
of presentation but it's ok I'll do

1533
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:13,489
without and then we had a stage 2

1534
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:17,570
specification which is called ia32 which

1535
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:20,280
is presented here which try to explicit

1536
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:24,170
the requirements for this wim component

1537
01:26:20,280 --> 01:26:27,269
and we have worked on it extensively and

1538
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:29,310
today we have started working on what we

1539
01:26:27,270 --> 01:26:31,440
call the stage free which is protocols

1540
01:26:29,310 --> 01:26:38,460
and data models for the interface to

1541
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:40,559
this wide area controller so this has

1542
01:26:38,460 --> 01:26:41,900
been started already so we have tried to

1543
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,150
[Music]

1544
01:26:41,900 --> 01:26:47,730
assassin of existing protocols actn is

1545
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:49,620
prominently featured in this document it

1546
01:26:47,730 --> 01:26:52,559
doesn't mean that you want to approve a

1547
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:54,900
CDN as the interface but at least we

1548
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:58,890
want to understand how a CTN fits in the

1549
01:26:54,900 --> 01:27:01,830
picture and of course how if that is how

1550
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:06,000
the actn designers and users expect the

1551
01:27:01,830 --> 01:27:08,010
specification to be used so the

1552
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,290
interface basics that we have on this

1553
01:27:08,010 --> 01:27:12,390
interface or there are four different

1554
01:27:10,290 --> 01:27:13,980
sub interfaces one of them is for the

1555
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:15,800
multi-site communication services

1556
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:19,339
management interfaces with the typical

1557
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:23,700
crowd operations but also operations on

1558
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:25,560
notifications and on reservation we have

1559
01:27:23,700 --> 01:27:28,260
a capacity management interface with

1560
01:27:25,560 --> 01:27:30,450
also core operations and topology and

1561
01:27:28,260 --> 01:27:32,190
topology information queries a fault

1562
01:27:30,450 --> 01:27:35,639
management interface which also allows

1563
01:27:32,190 --> 01:27:37,200
to query the different notifications for

1564
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:40,500
faults and performance management

1565
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:42,480
interface so this is the kind of concept

1566
01:27:40,500 --> 01:27:46,140
that we deal with at that level on this

1567
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:49,440
interface when we try to map nav with a

1568
01:27:46,140 --> 01:27:53,790
CTN so we have tried in document I fat32

1569
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:55,650
to get to a number of guesses over how

1570
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:59,730
this could do there is not unanimous

1571
01:27:55,650 --> 01:28:02,280
agreement on those mapping and if people

1572
01:27:59,730 --> 01:28:04,500
in a CTN have some comments about it

1573
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:06,269
we'd be happy to hear about it

1574
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:08,160
as you can see on the left hand side you

1575
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:10,320
have this drawing that shows that the EM

1576
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:11,780
the service Orchestrator and network

1577
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:14,910
Orchestrator are considered to be

1578
01:28:11,780 --> 01:28:17,309
equivalent to the MDS c but in other

1579
01:28:14,910 --> 01:28:20,460
interpretations we think that the MDS C

1580
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:23,490
is actually the wim itself so clearing

1581
01:28:20,460 --> 01:28:26,280
that understanding is something that you

1582
01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:30,900
could help doing so finally to get to

1583
01:28:26,280 --> 01:28:33,929
what we're typically asking for the the

1584
01:28:30,900 --> 01:28:35,339
ITF reaction so we we would like to be

1585
01:28:33,930 --> 01:28:37,590
Sienna Vee would like to be informed of

1586
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:40,230
the relevant RFC's and internet draft

1587
01:28:37,590 --> 01:28:42,300
that pertain to ITF actn I think it's

1588
01:28:40,230 --> 01:28:45,120
pretty easy to do along with the status

1589
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:48,570
of each other's document and the date of

1590
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:51,420
completions if any and also we are

1591
01:28:48,570 --> 01:28:54,299
interested should we identify some

1592
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:56,490
specific requirements over a CTN on how

1593
01:28:54,300 --> 01:29:00,210
we can do to push them forward to our

1594
01:28:56,490 --> 01:29:03,150
ITF I think I know but the dates are the

1595
01:29:00,210 --> 01:29:04,530
two ITF meetings are there of course one

1596
01:29:03,150 --> 01:29:07,650
thing that is not written there but

1597
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:09,660
which is prominent interest for us is to

1598
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:12,900
understand if the way that we are

1599
01:29:09,660 --> 01:29:18,690
planning to use a CTN is what you think

1600
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:20,759
our actn should be used thank you how do

1601
01:29:18,690 --> 01:29:23,610
you envision this exchange to take place

1602
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:25,620
so how do you envision that we will

1603
01:29:23,610 --> 01:29:27,389
communicate with each other so I think

1604
01:29:25,620 --> 01:29:29,250
that the easiest way would of course be

1605
01:29:27,390 --> 01:29:31,320
through shared participation or at least

1606
01:29:29,250 --> 01:29:34,650
three or four people that have common

1607
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:37,610
participation in both ITF and at Siena V

1608
01:29:34,650 --> 01:29:42,389
so that's the quickest way I would say

1609
01:29:37,610 --> 01:29:44,360
but we doesn't need to identify someone

1610
01:29:42,390 --> 01:29:48,810
in ITF that would at least take a look

1611
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:52,559
so generally we in the ITF look at

1612
01:29:48,810 --> 01:29:54,420
documents so if you have a document in

1613
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,240
some description that you can contribute

1614
01:29:54,420 --> 01:30:00,270
here you know the leaders not to be very

1615
01:29:57,240 --> 01:30:03,000
easy way to the text of the liaison

1616
01:30:00,270 --> 01:30:06,000
statement that was sent contains the

1617
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:09,840
links to publicly accessible documents

1618
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:11,730
from its univee if you want a case you

1619
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:13,320
would be asking for us to comment on

1620
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:14,910
that in the way that we would do that as

1621
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:18,090
see who is interested in participating

1622
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:19,349
if you submitted an internet draft that

1623
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:21,750
would be something that the working

1624
01:30:19,350 --> 01:30:24,270
group would actually definitely look at

1625
01:30:21,750 --> 01:30:27,000
so just keep that keep in mind how the

1626
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:29,700
process works the other suggestion is to

1627
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:32,160
talk with I think it's the IAB that

1628
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,840
manages relationships with other

1629
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,480
organizations I don't believe as a

1630
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:38,700
relationship between the IETF and that's

1631
01:30:36,480 --> 01:30:40,530
Etsy and having a formal relationship

1632
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:42,150
might house I think there is a formal

1633
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:44,370
relationship okay

1634
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:46,559
we haven't exchanged lots of liaison but

1635
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,780
this is the first real one where there

1636
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,880
is

1637
01:30:46,780 --> 01:30:50,469
yes I went looking for that the

1638
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:52,059
definition that identification of a

1639
01:30:50,469 --> 01:30:53,889
formal relationship and it doesn't seem

1640
01:30:52,059 --> 01:30:58,570
to be posted so we can talk about that

1641
01:30:53,889 --> 01:31:01,389
offline we have a Adrian Farrell so

1642
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:03,880
first I think it's really good news that

1643
01:31:01,389 --> 01:31:06,300
a CTN is reaching out beyond this

1644
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:09,849
working group so thank you for that

1645
01:31:06,300 --> 01:31:11,889
thank you for communicating and pointing

1646
01:31:09,849 --> 01:31:16,500
out the work and I think you're right

1647
01:31:11,889 --> 01:31:21,280
that the most efficient way of achieving

1648
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:23,260
progress is by mutual participation you

1649
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:26,139
may find it hard to get people to go to

1650
01:31:23,260 --> 01:31:30,670
even more standards meetings so emails

1651
01:31:26,139 --> 01:31:34,780
are good be careful of the formal

1652
01:31:30,670 --> 01:31:37,599
relationship formal liaison thing there

1653
01:31:34,780 --> 01:31:41,349
is no as Lou says there is no formal

1654
01:31:37,599 --> 01:31:44,590
relationship between the IETF and Etsy

1655
01:31:41,349 --> 01:31:50,020
at the moment that would take time to

1656
01:31:44,590 --> 01:31:52,960
set up and send in a formal request for

1657
01:31:50,020 --> 01:31:56,020
a formal response will fall into the

1658
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:58,960
quagmire what you want really is an

1659
01:31:56,020 --> 01:32:01,750
individual to be sending a mail to that

1660
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,369
tease saying we're doing this stuff does

1661
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:05,860
this look right and getting other

1662
01:32:03,369 --> 01:32:08,710
individuals to comment back that's

1663
01:32:05,860 --> 01:32:11,230
that's the effective way to make

1664
01:32:08,710 --> 01:32:13,650
progress not asking for the IETF s

1665
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:16,919
formal consensus opinion on something

1666
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:20,348
okay this is good guidance thank you

1667
01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:22,510
result from Nokia another thought about

1668
01:32:20,349 --> 01:32:25,179
this interface if I understood correctly

1669
01:32:22,510 --> 01:32:29,130
the interface is trying to basically

1670
01:32:25,179 --> 01:32:31,510
address the connectivity between to the

1671
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:34,179
virtual natural function in different

1672
01:32:31,510 --> 01:32:36,610
data centers the upper layer is a

1673
01:32:34,179 --> 01:32:38,800
request in the connectivity the new

1674
01:32:36,610 --> 01:32:41,829
initiative that we have on the network

1675
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:46,570
slicing design team the interface that

1676
01:32:41,829 --> 01:32:48,940
we are try to address I think could be

1677
01:32:46,570 --> 01:32:52,090
applicable here as well the upper layer

1678
01:32:48,940 --> 01:32:55,268
is requesting so-called transfer slice

1679
01:32:52,090 --> 01:32:58,030
or connectivity which are the logically

1680
01:32:55,269 --> 01:33:00,459
independent connection that we want to

1681
01:32:58,030 --> 01:33:05,099
do and this might be another

1682
01:33:00,459 --> 01:33:07,929
the way to do this the wingman interface

1683
01:33:05,099 --> 01:33:09,579
yeah I think it looks like it's it's

1684
01:33:07,929 --> 01:33:11,889
pretty close to what what's needed and

1685
01:33:09,579 --> 01:33:14,110
at Siena V itself is pretty oblivious to

1686
01:33:11,889 --> 01:33:16,809
slicing because slicing is supposed to

1687
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:19,719
do it on a higher level but still we do

1688
01:33:16,809 --> 01:33:22,360
carry the network slice identifiers into

1689
01:33:19,719 --> 01:33:24,420
the interfaces that we use conversation

1690
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:27,098
short were actually three minutes over

1691
01:33:24,420 --> 01:33:28,780
we have an IAB member behind you so I

1692
01:33:27,099 --> 01:33:33,429
don't know if he's gonna talk from that

1693
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:35,469
standpoint or no standpoint is in my

1694
01:33:33,429 --> 01:33:38,949
previous I have participated in Etsy and

1695
01:33:35,469 --> 01:33:41,199
leadership of Etsy doesn't recognize ATF

1696
01:33:38,949 --> 01:33:43,388
as such so saying that the relationship

1697
01:33:41,199 --> 01:33:47,169
with Etsy would be deceiving what you

1698
01:33:43,389 --> 01:33:49,269
see here is particular IG trying to work

1699
01:33:47,170 --> 01:33:50,469
with ATF would be great to establish

1700
01:33:49,269 --> 01:33:52,630
this relationship but it doesn't really

1701
01:33:50,469 --> 01:33:56,199
and we are certainly certainly would be

1702
01:33:52,630 --> 01:33:57,999
welcome any participation here so it's

1703
01:33:56,199 --> 01:33:59,228
it's the formality that makes it a

1704
01:33:57,999 --> 01:34:03,400
little problem makes it a little

1705
01:33:59,229 --> 01:34:05,739
problematic last last question just in

1706
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,688
on the comment from vista well the I'm

1707
01:34:05,739 --> 01:34:11,079
rich Contreras from telefónica just to

1708
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:13,539
say that they're considering this I 0 17

1709
01:34:11,079 --> 01:34:15,880
is from the roadmap of the API document

1710
01:34:13,539 --> 01:34:19,929
that we are managing in design team for

1711
01:34:15,880 --> 01:34:22,119
nebula slicing okay so Daniel II has a

1712
01:34:19,929 --> 01:34:24,249
comment on jabber this will be the way

1713
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:26,799
we end is he says this has nothing to do

1714
01:34:24,249 --> 01:34:28,719
with slicing so if you want to have a

1715
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:30,159
conversation more to learn more we can

1716
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,429
take it to the list and get the

1717
01:34:30,159 --> 01:34:35,188
conversation going about with different

1718
01:34:33,429 --> 01:34:38,699
individuals having a good conversation

1719
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:44,199
this is welcome alright great thank you

1720
01:34:38,699 --> 01:34:46,959
we will see you back not the next

1721
01:34:44,199 --> 01:34:52,438
session but the one after that and we'll

1722
01:34:46,959 --> 01:34:52,438
be back here 5:10 thank you

1723
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,940
no it would be nice if it was
