1
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,310
[Music]

2
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,649
[Music]

3
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:09,990
how come you get murdered

4
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:26,680
the folks say it's true but they go

5
00:02:24,909 --> 00:02:33,730
monkey we're missing Mary Ellen a few

6
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:55,440
other people yeah but she's also she's

7
00:02:33,730 --> 00:03:03,339
also French saara so you hear us well

8
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:05,940
okay no problem depression this team is

9
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,940
addressing it

10
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:32,799
I suggest we stop so welcome to the

11
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:34,900
network coding research group or as Dave

12
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:41,650
Oren just said the French coding recent

13
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:45,459
group this is a I think the continuation

14
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:46,750
of a number of of the work that we've

15
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:49,209
been doing for a while but I think

16
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:52,690
there's always new things I think I was

17
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,299
also welcome Raymond who is usually

18
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,170
online and is finally here with us so

19
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:01,660
welcome to the group and yes we have a

20
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:04,208
number of interesting presentations

21
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,890
we're also very happy to have today the

22
00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:11,489
people from loops who are looking at

23
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:16,750
similar things but more from the IETF

24
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:19,239
point of view so again we're not the

25
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:24,669
IETF with the IRT so our goal is to

26
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:27,159
foster research and mostly and network

27
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:29,590
and application layer coding to improve

28
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,270
network performance and I have a

29
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:34,419
presentation a bit later it's not just

30
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,060
the networks that we know like now but

31
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:38,650
also the future of the networks where

32
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,110
you start having computing elements

33
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,929
everywhere so we want to look at coding

34
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:46,090
and coding libraries protocols and a lot

35
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,680
of real-world use case and I think this

36
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,719
is where there's a lot of cool stuff

37
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,720
happening also in the work in progress

38
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,479
well okay so let us know yeah I press

39
00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:00,460
the wrong button

40
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:03,880
thank you so this is the new note well

41
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:05,888
for the IRT F if you haven't seen it it

42
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,400
restates a lot of things already know

43
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:13,000
but it talks about in the more specific

44
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,820
I RTF world and obviously there's all

45
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,770
the issues still of am i doing something

46
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:23,590
wrong oh thank you thank you you know

47
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:27,070
technology is difficult I said the math

48
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:29,710
campus oh wow okay so okay so it's very

49
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:31,150
much more in the IRT F point of view it

50
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:33,729
means that you know we still have issue

51
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,998
you still have to disclose and the

52
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:38,919
pyaare and patents new part of it is

53
00:05:36,999 --> 00:05:41,650
that we also have to be nice to one

54
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,990
another as the ITF wants more and more

55
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:49,210
foster an environment where people feel

56
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:51,939
safe to express opinions and this one

57
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,998
say states explicitly the goal of the

58
00:05:51,939 --> 00:05:57,400
IRT F which is not to do standardization

59
00:05:54,999 --> 00:06:00,969
but it's very much to foster research

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,308
and foster communities of research along

61
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:06,550
the topics that we're talking about this

62
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:10,120
case coding and applications and I think

63
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,360
that makes it very important to see also

64
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,460
how I RTF and IETF can work together so

65
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,279
that the research is done here and then

66
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,899
eventually we can actually you know send

67
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:26,740
it to the IETF when there's something

68
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:29,409
that needs standardization so this is

69
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:32,860
about an instructive stuff there's no

70
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:35,080
big change just to remind you that you

71
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,990
can have a look at the github repository

72
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:39,938
where we store all the presentations all

73
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,370
the minutes everything that concerned

74
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:46,259
this working group with the troops sorry

75
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:49,870
as well as the swift correct

76
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:51,339
implementation so everything is there so

77
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:55,419
do not hesitate there is also of course

78
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:59,050
the death tracker this is the agenda so

79
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:02,169
we have almost full agenda today

80
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:07,559
maybe with ten use of spare time at the

81
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:11,289
end we will see do does anybody want to

82
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:13,449
change add something talk about

83
00:07:11,289 --> 00:07:17,009
something that was not in the list so in

84
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:21,699
this agenda no it's okay for everybody

85
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:25,449
okay so we'll go for it

86
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:30,669
first of all a few news about current

87
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:34,889
internet drafts and so on written

88
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:38,740
internet resto concerning the group

89
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:42,550
documents except the presentation we'll

90
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:45,819
have later on we have two topics two

91
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,500
sets of internet drafts that will not be

92
00:07:45,819 --> 00:07:51,190
presented there the first one

93
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:54,490
that is about network coding for CDN so

94
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:57,550
sorry see CN and DN environments with

95
00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,760
requirements and challenges so Dave you

96
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:06,340
may document some time ago it was in ITF

97
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:09,640
104 so in March this year the document

98
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:12,400
the idea was to discuss document within

99
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:14,800
the IC energy which is what we said at

100
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,690
that time so what's the situation have

101
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,560
no reservations you've put me on the

102
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:22,840
spot didn't public

103
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,750
I've got no feedback from anybody on in

104
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:29,770
the RG on the document since then I'll

105
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:33,219
bug everybody again ok so when you feel

106
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,579
that we can continue with and we'll see

107
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:38,260
our G+ school then tell us tell us what

108
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,760
when I give them a month and then we'll

109
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:42,789
move it forward no matter what happens

110
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,380
how's that okay well I have to confirm

111
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:46,960
that with my co-chairs but yeah of

112
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,410
course okay thank you aware this mic is

113
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:56,100
off

114
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:59,230
so there's anybody this mic on meet you

115
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:02,620
here it Thanks okay thank you for the

116
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:07,440
status the other one is about this those

117
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:07,440
two documents are in C documents

118
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:12,880
unfortunately nobody from the author's

119
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:16,780
was able to come to this or I turned

120
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:17,740
remotely this meeting but the situation

121
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,520
is the following

122
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:24,550
in who's told us that record there was

123
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:28,510
an update on the RNC single citation

124
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,329
documents small tech fixing a few things

125
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:33,040
not nothing very essential there is also

126
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,680
another document that expired

127
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:41,760
unfortunately at the moment they don't

128
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:46,239
have any clear view on what to do next

129
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:48,160
so the situation is about is a little

130
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,860
bit ambiguous

131
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:54,550
he asked earth chairs

132
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,650
he asked us to ask to the group to

133
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:59,740
everybody to to have a look and to

134
00:09:56,650 --> 00:10:01,220
provide feedbacks and we will also have

135
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,410
to decide together what

136
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:06,740
we want to do with two with these two

137
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:10,219
documents accept them as working a

138
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:14,480
recent groupie team or or not so that's

139
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:16,879
an open question to everybody so if you

140
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,550
have an opinion you can you're invited

141
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:23,660
to express yourself and the list on the

142
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:27,469
mic as you want we would like to take

143
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:30,139
decision on tooth decay rapidly there

144
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:32,300
was a desire concerning chairs to to

145
00:10:30,139 --> 00:10:35,899
have a iron see documentation so it

146
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:41,389
makes sense but okay does anybody want

147
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:46,040
to discuss this no I would actually

148
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:47,449
really support what they saw has said

149
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,639
and I think it's because it goes to the

150
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:51,769
notes so please put it there I think

151
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,769
it's extremely important that we have a

152
00:10:51,769 --> 00:10:57,410
document on on our LNC and I would put

153
00:10:54,769 --> 00:11:00,019
also the people of titlis on the

154
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,819
underline here I think one of the since

155
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,209
one of them is here I'm looking at him

156
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:07,370
now and I think one of the goals of this

157
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:11,329
group at the beginning was to have a set

158
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:13,970
of documentation on existing FEC

159
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:15,769
solutions or network coding solutions

160
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:17,750
and because again we have in the room

161
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:21,050
the people from loops who are actually

162
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:24,259
looking for for directions when they

163
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,628
start doing some FEC beyond the stuff

164
00:11:24,259 --> 00:11:28,040
that is already existing on open source

165
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,009
and everything so I think it would be

166
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:33,889
extremely important to continue in this

167
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:35,809
in this way of having a set of documents

168
00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:40,579
I think we're having very soon

169
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:43,160
they are the RFC's from and so on the

170
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:46,699
swift codec but I think the other ones

171
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:49,399
are a RLC Ireland C and Tetris I would

172
00:11:46,699 --> 00:11:52,609
really really like to see them with my

173
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:56,420
hat chair my char hat chair hat I'm

174
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:58,009
actually so tired my my chair hat on I

175
00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:03,670
would really really like to see those

176
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:09,220
happening just about

177
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:12,370
the tetris a draft Jonathan did some

178
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:16,450
correction I think there is nothing more

179
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,640
to to add inside so I will have a chat

180
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:21,880
with my colleagues when I will back back

181
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:26,230
to from Singapore but we don't see

182
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:29,710
anything else to add inside so as a

183
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,770
document and actually yeah feel free to

184
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,810
discuss or to comment or the criticism I

185
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:38,260
think if you can post a new version I

186
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:40,540
think we would really be really really

187
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,819
happy to be able to put it as a as a

188
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:45,250
group document and move on yes there is

189
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:47,920
an updated one that is not published yet

190
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,220
because we still out this discussing on

191
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,990
it but if it's of interest for the group

192
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,790
who would publish it again if you look

193
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:58,000
at the Charter it was part of the

194
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:00,819
Charter to have said I know I know I

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,340
will I will speak with Jonathan at Maya

196
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,350
when I'm back thank you and we will make

197
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,870
sure to connect to the RL and see people

198
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,130
but Yanis I think was very open to it

199
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:13,470
it's just that he has a family emergency

200
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:16,360
yes thank you

201
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,270
if you want about the three related

202
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,170
internet drafts so about fake friend or

203
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:26,260
C&T mg42 so do three documents are

204
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:32,770
almost done in the sense that the I'll C

205
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:35,650
and T 90 52 PNG have been not yet really

206
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:38,079
published but almost published as I see

207
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:41,439
we already have the the numbers 86-81

208
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:44,800
and 62 for those two documents and now

209
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:48,100
we are just waiting for final approval

210
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,990
by Magnus our ad actor and the effect

211
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,250
for an extension to sliding window cards

212
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,870
just a matter of rewarding issues here

213
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,620
and there on the documents it's not a

214
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,840
big deal

215
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:02,170
but we are waiting for for his approval

216
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:04,240
then I guess that in the coming days it

217
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:06,939
should be a published the three of them

218
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,370
will be published together as ice so

219
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:14,120
we're very very close to the end now so

220
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:19,370
for the few

221
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:22,300
well we'll talk about it at the end okay

222
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:22,300
so let's move to the first

223
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:27,520
the following presentation by myself

224
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:40,809
[Music]

225
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:56,270
right :

226
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,560
okay so this is just a quick feedback

227
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:04,250
from the Hakkasan on Saturday and Sunday

228
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:06,739
so I remember when you do the goal of

229
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:09,590
this like a song this is to develop an

230
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,410
open source reference correct free

231
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,680
correct for sliding window cuts and also

232
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:18,740
to challenge document on the API for

233
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,650
such a colleague so we were three people

234
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:28,760
at that time for this hackathon myself

235
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:30,949
Omaima and Siri and very happy that in

236
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:34,490
between this hackathon previous one

237
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:38,390
second Omaima managed to work a lot on

238
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:39,830
this project and we are approaching not

239
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:41,420
the end but we are approaching a

240
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,750
situation where things will start

241
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,579
working very well so what has been done

242
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:48,920
so the end color let's say it's almost

243
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,570
done the decoder and that's the great

244
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,229
thing because this is the complex part

245
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:58,190
starts working so we managed to do

246
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:04,820
decoding and to real sauce packets and

247
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:07,430
check that sauce packet is indeed ok

248
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:09,680
we also this see demonstration

249
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:13,729
application that's almost done and the

250
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:17,390
Python work of rapper and demos on top

251
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:21,110
of this rapper that are almost on so we

252
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:24,080
are approaching the end even if the

253
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,630
still work to be done we also managed to

254
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:30,550
we also found

255
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:33,740
an issue in the API stupid thing and

256
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:36,140
four points that remain open in this

257
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,390
document and in particular Rd I would

258
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,189
like to say a few words about the ESI

259
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:42,370
the encoding symbol idea it's not

260
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,540
something a very trivial because

261
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:47,660
currently the way it's implemented is

262
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:51,170
just type def it's type def to an

263
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:53,030
unsigned int 32 bits and that's all but

264
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:56,150
if you look at some of the documents

265
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:58,699
were working on in particular this I'll

266
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:02,390
see for quick document you will see that

267
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:05,240
this including symbol ID is represented

268
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:07,910
as a variable int integer in the sense

269
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,920
of quick meaning that can be a small or

270
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:12,160
larger integer so that's something

271
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,680
non-trivial to do in order to map this

272
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:18,530
fireball size into the API in a way that

273
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,540
can be used in different contexts so

274
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,139
that's something we'll have to fix in

275
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:27,500
the next cycle hopefully so next step

276
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:30,560
now is for next time I said Montrell but

277
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,080
that's mistake it's Vancouver so in our

278
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:36,679
ITF 107 at Vancouver

279
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:40,340
we'll have our fifth Agathon and do some

280
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:42,470
kind of improvement of the code cleaning

281
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,919
and things like that documentation also

282
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:47,870
something that could be very useful

283
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:49,550
explaining much better how to do and

284
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,320
cutting the coding how to write an

285
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:55,220
application on top of deuce decoder and

286
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:57,409
colors and decoders so and once this

287
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:59,930
will be done then we will be able to

288
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,320
move to the next step which is which

289
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:06,200
will consist in having this soil and see

290
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,090
like codec being implemented it's just a

291
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:09,290
matter of changing a few things inside

292
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:12,139
the incorrect buts

293
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,730
it seems simple say it like that it's

294
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:15,260
always a bit more tricky when you go

295
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:17,600
into the source code when you want to

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:19,640
actually implement it but that's

297
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,750
something that will that will be our

298
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:28,790
next goal once this I'll see like codec

299
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:31,280
will be done I'm done for this quick

300
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:34,070
ethical once again I would really like

301
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,930
to thank may not because thanks to you

302
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,970
we made a lot of progress on these

303
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:40,390
projects thank you very much and also

304
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:40,390
city

305
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:47,560
comments yeah do you want you want to

306
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:51,950
say something okay any questions

307
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:55,070
comments for those of you who have not

308
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,600
participated in the hackathons yet I'm

309
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,639
actually also running another one in

310
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,800
parallel this we didn't manage to get

311
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,720
the same table but I think it's becoming

312
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,909
more and more a really nice way of

313
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,820
learning with the other groups in both

314
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:10,640
the IETF and the IRT F for doing because

315
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,010
for two days were actually co-located as

316
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:16,100
when we here we're so much distributed

317
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:17,990
in different places so I would really if

318
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:20,330
you can arrive early on the Saturday I

319
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:22,400
would really recommend that you show up

320
00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:24,350
even if you don't want to we don't want

321
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,420
a hack just you know just come and hang

322
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:28,669
out yeah and there's also this

323
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:31,040
presentation on Sunday afternoon where

324
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:33,830
you will get a feeling of what's going

325
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,110
on during the accident so everybody will

326
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:39,020
present you in a few minutes what they

327
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:40,550
managed to do the NGO project and so

328
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,660
it's very interesting to have a global

329
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:51,940
view overview of what's going on in ITF

330
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:51,940
and IIF I RT F as well thank you next

331
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:26,209
no Cebu City possible perfect okay so

332
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:28,188
let's go okay so hello everyone and

333
00:20:26,209 --> 00:20:29,809
furry because that's a very worst part

334
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:32,179
of the day for me I've been sleeping

335
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,699
every early afternoon this week so I

336
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:39,709
hope you're not sleeping and I hope I'm

337
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:43,939
not and he's an update for the network

338
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:46,669
coding for satellite systems document so

339
00:20:43,939 --> 00:20:48,079
these that melibea will go through what

340
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:50,239
happened and for those who are not

341
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,049
familiar with what is the scope of

342
00:20:50,239 --> 00:20:55,909
document the idea is to identify

343
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:57,889
scenarios where including network

344
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,559
cutting at higher layer than the

345
00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:02,748
physical and major ones and in satellite

346
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,219
systems make sense and in is an

347
00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:09,009
opportunity for more natural cooling

348
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:13,219
deployed in general so we were in

349
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:18,889
research group last call in April we

350
00:21:13,219 --> 00:21:22,399
have a second one in the 15th of October

351
00:21:18,889 --> 00:21:26,779
and we received the lloyd would comment

352
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:30,228
on the fixed on 26 so i have here some

353
00:21:26,779 --> 00:21:32,689
slides on explaining how we dealt with

354
00:21:30,229 --> 00:21:35,779
every single comments they are also

355
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:38,269
available on the github repository of

356
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:40,639
the research group where we made an

357
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,109
issue for every comment we received so i

358
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:47,539
can go through them I don't know have

359
00:21:42,109 --> 00:21:50,658
time but ok ok code is not here anyway

360
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:55,089
from but I will go sweeten you ok in

361
00:21:50,659 --> 00:21:58,449
case ok

362
00:21:55,089 --> 00:22:00,529
medically that was that was a comment on

363
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:02,719
the fact that it's not really clear

364
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:05,389
whether we are speaking about link layer

365
00:22:02,719 --> 00:22:07,669
and physical layer or not we tried to

366
00:22:05,389 --> 00:22:10,478
clarify that lots of times

367
00:22:07,669 --> 00:22:12,469
apparently it was not enough so we

368
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:14,899
skipped lots of things from the

369
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:17,059
introduction to be narrow directly down

370
00:22:14,899 --> 00:22:18,918
to what the actual problem and the

371
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:22,070
document is tackling

372
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:25,039
so that is one of the many changes we've

373
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:27,759
done another one that you've more

374
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,200
satellite speaking to a satellite guy on

375
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,379
do we need to specify what those effect

376
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:35,330
fame is as opposed to a be befriend and

377
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:37,100
in the document we say that's it is a

378
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:40,428
satellite discussion so we points to the

379
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,918
DVB standard documents and we you just

380
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:46,820
not need here to know what and below the

381
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:48,769
access layer so just one comment the

382
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,939
fake friend do this fake friend is not

383
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:55,489
the one I'm talking about

384
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:58,309
so it's a bit confusing that's dvb-s the

385
00:22:55,489 --> 00:23:03,440
wording furnance sorry for that I didn't

386
00:22:58,309 --> 00:23:06,470
realize in making that is somehow in

387
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,820
detail as well or more change figures to

388
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:13,100
make things clearer that we have done

389
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:19,309
that as well and that's a comment

390
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:21,049
related to also the problem on I see em

391
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,789
I see em if the mechanism we have a

392
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,529
drink layer in satellite systems to

393
00:23:22,789 --> 00:23:27,499
actually have horrible transmissions

394
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:30,649
that enable us seeing clouds coming and

395
00:23:27,499 --> 00:23:32,299
that recording rate and and what we say

396
00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:35,629
in the document is that this mechanism

397
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:38,389
do not go as quickly I have they should

398
00:23:35,629 --> 00:23:40,639
for mobile yet mobile users or when we

399
00:23:38,389 --> 00:23:41,719
go through higher bandwidth bands such

400
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:45,320
as UV bands

401
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,570
so we basically here tried to make that

402
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,639
way clearer in the document that all

403
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:53,720
these link layer stuff are out of the

404
00:23:49,639 --> 00:23:55,729
scope and I hope it's better but then we

405
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:57,379
thought we were over but then we

406
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,580
received also comments from vents on so

407
00:23:57,379 --> 00:24:01,820
basically the weather

408
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,570
another error on the fake in the

409
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:08,090
glossary there was wording issues

410
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:10,220
introduction in the end if you want what

411
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:12,769
so this has been done this week earlier

412
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:15,409
this week because we just sat down with

413
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:18,049
one song and took one of all the issues

414
00:24:15,409 --> 00:24:21,259
you had one by one and work directly on

415
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:24,080
the github of the the document so

416
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:26,029
basically when something was compute in

417
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,489
general when something was computing we

418
00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:30,139
removed it try to have very short a

419
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:32,809
document to go straight to the point of

420
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:36,860
what is in the scope of the document

421
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:39,230
what is not we tried to have a better

422
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,168
wedding we are not native speakers so if

423
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:43,490
anyone wants to hold you our English

424
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:46,340
you're welcome

425
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:50,809
we removed the figure that one that was

426
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:54,019
confusing also that's another problem we

427
00:24:50,809 --> 00:24:56,120
have when you mix words that a payload

428
00:24:54,019 --> 00:24:57,499
for satellite is actually the thing that

429
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,989
is flying and of the payload of the

430
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:02,509
packet so that's can lead to some

431
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:04,100
confusion it's the same issues such as

432
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,240
we had with a fig frame so we just

433
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:07,850
remove that we just pick about

434
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,119
satellites and not that is the kind of

435
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,340
detail things we've been doing and we

436
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:16,908
have tried to put some details details

437
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:18,619
on the multipath use case and we have

438
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:21,499
rewritten the section of modulation

439
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:27,799
encoding and mobile and QV bands because

440
00:25:21,499 --> 00:25:30,619
that was not clear so we think that with

441
00:25:27,799 --> 00:25:35,720
this update the document is ready for

442
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:37,789
another round of last call and so if you

443
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,470
have any question we are here if you

444
00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:44,929
want to have use the document thank you

445
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:47,119
very much and that's it yes so just to

446
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:49,940
make it clear this document is hopefully

447
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,330
close to the end it was a recent copy

448
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:56,840
terms for sometime we went through

449
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:59,629
already two last calls and now the last

450
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,350
perhaps some programs but there arm on

451
00:25:59,629 --> 00:26:05,990
the editorial side and improvement

452
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:10,428
things like that hopefully it will be

453
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:13,519
fixed rapidly so the idea is to ask for

454
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:16,879
volunteers to review this document if

455
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:20,629
feasible imagine myself will read it

456
00:26:16,879 --> 00:26:23,949
again as it is now and trying to fix the

457
00:26:20,629 --> 00:26:28,248
last few mittens but hopefully it will

458
00:26:23,950 --> 00:26:30,440
soon move to the next step I under

459
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:32,590
document Shefford so I will take care of

460
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,590
this

461
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,480
- okay thank you

462
00:26:55,560 --> 00:27:01,530
so we now have a presentation from

463
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,810
Raymond it is a great that you managed

464
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:06,750
to come this time well very pleased of

465
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:09,389
that as we said before just to remind

466
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:12,360
you that was working progress on this

467
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,150
topic on bat skirts and remand made

468
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:17,879
several presentations of those skirts

469
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:21,450
and also the use case where these those

470
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:22,860
cuts are going to be deployed and so on

471
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,350
so this is an update of the situation

472
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,280
there is also an intern draft that is

473
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:32,219
associated to this twist work and also

474
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:35,280
like to discuss about it again

475
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:40,740
so thank you I give you the floor ok

476
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,580
pusher everybody and I thank you and

477
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,030
also Vincent

478
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:46,620
ok I'm from the Institute of no coding

479
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:49,110
of Chinese University of Hong Kong and I

480
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,729
also have a hat because I am now running

481
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:54,840
a startup company called n hop

482
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:57,300
technologies ok so I I think I don't

483
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:00,120
have to say too much about spot impose

484
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:01,830
but just sums as to something see

485
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,060
something about background now the thing

486
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,379
is that there are a lot of equipments on

487
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,210
the small impose and they must be

488
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,540
connected to the Internet backbone and

489
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,760
possible technologies are optical fiber

490
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:14,879
cellular and one infinite choice pads

491
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,140
which is say kind of like an efficient

492
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,320
implementation random linear neural

493
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,910
coding okay so for optical fiber you

494
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,730
know we know that that has got very high

495
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:26,130
data rate highly reliable and unless you

496
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,140
accidentally lit the cup the fiber

497
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,750
however it has high installation cause

498
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:32,280
it's a very long set of time for example

499
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,940
I was told that you know in many cities

500
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:37,740
if you want to get all the licenses for

501
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,050
developer row it may take two to three

502
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,990
years which is a to long time to wait

503
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:46,139
for many applications and so

504
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:48,750
realistically only a very small number

505
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:51,060
of lampposts in the inner system can be

506
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,190
directly connected to optical fiber

507
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,940
now the rest you still need to find some

508
00:28:53,190 --> 00:29:00,180
way to connect them to the Internet so

509
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:01,680
how about we use a 4G or all upcoming 5g

510
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,650
okay so it's very simple you just

511
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:07,530
install a 4G card at each lamppost

512
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,970
converting each one into have like a

513
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:11,370
cell phone

514
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:13,380
the pros are easy to deploy and

515
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:15,090
relatively inexpensive but the cons are

516
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,910
it has a very high in recurring cost

517
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:20,550
also you upload data 24 hours a day and

518
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:22,200
7 days a week and you need to pay the

519
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:24,720
monthly service fee I mean you're

520
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,410
talking about a city with 10,000 M post

521
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,050
and you have a pretty huge a monthly fee

522
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:34,590
to pay and the government usually do not

523
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:36,570
pay for this kind of solution and for 40

524
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:39,030
another problem is that bandwidth

525
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:41,570
drastically drops during rush hours

526
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:45,480
hopefully will not be the case for 5g

527
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:48,929
now the so what we are introducing is a

528
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:51,060
multi hop solution called bats so now in

529
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:52,410
this particular illustration we have on

530
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,300
the left hand side lamppost

531
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,280
which has direct connection to an

532
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:58,649
optical fiber and what we do is that we

533
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:01,470
connect the rest of the lamppost on the

534
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:04,920
same street using a wireless multi hub

535
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:08,030
network okay so why do we want to talk

536
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,230
about bats the problem here is that

537
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:12,300
multi-hop is a long-standing problem in

538
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:14,190
wireless communications for the reason

539
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:17,490
that for each hub you lose packets and

540
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:20,250
if you regard you know packets as being

541
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:22,140
a commodity then there's no way that you

542
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:24,570
can prevent hackers from losing a long

543
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,220
way and the and the throughput drops

544
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:29,610
exponentially fast with the number of

545
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:31,020
house now the I talked to some people in

546
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:33,899
industry and sometimes they call this

547
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:35,070
the multi-hop curse and bats as I

548
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:38,280
mentioned is an efficient implementation

549
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:41,070
of randomly in enamel coating and with

550
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:43,230
this technology you know transmission

551
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:45,149
can sustain tens or even hundreds of

552
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:46,650
hops without relying on link by language

553
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:48,210
transmission which actually is very bad

554
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:51,690
for video transmission itself you may

555
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:54,090
know okay now the the idea is to instead

556
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:56,670
we employ recoding at the intermediate

557
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:00,750
nodes and with paths a very long

558
00:30:56,670 --> 00:31:03,180
multi-hop network can be realized okay

559
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,910
so this is a monograph that was

560
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:10,440
published by Shanghai Yang and myself is

561
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:15,420
the my co-inventor of s code that we

562
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:17,790
first first proposed in 2011 and so

563
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,360
here's a performance comparison between

564
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:22,860
bass and in this example I just put down

565
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,049
tcp/ip it could be any

566
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,899
stolen forward based technology

567
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:31,049
including fun and code for example so in

568
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:32,580
this case we assume that's the the

569
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:35,999
packet loss on each lane without

570
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:39,539
retransmission is equal to 20% so that

571
00:31:35,999 --> 00:31:41,600
after one hop you know you got only 0.8

572
00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:44,519
okay and if you use store-and-forward

573
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,590
along the way then you every hobby

574
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,860
multiplied by 0.8 and you throughput

575
00:31:46,590 --> 00:31:51,990
drops exponentially fast whereas with

576
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:54,658
with them ran Venini Annelle coding

577
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:58,529
ideally you know the throughput won't

578
00:31:54,659 --> 00:32:00,450
change with the number of hops and which

579
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:03,210
is in these in Tonica results now with a

580
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:06,860
bad service is kind of like a good

581
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:08,970
approximation of this orthotic

582
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:11,100
implementation of randomly ninel coding

583
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,129
except that it is highly efficient and

584
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,360
keeping implemented on most platforms we

585
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:18,840
see that there's a drop in performance

586
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,998
but the drop is it's very slow okay so

587
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:25,259
so after 50 halves you still get about

588
00:32:20,999 --> 00:32:27,809
0.7 and and the drop actually becomes

589
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:31,139
slow and slower and in this part we see

590
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:36,320
that after 1,000 hops you still get

591
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:41,129
about point six six of the original

592
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,259
through poetry okay so these are some

593
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:45,840
technical features of bat since Scott

594
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:47,999
high throughput load agency as we know

595
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,949
for running and never coding it is

596
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:53,129
basically pipelining operation so that

597
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:56,279
you don't wait for for for any lost

598
00:32:53,129 --> 00:32:57,840
packets or the cutting and it's got a

599
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:59,970
little coding complexity and low source

600
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,009
requirements these the last two features

601
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:05,399
are regarding the efficiency of

602
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:08,639
implementation and now I would like to

603
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,610
talk about the real deployment of bats

604
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:14,998
in the Hong Kong small n post project

605
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:17,699
the the plan was to install 400 spar

606
00:33:14,999 --> 00:33:19,919
lamppost starting some last summer okay

607
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,440
this is a the scope of the pilot project

608
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,320
and then followed by several 10,000

609
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:28,320
lamppost and ourself company has been

610
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,879
commissioned to deploy bats in 36 out of

611
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,250
the first 50 small M post and so this is

612
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:36,770
the first

613
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:42,850
small important system that was erected

614
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:46,340
in in the city and so our project were

615
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,590
participated in in the 2019 exhibition

616
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:50,270
of inventions of Geneva and we were very

617
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:54,260
honored to receive a code matter with

618
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:57,830
congratulations of the jewelry and so

619
00:33:54,260 --> 00:34:00,020
this picture shows the the design of the

620
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:04,460
small and post it it is hollow in the

621
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:07,010
middle so that all the IPC's and other

622
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:11,659
devices can be concealed inside a

623
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,739
lamppost which is very important you may

624
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:15,678
know that in Hong Kong there are a lot

625
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:17,359
of hurricanes and this is actually a

626
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:20,480
very good design for for the local

627
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:24,320
situation and there there's some the

628
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,740
field the gadgets here which are called

629
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,050
Donuts and these are small containers

630
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:33,729
that actually contains them that the

631
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,730
antennas for for bats

632
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:40,250
so this particular boxes is the install

633
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:45,490
recall the best boxes and industrial PC

634
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:48,080
and the the best box was actually

635
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:50,540
co-developed with event tech as some of

636
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:55,489
you may know it event is one of the

637
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:56,929
leading IPC vendors from Taiwan and the

638
00:34:55,489 --> 00:34:59,169
current status is that we have already

639
00:34:56,929 --> 00:35:01,220
successfully deployed at two streets

640
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,040
unfortunately as some of you may know

641
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:07,669
there's a picture more in hong kong and

642
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:11,900
on the on august 24th there was a

643
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:14,260
protest in which the the spar lamppost

644
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,780
at one of the streets were heavily

645
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:20,720
vandalized that's very unfortunate and

646
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:22,820
it's the diploma is almost done at

647
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,230
another street now the the reason is

648
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,820
that the general public has concerned

649
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:29,090
about the installation of video cameras

650
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:32,150
on the on the lamppost due to a possible

651
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:33,620
infringement of privacy and to respond

652
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:35,870
to this the government has formed a

653
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,600
special committee to review the spot

654
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:40,520
impose applications and so this is

655
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:45,049
something we you need to be mindful

656
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,780
about for this kind of applications and

657
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:52,190
so one possible recommendation

658
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:54,470
the committee it could be to replace the

659
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:56,000
cameras by Raiders or lighters which is

660
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,390
less sensitive because the Raiders and

661
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Niners cannot really do face recognition

662
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:05,509
ok and and also could not recognize a

663
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,950
license plate okay so this one thing I

664
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:09,320
would like to mention which I didn't

665
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:12,950
realize before instead the best actually

666
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,380
has got a very close connection with for

667
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,779
computing this fence is inherently a for

668
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,670
computing application for the reason

669
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:20,840
that the competition must be done at

670
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,290
edge okay for most other applications

671
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,090
you know you can do it at a cloud except

672
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:29,000
that the performance may be degraded but

673
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:31,630
for best it must be done at edge so best

674
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,490
is actually inherently for edge

675
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:38,630
computing application so we planned to

676
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:41,600
install our 24 note base model impose on

677
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:43,760
the on our own University campus with

678
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:46,190
vets being provided as service by by the

679
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,530
 node and this is meant to be a

680
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:51,410
prototype for the next generation smart

681
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:53,990
and post and there's some further

682
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,870
opportunities that ripping exploring we

683
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:58,339
talked to some some departments in the

684
00:36:56,870 --> 00:37:00,109
government they are very interested in

685
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:02,570
installing spot lampposts in country

686
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,790
parks and which not largely not covered

687
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,760
by our seller networks and this poses

688
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:10,310
some threats to to the hikers okay so

689
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,290
and also that we learned that many

690
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:14,990
cities in Southeast Asia are interesting

691
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:19,640
in having some kind of party small and

692
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:21,229
post projects so as mentioned by Vincent

693
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:25,490
we have submitted a and internet draft

694
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:28,340
and and this is the the list of patents

695
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:33,819
that we have obtained so far ok thank

696
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:36,620
you for your attention thank you

697
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:39,610
commands from the room yeah

698
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:42,620
yes you thank you thank you our

699
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:50,330
presentation I just want to come back to

700
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:54,290
slide 8 please yes this one

701
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:57,470
I have good eyes not sure so we all know

702
00:37:54,290 --> 00:38:01,460
that TCP is called I've seen in such use

703
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:04,189
case so the things you are showing here

704
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:08,450
is that you encapsulate TCP inside your

705
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:12,890
bags coding no we don't use TCP we use

706
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:15,319
UDP it's a UDP so you compare TCP start

707
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:19,460
out with a UDP flows which is bad coded

708
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:22,040
I guess ok so there is no there is no

709
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:24,440
fairness no feedback no feedback I don't

710
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:26,509
know retransmission ok but if you share

711
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,270
several flows between them how does it

712
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:31,640
either I'm sorry if you share multiple

713
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:34,070
flows because it just one flows ok

714
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,100
actually we have that implementation so

715
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,900
each one of them in our current

716
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:43,490
implementation each one of them has a

717
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:45,140
different flow ok so it's a you you use

718
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:47,839
a congestion control something like that

719
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:50,060
inside your UDP or how do you manage it

720
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:53,030
between flows when you heat for instance

721
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:54,980
a base station and you you got goes on

722
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:57,190
and doesn't flows arriving at the base

723
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,380
station okay we don't have dozens of

724
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:02,360
thousands of those at this point we have

725
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:04,790
let's for example in Hindi and the small

726
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,070
lamppost application for example you

727
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:08,960
know that devices on each lamppost and

728
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:11,780
there each one of them is connected back

729
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,410
to to the lamppost on the left-hand side

730
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:18,050
in our in the picture yeah ok and just a

731
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,240
last question so if I won't understand

732
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,730
it's a protocol itself like quick for

733
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,979
instance we affect coding inside this is

734
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:31,280
not something we see that is added to us

735
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:32,690
beautiful ok actually I don't I I think

736
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,970
we've talked about this offline because

737
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:38,840
I'm not sure doing the implementation I

738
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,790
i if passed by I really your question to

739
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:41,780
my technical team ok but very

740
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:46,700
interesting thank you thank you very

741
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:52,370
much ok also commands those are

742
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:54,950
questions thank you

743
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,859
I would like to just look a bit about

744
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:01,310
the internal drafts so in the same way

745
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:04,190
we asked for having something from the

746
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:07,038
audience he and Tetris people

747
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:10,009
we have now something for bats that's

748
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:11,599
also something that is what this is

749
00:40:10,009 --> 00:40:15,380
solution that is currently employed so

750
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,140
that's great and so the question is

751
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:21,759
what's the future for this document what

752
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:25,430
do you as a contributor would like to do

753
00:40:21,759 --> 00:40:26,749
achieve with this document so we hope

754
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:29,029
that at some point it could be

755
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:32,779
considered as as part of a part of a

756
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:35,960
standard yeah so so as we said before as

757
00:40:32,779 --> 00:40:38,839
we said in introduction we our research

758
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:44,119
group so there is no standard see but we

759
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:46,999
can publish informational RFC that's

760
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:49,489
feasible that's okay but it will not be

761
00:40:46,999 --> 00:40:52,069
considered on as an idea first on that's

762
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:54,019
not possible but still we can restore

763
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:59,119
that that was work being done that's

764
00:40:54,019 --> 00:41:01,729
something that's seems to be sound from

765
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,410
the ITF on view and we have this

766
00:41:01,729 --> 00:41:10,160
document this IC with none that's Dave

767
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,538
random I'm sorry for being lazy but can

768
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,868
you tell me off the top of the head what

769
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:19,190
the IP are disclosures on that say in

770
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:22,190
terms of Rights I would just like to

771
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:24,019
highlight the fact that Raymond has been

772
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,609
very clear on these aspects into the

773
00:41:24,019 --> 00:41:29,390
beginning so since the beginning we know

774
00:41:25,609 --> 00:41:32,569
that the IPR with bats so so basically

775
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:35,210
they're they're 3-3 inventions and for

776
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:37,099
one of the inventors this one can you

777
00:41:35,210 --> 00:41:40,640
tell me what the IPR disclosed you on

778
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:45,499
these what was the contents is it friend

779
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,219
is it Rand is it nothing if you can't

780
00:41:45,499 --> 00:41:47,779
answer off the top

781
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:55,579
I'll just go look it up myself I'm just

782
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:57,789
being lazy okay is one of them actually

783
00:41:55,579 --> 00:42:00,410
is the most important one is the is the

784
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:02,329
original invention of bats and that one

785
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:05,049
we have coverage in the US and some

786
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:07,400
European countries and also in China and

787
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:09,469
there's one which has sound that wasn't

788
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:12,619
my question I understand you have kept

789
00:42:09,469 --> 00:42:16,099
your coverage I'm asking what does the

790
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:17,340
disclosure to the ietf i RTF say about

791
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:21,110
what people's right

792
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:25,770
or when they use it for ITF and I RTF

793
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:28,650
work the what is the license or is it a

794
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:35,070
fair where I'm running around like like

795
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:36,750
that Colin Perkins I guess the important

796
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:40,890
question is has there been an IPR

797
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:46,230
disclosure made to the idea for this and

798
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:48,240
if so we can go look it up if there

799
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:50,550
hasn't been an IPR disclosure made then

800
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,439
you need to make an IPR disclosure sure

801
00:42:50,550 --> 00:43:01,920
and I'll just list it on the slides okay

802
00:42:52,440 --> 00:43:07,380
yeah thank you what there's no other

803
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,390
questions that's right next okay um so

804
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:12,840
okay so yeah that's what the question

805
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:15,690
was okay so sorry I think I think we can

806
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,700
people in in the room raised their hands

807
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,690
or actually no we're not supposed to ask

808
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,169
you to raise your hands because

809
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:25,080
supposedly we want this to be very that

810
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:26,760
is the hum thing I hate it actually I I

811
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,400
never understood it that's fine okay so

812
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,290
it would let's put it this way with

813
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,470
anybody in the room of check of this

814
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:40,550
becoming one of the research group

815
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:45,870
documents and if you do yes if you do

816
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:48,960
say it whatever if not we could actually

817
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:50,730
also send this to the list and ask if

818
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,680
anybody on the list objects to it

819
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:55,590
because I think this is again when I

820
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:59,430
said that we had as a research group

821
00:43:55,590 --> 00:44:01,260
goal to have a list of existing codes

822
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:03,000
out there so that people would know

823
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,890
because this is what all the time people

824
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,750
ask us you know what's what's a network

825
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:10,650
code second one is where are they and

826
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:13,890
who which ones can we use so if nobody

827
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:16,890
has a major objection I think that would

828
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,370
be a very good document to become the

829
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:26,310
research research document so if okay

830
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:27,870
Colin and Dave small point it's

831
00:44:26,310 --> 00:44:31,060
currently classified as informational

832
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:33,750
and that may not be appropriate

833
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:37,150
or something that actually defines bits

834
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:42,160
okay it may be better classified as

835
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:47,500
experimental good idea good I do yes

836
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,750
okay call it Colin hey Colin Perkins so

837
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,160
um I think they've probably makes a good

838
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,940
point so though I haven't read the draft

839
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:57,009
so who would have to defer to that other

840
00:44:54,940 --> 00:44:58,870
than that provided the appropriate ideas

841
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,450
a PR disclosures have been missed

842
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:03,339
absolutely yes other thing we can expect

843
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:04,870
we can accept this as a research group

844
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:07,540
documents unless the disclosures have

845
00:45:04,870 --> 00:45:09,100
been made yeah well I was I think I had

846
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,690
that in the back of my mind that you

847
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:16,120
know printing every legal t's and eyes

848
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:17,560
let's yes I'm sure you did I just wanted

849
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:21,580
to make it clear even though had some

850
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:23,259
discussion okay appreciate input okay so

851
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,920
we'll take it to the list and we'll say

852
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:29,890
that we'll ask the community but I would

853
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:32,650
say I don't see again like what Colin

854
00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:34,330
said once we've done all the make sure

855
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:36,970
that all the patent disclosures have

856
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:39,040
been made I see this is would be a very

857
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:42,029
good contribution to the group so thank

858
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:42,029
you very much thank you very much

859
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:57,420
[Music]

860
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:16,980
okay so next is

861
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:21,270
they sound without is is a chair hat yes

862
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,640
so this is a follow up on our effects

863
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:27,030
scheme for quick so just to remind you

864
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,040
we are considering in this group because

865
00:46:27,030 --> 00:46:32,490
it's more appropriate for the moments

866
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:36,270
some work on quick and adding possible

867
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:40,080
FEC schemes in quick it's absolutely

868
00:46:36,270 --> 00:46:41,970
impossible to push this work at ITF

869
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:43,740
quick walking group for the moment but

870
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:46,080
still it makes sense to have this

871
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:49,290
discussion and to do that kind of work

872
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:52,589
and also evaluate all of this inside

873
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:54,570
this research group so this is why we

874
00:46:52,589 --> 00:46:56,759
proposed this so we have two documents

875
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:59,510
one of them is coding for quick this is

876
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,369
the general framework how can we add

877
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:04,440
coding inside quick and there is also

878
00:47:02,369 --> 00:47:08,070
another good document which is this one

879
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,650
how to do that for RC cuts themselves so

880
00:47:08,070 --> 00:47:14,099
we in this document that we just updated

881
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:17,790
recently we explain how we can do that

882
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:23,910
in quick using our sequence so the

883
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:26,460
specific details this document is now in

884
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,080
line with the also document was not the

885
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:30,210
case until recently so that's the

886
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:32,060
motivation for doing these updates so it

887
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:35,869
is in line with the coding for quick

888
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:39,359
version I presented at previous site EF

889
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:43,290
just to remind you very briefly we want

890
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,020
to do cross packet frames protection so

891
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:48,450
it means that we consider packet and we

892
00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:50,040
protect the wolf stuff in the packet for

893
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,720
at least a few exceptions because

894
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,550
someone friends are maybe less important

895
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:55,529
but that's a little let's say that we

896
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,780
want to protect the packets as a war on

897
00:47:55,530 --> 00:48:00,869
the frames of the packet as opposed to

898
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:04,859
protecting one stream inside quick

899
00:48:00,869 --> 00:48:08,040
session the great benefit of doing that

900
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:10,920
is that we are a frame agnostic so we

901
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,630
can protect whatever type of frame is

902
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:17,130
defined in quick so that's the main

903
00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:19,109
advantage in this artifact scheme we

904
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:21,930
leverage of course on these

905
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:26,308
those two ifcs I already mentioned I've

906
00:48:21,930 --> 00:48:28,440
see 86 81 and 86 82 so that's great

907
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:31,589
because it makes the document quite

908
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,009
small and easy to read we only focus in

909
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:37,890
this document on the mapping and

910
00:48:34,009 --> 00:48:41,279
signaling aspects and whatever concerns

911
00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:44,430
the code itself is already defined as

912
00:48:41,279 --> 00:48:46,140
well so that's now very easy to do Alice

913
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:48,538
effect schemes that was also one of the

914
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:54,180
expected benefit of having this Priya

915
00:48:48,539 --> 00:48:57,930
work that's just one example of X Kim

916
00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:01,078
we may add and if that is coding inside

917
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:03,180
which we probably will add ourselves or

918
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:05,489
somebody else it's not matter we will

919
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:07,440
add additional internet draft specifying

920
00:49:05,489 --> 00:49:10,079
additional effects schemes for quick

921
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,849
when it makes sense they don't work in

922
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,579
the same way they don't have exactly the

923
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:17,579
same use cases and it would make sense

924
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:20,690
for instance to consider our C schemes

925
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:24,269
when you have real time constraints and

926
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:26,670
small windows and cunning windows let's

927
00:49:24,269 --> 00:49:29,218
say because it's a situation where those

928
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:31,799
codes are working very well and perhaps

929
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:34,979
when you have a very high bandwidth

930
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:38,609
delay product flow with a lot a lot of

931
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:41,759
packets take together maybe block codes

932
00:49:38,609 --> 00:49:44,609
are good approach for protecting them

933
00:49:41,759 --> 00:49:47,789
because there's less processing overhead

934
00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:49,828
perhaps so there is no clear boundaries

935
00:49:47,789 --> 00:49:52,650
this is something we had we need to

936
00:49:49,829 --> 00:49:54,930
experiment it really depends on the

937
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:58,049
exact conditions working conditions for

938
00:49:54,930 --> 00:50:00,479
each case but just want to say that

939
00:49:58,049 --> 00:50:04,349
there won't be a single solution most

940
00:50:00,479 --> 00:50:07,019
probably so I don't want to go too much

941
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:10,199
into details because I really introduced

942
00:50:07,019 --> 00:50:13,979
had previous ITF the some of those

943
00:50:10,199 --> 00:50:16,079
details so this slide is just to remind

944
00:50:13,979 --> 00:50:18,509
you that there is necessarily a mapping

945
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,849
and that's perhaps one of the key

946
00:50:18,509 --> 00:50:24,239
aspects inside this document is mapping

947
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:27,119
between F is between quick packets and

948
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:29,729
source symbols so source symbols is the

949
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,829
stuff the piece of data that will be

950
00:50:29,729 --> 00:50:33,419
managed data chance that will be managed

951
00:50:31,829 --> 00:50:35,730
inside the

952
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:40,230
officiant coder inside the FCC decoder

953
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:44,430
so that's essential but otherwise quick

954
00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:46,980
packets will be sent as as they were

955
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:49,440
with just one additional frame I will

956
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,569
just mention after after that so there

957
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,119
is a mapping where there is a mapping

958
00:50:51,569 --> 00:50:57,599
between tooth quick packets and so

959
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:00,690
symbols it's a bit complex so this

960
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:05,099
diagram explains more or less how it

961
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:07,140
works so we perhaps add some padding but

962
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:08,579
because of quick specificities we don't

963
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:12,328
add padding at the end but in the

964
00:51:08,579 --> 00:51:16,770
beginning just after the ADA we also cut

965
00:51:12,329 --> 00:51:19,140
them into fixed size source symbols so

966
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:21,660
the first symbols be a little bit

967
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,839
shorter because that means more overhead

968
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:26,670
and more will had some additional

969
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:29,190
information at the beginning of this

970
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:31,740
simile also ones will be a bit shot a

971
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:34,829
bit larger so they are not all exactly

972
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:38,910
the same size but either a minus 5 or a

973
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:41,730
minus 1 like bytes where he is a single

974
00:51:38,910 --> 00:51:43,140
size so unless there are questions I

975
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:46,250
don't want to go into these those

976
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:49,640
details I mentioned them last time

977
00:51:46,250 --> 00:51:52,410
otherwise so now we need to transmit

978
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:56,190
quick packets so quick packets will be

979
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:59,819
sent as they are with just one exception

980
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:02,579
wide one more frame in these induced

981
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:05,250
packets so this is the source fpi fact

982
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:07,829
payload information that's in that case

983
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:11,280
a very simple piece of information is

984
00:52:07,829 --> 00:52:15,089
just so simple identifier which is in

985
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:18,859
this version of the document we suggest

986
00:52:15,089 --> 00:52:21,180
to use a viable integer but we may

987
00:52:18,859 --> 00:52:25,109
decide something else it's not very

988
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:27,270
important so but I mean that each symbol

989
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:30,500
will be identified very precisely with

990
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:34,079
only light and with an identifier

991
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:37,339
otherwise quick packet or a repair

992
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:40,380
packets that have been produced by the

993
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:43,400
encoder will be transmitted we propose

994
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,950
to transmit them as another type of

995
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:49,559
frame that we call repair friends so

996
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:53,339
that can be one or more repairs involves

997
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:57,809
repair frames we can adapt depending on

998
00:52:53,339 --> 00:53:01,529
the maximum payload we can have well

999
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:05,069
depending on the path MTU and the symbol

1000
00:53:01,529 --> 00:53:08,400
size so we need to put more information

1001
00:53:05,069 --> 00:53:12,150
that case because we have to explain now

1002
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:14,220
this disorders or repair symbols have

1003
00:53:12,150 --> 00:53:16,289
been produced so we need to specify what

1004
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:19,078
was the and cunning window and this

1005
00:53:16,289 --> 00:53:21,720
encoder at that time so this is why we

1006
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:24,180
had not find first symbol in inside this

1007
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,848
and cunning window we also need to

1008
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,868
specify how many symbols were in this

1009
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:32,819
and cunning window we also need to

1010
00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:37,769
specify an additional parameter DT I

1011
00:53:32,819 --> 00:53:40,890
won't explain what it is and we also

1012
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:42,839
need to specify how many we pass symbol

1013
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:44,609
has been produced and put in this repair

1014
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:47,849
frame because it needs to be

1015
00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:50,400
self-sufficient by processing is either

1016
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:53,190
you need to identify exactly what is the

1017
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,380
size of this frame so that's the reason

1018
00:53:53,190 --> 00:53:59,700
for this number of replacing bells and

1019
00:53:55,380 --> 00:54:01,680
RS basically that's the format of this

1020
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,689
repair frame and of course after this

1021
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,490
either you will find all the Rita

1022
00:54:03,690 --> 00:54:09,440
symbols that can be one that can be more

1023
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:12,808
than one depends on the value for e and

1024
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:16,769
maximum payload size you can have in

1025
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:18,920
these in those quick packets so the

1026
00:54:16,769 --> 00:54:21,359
situation is the following we have

1027
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,359
reference implementation the reference

1028
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,299
implementation from Francoise mission

1029
00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:30,538
which is open source so we can download

1030
00:54:27,299 --> 00:54:32,670
it and test it there are few open

1031
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:35,690
questions but it's far from being

1032
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:41,490
finished of course some of them may also

1033
00:54:35,690 --> 00:54:44,180
mention price ITF I have two more open

1034
00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:48,529
questions that those are design things I

1035
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:52,078
don't think it's so so important to

1036
00:54:48,529 --> 00:54:54,869
detail them at the moment but we are

1037
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:57,180
making progress that's the good part so

1038
00:54:54,869 --> 00:55:00,269
it's not finished but we already have

1039
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:03,598
some something that's

1040
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:06,029
spirit that start to be a bit sound I

1041
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:08,669
would say we start to be confident in

1042
00:55:06,029 --> 00:55:12,749
what we are doing we have this working

1043
00:55:08,669 --> 00:55:15,808
implementation it's we can recover from

1044
00:55:12,749 --> 00:55:20,069
packet losses we can adapt to several

1045
00:55:15,809 --> 00:55:24,119
situations so we especially Francois but

1046
00:55:20,069 --> 00:55:25,769
also is our manual and people are

1047
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:29,999
working on this topic and we're making

1048
00:55:25,769 --> 00:55:32,519
progress well so making tests and so

1049
00:55:29,999 --> 00:55:34,589
there will be additional presentation

1050
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:39,118
performance results we can expect from

1051
00:55:34,589 --> 00:55:42,089
those from this evolution of potential

1052
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:44,159
evolution of quick in the future ITF

1053
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:45,839
meetings so while working not only are

1054
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:50,789
the specification but also on the

1055
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:52,589
research aspects so that's so I'm done I

1056
00:55:50,789 --> 00:55:56,339
don't know if there are questions or

1057
00:55:52,589 --> 00:56:09,919
comments from the womb or from Nick Nick

1058
00:55:56,339 --> 00:56:11,369
oh no everybody's happy so thank you yes

1059
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:25,828
thank you

1060
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:31,259
I can okay so the question from Caston

1061
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:33,929
is about the value for e so I think yes

1062
00:56:31,259 --> 00:56:36,509
I have an additional slide this is one

1063
00:56:33,929 --> 00:56:39,809
slide I mentioned last time so the e

1064
00:56:36,509 --> 00:56:41,729
value is the symbol size value so it's

1065
00:56:39,809 --> 00:56:44,849
something which is important because in

1066
00:56:41,729 --> 00:56:48,118
practice you may choose any value

1067
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:51,629
between few bytes and a few hundreds or

1068
00:56:48,119 --> 00:56:54,029
thousands of bites and depends that's

1069
00:56:51,629 --> 00:56:55,889
one of the key parameters and there is

1070
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:57,889
no single and so it really depends on

1071
00:56:55,889 --> 00:57:01,799
the use case the target shows case but

1072
00:56:57,889 --> 00:57:10,469
there are advantages in using small Y

1073
00:57:01,799 --> 00:57:13,620
values or single size values if you if

1074
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:16,260
you have largely variables symbol

1075
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:18,990
quick packet sizes having a small values

1076
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:24,680
will enable you to adjust very

1077
00:57:18,990 --> 00:57:27,169
efficiently to those variable sizes

1078
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:30,990
efficiently you won't be obliged to

1079
00:57:27,170 --> 00:57:34,410
produce very very large repair symbols

1080
00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:39,689
if all this incoming sauce packets are

1081
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:42,029
very small it would be sufficient but ok

1082
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:44,880
having a small value small Y value in

1083
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:47,280
that case is interesting is a good

1084
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:49,020
choice but at the end if you use

1085
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,140
something which is too small then you

1086
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:55,110
will end up with large number of source

1087
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:57,509
symbols with large linear systems which

1088
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:59,790
means that you will have more processing

1089
00:57:57,510 --> 00:58:03,210
overhead that the encoder decoder so

1090
00:57:59,790 --> 00:58:05,640
that is also well there is a balance to

1091
00:58:03,210 --> 00:58:07,980
find between all of them I don't have

1092
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:12,299
any magic value that's the parameter we

1093
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:15,270
need to test and find a good balance

1094
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:19,640
it will probably be use case dependent I

1095
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:24,360
don't know if what I do I don't have any

1096
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:29,009
answer but those are the things that we

1097
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:29,430
that will have to be considered you're

1098
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:41,910
welcome

1099
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:43,649
a manual question comments to read it

1100
00:58:41,910 --> 00:58:51,180
before asking question so what I

1101
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:57,360
understand here is you're from Toulouse

1102
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:59,669
III I thought I said sorry so you are

1103
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:02,310
piggybacking at the end of a packet the

1104
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:07,400
redundancy the repair information with

1105
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:12,330
he or you are using a specific signal

1106
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:16,620
signal packet yes so this value as well

1107
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:22,529
as some dish few more information need

1108
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:27,118
to be exchanged during the the beginning

1109
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:31,099
of the session negotiation phase yes

1110
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:36,109
let's say negotiation face it's not

1111
00:59:31,099 --> 00:59:39,480
anywhere in the whip frame either yeah

1112
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:41,700
it's something that is managed elsewhere

1113
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:43,349
in the the session during the nice

1114
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,509
initial negotiation

1115
00:59:43,349 --> 00:59:47,970
okay we need to keep loose the encode

1116
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:49,589
and decode synchronized and that's part

1117
00:59:47,970 --> 00:59:52,259
of the information that is required for

1118
00:59:49,589 --> 00:59:54,769
the English synchronization so you got

1119
00:59:52,259 --> 00:59:57,749
source source data packet and you get

1120
00:59:54,769 --> 01:00:00,839
source data packet right embeds a part

1121
00:59:57,749 --> 01:00:09,180
of Reaper packet or you a full repair

1122
01:00:00,839 --> 01:00:12,299
back now we have either original quick

1123
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:15,450
packets containing source data plus this

1124
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:18,480
FBI frame because we need to we need to

1125
01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:20,970
provide this additional information in

1126
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:22,950
order to keep both ends synchronized so

1127
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:25,740
that's one possibility but basically

1128
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:31,319
those quick packets are not modified

1129
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:35,399
accepted we had frame or we have repair

1130
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:38,099
packets and in that case those quick

1131
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:40,589
packets contain those repair fret okay

1132
01:00:38,099 --> 01:00:46,619
that can be one or more than one but I

1133
01:00:40,589 --> 01:00:48,869
guess that in one but all quick packet I

1134
01:00:46,619 --> 01:00:54,029
mean here are managed by the congestion

1135
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:56,249
control yes less it should so okay so

1136
01:00:54,029 --> 01:01:00,059
the the part of the repair packet is

1137
01:00:56,249 --> 01:01:01,549
counted inside the the way understand

1138
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:04,259
yes okay

1139
01:01:01,549 --> 01:01:07,380
Roswell will be able to run some more

1140
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:12,539
precisely but the way understanding you

1141
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:15,660
know I have to read the draft the other

1142
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:19,170
one well okay should answer this

1143
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:23,239
question okay I've got week I not this

1144
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:23,239
one okay

1145
01:01:26,630 --> 01:01:38,000
I have a two question do you plan to

1146
01:01:30,980 --> 01:01:42,980
write from Orange yeah do you plan to

1147
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,980
write an extension of quick to we and I

1148
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:49,790
want missions is to convince everybody

1149
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:53,840
that it's useful we are doing that

1150
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:57,710
inside this research group and then when

1151
01:01:53,840 --> 01:02:00,650
the v1 will be done and when it will be

1152
01:01:57,710 --> 01:02:04,100
time to to propose additional things to

1153
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:08,810
to go too quick and see what's what's

1154
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:13,220
feasible on this point also the same

1155
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:14,900
team in Inuvik they have a in

1156
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:19,450
architecture it is called pluggable

1157
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:22,520
quick to allow extending quick without

1158
01:02:19,450 --> 01:02:25,279
changing the basic protocols in the

1159
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:29,420
basic mechanisms and we feel that that

1160
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:32,960
could be a really good example or a use

1161
01:02:29,420 --> 01:02:35,450
case for the pluggable the pluggable

1162
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,010
quick so and they had a paper in sitcom

1163
01:02:35,450 --> 01:02:40,399
this year so this is actually could be

1164
01:02:37,010 --> 01:02:43,910
one way of doing this without again

1165
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:46,640
touching too much the the current

1166
01:02:43,910 --> 01:02:48,620
implementations when they get to v1 yeah

1167
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:50,779
and when I'm saying that also has a

1168
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:53,029
client web sauce implantation I'll refer

1169
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:56,390
to this specific implementation to this

1170
01:02:53,030 --> 01:03:01,630
pluggable quick implementation what is

1171
01:02:56,390 --> 01:03:04,069
specific why is this specific to quick

1172
01:03:01,630 --> 01:03:07,610
the signaling part is specific to

1173
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:09,950
quickie so signaling aspects mapping and

1174
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:12,110
signaling this is specific to I'm doing

1175
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:15,620
the different wave for fake frame for

1176
01:03:12,110 --> 01:03:20,090
instance because don't you use that for

1177
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:26,180
UDP it should be more general to speak

1178
01:03:20,090 --> 01:03:28,970
about fake quick quick is not exactly

1179
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:32,930
quick as not UDP just uses I know they

1180
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:36,529
you know Asian yeah but if you consider

1181
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:39,230
fake friend that's a way to learn to do

1182
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:40,420
a fishy encoding between RTP for

1183
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:44,140
instance and you

1184
01:03:40,420 --> 01:03:46,480
it's a standardized way for doing that

1185
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:51,450
exactly if you are making Chuck you can

1186
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:54,460
be chunk over UDP packet yeah there are

1187
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:56,739
potential use cases and at the end I see

1188
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:58,660
that cast on is waiting for things

1189
01:03:56,739 --> 01:04:02,049
asking question of doing a comments

1190
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:06,999
loops is also potentially one way to to

1191
01:04:02,049 --> 01:04:09,690
use recording so the the sketches we

1192
01:04:06,999 --> 01:04:13,480
have on our napkins cast Boorman

1193
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:15,400
actually look very similar to us but of

1194
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:18,339
course all the reference information the

1195
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:21,279
numbers that point back and forth they

1196
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:22,630
look different so we don't have a quick

1197
01:04:21,279 --> 01:04:26,920
packet to get somewhere we ever lose

1198
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:29,950
packet sequence that's the main benefit

1199
01:04:26,920 --> 01:04:31,539
of having a specification of the code

1200
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:35,230
specific fall of the codes

1201
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:38,920
dot where all those mathematical and

1202
01:04:35,230 --> 01:04:43,660
more complex aspects are specified and

1203
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:45,430
then you just design fake schemes so

1204
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:48,640
that explain what is additionally

1205
01:04:45,430 --> 01:04:51,999
required to use you do Scots in this

1206
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:54,788
context with those protocols and now of

1207
01:04:51,999 --> 01:04:57,519
course usually seven ways to do that not

1208
01:04:54,789 --> 01:05:00,130
a single fact scheme perfect code given

1209
01:04:57,519 --> 01:05:02,439
a target use case but we have this

1210
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:08,019
flexibility and that's a good way to

1211
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:10,869
proceed to to want to push and you see

1212
01:05:08,019 --> 01:05:13,479
cuts why it makes sense a manner

1213
01:05:10,869 --> 01:05:16,029
yes I'm an illusion again just to

1214
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:17,680
complete I think adding effect to quick

1215
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:20,410
is completely different from adding

1216
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,839
effect to stoner UDP so we cannot mix

1217
01:05:20,410 --> 01:05:24,700
both together and just a little bit of

1218
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:27,940
tied advertisement you can use the trees

1219
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:30,399
if you want to play UDP for instance but

1220
01:05:27,940 --> 01:05:32,859
I have another question about the packet

1221
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,589
format just the years

1222
01:05:32,859 --> 01:05:38,739
reaper sambar you got here is it

1223
01:05:35,589 --> 01:05:42,038
optional or if I don't use for instance

1224
01:05:38,739 --> 01:05:44,739
inside quick rather than see packet the

1225
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:47,019
a no repair frame there is no repair

1226
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:50,920
frame yes so this is a specific either

1227
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:53,140
to Reaper from yes the frame is not only

1228
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,590
the either that's the first part is the

1229
01:05:53,140 --> 01:05:56,259
one

1230
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:58,620
that I mentioned here is the yeah it's D

1231
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:01,210
either but you can see the in green this

1232
01:05:58,620 --> 01:06:03,880
Reaper symbol or we passing goals it

1233
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:07,120
depends and how many symbols you need to

1234
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:09,880
transmit so just an why just want to

1235
01:06:07,120 --> 01:06:15,880
know whether I based some payload if I'd

1236
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:18,880
not using repair symbol how you would my

1237
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:23,860
payload for instance if my heater I stay

1238
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:26,170
as longer as we sighs whether I use or

1239
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:29,530
not repair symbol this is not the same

1240
01:06:26,170 --> 01:06:32,020
either that's what I said for instance I

1241
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:34,030
get an either and we get optional fields

1242
01:06:32,020 --> 01:06:38,140
and if I don't use it they are still

1243
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:38,920
inside the either okay this is the case

1244
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,930
here or not

1245
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:46,510
no no if you don't have a symbol there

1246
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:49,899
will be no repairs change yeah yeah in

1247
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:54,880
turn change if you're not using FEC

1248
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:58,720
there will be no source FBI frame that's

1249
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:06,430
perfect and if the receiver should not

1250
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:10,149
happen but if if if ever the receiver

1251
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:13,149
does not understand FEC and you receive

1252
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:16,030
this type of frame that can ignore this

1253
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:19,450
frame very easily it's it's independent

1254
01:07:16,030 --> 01:07:24,660
from the rest okay dies no some

1255
01:07:19,450 --> 01:07:28,689
negotiation but I is it expected to work

1256
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:30,640
full duplex on half duplex it's possible

1257
01:07:28,690 --> 01:07:33,250
to do alpha duplex so I don't see any

1258
01:07:30,640 --> 01:07:37,390
good in no reason to prevent it probably

1259
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:39,070
working full duplex but and alpha duplex

1260
01:07:37,390 --> 01:07:42,060
for instance you just one puff yeah

1261
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:49,030
what's protected and not the other one

1262
01:07:42,060 --> 01:07:51,549
go fast because in again just to explain

1263
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:55,530
my initial question do you need to have

1264
01:07:51,550 --> 01:08:00,000
the session key to do that or not

1265
01:07:55,530 --> 01:08:02,980
session key all disciplines before

1266
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:07,290
encryption does it answer your question

1267
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:07,290
this happen before encryption yeah okay

1268
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:19,420
yeah this is this happens before

1269
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:19,420
encryption next

1270
01:08:30,549 --> 01:08:35,569
so we're the next presentation about

1271
01:08:33,559 --> 01:08:37,849
coding congestion control so today I

1272
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:40,759
think we're dressing things that we had

1273
01:08:37,849 --> 01:08:42,889
for a long time on our list and there

1274
01:08:40,759 --> 01:08:45,920
was no real contribution so we're very

1275
01:08:42,889 --> 01:08:47,868
happy about this contribution now as it

1276
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:50,239
is absolutely a question every time you

1277
01:08:47,868 --> 01:08:52,429
add coding anywhere the first question

1278
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:57,229
that people ask you is how does it

1279
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:59,569
interact with congestion control thank

1280
01:08:57,229 --> 01:09:02,149
you for the nice introduction we were

1281
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:04,699
lucky to have Francois Michel coming to

1282
01:09:02,149 --> 01:09:07,939
Toulouse to do some tests on satellites

1283
01:09:04,698 --> 01:09:09,919
and Francois they don't really like the

1284
01:09:07,939 --> 01:09:11,750
way in research you have people

1285
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:13,759
comparing coding mechanisms that ignore

1286
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:16,189
congestion with coding in Caen ISM that

1287
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:17,929
do congestion so basically it's always

1288
01:09:16,189 --> 01:09:20,419
an unfair comparison people do coding

1289
01:09:17,929 --> 01:09:22,520
and show oh look my coding mechanism is

1290
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:24,739
great sure you are just ignoring losses

1291
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:28,819
so because it was slightly pissed off

1292
01:09:24,738 --> 01:09:31,939
with that we decided to start a draft to

1293
01:09:28,819 --> 01:09:33,409
explain what we think on best current

1294
01:09:31,939 --> 01:09:35,299
practice even if it's not the place of

1295
01:09:33,408 --> 01:09:38,658
an RTF group to speak about this based

1296
01:09:35,299 --> 01:09:40,488
on practice but at least what we at

1297
01:09:38,658 --> 01:09:43,488
least err based on which we can discuss

1298
01:09:40,488 --> 01:09:47,388
and can we put must or not even if it's

1299
01:09:43,488 --> 01:09:50,629
a research group you know that so if we

1300
01:09:47,389 --> 01:09:52,460
look at the FCC 56 81 TCP is a loss

1301
01:09:50,630 --> 01:09:54,770
based congestion control we know that VB

1302
01:09:52,460 --> 01:09:58,550
are around that you know losses but

1303
01:09:54,770 --> 01:10:02,570
that's another topic encoding mechanisms

1304
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:04,880
could hide condition losses to the

1305
01:10:02,570 --> 01:10:09,469
sender for death congestion that the

1306
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,030
sender doesn't see and but however we

1307
01:10:09,469 --> 01:10:14,059
could use coding when we have tail

1308
01:10:11,030 --> 01:10:16,210
losses or when we are in a case where we

1309
01:10:14,059 --> 01:10:20,389
have lots of non condition losses that

1310
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:23,960
would be interested to ignore and that

1311
01:10:20,389 --> 01:10:25,760
when we repair these losses so that we

1312
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:28,190
try to provide some best current

1313
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:32,119
practice or some best practice without

1314
01:10:28,190 --> 01:10:35,329
the actual PCP on how coding and coding

1315
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:37,369
console could coexist so just a

1316
01:10:35,329 --> 01:10:41,150
disclaimer because we wrote that without

1317
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:43,308
the tooling in mind so just something we

1318
01:10:41,150 --> 01:10:43,849
wanted because we are worried on quick

1319
01:10:43,309 --> 01:10:45,530
ignoring

1320
01:10:43,850 --> 01:10:48,230
is you know a satellite use case so that

1321
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:49,670
was reapplied and twins what we started

1322
01:10:48,230 --> 01:10:51,650
like that maybe it can be applied to

1323
01:10:49,670 --> 01:10:55,600
tunnels but that's not the initial

1324
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:58,309
discussion what we propose is simple

1325
01:10:55,600 --> 01:11:00,740
because even between the others we

1326
01:10:58,310 --> 01:11:02,420
didn't agree with the tradition but you

1327
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:04,250
need to have a base solution and you may

1328
01:11:02,420 --> 01:11:06,710
need if you have a draft when you only

1329
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:08,780
say you may do that you may do that you

1330
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:10,310
just end up saying nothing so what if I

1331
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,320
did you need to say things so we said

1332
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:15,560
the receiver most indicates to the

1333
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,980
sender that one or multiple packets have

1334
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:21,800
been recovered using a scheme so then

1335
01:11:18,980 --> 01:11:23,959
how it does so depends on the condition

1336
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:25,370
control on mechanism that is using for

1337
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,890
them for you you could use this hand

1338
01:11:25,370 --> 01:11:31,030
signals if you are using TCP you could

1339
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:34,700
use a new type of signals such as

1340
01:11:31,030 --> 01:11:36,889
recovered frame in quick so that it

1341
01:11:34,700 --> 01:11:39,440
depends on how you were doing things but

1342
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:44,570
the receiver mass indicates because we

1343
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:46,790
think the didn't decision is at the

1344
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:48,349
sender because he knows more about the

1345
01:11:46,790 --> 01:11:51,560
situation in the network he knows more

1346
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:54,400
things and the client on me so so the

1347
01:11:51,560 --> 01:11:59,810
favour must be able to detect the signal

1348
01:11:54,400 --> 01:12:02,629
those are the base idea we do not

1349
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:06,220
describe how we must react but then we

1350
01:12:02,630 --> 01:12:10,880
can we just drive list of possibilities

1351
01:12:06,220 --> 01:12:14,600
because on the sender side when you do

1352
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,490
coding you could just ignore the

1353
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:18,800
condition window provision you could

1354
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:21,710
just decide that whatever I do I just

1355
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:24,020
add ten packets or whatever I do I just

1356
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:27,260
add a coding rate so every packet I

1357
01:12:24,020 --> 01:12:28,760
could do whatever I want I just ignore

1358
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,140
the condition window position that was

1359
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:33,580
something you could do that some things

1360
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:33,580
that some people in research papers do

1361
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:39,980
my Keveza nitpicking if I consider the

1362
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:43,130
previous slide again I was thinking

1363
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:44,839
about this statement of the receiver

1364
01:12:43,130 --> 01:12:46,070
must indicate to the sender that one or

1365
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:49,760
more multiple packets have been

1366
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:52,099
recovered so the point here is that the

1367
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:57,350
sender doesn't doesn't well learns about

1368
01:12:52,100 --> 01:13:02,210
loss right thoughts so that is one thing

1369
01:12:57,350 --> 01:13:05,240
which is okay to do Bob do you really

1370
01:13:02,210 --> 01:13:06,920
want to always convey all cases where

1371
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:09,380
you were able to recover what if you're

1372
01:13:06,920 --> 01:13:11,210
not able to recover something then you

1373
01:13:09,380 --> 01:13:13,520
know there's an unreliable data transfer

1374
01:13:11,210 --> 01:13:15,290
you don't need to retransmit it and you

1375
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,760
may not need to convey that yet you

1376
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:19,280
still want to inform the send about the

1377
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:20,690
packet loss but you still inform that

1378
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:23,980
the packet has been lost because you

1379
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:26,660
don't acknowledge them and when you just

1380
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:28,669
then if if it either unavailable

1381
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,470
transfer the favor knows about it it

1382
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:32,030
knows it's an unreliable transfer so it

1383
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:33,860
would just ignore that the packet has

1384
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:36,500
been lost and go on sending new packets

1385
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:38,179
that's that's more the more things are

1386
01:13:36,500 --> 01:13:41,060
at the offender because he knows what

1387
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:43,100
you're sure IIIi agree with that but I'm

1388
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:46,040
thinking that there there is a corner

1389
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:48,020
case here that may this may require a

1390
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:51,890
bit too much actually so there can be a

1391
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:54,560
case where I send ten packets and five

1392
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:57,470
of them are lost and two of them are

1393
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,970
recovered right then if it's an

1394
01:13:57,470 --> 01:14:00,710
unreliable data transfer where I don't

1395
01:13:58,970 --> 01:14:02,750
need to retransmit everything I care

1396
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:08,210
about knowing about the five but I may

1397
01:14:02,750 --> 01:14:11,720
not care about the tool okay that's all

1398
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:14,090
I'm saying okay I think it's true that

1399
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,590
but then it depends on how what signals

1400
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:17,120
you used to notify what has been lost or

1401
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:20,480
what hasn't been lost and then how you

1402
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,970
actually do it that because you could

1403
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,309
say you could sack and say okay these

1404
01:14:22,970 --> 01:14:27,830
paper packets have been recovered this

1405
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:30,050
one have been lost this one are on my

1406
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,580
side you could if you are if you're

1407
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:37,310
using a new type of framing quick you

1408
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:39,170
would actually do that that's for the

1409
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:44,500
noise you just basic statements on who

1410
01:14:39,170 --> 01:14:44,500
knows what and who indicates what to who

1411
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:53,630
just moment quicker and recovered

1412
01:14:49,570 --> 01:14:56,330
doesn't mean lost you might actually

1413
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:56,720
work on a recovered package because they

1414
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:59,360
lost

1415
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:02,020
figured the apparently lost packet has

1416
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:02,019
just been delayed

1417
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:07,690
at me you can have networks we are doing

1418
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:09,040
later - we are doing and you actually we

1419
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:10,570
cover a packet that your knowledge

1420
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:16,090
dressed white right after that's

1421
01:15:10,570 --> 01:15:17,980
something that indeed we have discussed

1422
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:20,160
with Emanuel recently and we were

1423
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:22,660
thinking that they've also an impact on

1424
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,519
the GA acknowledgements because we don't

1425
01:15:22,660 --> 01:15:27,250
act every packet you may have a delay

1426
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:30,400
that could cover this kind of effects I

1427
01:15:27,250 --> 01:15:32,650
think that's something we yes we need to

1428
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,790
have if we go further with the document

1429
01:15:32,650 --> 01:15:35,920
that's the end of the presentation do we

1430
01:15:33,790 --> 01:15:38,230
go further and we are happy to have more

1431
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,520
others and more people and just if we go

1432
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:44,290
for the DZ the kind of things we need to

1433
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:47,080
at least put warnings on high difference

1434
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:50,410
so this is fine but I think you're

1435
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:52,390
missing the inverse case which is you

1436
01:15:50,410 --> 01:15:56,460
aren't losing very many packets or even

1437
01:15:52,390 --> 01:16:00,070
any but you don't know how many extra

1438
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:02,410
coded packets you sent that the receiver

1439
01:16:00,070 --> 01:16:05,259
actually didn't need to recover the data

1440
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:07,900
packets and if you knew that you could

1441
01:16:05,260 --> 01:16:09,430
actually figure out whether the right

1442
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:11,290
thing to do is to increase your

1443
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:13,510
congestion window or reduce your coding

1444
01:16:11,290 --> 01:16:15,970
rate when you have adaptive coding rates

1445
01:16:13,510 --> 01:16:21,940
and so I've encouraged you to also look

1446
01:16:15,970 --> 01:16:24,880
at on the success the the the success

1447
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:26,950
cases where you've decoded Pat you've

1448
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:29,320
decoded something with with to repair

1449
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:30,970
packets right but you actually wound up

1450
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:34,509
receiving five repair packets because

1451
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:36,190
the sender was sending five so it gives

1452
01:16:34,510 --> 01:16:37,660
you an extra degree of freedom to play

1453
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:40,089
with whether you want to increase your

1454
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:45,370
congestion window or decrease your

1455
01:16:40,090 --> 01:16:48,190
coding rate yes you're right point taken

1456
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:51,220
I think we need to add some things about

1457
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:53,080
that document and thank you because I

1458
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:55,270
think it's useful if we want to go

1459
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:56,950
further with that to gather all these

1460
01:16:55,270 --> 01:17:00,130
issues if you want to go with us on the

1461
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:01,570
draft you're welcome just there are all

1462
01:17:00,130 --> 01:17:03,850
these kind of corner cases we need to

1463
01:17:01,570 --> 01:17:05,110
think if we want to have a good document

1464
01:17:03,850 --> 01:17:07,390
on the interactions between these two

1465
01:17:05,110 --> 01:17:09,070
things we need to have people that know

1466
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:11,040
a lot of of coding encryption control to

1467
01:17:09,070 --> 01:17:13,750
a tree come together because it's always

1468
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,980
at least we try to have some because

1469
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,650
what you mentioned now is great

1470
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:20,299
do how you actually consider Khan coding

1471
01:17:18,650 --> 01:17:23,839
within a conditioned window or not

1472
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:25,520
because you could just add symbol so

1473
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:27,440
they weren't just just a truth and

1474
01:17:25,520 --> 01:17:28,820
advertising thing you're only addressing

1475
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:31,610
window based congestion control schemes

1476
01:17:28,820 --> 01:17:33,469
so you wouldn't think this does not work

1477
01:17:31,610 --> 01:17:37,519
for this is not what you do for a rate

1478
01:17:33,470 --> 01:17:41,690
based scheme for example that it's the

1479
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:43,850
same if these BB are a bi is the rate

1480
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:44,839
based congestion control and we are in

1481
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:46,880
the cases where we have a congestion

1482
01:17:44,840 --> 01:17:47,650
control with oh it's Windows based or

1483
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:51,200
not

1484
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:53,570
that's so this is described in terms of

1485
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:57,559
a of a window based congestion control

1486
01:17:53,570 --> 01:18:00,320
scheme okay okay we try to attack to be

1487
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:01,700
the more general the possible and then

1488
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,349
their court their corner cases like

1489
01:18:01,700 --> 01:18:05,420
relentless which I'm not necessarily

1490
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:08,989
saying you need to describe relentless

1491
01:18:05,420 --> 01:18:11,989
but that wouldn't work this way if you

1492
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:13,639
did relentless you drew that we have

1493
01:18:11,989 --> 01:18:15,799
started to draft we squeaky shoes in

1494
01:18:13,640 --> 01:18:17,560
mind so that's maybe why maybe why we

1495
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:21,830
are

1496
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:26,989
Spencer Dawkins I I wanted to just thank

1497
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:30,350
you for starting this work and if I'm

1498
01:18:26,989 --> 01:18:33,290
understanding this correctly you're at -

1499
01:18:30,350 --> 01:18:35,000
zero zero of a base solution and you're

1500
01:18:33,290 --> 01:18:37,340
already getting an awful lot of interest

1501
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,320
I think that's a really good sign for a

1502
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:42,650
research group so thank you especially

1503
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:44,660
for bringing it I hope this all works

1504
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:47,389
out because I know that there are people

1505
01:18:44,660 --> 01:18:48,889
who need it thank you very much

1506
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:50,750
yeah and I would say we're all very very

1507
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:53,210
happy because we've been wanting to have

1508
01:18:50,750 --> 01:18:57,710
that work like almost since we started

1509
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:59,570
this group so it's really good stuff we

1510
01:18:57,710 --> 01:19:02,000
have lots of slides on which we can

1511
01:18:59,570 --> 01:19:03,769
disagree and that's also why we wanted

1512
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:05,180
to have statements very strong

1513
01:19:03,770 --> 01:19:06,410
statements from the beginning because

1514
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:08,030
you interest people if you have strong

1515
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:11,360
statements if you just say we may do

1516
01:19:08,030 --> 01:19:12,650
that we may do that nobody cares and to

1517
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:16,639
have a thing on who is interested and

1518
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:18,589
come with us on that document so on the

1519
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,730
Thunder side basically dispensations are

1520
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:26,870
in the document there are two things

1521
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:28,299
femicides coding solutions and then and

1522
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:30,489
then what do you do

1523
01:19:28,300 --> 01:19:33,460
because everything on the Thunder

1524
01:19:30,489 --> 01:19:35,138
whatever happens the I know that the

1525
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:36,520
clients then that might be issues

1526
01:19:35,139 --> 01:19:38,650
because we don't report the good things

1527
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:41,650
but at least when we cover a packet we

1528
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:43,598
report it and then what if the the first

1529
01:19:41,650 --> 01:19:45,670
part of the presentation if what with

1530
01:19:43,599 --> 01:19:48,059
how the Thunder ad coding and the second

1531
01:19:45,670 --> 01:19:51,699
part is what do you do when you receive

1532
01:19:48,059 --> 01:19:54,880
recovered packets information there are

1533
01:19:51,699 --> 01:19:57,969
two parts the first part is you could

1534
01:19:54,880 --> 01:20:02,380
just ignore the congestion window and do

1535
01:19:57,969 --> 01:20:03,760
ad according a repair window that could

1536
01:20:02,380 --> 01:20:06,010
be based on another congestion control

1537
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,920
you could use let bat for example to try

1538
01:20:06,010 --> 01:20:11,139
to have somehow lower than based if

1539
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:13,480
there are many collisions here just you

1540
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,860
could just have your constraint window

1541
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,659
and that we know that are the same and

1542
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:19,360
you just add packets you ignore

1543
01:20:16,659 --> 01:20:21,790
congestion the other solution is you

1544
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:23,710
have your congestion window and within

1545
01:20:21,790 --> 01:20:25,809
that you include you in packets and that

1546
01:20:23,710 --> 01:20:27,489
is when your point Dave is important it

1547
01:20:25,809 --> 01:20:29,980
with there are the link between the data

1548
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:32,468
rates ends actual data and timing so

1549
01:20:29,980 --> 01:20:34,419
that is where that - maybe they offer

1550
01:20:32,469 --> 01:20:42,429
the solution with one way of seeing the

1551
01:20:34,420 --> 01:20:44,980
things for the sender side reactions we

1552
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:46,300
could say when I receive a recovered

1553
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:48,159
packet I consider that as the lost

1554
01:20:46,300 --> 01:20:49,659
packet if I have the same type of

1555
01:20:48,159 --> 01:20:53,199
reaction that I do when I lose a packet

1556
01:20:49,659 --> 01:20:54,759
that's a solution but when you are

1557
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:56,888
considering anything like your lamp was

1558
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,909
saying when you have huge losses you

1559
01:20:56,889 --> 01:20:59,739
don't want to have this kind of behavior

1560
01:20:57,909 --> 01:21:01,929
because what the hell you need and

1561
01:20:59,739 --> 01:21:03,909
coding if you just behaving as if a

1562
01:21:01,929 --> 01:21:06,969
packet was lost you just maybe save some

1563
01:21:03,909 --> 01:21:10,540
entities but not really relevant another

1564
01:21:06,969 --> 01:21:12,909
solution is doing from how what what you

1565
01:21:10,540 --> 01:21:15,639
have in your I have seen eighty five

1566
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:17,379
eleven saying I just have my congestion

1567
01:21:15,639 --> 01:21:19,840
window and there's the loss and when

1568
01:21:17,380 --> 01:21:26,440
that's a Reaper packet I just diminish

1569
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:28,770
it but with a lower level that's because

1570
01:21:26,440 --> 01:21:29,610
that's because maybe

1571
01:21:28,770 --> 01:21:32,790
for the man who just have three

1572
01:21:29,610 --> 01:21:35,280
solution.i I just consider the packet is

1573
01:21:32,790 --> 01:21:38,370
lost I do the same thing that for love

1574
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:40,259
packets I do not sing that's what lots

1575
01:21:38,370 --> 01:21:41,970
of research papers do I ignore losses

1576
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:44,730
and go on increasing my career in window

1577
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:46,710
as if there is no loss and this is

1578
01:21:44,730 --> 01:21:48,509
somehow maybe a trade-off that would be

1579
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:51,240
interesting on I don't ignore all the

1580
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:53,360
losses but I still reduce in case there

1581
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:56,490
was actual collision you don't make it

1582
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,490
[Applause]

1583
01:21:59,540 --> 01:22:04,560
yeah I don't understand the intuition

1584
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:06,180
between reducing by less but just

1585
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:09,570
because we were able to recover I don't

1586
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:11,550
think it makes sense and I don't make

1587
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:13,049
for the record I also don't think it

1588
01:22:11,550 --> 01:22:14,790
makes sense to keep on increasing rate I

1589
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:16,740
think we agree on it but I don't think

1590
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:19,110
that there's a point to make a trade-off

1591
01:22:16,740 --> 01:22:20,610
between something stupid and something

1592
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:29,820
reasonable by saying something half

1593
01:22:20,610 --> 01:22:33,019
reasonable there's like well there has

1594
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:33,019
to be something in between because

1595
01:22:33,170 --> 01:22:43,680
speaking because this is basically why

1596
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:46,470
do you need we call coding if you have

1597
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:47,910
long if you just react as losses and why

1598
01:22:46,470 --> 01:22:50,580
do you just in the congestion if you do

1599
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:53,910
not if you just ignore it if you have a

1600
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:56,309
coding that recover every two percent of

1601
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:57,780
losses and if you have two percent of

1602
01:22:56,310 --> 01:23:00,330
packet ateb lost because of congestion

1603
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:01,800
you're just ignoring this congestion so

1604
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:03,930
there is something at least that we must

1605
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,820
discuss as a group on what when we speak

1606
01:23:03,930 --> 01:23:07,590
about I think that is where we have the

1607
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:09,509
discussion on interactions between

1608
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:11,930
coding and congestion control we see the

1609
01:23:09,510 --> 01:23:19,740
kind of things that we need to find some

1610
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:21,270
consensus I think so mr. Dawkins again I

1611
01:23:19,740 --> 01:23:27,900
just wanted to mention one other thing

1612
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:32,490
here so yeah the the the the thing the

1613
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:34,139
thing where we spent I don't know how

1614
01:23:32,490 --> 01:23:36,710
much time but you know maybe four or

1615
01:23:34,140 --> 01:23:40,650
five thousand RFC numbers amount of time

1616
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:42,300
trying to decide that EC and signals

1617
01:23:40,650 --> 01:23:44,610
weren't just

1618
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:46,860
the same yeah the same as loss and going

1619
01:23:44,610 --> 01:23:51,839
to be treated as loss and that we wanted

1620
01:23:46,860 --> 01:23:53,160
to do scalable congestion control the

1621
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:57,720
the you know the silver it's like now we

1622
01:23:53,160 --> 01:24:03,019
want to do easy act1 and getting that

1623
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:07,260
through the community and into into

1624
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:09,570
RFC's was a hugely big deal so I would

1625
01:24:07,260 --> 01:24:14,960
ask you you you might want to think

1626
01:24:09,570 --> 01:24:18,269
about kind of do you want to shoot for

1627
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:23,190
it's the same as loss which is the other

1628
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:24,990
ct0 view of the world or it is do I do I

1629
01:24:23,190 --> 01:24:27,660
just want to live in a nice et1

1630
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:29,639
world it you know where I can tell

1631
01:24:27,660 --> 01:24:31,830
people to speed up a little bit and slow

1632
01:24:29,640 --> 01:24:34,320
down a little bit and that might tell

1633
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:37,710
you things also about how much coding

1634
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:41,759
you're doing or not doing and I think

1635
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:43,680
that not to step on courses toes but

1636
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:47,640
that's something that would be extremely

1637
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:50,790
helpful for the many kinds of proposals

1638
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:52,620
that are like loops you know it's like

1639
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:55,170
you know we know something happened and

1640
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:56,309
we don't you know we want to do the

1641
01:24:55,170 --> 01:25:00,210
right thing and we don't know what that

1642
01:24:56,310 --> 01:25:02,700
is you know so with you know with fact

1643
01:25:00,210 --> 01:25:05,550
versus retransmission versus you know I

1644
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:09,630
don't know what you know so I think that

1645
01:25:05,550 --> 01:25:14,700
I think that I encourage you to include

1646
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:17,370
the scalable congestion control ideas in

1647
01:25:14,700 --> 01:25:22,220
your work when you get past zero zero

1648
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:25,500
and get past the base solution thank you

1649
01:25:22,220 --> 01:25:28,380
good point good point definitely in fact

1650
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:31,280
what we want to highlight here is there

1651
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:34,650
is an antagonism by using both

1652
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:37,349
congestion control and errors you're

1653
01:25:34,650 --> 01:25:38,940
coding at the transport level and it

1654
01:25:37,350 --> 01:25:41,670
will be the case for every kind of

1655
01:25:38,940 --> 01:25:44,190
protocol whatever it is TCP or quick we

1656
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:46,920
will get the exact exact case because

1657
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:48,929
you got one is going to grow up because

1658
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:53,220
there are more more laces if it's

1659
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:54,780
adaptive as set by your Dave or and you

1660
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,830
will get a congestion control but is

1661
01:25:54,780 --> 01:25:58,530
going to decrease

1662
01:25:55,830 --> 01:26:01,230
so there is a problem and you you won't

1663
01:25:58,530 --> 01:26:03,300
get a good result anyway so the fact is

1664
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:05,580
how we manage that is the network is

1665
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:07,530
going to manage the redundancy and to

1666
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:09,480
drop it if it's too much rodents inside

1667
01:26:07,530 --> 01:26:11,790
the network treat it as a best-effort

1668
01:26:09,480 --> 01:26:14,429
traffic using some scheduling mechanisms

1669
01:26:11,790 --> 01:26:16,470
that gives all I don't know how we are

1670
01:26:14,430 --> 01:26:18,780
going to manage both maybe it's not that

1671
01:26:16,470 --> 01:26:21,120
the TCP level or the transport level we

1672
01:26:18,780 --> 01:26:24,830
have to do that maybe it should be stick

1673
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,120
at the IP or low level link layer level

1674
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:29,490
this is all the questions we want to

1675
01:26:27,120 --> 01:26:33,960
point out here because we cannot we

1676
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:36,480
cannot manage it to plug transport level

1677
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:39,750
and consider on a congestion control and

1678
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:43,259
energy of cutting team easily and may I

1679
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:44,730
add something as I understand this the

1680
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,510
goal of this document is not to solve

1681
01:26:44,730 --> 01:26:48,799
all the problems

1682
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:51,990
the goal is to highlight that guys as

1683
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:55,620
Emanuel said an antagonism and that's

1684
01:26:51,990 --> 01:26:58,260
the bunch of proposals I won't say

1685
01:26:55,620 --> 01:27:01,230
solutions but proposals and we need to

1686
01:26:58,260 --> 01:27:04,880
discuss them the goal is to make it to

1687
01:27:01,230 --> 01:27:08,129
bring some some light in this domain

1688
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:11,040
that's the way I understand it because

1689
01:27:08,130 --> 01:27:15,120
we're talking about goals why do you

1690
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:17,130
want to do interesting control I think

1691
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:21,960
the obvious answers to protect the

1692
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:25,530
network but there's also always the

1693
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:29,520
question do you want to have TCP

1694
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:31,769
fairness I think you have to be very

1695
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,640
explicit about what your objective yes

1696
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:37,470
do you just want to protect the network

1697
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:39,780
ok so I'm not the type of guy that hide

1698
01:27:37,470 --> 01:27:42,300
my objectives my objective is to have

1699
01:27:39,780 --> 01:27:43,980
quick working on satellite links and I

1700
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:46,380
see that we have issues in our networks

1701
01:27:43,980 --> 01:27:48,330
where we have losses so I think maybe

1702
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:50,910
having people to sync together on

1703
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:53,610
whether we can include FEC in quick is

1704
01:27:50,910 --> 01:27:56,610
what happened and I know that when one

1705
01:27:53,610 --> 01:28:00,360
of the wall that we will have when for

1706
01:27:56,610 --> 01:28:01,920
quick v3 we will have FEC in quick there

1707
01:28:00,360 --> 01:28:03,960
will be but how do you manage

1708
01:28:01,920 --> 01:28:05,580
interactions between FEC and corrosion

1709
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:07,710
control we will have this discussion

1710
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:09,449
happen if we end up adding FEC in quick

1711
01:28:07,710 --> 01:28:12,840
that's my main that

1712
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:15,330
I said owners we are end-to-end networks

1713
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:18,660
with losses where we have to manage some

1714
01:28:15,330 --> 01:28:22,350
congestion and so I want with this

1715
01:28:18,660 --> 01:28:24,870
document to prepare at least by base on

1716
01:28:22,350 --> 01:28:28,350
which we may agree on advantages or

1717
01:28:24,870 --> 01:28:30,809
disadvantages when we will have the

1718
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:32,940
walls of deploying this kind of solution

1719
01:28:30,810 --> 01:28:34,890
for quick otherwise efficient quick will

1720
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:36,809
not happen we could be people lots of

1721
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:38,429
people don't like it and people would

1722
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:40,080
say how do you manage it country control

1723
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:42,239
is complicated and so on so if we end up

1724
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:45,269
with some simple solutions we may end up

1725
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:48,718
having that deployed yeah that's my my

1726
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:53,910
main objective third potential objective

1727
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:56,190
here getting by the isg but really I

1728
01:28:53,910 --> 01:29:01,230
think you have to say whether you want

1729
01:28:56,190 --> 01:29:02,699
to be fair a lot okay so we may want to

1730
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:04,889
put that in the document that because

1731
01:29:02,699 --> 01:29:06,809
this is this is something that we have

1732
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:09,210
added on the slides that it is not for

1733
01:29:06,810 --> 01:29:11,730
the tunnels we have to insist on the

1734
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:14,239
site that it is for end-to-end where we

1735
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:17,309
need to have some sort of TCP finish

1736
01:29:14,239 --> 01:29:19,110
even if there's a huge paper of bubbly

1737
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:21,600
school on TCP Finance same thing it's

1738
01:29:19,110 --> 01:29:23,009
useless but that's very nice paper if

1739
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:27,449
you are if you have time on your plane

1740
01:29:23,010 --> 01:29:30,150
like so this is an RG and one of the

1741
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:34,080
goals of an RG is to figure out what

1742
01:29:30,150 --> 01:29:36,989
research we need to do so I was looking

1743
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:40,590
at the document and it starts to talk

1744
01:29:36,989 --> 01:29:44,299
about what the possibilities are for how

1745
01:29:40,590 --> 01:29:47,010
we marry congestion control and encoding

1746
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:50,070
it would be really nice if we put some

1747
01:29:47,010 --> 01:29:52,679
thought in is how it's a guide reach to

1748
01:29:50,070 --> 01:29:54,750
say what well what things do we need to

1749
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:58,140
do research on in order to actually

1750
01:29:54,750 --> 01:29:59,280
decide what the right path is right as

1751
01:29:58,140 --> 01:30:01,230
opposed to just sort of said here's

1752
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:06,059
here's a couple of ideas you know have

1753
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:07,440
fun so so you know I'd encourage a lot

1754
01:30:06,060 --> 01:30:09,570
of people in the room who are interested

1755
01:30:07,440 --> 01:30:11,910
in either no coding or congestion

1756
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:14,580
control or both together to sort of help

1757
01:30:11,910 --> 01:30:16,050
give some guidance and and and and sort

1758
01:30:14,580 --> 01:30:17,730
of point people in the right direction

1759
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:22,090
because we could spend a lot of time

1760
01:30:17,730 --> 01:30:24,369
doing useless simulations and

1761
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:30,670
and research that doesn't actually

1762
01:30:24,369 --> 01:30:32,949
inform the final solution yes I think in

1763
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:35,710
sake of time this sketch he could be

1764
01:30:32,949 --> 01:30:39,190
going on forever in the sake of time we

1765
01:30:35,710 --> 01:30:40,480
would like to cut the line but I again

1766
01:30:39,190 --> 01:30:42,759
for those of you who've been involved

1767
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:45,968
with us for quite a long time congestion

1768
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:49,179
control and the interaction with coding

1769
01:30:45,969 --> 01:30:52,510
was one of the original research group

1770
01:30:49,179 --> 01:30:55,150
items that we had actually vents on I

1771
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:57,280
had actually defined a few years ago so

1772
01:30:55,150 --> 01:31:00,489
I would suggest that we bring it back

1773
01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:02,409
that we make it a major focus of this

1774
01:31:00,489 --> 01:31:06,129
research group because it needs research

1775
01:31:02,409 --> 01:31:09,009
obviously and then put it obviously on

1776
01:31:06,130 --> 01:31:11,349
the on the list for discussion at the

1777
01:31:09,010 --> 01:31:13,869
next meeting and actually uni really

1778
01:31:11,349 --> 01:31:18,489
goes sorting through this I think it is

1779
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:20,650
one of the major research I would say

1780
01:31:18,489 --> 01:31:23,369
into the protocols I think at the

1781
01:31:20,650 --> 01:31:25,989
beginning we're doing a lot of coding as

1782
01:31:23,369 --> 01:31:27,639
codes I think now we're at the point

1783
01:31:25,989 --> 01:31:29,619
where we need to start looking at the

1784
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:32,559
implications of coding and protocols and

1785
01:31:29,619 --> 01:31:34,420
this is a perfect ID for it and if

1786
01:31:32,559 --> 01:31:37,210
everybody agrees we will bring back the

1787
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:39,460
work the research group work item and

1788
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:41,949
and actually make progress on this and

1789
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:49,539
if somebody disagrees please come to the

1790
01:31:41,949 --> 01:31:51,190
microphone and nobody disagrees so the

1791
01:31:49,539 --> 01:31:53,920
code do you have more slides

1792
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:59,619
we already did agreed a lot so I think

1793
01:31:53,920 --> 01:32:01,780
we shouldn't keep that one okay very

1794
01:31:59,619 --> 01:32:04,630
important presentation so I think we'll

1795
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:06,340
we'll we'll close it now and thank you

1796
01:32:04,630 --> 01:32:08,650
very much for raising this and again

1797
01:32:06,340 --> 01:32:10,119
that's here and then you'll also because

1798
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:11,888
this is again for people who've been

1799
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:15,239
around this is something that we always

1800
01:32:11,889 --> 01:32:19,559
wanted to do so thank you very much I

1801
01:32:15,239 --> 01:32:19,558
know we confirm on the list of course

1802
01:32:35,940 --> 01:32:47,049
okay so this presentation is about one

1803
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:49,360
common problem that we found to deal in

1804
01:32:47,050 --> 01:32:51,670
this group which is we have our coding

1805
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:54,460
system so code about the color of the

1806
01:32:51,670 --> 01:32:57,520
codec path and it's need to exchange not

1807
01:32:54,460 --> 01:32:59,860
only samples coded encoded decoded but

1808
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:05,110
also its need to exchange sometimes some

1809
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:07,360
states and then the question is what

1810
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:18,730
information do you need and what do you

1811
01:33:07,360 --> 01:33:23,009
need to do so it's a kind of thank you

1812
01:33:18,730 --> 01:33:28,570
it's a kind of follow-up of a discussion

1813
01:33:23,010 --> 01:33:31,240
by mention on the fake generate fake API

1814
01:33:28,570 --> 01:33:35,490
codec that has been presented and that

1815
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:38,230
is ongoing and my presentation here is

1816
01:33:35,490 --> 01:33:40,870
more about how can it be excellent watch

1817
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:43,540
is needed and it's just to start the

1818
01:33:40,870 --> 01:33:46,300
discussion there's no definite answer of

1819
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:48,340
course now and it's linked also to the

1820
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:50,230
general problem but of course in many

1821
01:33:48,340 --> 01:33:52,600
protocol unitary challenge States and

1822
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:55,360
some of it is related to your coding

1823
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:59,520
state and this should be reflected back

1824
01:33:55,360 --> 01:34:01,089
into that so I will take the example of

1825
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:02,860
implementation open source

1826
01:34:01,090 --> 01:34:05,800
implementation that we took which was

1827
01:34:02,860 --> 01:34:09,099
many vicodin which is a switch because I

1828
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:11,680
can't walk that way you have on the left

1829
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:16,720
side verse under on the right side which

1830
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:19,120
if a node it's a systemic code so it's

1831
01:34:16,720 --> 01:34:21,850
awesome bellossom directly and then the

1832
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:25,390
IP I divided the application with

1833
01:34:21,850 --> 01:34:27,700
encoder and the application feed was

1834
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:29,680
watsonville to encoder and from time to

1835
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:31,830
time it will ask for a Rita packet and

1836
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:36,520
oh it does that is by specifying which

1837
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:37,750
source ID it wants in the linear

1838
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:39,910
combination also

1839
01:34:37,750 --> 01:34:45,010
implicitly whatever coefficient that it

1840
01:34:39,910 --> 01:34:48,010
wants so these are then the application

1841
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:50,500
asked for repair it is then obtained son

1842
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:52,870
of our guai and various fell note does

1843
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:55,239
the symmetric things which is filled all

1844
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:57,610
the received packet inside the decoder

1845
01:34:55,239 --> 01:35:00,820
and then when it's a repair packet

1846
01:34:57,610 --> 01:35:04,150
specify exactly which of source ID and

1847
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:06,429
which have coefficient value which is

1848
01:35:04,150 --> 01:35:09,519
amplitude but can't be explicit and then

1849
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:14,489
we recovered sauce sambal a thumbtack so

1850
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:17,410
as you can see this this is the most of

1851
01:35:14,489 --> 01:35:19,360
grunge genetics I copy you can do a lot

1852
01:35:17,410 --> 01:35:23,380
of things with it but there is a

1853
01:35:19,360 --> 01:35:26,530
question of you don't see a lot of state

1854
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:29,260
exchange so here is a question of okay

1855
01:35:26,530 --> 01:35:30,670
if you want to do more general protocol

1856
01:35:29,260 --> 01:35:32,380
like if you had feedback we have

1857
01:35:30,670 --> 01:35:34,510
description logic back or if you want to

1858
01:35:32,380 --> 01:35:36,910
do information centric networking or on

1859
01:35:34,510 --> 01:35:39,610
them lineal cutting a rainy sea and

1860
01:35:36,910 --> 01:35:41,980
doing the recording part or even if you

1861
01:35:39,610 --> 01:35:44,949
want to do some multicast transport so

1862
01:35:41,980 --> 01:35:47,860
there was a discussion this week from

1863
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:49,870
Stinson multicast the in the LP one

1864
01:35:47,860 --> 01:35:54,489
group where they want to do potentially

1865
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:56,530
a new kind of fake resident basis but a

1866
01:35:54,489 --> 01:36:00,759
very very short packet those on the

1867
01:35:56,530 --> 01:36:03,969
bytes and if you want to do that can you

1868
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:05,590
do that with the current API and the

1869
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:07,090
thing is that if you look at you on

1870
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:10,719
protocol implementation they don't

1871
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:13,930
always do have a codec abstraction so if

1872
01:36:10,719 --> 01:36:16,000
you make a codec abstraction and want to

1873
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:20,080
look at alpha motion through it will be

1874
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,840
a little bit like on this diagram so the

1875
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:25,960
receiver States has to go from the codec

1876
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:27,910
to application and then it has to be

1877
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:30,219
sound of other way if you have some kind

1878
01:36:27,910 --> 01:36:32,860
of feedback it can be a summary of a

1879
01:36:30,219 --> 01:36:35,410
local state of the local state of a

1880
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:39,280
codec so it could be ever want a state

1881
01:36:35,410 --> 01:36:42,070
or it would be a summary and then the

1882
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:46,660
sound annoyed will typically also get

1883
01:36:42,070 --> 01:36:47,469
rocker state of encoder and using both

1884
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:49,809
affirmations

1885
01:36:47,469 --> 01:36:50,639
it will generate a coded summer so I

1886
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,929
think okay

1887
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:53,939
there's not much affirmation you know

1888
01:36:51,929 --> 01:36:57,059
but it's just described formation flow

1889
01:36:53,939 --> 01:37:00,840
and everything is the detail of all you

1890
01:36:57,059 --> 01:37:04,860
do step one two three four and if you

1891
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:08,159
ask the question okay Oh does it work

1892
01:37:04,860 --> 01:37:11,070
when you do some completely complicated

1893
01:37:08,159 --> 01:37:13,438
case so I think we are to case but are

1894
01:37:11,070 --> 01:37:16,619
not so straightforward so to say which

1895
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:19,919
is information centric networking and

1896
01:37:16,619 --> 01:37:22,919
from Dominica Dean so like in a new

1897
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:28,159
protocol in this case what you do at one

1898
01:37:22,919 --> 01:37:32,130
color is to select the indices of your

1899
01:37:28,159 --> 01:37:36,329
sample that you will generate but you

1900
01:37:32,130 --> 01:37:38,369
need also as in many of our protocol you

1901
01:37:36,329 --> 01:37:39,959
need to know what European needs which

1902
01:37:38,369 --> 01:37:45,719
is the decoding state by to receive but

1903
01:37:39,959 --> 01:37:48,059
the subtlety is error is it's not if you

1904
01:37:45,719 --> 01:37:50,939
do recording you don't have access to

1905
01:37:48,059 --> 01:37:54,449
all the saw some more so you need to

1906
01:37:50,939 --> 01:37:56,309
have formation about which sample you

1907
01:37:54,449 --> 01:37:58,199
could generate and then you need to

1908
01:37:56,309 --> 01:38:00,749
match both what you need and what you

1909
01:37:58,199 --> 01:38:03,449
can generate and this is not

1910
01:38:00,749 --> 01:38:06,599
straightforward because you can end up

1911
01:38:03,449 --> 01:38:11,928
having to solve and ex coding prime if

1912
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:15,179
you didn't think well all week I'd so

1913
01:38:11,929 --> 01:38:23,249
there is a kind of research and design

1914
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:25,619
issue here now we I don't have as I

1915
01:38:23,249 --> 01:38:28,820
don't have precise solution to external

1916
01:38:25,619 --> 01:38:30,808
API on this subject but if we look at

1917
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:33,030
what we will do in the current

1918
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:37,169
implementation so of course local state

1919
01:38:33,030 --> 01:38:39,389
as we do in our coding can be

1920
01:38:37,169 --> 01:38:41,669
represented as in matrix so we could

1921
01:38:39,389 --> 01:38:44,039
imagine two paths to you can imagine to

1922
01:38:41,669 --> 01:38:46,409
pass the matrix back to the application

1923
01:38:44,039 --> 01:38:49,409
but it's of course it's large its

1924
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:51,780
growers it's not nice because when

1925
01:38:49,409 --> 01:38:55,589
typically we will have to do algebra in

1926
01:38:51,780 --> 01:38:58,018
the application of protocol part maybe

1927
01:38:55,590 --> 01:38:59,550
even eight representation for instance

1928
01:38:58,019 --> 01:39:04,950
if you do kind of

1929
01:38:59,550 --> 01:39:06,510
DPC pealing decoder and ready to and

1930
01:39:04,950 --> 01:39:08,940
sunder maybe a Tanner graph

1931
01:39:06,510 --> 01:39:11,430
representation I don't know so there is

1932
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:15,719
this open question for the API for the

1933
01:39:11,430 --> 01:39:18,630
local state and for remote state summary

1934
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:21,180
so era okay there are several things so

1935
01:39:18,630 --> 01:39:24,630
first of all you you could generate

1936
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:26,580
lease on your state so maybe even with

1937
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:29,820
the previous magics all you could

1938
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:32,340
request directly what you want so if use

1939
01:39:29,820 --> 01:39:34,769
on your state of course the other side

1940
01:39:32,340 --> 01:39:37,110
we know what you need then you could

1941
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:40,800
also implicitly state what you have by

1942
01:39:37,110 --> 01:39:43,380
doing a acknowledgement then if suppose

1943
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:46,230
know what receiver as lost and what it

1944
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:48,450
has received he can deduce at least a

1945
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:54,889
passionate kiss pessimistic bound of

1946
01:39:48,450 --> 01:39:58,139
what with the receivers and then if you

1947
01:39:54,890 --> 01:40:00,060
want an explicit summary so you can send

1948
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:02,550
the matrix or you can do some kind of

1949
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:06,420
compression of information your own

1950
01:40:02,550 --> 01:40:10,290
matrix for instance up to where you have

1951
01:40:06,420 --> 01:40:12,830
decoded or you can also specify for

1952
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:17,880
instance on the sandbar ID level which

1953
01:40:12,830 --> 01:40:19,410
which ID you want you don't want you are

1954
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:22,260
interested in unity or on which which

1955
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:24,330
are or you can send something created

1956
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:28,950
with you so here are various also for

1957
01:40:24,330 --> 01:40:32,220
the IP I the question of which is a what

1958
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:36,059
is a good representation of a remote

1959
01:40:32,220 --> 01:40:41,460
state and then we can look quickly at

1960
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:44,940
some existing protocol which is more on

1961
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:47,370
the remote state level so for instance

1962
01:40:44,940 --> 01:40:49,580
for net code coding sources yen and yen

1963
01:40:47,370 --> 01:40:55,140
draft they have much the emotion of

1964
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:57,840
feedback int and also how to transmit us

1965
01:40:55,140 --> 01:40:59,700
information in Dragon cast and

1966
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,200
Dragonette the information that you use

1967
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:04,380
on protocol level is the last sample

1968
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:08,400
decoded and then wrong and highest

1969
01:41:04,380 --> 01:41:12,239
symbology so it's the fake IPS is almost

1970
01:41:08,400 --> 01:41:15,420
fair for today's I think

1971
01:41:12,239 --> 01:41:20,968
before can confirm it's something which

1972
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:24,330
is equivalent to the PI vote of the

1973
01:41:20,969 --> 01:41:25,310
mattress and there are many of our

1974
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:30,180
possibility

1975
01:41:25,310 --> 01:41:34,500
so anyway so a lot of open issue as you

1976
01:41:30,180 --> 01:41:36,600
see we as author you we plan to do the

1977
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:41,130
following start from particle case try

1978
01:41:36,600 --> 01:41:43,050
to fit in API and then try to do some

1979
01:41:41,130 --> 01:41:46,140
suggestion and we'll start with

1980
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:48,270
implementation of dragnet and then there

1981
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:50,340
is the question of other more general

1982
01:41:48,270 --> 01:41:53,040
case of state actions that can be

1983
01:41:50,340 --> 01:41:55,830
factored between different protocol and

1984
01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:58,100
that should be reflected in the API and

1985
01:41:55,830 --> 01:42:00,989
of course we welcome advice comment

1986
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:05,850
contribution discussion over here or

1987
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:10,349
orange mailing list thank you any

1988
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:12,780
questions okay

1989
01:42:10,350 --> 01:42:15,500
well thank you so very much Jessica not

1990
01:42:12,780 --> 01:42:15,500
way yes

1991
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:21,750
good point we we need to see what code

1992
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:24,180
should be done in terms of API to

1993
01:42:21,750 --> 01:42:29,510
reflect this into some of the protocols

1994
01:42:24,180 --> 01:42:33,420
using those because may have you know

1995
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:37,160
but let's keep it simple and I would say

1996
01:42:33,420 --> 01:42:41,640
today but we have to talk about it more

1997
01:42:37,160 --> 01:42:45,570
let's do things more specific let's

1998
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:53,880
leave them he has implementation

1999
01:42:45,570 --> 01:42:56,670
specific features is this generic get

2000
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:59,250
fake parameters that does not require

2001
01:42:56,670 --> 01:43:01,800
you to specify exactly how to do that

2002
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:04,380
that can be used in an implantation

2003
01:43:01,800 --> 01:43:07,790
specific way so we will talk about it

2004
01:43:04,380 --> 01:43:11,640
but it's good to point this requirement

2005
01:43:07,790 --> 01:43:15,150
okay thank you so I suggest we skip the

2006
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:18,000
last it done from module and now we have

2007
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:20,580
a so now we have more time for you

2008
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,239
Kirsten and this is actually the view

2009
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:26,340
from the IETF I think at the IRT F

2010
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:29,280
opened we talked a lot about

2011
01:43:26,340 --> 01:43:32,520
collaborations between the ietf and the

2012
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:36,540
IRT F and how to you know move things

2013
01:43:32,520 --> 01:43:39,389
from one place or another or how to use

2014
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:41,219
technology or the research that was used

2015
01:43:39,389 --> 01:43:42,989
that was developed here and the

2016
01:43:41,219 --> 01:43:44,639
technology that was developed in the ITF

2017
01:43:42,989 --> 01:43:46,949
and make sure that they they match

2018
01:43:44,639 --> 01:44:00,449
better together so thank you Carson for

2019
01:43:46,949 --> 01:44:02,460
doing this okay thank you yeah I want to

2020
01:44:00,449 --> 01:44:06,440
give a quick introduction into what

2021
01:44:02,460 --> 01:44:10,349
oopss who has been at previous loops

2022
01:44:06,440 --> 01:44:13,650
site meeting about half of the people

2023
01:44:10,349 --> 01:44:16,409
here in this room okay so I will have to

2024
01:44:13,650 --> 01:44:19,019
speed up considerably and you may need

2025
01:44:16,409 --> 01:44:22,619
to stop me if you are missing some

2026
01:44:19,020 --> 01:44:24,210
context yeah so we're in the net

2027
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:27,540
recording research group so I think we

2028
01:44:24,210 --> 01:44:30,210
all agree that packet loss is something

2029
01:44:27,540 --> 01:44:34,400
we want to avoid in particular tailors

2030
01:44:30,210 --> 01:44:36,900
and loops has a completely different

2031
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:39,480
approach from the things that you have

2032
01:44:36,900 --> 01:44:42,598
seen here so far we want to do something

2033
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:44,699
in the network so the hosts are

2034
01:44:42,599 --> 01:44:48,179
completely oblivious to what's going on

2035
01:44:44,699 --> 01:44:50,519
the hosts are sending probably encrypted

2036
01:44:48,179 --> 01:44:52,230
stuff that we don't understand now we

2037
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,690
have no idea what transfer protocol is

2038
01:44:52,230 --> 01:44:58,500
they are speaking all we are seeing is

2039
01:44:54,690 --> 01:45:01,799
IP packets and we want to be able to

2040
01:44:58,500 --> 01:45:08,849
recover IP packets that get lost within

2041
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:11,639
one segment of the path and well this

2042
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:14,940
can be done locally doing things locally

2043
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:20,159
always is good because we can do this

2044
01:45:14,940 --> 01:45:22,320
fast with low latency and we also don't

2045
01:45:20,159 --> 01:45:26,790
have to send recovery packets end to end

2046
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:28,500
and spend the beds everywhere we can do

2047
01:45:26,790 --> 01:45:33,750
this in the network so we don't have to

2048
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:36,869
upgrade hosts to do this and yeah the

2049
01:45:33,750 --> 01:45:38,099
new thing here is the assumption is we

2050
01:45:36,869 --> 01:45:39,849
are not going to rotate through the

2051
01:45:38,099 --> 01:45:41,820
packets we are not going to touch

2052
01:45:39,850 --> 01:45:45,040
the packets and of course traditionally

2053
01:45:41,820 --> 01:45:48,849
performance-enhancing proxies have done

2054
01:45:45,040 --> 01:45:51,370
all of this very much so there will be

2055
01:45:48,850 --> 01:45:53,740
two ways of doing recovery one is of

2056
01:45:51,370 --> 01:45:56,559
course the traditional retransmission

2057
01:45:53,740 --> 01:46:01,269
and the other one is forward error

2058
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:04,180
correction and what the protocol then

2059
01:46:01,270 --> 01:46:06,370
essentially does is encapsulate the

2060
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:11,280
forward error correction but it also

2061
01:46:06,370 --> 01:46:15,580
sends big information to the coding side

2062
01:46:11,280 --> 01:46:21,099
to possibly dynamically adjust the

2063
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:23,230
parameters one approach here is that

2064
01:46:21,100 --> 01:46:25,360
given this is that this is in the

2065
01:46:23,230 --> 01:46:28,389
network we assume there is some

2066
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:31,059
management so we are not going to define

2067
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:35,050
that part of the protocol that does set

2068
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:37,330
up for these path segments we have a

2069
01:46:35,050 --> 01:46:39,040
controller model here maybe there will

2070
01:46:37,330 --> 01:46:41,620
be a yang module at some point that

2071
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:45,280
contains all this but this is kind of

2072
01:46:41,620 --> 01:46:48,670
out of scope yeah I think we have talked

2073
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:52,500
about congestion control and given that

2074
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:54,520
we are a tunnel we have to export

2075
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:57,610
congestion control information out of

2076
01:46:54,520 --> 01:47:02,680
the tunnel of course preferably with ecn

2077
01:46:57,610 --> 01:47:06,070
and possibly with silane if dropping now

2078
01:47:02,680 --> 01:47:07,630
this is of course confusing we're trying

2079
01:47:06,070 --> 01:47:10,120
to recover packets and then we are

2080
01:47:07,630 --> 01:47:13,630
dropping some of course this means we're

2081
01:47:10,120 --> 01:47:16,809
just recovering a few packets less then

2082
01:47:13,630 --> 01:47:19,840
we could and the assumption is if there

2083
01:47:16,810 --> 01:47:23,920
are modes of doing this where we are the

2084
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:28,410
recovery still is a net win but that's

2085
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:32,860
not what I want to talk about today but

2086
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:35,099
really loops is a protocol that feels a

2087
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:37,719
lot like a transfer protocol but isn't

2088
01:47:35,100 --> 01:47:40,360
first of all it's completely separate

2089
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:43,120
from the entrant transfer protocol we

2090
01:47:40,360 --> 01:47:45,580
are not meddling with that but of course

2091
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:50,230
we are providing information we are

2092
01:47:45,580 --> 01:47:52,539
sending congestion feedback so the ideas

2093
01:47:50,230 --> 01:47:55,659
that loops itself is not

2094
01:47:52,539 --> 01:47:58,869
controlling the sending rage maybe it's

2095
01:47:55,659 --> 01:48:00,879
doing some pacing but the sending rate

2096
01:47:58,869 --> 01:48:05,380
really is under control of the

2097
01:48:00,880 --> 01:48:09,190
end-to-end transfer protocols and the

2098
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:14,440
other thing is residual losses okay this

2099
01:48:09,190 --> 01:48:17,199
is an unreliable protocol and yeah we we

2100
01:48:14,440 --> 01:48:19,960
also can maybe get more information

2101
01:48:17,199 --> 01:48:22,058
extracted from the path segment that

2102
01:48:19,960 --> 01:48:24,340
your traditional transfer protocol could

2103
01:48:22,059 --> 01:48:28,360
because the tunnel is carrying

2104
01:48:24,340 --> 01:48:30,780
aggregated traffic so a lot of the the

2105
01:48:28,360 --> 01:48:34,320
intuitions we have for transport

2106
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:37,690
protocols really need to be re-examined

2107
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:39,610
they may not be entirely true we have a

2108
01:48:37,690 --> 01:48:42,119
controlled environment we have a set up

2109
01:48:39,610 --> 01:48:47,289
mechanism we don't have full reliability

2110
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:49,839
we can do things like set the maximum

2111
01:48:47,289 --> 01:48:51,070
overhead volume from the outset we're

2112
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:53,230
never going to send more than 10%

2113
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:55,690
overhead and everything the protocol

2114
01:48:53,230 --> 01:49:00,299
does stays within these 10% and that of

2115
01:48:55,690 --> 01:49:02,710
course has some interesting effects on

2116
01:49:00,300 --> 01:49:04,989
how you look at congestion control

2117
01:49:02,710 --> 01:49:08,679
because you you cannot really blow up

2118
01:49:04,989 --> 01:49:10,750
the network with those 10% so you might

2119
01:49:08,679 --> 01:49:13,989
have a slightly different view at this

2120
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:18,280
and finally since this is a tunnel we

2121
01:49:13,989 --> 01:49:21,759
have multiple flows in there and we

2122
01:49:18,280 --> 01:49:24,250
usually have a lot of packets in flight

2123
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:26,849
at any particular point in time so we

2124
01:49:24,250 --> 01:49:29,559
might have much better measurement

2125
01:49:26,849 --> 01:49:33,059
opportunities then a traditional

2126
01:49:29,559 --> 01:49:35,199
transfer protocol there are a few

2127
01:49:33,059 --> 01:49:38,760
strongly documents out there there is a

2128
01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:46,690
use case and problem statement a

2129
01:49:38,760 --> 01:49:49,710
document by jove and gesture right there

2130
01:49:46,690 --> 01:49:52,000
is a generic information search by by

2131
01:49:49,710 --> 01:49:56,590
unlikely and me and this is pretty much

2132
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:59,019
the the protocol but not yet bound to

2133
01:49:56,590 --> 01:50:01,179
specific bits in a packet because you

2134
01:49:59,019 --> 01:50:02,199
want to do this specific to

2135
01:50:01,179 --> 01:50:05,260
encapsulations

2136
01:50:02,199 --> 01:50:05,860
because different network environments

2137
01:50:05,260 --> 01:50:07,900
have differ

2138
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:11,170
and encapsulation preferred

2139
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:13,719
encapsulations so this is the generic

2140
01:50:11,170 --> 01:50:17,080
information said and this is then bound

2141
01:50:13,719 --> 01:50:22,360
to a specific encapsulation like genève

2142
01:50:17,080 --> 01:50:25,480
or gue or GRE whatever makes the most

2143
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:27,420
sense so this these are documents that

2144
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:30,280
you can read but of course they don't

2145
01:50:27,420 --> 01:50:34,290
contain all the answers yet because we

2146
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:38,290
are still looking for for some answers

2147
01:50:34,290 --> 01:50:39,850
Dave Dave ran again excuse me I haven't

2148
01:50:38,290 --> 01:50:41,469
read this stuff but I had a real quick

2149
01:50:39,850 --> 01:50:42,639
question because you said of all the

2150
01:50:41,469 --> 01:50:44,170
things you didn't do

2151
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:48,850
is one of the things you don't do

2152
01:50:44,170 --> 01:50:49,989
reordering well the network does the

2153
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:53,469
reordering and we might be doing

2154
01:50:49,989 --> 01:50:58,989
resequencing and that is actually indeed

2155
01:50:53,469 --> 01:51:01,750
a question that comes up it is part of

2156
01:50:58,989 --> 01:51:04,239
the requirement to take or miss ordering

2157
01:51:01,750 --> 01:51:07,210
that occurs inside the tunnel and fix it

2158
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:10,629
at the tunnel exit part of the

2159
01:51:07,210 --> 01:51:12,639
requirement probably is to be robust

2160
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:15,100
against reordering that occurs in the

2161
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:19,810
tunnel whether it should be fixed at the

2162
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:21,639
exit that is a matter of debate I don't

2163
01:51:19,810 --> 01:51:25,960
think we have an answer to that yet okay

2164
01:51:21,639 --> 01:51:34,090
thanks so I would like to avoid having

2165
01:51:25,960 --> 01:51:51,600
to do it but let's see where we get yeah

2166
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:57,360
it's not an easy question right yeah

2167
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:57,360
okay but from the taking your documents

2168
01:51:58,199 --> 01:52:03,489
there is also a proposed charter out

2169
01:52:01,480 --> 01:52:06,610
there so if you want to see more

2170
01:52:03,489 --> 01:52:10,750
precisely precisely what we propose the

2171
01:52:06,610 --> 01:52:12,909
working up to do you can look yeah so

2172
01:52:10,750 --> 01:52:16,210
obviously this is not happening in a

2173
01:52:12,909 --> 01:52:18,739
vacuum and in in the buff at the last

2174
01:52:16,210 --> 01:52:21,410
ITF we identified many plays

2175
01:52:18,739 --> 01:52:24,200
we have to talk to a for instance the

2176
01:52:21,410 --> 01:52:27,559
transport area working group has been

2177
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:30,380
discussing congestion feedback so we

2178
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:31,730
want to make use of that and there's

2179
01:52:30,380 --> 01:52:34,040
lots of other things and there's of

2180
01:52:31,730 --> 01:52:38,209
course in particular this research group

2181
01:52:34,040 --> 01:52:42,370
which we plan to tap for all the

2182
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:46,100
information about radar coding and

2183
01:52:42,370 --> 01:52:48,940
recovery that we can get and we also see

2184
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:53,060
that you have a lot of experience with

2185
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:56,259
encapsulation techniques so one of the

2186
01:52:53,060 --> 01:53:00,080
figures out of the FEC of a quick

2187
01:52:56,260 --> 01:53:03,890
document already made it into our slide

2188
01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:06,559
rail yes so my question will be this is

2189
01:53:03,890 --> 01:53:08,930
emergency multi with or without chair I

2190
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:10,969
don't know um the question I would have

2191
01:53:08,930 --> 01:53:12,830
for you is how can we help you and how

2192
01:53:10,969 --> 01:53:15,170
do you see you know we talked at the IRT

2193
01:53:12,830 --> 01:53:17,269
F open of the mechanism so how do you

2194
01:53:15,170 --> 01:53:20,330
see the mechanisms for that type of

2195
01:53:17,270 --> 01:53:22,580
collaboration going well the but my

2196
01:53:20,330 --> 01:53:25,280
assumption is that we first have a look

2197
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:29,140
at products of the research group for

2198
01:53:25,280 --> 01:53:32,719
instance these documents are being

2199
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:35,270
created they actually already have moved

2200
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:37,280
to the IDF but they come out of the

2201
01:53:35,270 --> 01:53:39,680
research group so it makes sense to talk

2202
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,179
to the research group about why they are

2203
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:44,060
the way they are because we are not

2204
01:53:41,180 --> 01:53:47,030
using them unchanged we're using the

2205
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:53,000
general general approach so this is one

2206
01:53:47,030 --> 01:53:55,370
part and the other part is that based on

2207
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,430
the number of assumptions we will have

2208
01:53:55,370 --> 01:54:02,599
specific questions so for instance this

2209
01:53:58,430 --> 01:54:05,750
lists three classes of FEC schemes that

2210
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:08,030
we might want to use and this is a

2211
01:54:05,750 --> 01:54:10,820
random guess and I'm sure a lot of

2212
01:54:08,030 --> 01:54:14,389
people in this room have a more refined

2213
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:18,950
opinion on which have strong I would say

2214
01:54:14,390 --> 01:54:23,950
have strong opinions so the ideas that

2215
01:54:18,950 --> 01:54:28,599
the the group will formulate questions

2216
01:54:23,950 --> 01:54:30,280
like this and get

2217
01:54:28,600 --> 01:54:33,070
from the research group in answering

2218
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:37,509
these questions or at least formulating

2219
01:54:33,070 --> 01:54:39,549
hypotheses and in some cases the result

2220
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:41,050
may be a research question that actually

2221
01:54:39,550 --> 01:54:45,490
you have to sit down and do a simulation

2222
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:46,540
like like my question about a couple of

2223
01:54:45,490 --> 01:54:48,820
minutes ago

2224
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:51,910
we don't know what that number will be

2225
01:54:48,820 --> 01:54:56,049
and we will have to design some research

2226
01:54:51,910 --> 01:55:02,470
to find out definitely I think there is

2227
01:54:56,050 --> 01:55:04,690
there are many research issues here when

2228
01:55:02,470 --> 01:55:07,090
you when we deal with tuners so you get

2229
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:08,950
multiple flows and you treat the

2230
01:55:07,090 --> 01:55:11,530
aggregate inside for instance one

2231
01:55:08,950 --> 01:55:13,690
sliding window schemes or whatever

2232
01:55:11,530 --> 01:55:16,389
schemes you are doing and following

2233
01:55:13,690 --> 01:55:18,820
their redundancy produc'd you might have

2234
01:55:16,390 --> 01:55:21,100
at the end of Virginia some ed of light

2235
01:55:18,820 --> 01:55:24,400
blocking because the protection is

2236
01:55:21,100 --> 01:55:26,170
different between multiple flows and you

2237
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:28,360
need the sauce repel packet to be able

2238
01:55:26,170 --> 01:55:31,540
to decode maybe you don't have a good

2239
01:55:28,360 --> 01:55:35,950
sweeper packet for a given flow so there

2240
01:55:31,540 --> 01:55:38,070
are some scheduling needs I think at the

2241
01:55:35,950 --> 01:55:42,610
Ontario channel if you want to be as

2242
01:55:38,070 --> 01:55:45,549
performant as a single fact protected

2243
01:55:42,610 --> 01:55:49,240
flow so there are many many things and I

2244
01:55:45,550 --> 01:55:52,300
did some tests with that and I don't do

2245
01:55:49,240 --> 01:55:53,769
not have Ian's were yet but there are

2246
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:54,880
something to dig up here for sure

2247
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:56,860
definitely

2248
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:59,200
so you talked about the situation where

2249
01:55:56,860 --> 01:56:00,880
we have different traffic laws that

2250
01:55:59,200 --> 01:56:04,690
differ on traffic class different size

2251
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:07,150
of flows micro flow flow flow and maybe

2252
01:56:04,690 --> 01:56:09,700
you got a fake on coding is I'm cutting

2253
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:12,309
a part of five packets of one flow and

2254
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:14,110
two packets of no go flow and at the end

2255
01:56:12,310 --> 01:56:16,360
there is one missing packet for the

2256
01:56:14,110 --> 01:56:18,790
routers one and you cannot decode maybe

2257
01:56:16,360 --> 01:56:21,820
for instance because you are still

2258
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:26,890
waiting for one packets of a given flow

2259
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:30,070
that built the Reaper packet so you slow

2260
01:56:26,890 --> 01:56:32,470
down some flows because you get fake

2261
01:56:30,070 --> 01:56:35,469
code which is produced by different kind

2262
01:56:32,470 --> 01:56:37,990
of flows and I always already observes

2263
01:56:35,470 --> 01:56:39,640
of a bed of like blocking because some

2264
01:56:37,990 --> 01:56:41,849
fools are watching for our source data

2265
01:56:39,640 --> 01:56:46,169
packet from a lava flows to be

2266
01:56:41,849 --> 01:56:48,479
to a duty cut the missing one but the

2267
01:56:46,169 --> 01:56:50,729
tricky of course is to not even identify

2268
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,320
those flows yeah we're going to have a

2269
01:56:50,729 --> 01:56:54,239
hard time identifying them because much

2270
01:56:52,320 --> 01:56:57,389
of the information what them is actually

2271
01:56:54,239 --> 01:56:58,919
encrypted yeah so maybe maybe there are

2272
01:56:57,389 --> 01:57:01,709
some scheduling so we can do maybe just

2273
01:56:58,919 --> 01:57:05,519
only on there on the way a packet aren't

2274
01:57:01,709 --> 01:57:08,070
you keeping only the socket informations

2275
01:57:05,519 --> 01:57:10,079
- I don't know yeah honest and on so if

2276
01:57:08,070 --> 01:57:12,209
you can send some more information about

2277
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:14,820
the set of line blocking to the list

2278
01:57:12,209 --> 01:57:19,229
yeah sure sure I have some Carosa I did

2279
01:57:14,820 --> 01:57:22,759
with a pie with FQ go there with trying

2280
01:57:19,229 --> 01:57:25,439
to explore how we can deal with that but

2281
01:57:22,760 --> 01:57:30,679
I think if you do that you should copy

2282
01:57:25,439 --> 01:57:30,679
both lists you sure sure sure okay I

2283
01:57:33,559 --> 01:57:41,340
Colin Perkins speaking very much without

2284
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:43,558
any hats on I mean you list a bunch of

2285
01:57:41,340 --> 01:57:44,969
different FEC schemes though and

2286
01:57:43,559 --> 01:57:46,459
obviously they have very different

2287
01:57:44,969 --> 01:57:48,780
characteristics yes

2288
01:57:46,459 --> 01:57:51,929
one of the things we found with doing

2289
01:57:48,780 --> 01:57:54,780
the the FEC for video and audio in apt

2290
01:57:51,929 --> 01:57:57,209
is is that it was possible to build

2291
01:57:54,780 --> 01:57:58,949
general-purpose mechanisms that you

2292
01:57:57,209 --> 01:58:00,329
started out with a very simple parity if

2293
01:57:58,949 --> 01:58:02,579
you see scheme and then we gradually

2294
01:58:00,329 --> 01:58:05,369
added more of more things and it worked

2295
01:58:02,579 --> 01:58:06,688
okay was the the simple scheme and it

2296
01:58:05,369 --> 01:58:08,699
worked perhaps better with the more

2297
01:58:06,689 --> 01:58:11,399
complex schemes but you you could choose

2298
01:58:08,699 --> 01:58:12,780
where in the spectrum you left do you

2299
01:58:11,399 --> 01:58:14,669
expect this to be the same sort of thing

2300
01:58:12,780 --> 01:58:18,329
where there will be multiple if you see

2301
01:58:14,669 --> 01:58:20,039
schemes which you can address different

2302
01:58:18,329 --> 01:58:23,398
levels of protection with a different

2303
01:58:20,039 --> 01:58:24,749
complexity IPR etc trade-offs or giving

2304
01:58:23,399 --> 01:58:26,489
this something that needs a particular

2305
01:58:24,749 --> 01:58:29,699
FEC scheme to make this work

2306
01:58:26,489 --> 01:58:31,320
my hunch would be that we actually want

2307
01:58:29,699 --> 01:58:34,348
to dynamically change between these

2308
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:36,419
houses so if you just have a very low

2309
01:58:34,349 --> 01:58:39,389
level of random losses then a purchase

2310
01:58:36,419 --> 01:58:41,398
in may be fine for you and when things

2311
01:58:39,389 --> 01:58:42,859
start to become interesting then

2312
01:58:41,399 --> 01:58:45,689
probably you want to have a better

2313
01:58:42,859 --> 01:58:48,539
scheme and then you do have a reason to

2314
01:58:45,689 --> 01:58:52,619
expend the CPU that you can save by the

2315
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:54,750
simple expose I would have a follow-up

2316
01:58:52,619 --> 01:58:56,190
question I know you're not done

2317
01:58:54,750 --> 01:58:57,600
because it's coming it so do you don't

2318
01:58:56,190 --> 01:58:59,519
have some kind of signaling for that

2319
01:58:57,600 --> 01:59:01,410
because when we did when we did quick

2320
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,750
that's what we added actually we added

2321
01:59:01,410 --> 01:59:06,059
some kind of signaling to decide which

2322
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:08,760
code we want to use and we did the same

2323
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:11,160
with the real-time media so yeah so

2324
01:59:08,760 --> 01:59:13,140
that's exactly the the the part of the

2325
01:59:11,160 --> 01:59:14,880
protocol that needs to be designed so

2326
01:59:13,140 --> 01:59:17,400
whatwhat's in the forward information

2327
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:21,480
and this is this is pretty much the

2328
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:24,210
index or the set of indexes you need and

2329
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:26,339
a format for the repair packets and in

2330
01:59:24,210 --> 01:59:29,340
the reverse the information all that

2331
01:59:26,340 --> 01:59:32,250
feedback information would come that is

2332
01:59:29,340 --> 01:59:33,420
needed to make decisions of this guy yes

2333
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:36,270
and and the feedback information

2334
01:59:33,420 --> 01:59:37,650
presumably includes lost which packets

2335
01:59:36,270 --> 01:59:40,920
will receive which were lost which were

2336
01:59:37,650 --> 01:59:43,589
retired yeah maybe which packets or

2337
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:46,530
maybe just how much how many and how

2338
01:59:43,590 --> 01:59:48,510
many weren't and you can even think

2339
01:59:46,530 --> 01:59:50,570
about hybrid approaches where that

2340
01:59:48,510 --> 01:59:55,410
feedback trigger summary transmissions

2341
01:59:50,570 --> 01:59:57,509
if you still have time budget to make it

2342
01:59:55,410 --> 02:00:03,030
useful for the applications okay thank

2343
01:59:57,510 --> 02:00:06,420
you yeah so I come at that and there is

2344
02:00:03,030 --> 02:00:09,480
a number of assumptions here like we

2345
02:00:06,420 --> 02:00:11,340
have a pretty large variance of the size

2346
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:13,259
of the payload packets I think this is

2347
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:15,860
similar to the quick work this is

2348
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:22,140
probably why we arrive at similar ideas

2349
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:25,469
how to encapsulate things yeah it's

2350
02:00:22,140 --> 02:00:26,820
divided up and this is not necessary

2351
02:00:25,470 --> 02:00:30,930
related to the way they are sent forward

2352
02:00:26,820 --> 02:00:34,950
and then maybe we want to do some

2353
02:00:30,930 --> 02:00:38,010
piggybacking schemes so we we don't

2354
02:00:34,950 --> 02:00:40,950
actually get more Pickers but we already

2355
02:00:38,010 --> 02:00:43,290
get longer packets and that may be an

2356
02:00:40,950 --> 02:00:45,720
optimization that's actually useful and

2357
02:00:43,290 --> 02:00:48,269
on the other hand we made too may want

2358
02:00:45,720 --> 02:00:52,860
to split packets that are larger than

2359
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:56,670
the MTU so that's very much open whether

2360
02:00:52,860 --> 02:01:00,570
that makes sense so this is exactly the

2361
02:00:56,670 --> 02:01:03,930
kind of we have seen this figure yeah

2362
02:01:00,570 --> 02:01:06,590
I'm pretty much done yeah so the design

2363
02:01:03,930 --> 02:01:09,349
choices we need help with

2364
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:12,289
what are these classes of easy schemes

2365
02:01:09,349 --> 02:01:14,449
assuming that we can define classes that

2366
02:01:12,289 --> 02:01:17,389
need approximately is the same kind of

2367
02:01:14,449 --> 02:01:21,799
feedback information so within the class

2368
02:01:17,389 --> 02:01:23,960
we can be algorithm AJ but when you go

2369
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,269
to a different class you just need

2370
02:01:23,960 --> 02:01:29,920
different feedback information and

2371
02:01:26,269 --> 02:01:32,119
different index information ideas about

2372
02:01:29,920 --> 02:01:37,039
mitigating the entry you problem would

2373
02:01:32,119 --> 02:01:39,499
of course always be a help for how do we

2374
02:01:37,039 --> 02:01:42,710
make use of feedback for instance for

2375
02:01:39,499 --> 02:01:46,280
controlling the fec rage what what is a

2376
02:01:42,710 --> 02:01:52,130
sensible time scale they are and how do

2377
02:01:46,280 --> 02:01:56,059
we construct those packets and we just

2378
02:01:52,130 --> 02:01:57,979
show one last slide we haven't been

2379
02:01:56,059 --> 02:02:01,030
chartered yet that what we had at the

2380
02:01:57,979 --> 02:02:06,349
last IDF was a non work group for me

2381
02:02:01,030 --> 02:02:09,289
buff so we we are talking to the AG's on

2382
02:02:06,349 --> 02:02:11,210
getting the working group chartered but

2383
02:02:09,289 --> 02:02:14,780
that doesn't stop us from actually doing

2384
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:17,090
the taking you work at the same time and

2385
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:19,940
in particular you want to explore the

2386
02:02:17,090 --> 02:02:22,249
design space maybe you want to do the

2387
02:02:19,940 --> 02:02:24,710
tough decisions only when we are

2388
02:02:22,249 --> 02:02:27,679
actually a running group but exploring

2389
02:02:24,710 --> 02:02:30,440
the design space is very much what we

2390
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:33,340
want to do now and we want to improve

2391
02:02:30,440 --> 02:02:37,009
our set of documents maybe adding a fake

2392
02:02:33,340 --> 02:02:38,300
document at one point and it would of

2393
02:02:37,010 --> 02:02:43,579
course be interesting to see who is

2394
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:45,159
interested in doing the FEC work there

2395
02:02:43,579 --> 02:02:48,289
is a github repository there is a

2396
02:02:45,159 --> 02:02:49,999
mailing list please join the mailing

2397
02:02:48,289 --> 02:02:55,550
list it's not going to kill you traffic

2398
02:02:49,999 --> 02:02:57,469
wise and if you are interested in this

2399
02:02:55,550 --> 02:03:01,909
and of course if you have input to the

2400
02:02:57,469 --> 02:03:05,360
Charter proposal that is at github that

2401
02:03:01,909 --> 02:03:08,030
also would be very much welcome and the

2402
02:03:05,360 --> 02:03:10,039
timeline for the whole thing is that we

2403
02:03:08,030 --> 02:03:14,059
believe it should be possible to charter

2404
02:03:10,039 --> 02:03:17,949
a working group in time for IGF 1 over 7

2405
02:03:14,059 --> 02:03:17,949
let's see if we pull this off

2406
02:03:20,019 --> 02:03:27,480
comments questions yeah maybe we could

2407
02:03:24,159 --> 02:03:29,980
become you know the you guys have T to t

2408
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:31,900
RG and you have core and maybe would

2409
02:03:29,980 --> 02:03:34,119
could be this a bit of the same thing

2410
02:03:31,900 --> 02:03:35,499
you know like the kind of thing that

2411
02:03:34,119 --> 02:03:42,400
goes from one to another

2412
02:03:35,499 --> 02:03:54,429
yes well Judea is actually their partner

2413
02:03:42,400 --> 02:03:59,409
to about ERG working group so you know

2414
02:03:54,429 --> 02:04:02,849
it could be something similar yeah so

2415
02:03:59,409 --> 02:04:05,920
just an example in theory we have

2416
02:04:02,849 --> 02:04:11,050
designed hypermedia format and and we

2417
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:15,010
like that with a working group and that

2418
02:04:11,050 --> 02:04:19,030
is now looking at standardizing thank

2419
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:23,860
you very much Carson thank you yes so we

2420
02:04:19,030 --> 02:04:27,579
are done Wow four minutes for five

2421
02:04:23,860 --> 02:04:30,098
minutes late before splitting I would

2422
02:04:27,579 --> 02:04:33,308
like to say something we are about to

2423
02:04:30,099 --> 02:04:36,400
adopt several documents and there is a

2424
02:04:33,309 --> 02:04:39,010
requirements if you want your documents

2425
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:41,230
to be reviewed by others then it seemed

2426
02:04:39,010 --> 02:04:43,539
very very important that you yourself

2427
02:04:41,230 --> 02:04:47,888
review documents of others that's the

2428
02:04:43,539 --> 02:04:52,179
way it must work so please read and send

2429
02:04:47,889 --> 02:04:55,150
comments especially when we are doing

2430
02:04:52,179 --> 02:04:59,920
last calls but not only so please review

2431
02:04:55,150 --> 02:05:05,018
read and review and well I'm going to

2432
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:06,670
put Raymond on the on the line here but

2433
02:05:05,019 --> 02:05:09,820
