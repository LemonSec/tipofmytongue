1
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:24,030
okay welcome to the second debt net

2
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:29,070
session thank you for making it back

3
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:31,020
after the break since this is a

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,320
independent session we're gonna remind

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,510
folks of a few administrative things

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,890
first is the note well this is the same

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,309
as what we talked about the last session

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:44,909
please recall that everything you say

9
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:48,030
here is governed by our contribution

10
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:50,010
rules and anything you say becomes part

11
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:52,649
of our permanent record if you're not

12
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:54,059
familiar with our note well it's the end

13
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:55,920
of the week right you should know that

14
00:00:54,059 --> 00:01:00,989
by this point but please take a look at

15
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:03,559
the URL sorry I have to I have to

16
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:07,289
remember to eat the mic sorry about that

17
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,630
so we are streaming audio and video as

18
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,369
well as recording please speak your name

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:18,060
at the mic when you have a comment also

20
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,130
join in our joint minute taking the URL

21
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,649
is here it's also ascent to the list so

22
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,929
it can be easy to click on we are doing

23
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,430
jabber I'm on jabber we do have remote

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,829
participants and they should feel free

25
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:32,329
to join the mic the mic line if they

26
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:36,229
have comments and we do have one remote

27
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:39,350
speaker the agenda is slightly modified

28
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,969
from what we talked about before

29
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,380
specifically that item number seven

30
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:47,640
we've already covered in a previous

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,689
session also number ten is a late

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,119
addition so I'm not going to go over the

33
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:55,919
rest of the typical administrative

34
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,570
things we did that in last session I

35
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,170
think we're just going to jump right in

36
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,169
so I think Andy is next

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:20,590
oh no I'm sorry Mach is gonna present

38
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:23,770
for this topic so Andy is a co-author

39
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,320
and here buddies please fill in the blue

40
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:36,130
sheets note that we have new blue sheets

41
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:38,260
for this second session okay hello

42
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,500
everyone my name is marcin so I'm

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:46,179
representing all sir to present this

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,760
Dannette controller plan framework so

45
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:51,940
here's a background of this document so

46
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:56,160
as we know that to date the working

47
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:59,739
group many in focus on the data plan and

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,750
become modules so I think it's time to

49
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:05,980
consider about this control plane

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,900
protocol aspect as we know that as we

51
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:10,690
know that the current architectural

52
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:14,260
document has already discussed some

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:17,170
control and controller plan aspects in

54
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:21,209
the section and 404 mmm

55
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:26,950
font - as according to the definition in

56
00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:30,010
RC 17 for 2026 the controller plan

57
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,209
include actually includes a control and

58
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:41,109
the management plans so this document

59
00:03:34,209 --> 00:03:44,799
try to cover two it's two parts and we

60
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,769
do not there are some error detonate

61
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,440
then yet that better plan

62
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:53,200
Ted clone document already talked about

63
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,470
some requirement today actually to the

64
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,238
control plan so the purpose of the draft

65
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:01,540
is were straightforward we try to

66
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,500
compile all then the controller plan

67
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,840
requirement in this document and then we

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:11,170
can provide an overview of possible

69
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:15,129
control plan put solutions based on

70
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:18,969
those requirements for example how to

71
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:22,120
the fun particle different extensions in

72
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,820
the case of distribute distributed

73
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,330
control plan and a relevant signaling

74
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:31,020
protocol or you know for the central

75
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:34,229
centralized scenario or in elaborate

76
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,940
hybrid means there there may be some

77
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:42,789
centralized and the digital solution

78
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:45,550
used in a in in a scenario so this

79
00:04:42,789 --> 00:04:49,710
statement also discussed other control

80
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:53,380
plan issues that dedicated to dead net

81
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,659
for example how to support explicit

82
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,909
paths and how to do the source a

83
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:01,300
reservation to support pre-health

84
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:04,210
functions and how to you know to and

85
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:08,530
also talk about how to integration with

86
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:13,030
existing protocols for example the lung

87
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:17,830
I sir am furious long is our IP and also

88
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:20,530
can how to apply this to the I'm here

89
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:24,250
Sunday service six so this document also

90
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:26,888
to describe some aspect about the

91
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,130
management plan issue that is eunuch

92
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:32,979
eight unique to the net I've example how

93
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:38,440
to provision in the prayer of auction

94
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:39,550
and how to do then there are aliens so

95
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,400
this document

96
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:45,759
many major to know together to document

97
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,479
the gaps are you know in the existing

98
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,270
control and solutions of the document

99
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:54,820
tests test document that does not intend

100
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,289
to you know to define some specific

101
00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:02,409
solution this the solutions will be you

102
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:06,370
know document in dedicate document for

103
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:10,539
example if we want to extension the RC

104
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:14,919
BT protocol then we be sterilized us in

105
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:18,009
the case working group so here's a next

106
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,039
step our about this work so I think this

107
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:24,490
work has already discuss in a society of

108
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,400
meeting so based on current charter

109
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:29,080
there are the same sacrament that this

110
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,948
work is

111
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:36,800
within the current charter so the author

112
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:38,270
believed that the current draft is a you

113
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:43,610
know good ship and for locking up

114
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:48,979
adoption and Wednesday's work adopted I

115
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:51,259
can under a we can continue to improve a

116
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:53,979
document and also it can start a

117
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:59,419
relevant solution work in relevant

118
00:06:53,979 --> 00:07:02,659
working groups can I have a comment on

119
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:06,529
the previous slide I understand it's the

120
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:09,800
long-term plan and no comments on that

121
00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:13,759
but when you say that that integration

122
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,539
existing control planes there is a sorry

123
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:19,699
six and we will hear about it soon but

124
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:23,469
that's a new data plane so for the rest

125
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:27,499
actually we have data plane already and

126
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:30,589
we first should have maybe data plane

127
00:07:27,499 --> 00:07:34,159
before having control plane when it

128
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:36,379
comes to us every six a category I think

129
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:39,699
yeah I think great based on the

130
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:42,110
consensus optic on the group two years

131
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:46,729
also following up on at this is from

132
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:48,349
Jabbar from Bernard sales second routing

133
00:07:46,729 --> 00:07:51,080
is normally only having routing protocol

134
00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,669
extensions and no signaling protocol at

135
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:58,758
all

136
00:07:52,669 --> 00:08:02,508
so that's comment actually yeah I think

137
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:06,050
yes Signori has had its own protocol a

138
00:08:02,509 --> 00:08:08,689
single protocol but in our if we want to

139
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:12,349
leverage it's a grout intercept l10 net

140
00:08:08,689 --> 00:08:16,250
there may be some additional work need

141
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:19,819
to be done yeah I think I think this

142
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:23,149
person is focusing on thinking that

143
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:24,680
controller plane has to be signaled and

144
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,659
one of the things the reason we're using

145
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,819
controller plane versus the older term

146
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:32,000
of control plane is is that it may be

147
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:34,579
fully centralized and that you can you

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,539
could for example do resource management

149
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:40,760
with sr without having to signal it just

150
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,710
from a controller yeah I think this

151
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,770
document does not to

152
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:49,130
any potential solutions you just leave

153
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:52,240
straight option here I can distribute i

154
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:54,590
can4t centralized I can have great just

155
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,690
discuss some potential solution for the

156
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,900
control plan after Daniel Annette

157
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,610
yeah but resource management or resource

158
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,860
allocation reservation for segment

159
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:10,120
routing is an unsolved problem not there

160
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:14,510
is no solution so there is no solution

161
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,830
no standard for right so right now we do

162
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,500
have an issue this was going to come up

163
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:21,130
later that we don't have a definition of

164
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,960
what what traffic engineering 4sr means

165
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,930
this is an issue that we've been talking

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:29,660
with let's the spring chair as well as

167
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:32,270
the 80s and will continue to work

168
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,890
between now and the next meeting but I

169
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,230
think that that's consistent with the

170
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,980
point beyond or say let's not let's not

171
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:41,860
focus on SR to start yeah and and get

172
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:48,230
there as we do work out these other

173
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:50,980
topics yeah another comment from two

174
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:55,730
comments from jabber bernard sales says

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:58,790
but centralized is yang right and andy

176
00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:00,830
malice response is centralized is not

177
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,270
necessarily yang although that is an

178
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:10,850
option and then the response back is

179
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:13,880
okay but in general it is both think

180
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:15,890
votes right yeah so so that was a little

181
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
bit of it at like commerce and that was

182
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:19,819
a little bit of a nap mic conversation

183
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:26,020
and keeping in mind that Andy is one of

184
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:30,400
the co-authors of this yes all right

185
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:33,140
yeah I think yeah I think yeah okay so

186
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:36,890
we previously looked at this document

187
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:42,500
and got tried to get a feel for the room

188
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:44,210
I'll do it again how many have actually

189
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:47,120
I'm gonna ask the other question first

190
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:50,300
how many people think that we should be

191
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,130
working on this topic in the working

192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:59,079
group so controller plain work

193
00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:04,090
debt net okay that's a that's a

194
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:06,790
reasonable number how many think we

195
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:08,560
should not be working on this and

196
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,300
keeping in mind this is a gap analysis

197
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,800
this is not a solution document so I had

198
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:16,240
someone who looked like they're gonna

199
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,250
come to the like but I've and I made

200
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,090
that caveat I think I said they sat back

201
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:23,890
down right so they I think the objection

202
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:26,140
there would be is is if we start talking

203
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:27,730
about solutions there are other working

204
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:30,460
groups that own the solution space and

205
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:34,020
we shouldn't jump on their activity and

206
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,020
that's absolutely correct

207
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,640
so we've we've said that there was a

208
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,370
good number who thinks we should be

209
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:43,660
working on this there were no objections

210
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:47,410
how many think that this is a reasonable

211
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:52,540
foundation for our work in this area in

212
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:54,100
other words we should adopt how many

213
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,189
think we should adopt this document as a

214
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:59,440
starting point that's very that's that

215
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,380
that's much less who then think that we

216
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,940
should work in this area that's a little

217
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,590
bit of a surprising result maybe I

218
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:07,590
phrased it in a way but no matter what

219
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:16,750
yeah yeah how many have read the

220
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:17,950
document it's alright that was a good

221
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,210
question because it's about the same

222
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,690
number raise their hand

223
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:25,840
yeah so this is something we're going to

224
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:28,180
confirm number one that for our ad that

225
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,300
this is something that we can be working

226
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:35,099
on assuming that the ad says that it's

227
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:37,510
okay we will be taking this the list

228
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:41,700
okay thank you I think he's ready to

229
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:46,510
draft and Cummins right okay thank you

230
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:57,160
great thank you very much next next up

231
00:12:46,510 --> 00:13:01,530
we have a one of two SR v6 talks it's

232
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:01,530
really weird that this says flexi here

233
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,030
be careful when you have a presentation

234
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:20,410
and have a title when you steal it from

235
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:22,750
something else it shows up positional

236
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:27,569
and I will present our work about as I

237
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:30,520
was six Valdez net here is actually why

238
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:31,150
doesn't that from the first place excuse

239
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,460
me

240
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:36,520
I just unfortunately I was talking at

241
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,040
the mic Andy is saying hand up hand up

242
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,780
hand up repeatedly it's the danger of

243
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,219
being chair of cherry and also being

244
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,560
jabber scribe Andy did you want to make

245
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:54,760
a comment or you just hands up agreeing

246
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:57,810
oh he was just agreeing sorry about that

247
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:01,330
[Music]

248
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:03,760
why we need an ax from first place there

249
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,890
are some new applications and bring some

250
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,930
new requirements for network so perhaps

251
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:10,180
we need some new technologies rather

252
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,910
than the traditional ones so when you

253
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:16,180
detonate and I think people in the room

254
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,160
may be very familiar with these three

255
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:21,400
features often at the resource

256
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:24,610
allocation to avoid congestion and the

257
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:29,110
service protection to provide a

258
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:32,800
redundant transport to to avoid the

259
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:37,420
failure of the flow and also explicit a

260
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:41,560
routine so this work we try to implement

261
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:45,969
that netting yeah yeah SR SR v6 domain

262
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:49,119
so why is r6 first as a v6 in sauce

263
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:51,850
routine and as r6 could steer the packet

264
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,130
flows through the network according to

265
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,820
an explicit past with allocated

266
00:14:54,130 --> 00:15:01,710
resources and second network programming

267
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:03,940
a server six can support the the

268
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:07,120
functions that will be needed in

269
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:10,630
Internet and also metadata a services

270
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,120
could carry the information that will be

271
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,340
needed in that's net for example the

272
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,130
flow identification and sequence number

273
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:23,829
so why not

274
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:26,350
here is the architecture for a Sophists

275
00:15:23,829 --> 00:15:28,899
six for ten answers protection because

276
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:31,990
there are three features seen that's not

277
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:35,949
and in this stage we just cover the

278
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:39,370
service protection first and the first

279
00:15:35,949 --> 00:15:41,099
days the data plan basically the packet

280
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,820
will goes through the ingress node and

281
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:49,149
in the ingress node it will be inserted

282
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:51,220
the SR v6 policy that will steer the

283
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:54,279
packet from the ingress to the relay

284
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,070
node and also the fluid application a

285
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:59,920
sink with number will also be counting

286
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:03,269
in the SRH and a general they know the

287
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:06,910
one packet of replication happens and

288
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:10,300
after the replication the payload and

289
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,899
the ipv6 header with the SRH a binding

290
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,279
to different as our basics policies

291
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:17,199
which steer the packets through

292
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,890
different paths and the in the

293
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:24,670
elimination note the redundant packet

294
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:27,839
will be eliminated and the the survival

295
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:31,479
will transmitted through relay know to

296
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,149
go to the egress node and in the control

297
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:39,240
plan we consider and we considering that

298
00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:42,070
to the first we there should be an a

299
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,730
past commutation request from the edge

300
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,910
node to the controller to see that the

301
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:52,209
the TANF law won't Service protection

302
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:54,640
pass in order to have auto reliability

303
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,459
and the after the computation a

304
00:16:54,640 --> 00:17:00,430
controller will send pass to the add

305
00:16:57,459 --> 00:17:06,010
node and also the replication and

306
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:13,629
elimination notes and so I finish it

307
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:16,119
first or you yes and after the after the

308
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:18,819
controller configure the action or the

309
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:21,129
it should also configure the relay node

310
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:23,260
and the replication living node should

311
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:26,260
be configured to identify that then then

312
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:28,870
I flow spy flow identifications after

313
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,920
application or elimination the explicit

314
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:33,270
passed you

315
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:40,330
next relay should also be required

316
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:43,900
through some control plan extensions so

317
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:46,419
I'm trying to affinity Stewart you're

318
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,390
clearly describing doing pre off in this

319
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,070
but pre off requires sequence numbers

320
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,190
how do the sequence numbers get carried

321
00:17:51,070 --> 00:18:02,820
uh it will be describing in the next

322
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:07,030
slide okay yes Dave Allen Erickson the

323
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:09,929
statement binds a new SRV six policy to

324
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:13,330
the survival packet does this involve

325
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:15,700
inserting information

326
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:20,500
you mean searching for what kind of

327
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:23,440
omission and for this yes it's it's

328
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:28,000
basically abiding said actually after

329
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:30,070
the after the elimination it is it's a

330
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,200
binding cid that was not part of the

331
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:36,250
information inserted at the back at r1

332
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,560
right

333
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:41,470
you mean the information of flow

334
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,409
identification and the resource number

335
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:47,380
the sequence number well there's the

336
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:48,820
part where you use do the sequin you

337
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,470
proceed to replicate it and put the

338
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:54,639
sequence number and I understand that's

339
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:56,950
done with a tunnel because yes I think

340
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:00,220
so because you're discussing D capsule

341
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:02,470
aiding the odor of ipv6 header yes and

342
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:06,040
I'm assuming that's not a manipulating

343
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:09,250
the segment routed list but the

344
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:10,780
insertion or the binding a new s rv6

345
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:13,510
policy to me sounds like you're

346
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,149
inserting new information into the ipv6

347
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:19,510
packet and into the segment list

348
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:21,550
actually there is an example about how

349
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,610
to do this I think this will answer your

350
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:26,500
question perfectly yeah maybe you can

351
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:31,510
give more comments after that I will

352
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:36,070
wait thank you thank you and here is the

353
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:37,960
what do we need when we do a survey six

354
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:40,450
space that than that first we need a

355
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:43,630
manner to identify the 10 L payload type

356
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,730
and also a suitable explicitly routine

357
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,680
you deliver the Dynaflow which will be

358
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:50,710
supported by the segment at least and

359
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:53,440
yes RH and also we should have a method

360
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:58,270
of indicating the packet processing such

361
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,280
as the functions required in the service

362
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,480
protection for example packet

363
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:07,149
replication uttering and elimination

364
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,190
also we need a method of identifying the

365
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,610
denna flow and carrying the 10 a

366
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,350
sequence number actually carries queuing

367
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:16,810
in the forwarding indication will also

368
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:19,840
be considered but it is not in the

369
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:24,159
current version of the draft here we

370
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:27,669
bring some options to do this first we

371
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,380
can to carry the flow identification and

372
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:33,880
the sequence number the first option is

373
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:35,800
we we carry this in the SRH TLV and the

374
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,020
second option is two arguments in the

375
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:40,389
see the for relay node and the third one

376
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:44,920
is a 10s in assignment at least and the

377
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:49,060
option 4 is 10 and s RHD insert inside

378
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:52,270
the s rh because the limited time I just

379
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:55,740
will introduce the we think the most

380
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:58,870
reasonable one which is the option one

381
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,510
we carry the flu identification and

382
00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:04,149
sequence flow identification sequence

383
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:09,490
number in the optional TLV and we

384
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:13,600
designed how to how to link holding them

385
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:17,670
in the s rh and here is that we design

386
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,889
new functions for test net which is

387
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:23,950
replication and elimination use that

388
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:27,040
that is basically an extension of the

389
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:32,520
current binding set it means that after

390
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:36,100
replication it will binding new new

391
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,129
segment at least to the package and also

392
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:43,240
this one is after the elimination to

393
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:45,610
abiding a new segment least to the

394
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:49,919
packet and here is the example how to do

395
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:54,668
this basically in the

396
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,519
ipv6 header there is the source address

397
00:21:54,669 --> 00:22:00,070
and the destination address we in this

398
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:02,950
picture it shows as the end station 1

399
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:06,668
and station 2 and again the ingress node

400
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:12,220
we will insert as our age that currents

401
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:14,980
that the east source address is ingress

402
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:19,419
node and the next the destination

403
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:23,679
address is transit 1 and in the SRH the

404
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:25,960
seminar list shows the relay node 1 and

405
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,230
the transient not one and the in transit

406
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:34,360
not 1 the destination address in the

407
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:37,450
outer ipv6 header will will will change

408
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:40,119
to relay not one and again relay know

409
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:43,960
the one we said we see that after the

410
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:48,639
peculiar application there will be new

411
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:54,070
alter ipv6 header for two replicated

412
00:22:48,639 --> 00:22:56,998
packets and each SRV each each SRH

413
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:59,408
header in the outer ipv6 header will

414
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:02,169
indicate the packets goes through

415
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:05,139
different paths and one of them will go

416
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:07,869
through transit node 2 and one of them

417
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:11,469
will go through transcend l3 and in the

418
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:14,199
relay node 2 their packet elimination

419
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:19,299
happens and after the elimination the

420
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:22,960
alter ipv6 header will change and we

421
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:25,720
will bind another as out her as ipv6

422
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,279
header with a new SRH indicate the

423
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:34,659
packet goes through transient node 4 and

424
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:37,210
in the egress note the outer ipv6 header

425
00:23:34,659 --> 00:23:41,619
will be d capsulated and the packet will

426
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:45,279
go to the N station to finally so that

427
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:47,740
is the simple example of how to do this

428
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:55,740
I think this maybe can't answer the

429
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:58,750
question of the previous comment thanks

430
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,179
Tulse Eckert you know I think it would

431
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:02,440
be good for for for understanding by

432
00:24:01,179 --> 00:24:06,750
people to have a compare

433
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,750
in between you know just native ipv6

434
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,620
data plane where we would also need on a

435
00:24:11,529 --> 00:24:16,389
per hop basis the appropriate shaper for

436
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,939
the latency control that we needed at

437
00:24:16,389 --> 00:24:21,279
net and then compare that natively six

438
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:24,309
data plane with the SR v6 solution and

439
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,590
then you know explain what the benefits

440
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:28,990
would be right because I think that that

441
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:31,299
is hard to vet just from looking at this

442
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:33,159
solution obviously the interesting part

443
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:36,309
is the transit not the stuff on the edge

444
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:40,379
with the duplication duplication I think

445
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:40,379
that part would be certainly the same

446
00:24:43,379 --> 00:24:51,490
modular garrison so my question would be

447
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:56,200
for clarification first so is it a new

448
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:59,110
data plane yes but it is focusing only

449
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,860
to a single function to the pre off

450
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:05,740
function but you have described so far

451
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,928
and for the data plane we need what the

452
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:15,509
dotnet service sub-layer and also the

453
00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:15,509
dotnet forwarding sub-layer yes actually

454
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:21,668
yeah actually in the in a draft I

455
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:23,440
described this part because in the

456
00:25:21,669 --> 00:25:25,659
previous design

457
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,570
you know I'm PRS data plan solution

458
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:32,080
there is we can find the service sub

459
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,600
layer and forwarding sub layer obviously

460
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:39,699
because it's label stack right but in

461
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:42,129
sr6 it is cannot be separate very

462
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:43,659
obviously which part is forwarding sub

463
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:46,449
layer and which party is service a

464
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:49,360
bigger sub layer because the the

465
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:52,480
metadata that is needed by the server

466
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:57,549
sub layer is carrying inside the SRH

467
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:01,179
so although there is no sub layer seams

468
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:05,889
in the data data encapsulation

469
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:08,860
but inside the process the device

470
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:10,658
process it will be serviceable there and

471
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:13,479
forwarding sub layer and each sub layer

472
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:16,360
will do their own job but they will find

473
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:22,750
the corresponding information inside

474
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:26,439
the SRH from different part but but it

475
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,540
is not seems like the I'm sure as data

476
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:30,700
plan

477
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:33,820
but I think this is what is my major

478
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:36,040
problem here that if you are looking

479
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,950
here to the transport node and I think

480
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:42,580
this is but previous commander or circum

481
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:46,860
entities that in the transport nodes or

482
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:50,860
transit notes you need that net

483
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,219
forwarding sub-layer how to recognize

484
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:57,969
the flows if it is within your s r v6

485
00:26:54,220 --> 00:27:02,530
header which by definition should not be

486
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:06,640
touched by the transit nodes actually if

487
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:08,950
more functions will be needed for their

488
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,530
transit node I think the transient node

489
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,820
should has a seat to indicate that

490
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:17,530
because there it needs some special

491
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,439
processing or functions that is

492
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,629
reasonable but in this case I have

493
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:26,460
already said that in this case the only

494
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:28,630
service protection is included because

495
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,690
replication and the elimination is the

496
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,200
main focus in the current draft and the

497
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,850
perhaps after this part of work is

498
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,660
accepted or people think of this that is

499
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:42,639
reasonable and we can go further to the

500
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,470
other functions about maybe the

501
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,919
transcend out what should transcend all

502
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:52,000
should do yeah but this definition seems

503
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,790
to prohibit to do the not really sublet

504
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,210
actually I think I have a picture for

505
00:27:54,790 --> 00:28:01,720
that afterwards in this picture I show

506
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:03,190
that for service protection is it part

507
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:08,650
of the document

508
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:12,690
not really okay it's a whole picture we

509
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:12,690
have considered this question actually

510
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:23,020
explained can you then provide the

511
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:26,080
answer inside the draft no okay I will

512
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,540
in this picture it shows that a Service

513
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,070
protection Needham Ella metadata of flow

514
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:33,310
identification a six number

515
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:36,879
right so we put in the option one we put

516
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:41,110
these two information into the optional

517
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:43,360
TLV SRH and in service protection we

518
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,399
also provide some special functions to

519
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,800
do this including replication

520
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,190
elimination and ordering so we will

521
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:54,399
extend the current functions of sr6

522
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:56,620
programming we need new functions for

523
00:28:54,400 --> 00:29:01,000
that we have already discussed this

524
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:04,000
before and also in the left we see that

525
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,980
we also need some resource allocation in

526
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,500
this resource allocation maybe we need

527
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,380
new functions for scheduling or resource

528
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,750
reservation if so we will also do the

529
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,780
extensions to the functions and if there

530
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:21,010
is new metadata needed and maybe we will

531
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:24,389
end more data into the seed as arguments

532
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:27,910
or inside function that will be a lot of

533
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:31,090
implementations yes that is my answer

534
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:37,350
yeah but that is my question and that

535
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:40,240
was my issue that in the SR v6 fields

536
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:44,800
this is something but is not considered

537
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:48,520
by the transit nodes oh you are not

538
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:50,830
looking to the US a v6 header fields in

539
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,940
a transit node you will just check it at

540
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:58,090
the next destination this transient node

541
00:29:54,940 --> 00:30:00,280
is not the same concept in the SR v6

542
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:02,620
this transit node is just that not

543
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:04,930
ransom note that transit node means that

544
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,540
it doesn't handle the problem of

545
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:11,170
replication elimination it is not

546
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:15,360
exactly the transient Nodine sr6 okay so

547
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:18,880
then you are defining new type of SR v6

548
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,770
capabilities of nodes yes actually that

549
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,770
is what we are doing we try to define

550
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:28,120
the designated corresponding functions

551
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:30,070
in ice our v6 to implement does not okay

552
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,030
so what about compatibility with the

553
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:36,460
existing as our v6 definitions it's an

554
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:39,220
extension to it so maybe that is the

555
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:42,250
reason why you say that we should put it

556
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:44,100
in spring first to see what as a v6

557
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:47,529
people think about this

558
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,799
okay because I think if we intend to

559
00:30:47,529 --> 00:30:53,080
consider it as a as a data plan for that

560
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:56,379
net then we should see all the aspects

561
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:58,869
that bought some layers the service sub

562
00:30:56,379 --> 00:31:00,850
layer and the forwarding sub layers the

563
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:03,279
functions we have defined so far they

564
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:05,709
are possible to do with this data plane

565
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,039
and that is a very reasonable and

566
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,679
because you are you have been working on

567
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:13,330
the user plan the date opponent

568
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,429
definition for a long time so I think

569
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:18,850
your comments will be very valuable for

570
00:31:15,429 --> 00:31:20,950
us to to move this forward what should

571
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:25,748
be done what should be considered more

572
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,970
thank you okay a clarifying question do

573
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:31,360
you mind going back to that slide the

574
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:34,210
first version can you highlight where

575
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,369
whoops yeah thank you can you highlight

576
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:40,720
where in this picture you you see that

577
00:31:36,369 --> 00:31:43,779
there are new sr functions needed in the

578
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,809
relay node and the elimination node in

579
00:31:43,779 --> 00:31:48,820
the replication on an elimination node

580
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,860
and in this picture that is the relay

581
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:54,039
know the one r1 and really know the two

582
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:56,830
are to the arch r1 will do the

583
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:00,700
replication and that is a new function

584
00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:04,689
that is that function is an extension of

585
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:07,950
the current abiding function of the sr6

586
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:10,330
network programming and also in r2

587
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:12,549
elimination will be done so there is a

588
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:14,559
new function for elimination and after

589
00:32:12,549 --> 00:32:20,259
the elimination they were there

590
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:26,080
will a new as sorry as are H abiding

591
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:28,629
into the packet okay thank you so it's

592
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:34,230
David Allen again my generalized

593
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:38,709
question is is for example does r1 or r2

594
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:43,860
modified the segment list multi fine no

595
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:47,049
no because they just change the alter

596
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,529
ipv6 header so you you add an

597
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:54,369
encapsulation with its own segment list

598
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:56,730
yes because that is a yes I think you'll

599
00:32:54,369 --> 00:33:00,780
stay - right right so at our

600
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:12,990
- you remove the outer IBP six header

601
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:15,120
entirely yes then where does four okay

602
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:19,860
I'm just trying to figure out how that's

603
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:24,330
so at the the in router and at the Egret

604
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:27,059
so the in router insert is is there two

605
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:31,199
layers of tunneling here oh actually

606
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:34,610
there is only one layer because from the

607
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,030
beginning to the end there is only one

608
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:41,939
altar a pv6 header in an in a relay node

609
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:43,860
and the to relay notes which do the

610
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,910
replication and elimination we change

611
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,149
the outer aqua basics header okay yes

612
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:52,650
it's just that at the ingress node

613
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:56,780
getting to the egress doesn't appear to

614
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:00,929
be there so there actually there is no

615
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,570
IP basic SRH to indicate the packet from

616
00:34:00,929 --> 00:34:06,330
the ingress to the egress in the first

617
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,350
part is just in the steer the packet

618
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:13,529
from the ingress to r1 that is the first

619
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:16,230
part of the pass and the in the second

620
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:18,629
second part is steer the packet from the

621
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:20,250
r1 to r2 right and that's where you push

622
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:21,929
an additional header because you're

623
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,590
going to have to separate segment lists

624
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:27,030
and then it r2 you pop it yes then where

625
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:30,149
does the information to get to the

626
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:33,450
egress exists in all of this actually

627
00:34:30,149 --> 00:34:37,918
here there are some description in the

628
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:40,770
function design we we use we use some

629
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:44,600
funk we use some information bringing

630
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:47,580
from the previous as Irish header which

631
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:51,629
in this picture in this slide we can

632
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:55,560
show that we bring the sequence number

633
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:59,640
and flow and education in the optional

634
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,340
TLV in the first SRH right and hinder

635
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,618
after the replication we will get this

636
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:09,270
part of the you get this part of

637
00:35:04,619 --> 00:35:10,070
information and put that into a new SRH

638
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:14,000
in

639
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:16,850
new SRH optional tlvs to make the the

640
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,730
information of the flow transit from

641
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:22,940
from the the first part of the past to

642
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:25,520
second parts of the past okay I have to

643
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:27,380
admit I'm not understanding this but I

644
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,360
think that's my problem I will have to

645
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:31,400
review this and take it online thank you

646
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,170
please read the drops and a comment on

647
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:35,960
the Middle East so we've done a good job

648
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:39,470
of filling up time so we're why we were

649
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,500
ahead we're now right on right on time

650
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:46,759
so I'd like to ask the folks in line to

651
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:49,040
try to keep it brief and I'll also give

652
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:51,010
a preview of what what the chairs are

653
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,890
gonna say on this is any new

654
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:58,160
functionality new sr v6 function like

655
00:35:54,890 --> 00:36:02,330
this version we have to take to that the

656
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,160
working group group yes and you know

657
00:36:02,330 --> 00:36:05,270
talk to them about it so okay I have to

658
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,040
do that so that's just a heads up that

659
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,740
that's coming and yes

660
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,450
so total Secord again I mean my

661
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,859
understanding is that there is an SR

662
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:15,710
architecture right and would you really

663
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:18,740
be good to say that what how are we

664
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:22,160
doing debt net NSR with the ability

665
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:24,169
support both SRS MPLS and SR v6 the gaps

666
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:26,180
for both of them may be different in

667
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:27,920
terms of forwarding plane features but

668
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,589
the architecture should and could be the

669
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,530
same right so I kind of hate the idea of

670
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:36,050
saying oh today we think SR v6 is hip

671
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,880
and leaf you know the the SR MPLS

672
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,860
solution behind and then you know I

673
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,990
don't know next year maybe there is more

674
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,150
sales being made with SR MPLS and

675
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,399
everything shifts backside like if we're

676
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:48,290
saying SR let's start with SR and then

677
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,960
go down into you know the gaps for both

678
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,900
solutions thank you Tony's for a comment

679
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,670
brief respond I I haven't considered

680
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:58,850
this problem from the view of the sales

681
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:01,730
actually it is said in the previous data

682
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:05,270
plan solution strapped that the if we

683
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:08,000
use as our MPs it is supported naturally

684
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:10,550
by the current MPs data plan solutions

685
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,340
so there's there is no more job as our

686
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:16,010
MPs I'm not sure if that's actually true

687
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,480
for the hop-by-hop q so common that to

688
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:22,220
the the other older sis not my fault so

689
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,690
please could you clarify it I didn't

690
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,049
properly understand it we can within

691
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:29,810
here

692
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:31,250
Stewart is there only ever one segment

693
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,440
routing header on the front of this

694
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,900
packet yes and that it's completely

695
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,880
removed and replaced by another one when

696
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,540
you go through any stage of the pre-op

697
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,550
yes you know current design that is true

698
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:46,180
sorry when you split we will actually

699
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:48,980
don't you don't necessarily / - the

700
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:51,950
architecture allows arbitrary splits and

701
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:54,800
arbitrary merges and I was just trying

702
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:57,140
to understand making sure that you

703
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,380
weren't making an assumption of one

704
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,920
single replication going on on a on a

705
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:06,920
path so if you go back to your bigger

706
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:09,770
yes that's that one there so first off

707
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,470
our one in the general architecture is

708
00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:16,460
allowed to be replicated have multiple

709
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:22,100
replications there and then t3 could be

710
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:24,680
our 3 so we I'm just going to understand

711
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,830
whether your design will cope with the

712
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:32,560
generality or whether it's assuming a

713
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:35,960
very simple two way splits and merges

714
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,660
actually I think it is a very valuable

715
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,050
comment and we consider this problem

716
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:45,730
from beginning we design it this way

717
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:49,910
because if we replicate it again yeah

718
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:53,210
replicate pass it will makes the things

719
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:57,109
more complex you know because we allows

720
00:38:53,210 --> 00:39:00,320
this case this is just the simplest one

721
00:38:57,110 --> 00:39:03,860
if we do the replication again in one of

722
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,560
the paths and we merge in that path it

723
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:09,470
will makes the there will be header and

724
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,509
header and header so that will makes the

725
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,609
case really complex so we designed this

726
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:15,950
way but if you think there are other

727
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,650
reasonable design I think it's welcome

728
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:20,180
well well what I think we need to write

729
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:22,370
what we need to do in the next version

730
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:25,819
what you need to know I think is to take

731
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,799
some of the arbitrary replication P or

732
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,590
function the designs that we have in the

733
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,720
framework document and demonstrate how

734
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:34,340
you would solve those because this is

735
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,839
easy to solve and we just need to make

736
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,460
sure we can solve the general case or

737
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:41,650
put the limitations in

738
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,650
please contribute thank you thank you

739
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:50,780
Elijah a variation in the document in

740
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,220
the prayer of section in section for the

741
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:56,290
tree you are speaking about

742
00:39:52,220 --> 00:40:01,790
point-to-multipoint two point parts and

743
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:03,980
just thinking about that we intend to to

744
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:07,490
work also on some some controller paint

745
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,619
stuff so I don't understand that term so

746
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:13,220
please clarify what does it mean because

747
00:40:09,619 --> 00:40:15,109
I think as Stewart also referenced that

748
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:17,598
that you can do any number of

749
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:20,720
replication elimination during the path

750
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,960
so but does it mean that point move the

751
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,390
point to point

752
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,359
maybe this word is a little confusing I

753
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:33,080
can explain it or remove it but you

754
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:37,400
might in my understanding it just means

755
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:40,880
that it's just it is not the P 2 and P

756
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,580
it after the replication the elimination

757
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:45,770
exists that is what I mean from the

758
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,710
first place but it makes you a little

759
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:51,560
confusing I can we can talk talk about

760
00:40:48,710 --> 00:40:52,910
more how to describe this case I think

761
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,040
that is very confusing especially

762
00:40:52,910 --> 00:41:01,180
because you are using practically

763
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:04,040
point-to-point way over at this point

764
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:06,009
can we certainly have some procedural

765
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,890
stuff we have to work out here and then

766
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:12,130
we'll continue to work with the SR

767
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:12,129
spring chairs

768
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,750
good afternoon everyone my name is David

769
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:49,810
I'm from cyber home see ICT and if the

770
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:54,160
traveling is impaired innate that TSN

771
00:41:49,810 --> 00:42:07,810
negative I truly 8 or 231 years and over

772
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:10,000
as our v6 little to the look of the

773
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,940
structure of the peers and over detonate

774
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,500
and either similar to that he has an

775
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:23,410
over as our MPs and the left part and

776
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:27,220
the right part is autumn TSN TSN network

777
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:30,930
and mid parties there is our v6 to me

778
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:35,740
and that c1 and it will sense the

779
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:39,669
critical patriotism to p1 and p1 and the

780
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:43,149
AG ed notable as I said as our v6 and we

781
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:46,150
are performed the factions of mapping

782
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:50,170
and the publication and the elimination

783
00:42:46,150 --> 00:42:52,330
and send it to the P to another p2 then

784
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:55,510
at the traffic of Theoden will be

785
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:58,210
recovered to send it to see - that was

786
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:01,330
the pedicle structure of Tiran over to

787
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,970
the net now that we take a look at mr.

788
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:07,000
lewin of taking cover seriously relation

789
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:08,970
structure of tears over as our v6 we

790
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,869
have occurred several options for

791
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:16,419
encapsulation of tears and over as our

792
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:20,190
v6 the further wines just repackaging

793
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:22,810
packet and there's second wine is

794
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:25,840
inserted a trading to tear at our v6

795
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:28,480
packet will together with some control

796
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:32,440
innovations and the third one is just

797
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:36,010
this speaker because we think about them

798
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:39,400
as are a cheater overhead of authorities

799
00:43:36,010 --> 00:43:41,350
elite hole a turn so I think we here in

800
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:44,530
order to save their overhead and we

801
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:46,930
should a salute the payload of the TSN

802
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:52,170
and the insult of the payload Bay loaded

803
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:56,680
into them as ihe just follow the as IH

804
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:58,540
and two days are 56 where I did note

805
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:01,299
martyr support the following kids in

806
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:03,750

809
00:44:07,390 --> 00:44:11,770
user inside the Teton domain and the

810
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:14,650
third one is forever our yard when the

811
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:20,250
note is she hasn't replication or

812
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:24,120
elimination parade and it is the

813
00:44:20,250 --> 00:44:29,740
capitulation structure for anxiety for

814
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:33,520

825
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:13,180
reserved for the future functions an

826
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:15,990
ability family of new to new and as a v6

827
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:18,040
programming functions that the entropy

828
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:22,629
prevarication Terran lsit

829
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:25,150
and an appeal elimination force for the

830
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:29,140
pantry elimination function and this is

831
00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:31,990
just till corruption stopped and in the

832
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:37,720
future maybe we need to discussing and

833
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:40,120
then elaborated to functions and the

834
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,240
moment I would have I would like to take

835
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:46,180
a example over the NEP replication for

836
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:52,740
the Terran anxiety and the talented node

837
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:57,370
we will present a original packet and a

838
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,290
generator to duplicated packet patron

839
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:03,330
Terra

840
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:08,160
i ib v6 @ IH that's a ipv6 si a g1 and

841
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:11,490
ipv6 as IG - and then we will send it

842
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:13,649
there ever the duplicated thank you

843
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:19,229
duplicated packet and original angular 2

844
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:21,180
that you ran the pass now on the

845
00:46:19,230 --> 00:46:24,090
decision to give a summary for the data

846
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:27,830
plan considerations then the two aspects

847
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:30,180
the third one is written in intaglio

848
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:32,970
replication and elimination order

849
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:35,850
functions and the second is the aging

850
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:38,209
order processing and to the management

851
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:41,880
and control information summary we

852
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:44,550
included the first vegas for exit of

853
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:46,830
elimination here that's at the third why

854
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:49,050
the TSN screen identification that

855
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:52,980
here's an art rank information and the

856
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:55,730
second is IP v 6 for the trait and third

857
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,170
an attorney is the idea is to the revi 6

858
00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:03,210
destination address and therefore it's

859
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:06,660
the ipv6 traffic or class and and to the

860
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:10,860
next date and further although we will

861
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:14,670
solicit it a comment for this is dropped

862
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,190
and secondly we want to elaborate the

863
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:22,340
first and the second certainly we want

864
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:25,890
to other brands and they improve their

865
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:27,450
implementation for this suggestions that

866
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:34,950
though about the truck

867
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:37,109
thank you any comment actually I have to

868
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:43,439
ask what is the difference between this

869
00:47:37,110 --> 00:47:48,120
work and our work you need the tablet

870
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:52,110
you have it right now right that draft

871
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:55,259
is published about one year ago and the

872
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:58,590
contents of the draft is very very

873
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:00,780
similar of this one if you haven't read

874
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:04,410
it I recommend you read it this first

875
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:04,920
and because the it is too similar with

876
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,029
each other

877
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:10,570
I I have to say I prefer you put this

878
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:14,110
part of work as

879
00:48:10,570 --> 00:48:18,430
and contribution or comment on the

880
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:23,230
mailing list because I cannot see a lot

881
00:48:18,430 --> 00:48:28,240
of more work in this draft compared to

882
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:31,780
our previous one we have a 32-foot their

883
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,439
website for the similar department we

884
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:39,520
have got five similar part related to

885
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,560
this one but ice from my site those five

886
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,730
was thought you've read from this one

887
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:49,000
and your table is forgotten to turn it

888
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:53,310
over as our v6 right and it did why you

889
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,310
focus on here then override obviously

890
00:48:54,420 --> 00:49:01,180
misunderstanding about the what we want

891
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,270
to do when we say about i sorry 6 / -

892
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:06,970
yes maybe ok can I make a point on this

893
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:09,280
yes all related one so these are

894
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:12,430
individual contributions not adopted by

895
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,920
working group maybe what one way for

896
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:18,960
what could be the two teams contributor

897
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,960
teams come together and work together

898
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:28,480
very welcome but my point is after we

899
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:31,600
have done the work you you you change it

900
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:34,690
a little and publish a new draft I think

901
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:37,150
that is a not a very welcomed method

902
00:49:34,690 --> 00:49:39,660
should do the contribution yeah idea I

903
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:39,660
think so

904
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:45,850
i I think I should repeat and neither of

905
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,400
them are adopted by the working group

906
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,020
neither this working group or Spain we

907
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,270
keep saying we don't know where it goes

908
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:56,200
so these are so far individual

909
00:49:52,270 --> 00:49:58,480
contributions not working so I thought

910
00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,939
it may be you me and my colleague our

911
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:03,310
will change their cut in the website if

912
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,590
they had this identical we will always

913
00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:08,380
do it even if they are event I don't

914
00:50:05,590 --> 00:50:11,260
know the continue are did it our can

915
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,660
research it independently and then my

916
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:16,600
suggestion and and from my side then you

917
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:22,330
your father is ethically is it even

918
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:29,230
front with what what can I say thank

919
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:31,090
you generally if you have some comments

920
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:33,970
on an existing document it's good just

921
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:47,590
to say send the comments to the list so

922
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:52,990
we are okay perfect thank you apparently

923
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:55,240
this is a nice is group document the

924
00:50:52,990 --> 00:50:57,430
same problem it in these tablets as eius

925
00:50:55,240 --> 00:51:01,529
eius and since we are talking about it

926
00:50:57,430 --> 00:51:01,529
the very last slide says be a resilience

927
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:11,200
we're gonna move on to the next

928
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:13,810
presentation so thank you grandma I'm

929
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:18,160
changing from titi my presentation today

930
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:23,380
is the detonator ques cure s the drafter

931
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:27,129
has been presented in ITF 103 and we got

932
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:31,000
little feedback so this meeting we hope

933
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:37,870
to get more feedback out after mainly

934
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:41,680
applying existing ques work under that

935
00:51:37,870 --> 00:51:47,460
let less quick let's do a quick recap of

936
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:52,720
the ITF cues ITF cues model has been

937
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:56,680
proposed and adopted by the RTE gwg

938
00:51:52,720 --> 00:52:00,100
working group it mainly includes policy

939
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:06,279
a classifier action and the target and

940
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:11,080
it many user if they wish deficiency 80

941
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:13,660
the surface is diffserv for short under

942
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:17,710
the tip short tips a piece of

943
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:22,089
architecture is defined in our press 824

944
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:27,810
and 75 and and real MP else ifs of is

945
00:52:22,090 --> 00:52:33,370
also defined and in there ITI RFC third

946
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:36,160
3270 so there are there are many there

947
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:42,040
is marshal work has been done and

948
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:47,140
stable for ITF cues so we summarize the

949
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:52,300
delayed kills requirements in RFC 8655

950
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:55,390
so they are the ester follow shown a

951
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:58,750
telnet and long dead flood flows could

952
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:01,170
coexist with existing class of service

953
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:04,990
and the death net flows must be

954
00:53:01,170 --> 00:53:07,510
differentiated from law that traffic not

955
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:10,990
attract traffic cannot destroy

956
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:13,350
destructor there Detlef flows and the

957
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:16,779
net flows can be shaped and schedule

958
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:19,900
their aggregation of the led flows must

959
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:25,440
be supported and must others more others

960
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:30,640
can be provided so their death netquest

961
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,950
draft we many applying officiate

962
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,040
different safety the surface that it

963
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:39,370
serve and recuse moto in that land and

964
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:42,130
the definer that--let tips of mechanism

965
00:53:39,370 --> 00:53:45,930
including the that IP and mpls

966
00:53:42,130 --> 00:53:50,350
encapsulation maybe as rob6

967
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:52,660
encapsulation later there we also define

968
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:55,960
a young late better model for the

969
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:59,529
electives of queues includes including

970
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:04,480
Atlit accused tree structure under the

971
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:08,230
lac use module so this is a data

972
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:11,320
narratives of model we the tips of model

973
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:16,450
includes their classifiers yes if he

974
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:19,810
traffic conditioners PHP and queen so we

975
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:24,160
extended the tips of model for that land

976
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:27,100
we define that latter class virus we may

977
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:31,029
use their behavior aggregate the be a

978
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:35,350
classifier order marty field EMF

979
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:39,430
classifier which is defined before we we

980
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:44,710
are used we may be used to be a and MF

981
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:48,850
classifiers in that net we also add aloo

982
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:49,839
that latter and classifier it means it

983
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:53,949
named

984
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:58,930
that's not flow it is DF for short it

985
00:54:53,949 --> 00:55:04,299
may be used as label in death lat MPs

986
00:54:58,930 --> 00:55:07,109
encapsulation and maybe user flow and

987
00:55:04,299 --> 00:55:10,420
edification in as always six

988
00:55:07,109 --> 00:55:13,779
encapsulation may be in later

989
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:16,619
and so we are used with field to class

990
00:55:13,779 --> 00:55:20,189
find that net and the low dense net flow

991
00:55:16,619 --> 00:55:24,549
second we defined that last dscp

992
00:55:20,189 --> 00:55:29,609
includes the lat IP DSP and that amperes

993
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:34,390
DSP the sector value we haven't defined

994
00:55:29,609 --> 00:55:36,459
we will want to discuss with others in

995
00:55:34,390 --> 00:55:41,890
the mailing list and their define a

996
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:44,859
value second third we define death net

997
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:48,219
traffic conditioners including meter

998
00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:52,689
maid marker shaper dropper in the way at

999
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:57,839
a low action their scheduler we will

1000
00:55:52,689 --> 00:56:03,609
define or definite profile to to do the

1001
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:06,819
meter of action and to see why if

1002
00:56:03,609 --> 00:56:10,558
they're death knell flow is meat meat

1003
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:15,519
eater mr. kettle and fire a provirus

1004
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:19,359
requirement so men we that define our

1005
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:21,999
death natural / hot behavior that PHP we

1006
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:26,410
define a veterinary field should be and

1007
00:56:21,999 --> 00:56:29,738
defined er T and service class then

1008
00:56:26,410 --> 00:56:35,678
there are death not Queen we as we one

1009
00:56:29,739 --> 00:56:39,339
known tur this so far we provide their

1010
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:43,559
time schedules Queen and it is specified

1011
00:56:39,339 --> 00:56:49,929
in other drugs so this is the tips of

1012
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:51,819
model for that land then based on so at

1013
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:55,869
the last time we presented this there

1014
00:56:51,819 --> 00:56:56,619
was a question of what is a debt net

1015
00:56:55,869 --> 00:57:01,269
dscp

1016
00:56:56,619 --> 00:57:03,760
and it sounds to me as I hear it and as

1017
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:08,740
I read it is you're defining a new

1018
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:14,890
PHP for debt net yeah in debt net we

1019
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:16,930
have per flow resources and it's a

1020
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:20,440
little hard to understand how a what a

1021
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:22,509
debt net PHP is relative to per flow

1022
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:24,460
resources could you talk about how those

1023
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:26,590
two things relate this was the same

1024
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:29,140
question from 103 and I don't think it

1025
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:30,340
was been addressed from the last time I

1026
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,750
was presented I can't remember what

1027
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:39,119
meeting it was that it was presented but

1028
00:57:31,750 --> 00:57:44,580
yeah as I understand as in my opinion

1029
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:48,180
per flow there and schedule the queen is

1030
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:51,340
mesma Caledon duralumon thing has

1031
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:56,830
provided the mechanisms including their

1032
00:57:51,340 --> 00:58:03,930
per flow and the per class so I think we

1033
00:57:56,830 --> 00:58:09,119
use their surf model we mainly use the

1034
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:12,700
per class per class queen mcElhatton

1035
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:14,560
belong to so the only allocation you

1036
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:17,799
know the only assurances you can provide

1037
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:23,890
to when using this is a class based

1038
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:26,640
allocation based okay I'm not sure how

1039
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:31,799
that fits in with the hold that net

1040
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:35,618
architecture but the DA the queens

1041
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:38,680
mechanism has not been conferred we we

1042
00:58:35,619 --> 00:58:40,950
were used per class or poor flow it's

1043
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:48,850
worth it's it has been not been

1044
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:50,649
conferred you know maybe I didn't I

1045
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:51,549
still don't understand how this relates

1046
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:55,990
to the rest of the debt that

1047
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:58,869
architecture and maybe I'm the only one

1048
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:03,279
who has that issue but it's I don't find

1049
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:05,530
it clear maybe if it's just me I'll work

1050
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,850
offline and try to understand okay how

1051
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:11,440
this works okay

1052
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:15,279
and so there the work we have much work

1053
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:17,900
to perfectly to perfect it so there are

1054
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:21,890
DSP and the PHP we

1055
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:27,820
we need much work to fear it and perfect

1056
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:31,160
it but so I welcome welcome

1057
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:34,640
people people to join us and relief are

1058
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:38,720
suggestions so it's not good to me but

1059
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:40,759
anyway yeah I think that's the

1060
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,669
challenges is the figure you think about

1061
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:48,350
how to communicate how this fits in to

1062
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:50,840
the rest of the architecture because in

1063
00:59:48,350 --> 00:59:55,100
order for it to move forward will have

1064
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:57,080
to be clear there let's see what the

1065
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:04,069
working group thinks how many people

1066
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:05,330
have read this work very few who how

1067
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:07,040
many people would like to hear more

1068
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:08,540
about it in the future or maybe with

1069
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:11,750
some clarifications of how it ties

1070
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:16,009
together with the rest of the the net

1071
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:17,510
architecture alright is anyone

1072
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:23,510
interested in hearing more about this

1073
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:25,280
topic that's that's not good there's no

1074
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:26,930
one who seems interested in this work I

1075
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,480
think you have to do a much better job

1076
01:00:26,930 --> 01:00:32,120
of seeing of communicating how it

1077
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:35,930
relates to the rest of the working group

1078
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:38,540
activity try doing that on the list but

1079
01:00:35,930 --> 01:00:41,270
yeah maybe take a step back and come out

1080
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:43,520
at a different way because people aren't

1081
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,750
understand I think the way I read it is

1082
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,450
people aren't understanding how this

1083
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:51,370
relates to the working group okay thank

1084
01:00:47,450 --> 01:00:53,899
you all right thank you appreciate it

1085
01:00:51,370 --> 01:00:58,100
last stop it we're almost at a time

1086
01:00:53,900 --> 01:01:01,730
where this will be very quick yeah so

1087
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:04,310
why Louis the idea was that we would

1088
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:06,500
have time to talk about it and it was a

1089
01:01:04,310 --> 01:01:08,600
year ago when we had the workshop and we

1090
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:10,160
are proposing another one so just a

1091
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:13,750
quick update I'm speaking as an

1092
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:17,500
individual as usual and this is this is

1093
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:20,870
grouping of TSN standards and projects

1094
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:24,940
in in three categories based technology

1095
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:27,759
configuration solutions and profiles a

1096
01:01:24,940 --> 01:01:31,100
timeline is given compared to the last

1097
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:32,630
ITF in Bangkok where we discussed list

1098
01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:35,670
of

1099
01:01:32,630 --> 01:01:37,890
I'm just - I like that if you are

1100
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:40,470
puzzled on the TSN technology that we

1101
01:01:37,890 --> 01:01:42,089
have so many standards and projects you

1102
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:44,819
are not the only one that's why we have

1103
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:48,030
profiles for dedicated for particular

1104
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:51,599
verticals to select tools out of the

1105
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:55,440
toolkit and specify their use the color

1106
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:58,320
code here is that the darker shade is

1107
01:01:55,440 --> 01:02:01,380
more progress to work the lighter is a

1108
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:04,560
less progressed in the profiles the

1109
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:06,420
ongoing ones are the IEC I Triple E six

1110
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:08,820
way to to join project foreign in the

1111
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:10,650
industrial automation vertical we have

1112
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:15,090
an extension to the front hope of Fire

1113
01:02:10,650 --> 01:02:19,170
CMD and there are new ones automotive in

1114
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:22,950
vehicle and one for service provider

1115
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:24,599
networks how to use TSN for these this

1116
01:02:22,950 --> 01:02:28,470
is again there are some highlights

1117
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:30,960
compared to the previous Bangkok

1118
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:33,450
presentation I would like to highlight

1119
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,030
two items here the really good news out

1120
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:40,109
of last week is that the times in our

1121
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:41,940
time synchronization standard the 802

1122
01:02:40,109 --> 01:02:46,020
da20 as general as precision time

1123
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:49,320
protocol profile of the 1588 PTP has

1124
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:52,560
been approved by the AIT Plato to itself

1125
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:54,480
and sent to I typically standard

1126
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,700
Association revision committee approval

1127
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,220
hopefully early next year so we are

1128
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:02,419
practically speaking done with the

1129
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:05,640
long-awaited new time sync revision and

1130
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:11,900
there are some new work items here in

1131
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:15,299
the resource configuration part of the

1132
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:20,760
TSM pillars I would like to highlight

1133
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:23,099
here that work is ongoing to specify a

1134
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:25,849
new reservation protocols the brace

1135
01:03:23,099 --> 01:03:28,800
protocol being a so-called link local

1136
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:31,859
registration protocol on its own it's

1137
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:34,530
not really useful but we need an

1138
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:36,779
application on top and the ongoing work

1139
01:03:34,530 --> 01:03:39,359
is the resource allocation protocol for

1140
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:43,250
that this is a new project compared to

1141
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:45,180
one year ago and the two together will

1142
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:47,700
provide

1143
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:49,950
the new resource allocation and this

1144
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:53,308
work has been started to me the industry

1145
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:55,520
automation needs based on all the

1146
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:58,770
discussions with the key contributors

1147
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,329
they consider it applicable for death as

1148
01:03:58,770 --> 01:04:02,609
well and I've been encouraging them to

1149
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:04,950
contribute to that not so a heads up

1150
01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:09,328
