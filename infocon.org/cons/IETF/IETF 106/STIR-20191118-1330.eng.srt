1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,090
okay

2
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,720
zero times up

3
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,090
[Music]

4
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,069
nice person

5
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:24,750
while has an author always appreciate

6
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:05,750
[Laughter]

7
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:17,969
ever say it like whoever comes in last

8
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:20,339
minute I don't know I think that they

9
00:07:17,969 --> 00:07:23,808
were actually into some quote unit you

10
00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:23,809
were kind of kicked around house them

11
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,040
[Music]

12
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:51,698
it's time right

13
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:09,599
okay so we're still waiting on a minute

14
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,599
taker Richards doing it thank you

15
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:37,000
it'd be awesome if you could both take

16
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:45,720
notes and collaborate all right let's go

17
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:48,130
ahead and get started by now hopefully

18
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:53,680
since is the second session you've

19
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:59,740
probably been in at least today note

20
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:05,979
well please note the note well as we

21
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:10,450
will be using it and the agenda for

22
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:15,459
bashing the this was posted a couple

23
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:18,450
weeks ago since it was posted Martin

24
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:22,959
asked for a chunk of the time allows

25
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:26,350
section so if we're expeditious with the

26
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:30,130
other I will get to hear about the

27
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:35,320
emergency services work any agenda

28
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:36,910
fashion okay

29
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:39,600
then we'll start with the cert

30
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,600
delegation

31
00:09:49,839 --> 00:10:00,679
was like Yoda in the last speaker is

32
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,029
that working okay I think that's good

33
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,799
hi I'm Jon we're gonna talk about

34
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:05,689
certificate delegation and I have

35
00:10:03,799 --> 00:10:08,358
engineered my deck this time so it will

36
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:09,169
not eat the entire session as it did

37
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:13,369
last time

38
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:15,409
next slide please so what is this this

39
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:17,299
is a working group item on certificate

40
00:10:15,409 --> 00:10:19,849
delegation and it sets out to explain

41
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:22,069
exactly how delegation works I mean

42
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:24,199
there's some language in 80 to 26 that

43
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:26,089
says you can like create delegations and

44
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:28,069
they can have like child certs on parent

45
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,809
certs and they can inherit some of the

46
00:10:28,069 --> 00:10:31,639
permissions that these parents arts

47
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,439
possessed but it didn't really spell out

48
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:35,749
much of the mechanics what that meant

49
00:10:33,439 --> 00:10:37,279
have like an a s and BS deal with

50
00:10:35,749 --> 00:10:39,019
certificates like that so this is really

51
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,509
just trying to explain something we

52
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:45,769
hinted at in 82 26 but didn't actually

53
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:47,509
explain we also wanted to talk a bit

54
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:48,949
about how it interacted with acne since

55
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:51,439
we're doing a lot of acne stuff in

56
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:53,358
general around stur it's not a long

57
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,858
draft them you can probably read it by

58
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:56,959
the time this talk is done if you

59
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:58,879
haven't read it before but it does

60
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,888
support a number of interesting use

61
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,319
cases probably the ones to get the most

62
00:11:00,889 --> 00:11:05,720
attention in the industry are enterprise

63
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:07,878
in OTT cases cases where there are

64
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,709
entities that kind of pseudo carriers

65
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:11,209
that maybe have enough zip

66
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,998
infrastructure that they want to be able

67
00:11:11,209 --> 00:11:16,488
to sign calls themselves but in the

68
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:17,659
traditional shakin model they don't show

69
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,489
up as carriers they don't look like

70
00:11:17,659 --> 00:11:21,499
hairs like NECA and the people who

71
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:22,819
decide who gets operating carrier

72
00:11:21,499 --> 00:11:25,309
numbers traditionally in the United

73
00:11:22,819 --> 00:11:28,069
States and so we wanted to try to figure

74
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:29,719
out if there was a use for doing

75
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,238
delegation to kind of help those

76
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,970
entities get into the stir shaken

77
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:37,429
ecosystem this could work as well for

78
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:39,289
like end-user --is-- cases one common

79
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:40,939
one that comes up is like the doctor's

80
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:43,098
office case where the doctor wants to be

81
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:45,379
able to like spoof the main number of a

82
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:47,569
medical facility from his cell phone and

83
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:49,249
maybe an individual sir could be kind of

84
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:50,259
delegated to his phone or something that

85
00:11:49,249 --> 00:11:52,069
would let him do it there's like

86
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,089
possibilities for that but that's not

87
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:53,539
really what we're talking about at this

88
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:56,979
point

89
00:11:53,539 --> 00:11:56,979
next slide

90
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,910
sorry the blue sheets are going around a

91
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:08,080
second time because a bunch people came

92
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:09,350
in after they went around the first time

93
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,850
all right

94
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,970
changes since last time and this

95
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:17,420
reflects the interim meeting that we had

96
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:19,700
over that lovely teleconference two or

97
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,469
so months ago we talked a bit about the

98
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,300
need to articulate better how to not

99
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,010
list permissions worked because this is

100
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,319
actually apparently something we weren't

101
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,660
super clear about in 82 26 and I guess

102
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,399
we're using this document is a place to

103
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,420
make sure we explain what what the

104
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:34,910
hell-- supposed to mean if you actually

105
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,880
have OC ends and telephone numbers in a

106
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:39,709
bucket in a single certificate and based

107
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,800
on the design from long long ago that

108
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:44,000
rests out that with back in the day

109
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,939
permissions are added if what that means

110
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,010
is like you know if it contains two OC

111
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:50,959
ends what that doesn't mean is it's the

112
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,630
intersection of the telephone numbers

113
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,130
that they support that it's this

114
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,620
particular certificate is authorized to

115
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:58,790
sign for it is the superset of all the

116
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,760
telephone numbers covered by those two

117
00:12:58,790 --> 00:13:03,920
OC atoms and similarly if you have

118
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,110
heterogeneous resources like an OC N and

119
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,149
a telephone number range it's not saying

120
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,829
like within this OC n you can sign this

121
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,660
telephone number range instead of saying

122
00:13:09,829 --> 00:13:13,339
you know you can sign for anything

123
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,170
that's another so CN and anything under

124
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:17,600
this telephone number range even if they

125
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,010
are kind of overlapping so we just want

126
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,120
to make that clear I guess this is where

127
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:22,730
we're gonna end up making that

128
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,380
clarification added a bit more text

129
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:26,570
about collapsing the certificate chain

130
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:28,610
in cases where the CA that issued a

131
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,490
parent cert a parent wants to delegate

132
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,260
down to you know a new delegate

133
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,930
certificate for an enterprise or

134
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:39,140
whatever but really that you know the

135
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:41,750
the carrier let's say who controls that

136
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:43,550
parents heart is going to the same CA to

137
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,200
get the delegates hurt issue that issued

138
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,060
them their own so yeah their own

139
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,829
certificate in that case there may be

140
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:50,569
ways to collapse the certificate chain

141
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,370
so I kind of explain that a bit more

142
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:54,140
there is a bit of a trade-off in that

143
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,790
and that you may discard information

144
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,040
about who the entity was that issued the

145
00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:00,110
initial cert in the first place so we'd

146
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,149
have to you know figure out some way to

147
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,250
make sure that the resulting collapse

148
00:14:02,149 --> 00:14:06,980
chains are actually correctly identifies

149
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:08,540
who the parent is but there's been some

150
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,800
interest in this rather than having like

151
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,099
these sprawling chain

152
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:15,189
certificates that could potentially in

153
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:17,899
aberrant use cases arise from delegation

154
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:19,880
and finally I added a bit of language on

155
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:21,800
sub certs this was a TBD that we

156
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,860
discussed a bit last time and I think we

157
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:26,449
spend quite a bit of time on it actually

158
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,060
and kind of what the draft does now is

159
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,839
say we'll get to that if we need it in

160
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,089
other words

161
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,510
okay we're defining a delegation system

162
00:14:32,089 --> 00:14:37,700
here but there could be some regulatory

163
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:39,140
environment you know maybe if Germany

164
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,240
wakes up tomorrow insides we're gonna do

165
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,850
stir they may not like the idea of

166
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:45,890
issuing certificates to carriers with CA

167
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,930
equals true in it and so it just kind of

168
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,760
leaves the door open to okay if it turns

169
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,859
out that is gonna be possible in some

170
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,810
regulatory environments we should at

171
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,930
least know that there is a plan for how

172
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:59,109
to deal with that in those cases next

173
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,109
slide

174
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:05,300
more stuff left over from last meeting I

175
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,070
did just restrict pretty much using x5u

176
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,240
since everyone's using x5u and

177
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,720
understand there's already like PEM

178
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,190
chains and x5u home we could use x5c

179
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,720
because it's designed with a specific

180
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,190
purpose in in job but you know if people

181
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,020
want to start doing it that's fine right

182
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,430
now pretty much everyone is using x5u

183
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,649
though so I would probably stick with

184
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,479
that we had a big discussion last time a

185
00:15:24,649 --> 00:15:28,820
good bit about the idea that maybe we

186
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,470
should put some piece of markup in the

187
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:33,410
certificate that says that the entity

188
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:35,390
the CA that issued this cert did the

189
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,819
vetting process to make sure that the

190
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:41,420
encompassing semantics had actually been

191
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:44,180
validated before it the delegate cert

192
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:46,010
but as many people pointed out like it

193
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,719
should just do that and there shouldn't

194
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:49,399
be any need for you to say there has to

195
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,470
be a good bit to say that you just did

196
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:56,329
that instead we're just assuming you did

197
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:58,550
that so point on that is if there is a

198
00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:00,199
certificate policy under which the

199
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,420
certificate is issued that is where you

200
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:05,810
explicitly say it not in the sir

201
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,519
fair enough fair enough and so we're no

202
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,829
longer talking about good bits for that

203
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,899
this does not whoever preclude if you

204
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:13,930
were AVS and you still want to just

205
00:16:11,899 --> 00:16:16,370
double-check that this particular

206
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,020
telephone number is within the scope of

207
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:19,100
the OCA and in the sir that signed yet

208
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:21,199
you can still do that we're not

209
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:21,770
forbidding you from doing it we're just

210
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,180
saying that's kind of

211
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,720
belt-and-suspenders at this point

212
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,880
because

213
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,590
that delegation should have been assured

214
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,100
by the CA that issued the cert in the

215
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,390
first place and for now I I didn't Li do

216
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,950
anything about acne star I think we're

217
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,960
gonna push that probably into the

218
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:38,720
short-lived certs draft if we get around

219
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:40,670
to doing that which we probably will at

220
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,440
some point if we have any spare time

221
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:43,969
today we may talk about what future

222
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:46,940
directions will be for work we're gonna

223
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:49,450
explore here but for now I'm not really

224
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:54,980
saying anything about it in this draft

225
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:58,160
next slide that's it like I'm not here

226
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,430
to raise any issues I'm not really aware

227
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,530
there are any issues I think we we still

228
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:05,929
are kind of waiting to see what Addis is

229
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:07,129
going to emit from the process it's

230
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,530
going through right now to kind of

231
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:11,180
measure ways that enterprises know TTS

232
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,609
might participate in the shaken

233
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:16,550
ecosystem and I think once we have

234
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:18,379
something more concrete from that there

235
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,669
there may be just Corrections course

236
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,680
corrections they're required in this

237
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:23,300
approach but I think this you know for

238
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,450
that reason we may hold it another cycle

239
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,460
not advanced it just yet maybe we could

240
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:31,790
use that time to get some eyes on it and

241
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,050
see if anybody has any comments but as

242
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:34,399
far as I'm turned basically this should

243
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,840
be ready to advance this was never

244
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,630
intended to be particularly complicated

245
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:40,699
draft just trying to explain what we

246
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,500
meant by saying delegation was possible

247
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:47,900
when we wrote RFC 82 26 so point of

248
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:51,410
clarification there are you suggesting

249
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:53,690
we do working group last call now and be

250
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,840
ready or are you saying wait a cycle and

251
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:58,640
then do work wrap Lesko yeah I mean you

252
00:17:56,840 --> 00:18:00,560
could go either way I don't have strong

253
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,940
feelings about that I mean you know

254
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,909
working group last calls are two weeks

255
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:08,000
and cycles are like four months so I

256
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:10,730
don't think it is essential that we do

257
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,650
that immediately but we certainly could

258
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:15,050
if that'll help get some eyes maybe you

259
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:16,760
wanna that's what the point was is that

260
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:21,050
usually is a forcing function to get

261
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:26,030
people to actually read it so maybe

262
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:27,530
after Christmas anybody here read it

263
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:30,139
have any thoughts about it I think this

264
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:32,149
is the right wrong approach you know

265
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,280
it's not really any different from the

266
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,280
last to dyn's I presented this

267
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:44,179
okay I see some thumbs up I see some see

268
00:18:39,889 --> 00:18:47,178
one guy with a pitchfork but Chris went

269
00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:49,490
a few of us are implementing it so yeah

270
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:51,139
it is being implemented I understand

271
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,610
that people are kicking the tires on

272
00:18:51,139 --> 00:18:54,799
this in the marketplace like I said so

273
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:57,799
this is not exactly science fiction

274
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,918
stuff this is being again it is is in 82

275
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:02,480
26 that you can do this is in some RFC

276
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,070
we previously published this is just

277
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,899
really further people who are now trying

278
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:10,970
to implant explaining what it means to

279
00:19:05,899 --> 00:19:13,489
implement it so okay I believe that is

280
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:19,519
it on this there's nothing the backup

281
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:21,139
means backup you know and and I I'm glad

282
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,330
we got through that quick because now

283
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,748
plenty of time to spend on our CD unlike

284
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,749
last time

285
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,360
the funny part is we spend a lot of time

286
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,340
at the interim on our CD so I think what

287
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,020
he actually covered most of it but I'll

288
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:49,320
give an update I think there is a couple

289
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,049
of topics we can talk about in more

290
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,539
depth so actually really the first slide

291
00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:59,190
is most critical I have examples and

292
00:19:54,539 --> 00:20:06,690
other things there sorry second second

293
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:10,590
slide so for the most part you know

294
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:13,500
between the the interim meeting and the

295
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:16,168
new draft I you know took all the

296
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:21,059
decisions we made and try to incorporate

297
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:22,649
all those and draft the big one was and

298
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:25,590
you know the one that we probably spent

299
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:28,049
the most conversation on was sort of

300
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:30,689
trying to figure out what the normative

301
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:34,049
language is about like operating in

302
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,929
different modes and I think we came up

303
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:39,710
with essentially three modes which I

304
00:20:36,929 --> 00:20:43,230
detail in the draft so the first one is

305
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:45,779
you know nothing about integrity we're

306
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,179
just signing direct content into the

307
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:50,250
claims like you're directly

308
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,770
incorporating a j-card for example with

309
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:58,080
and there's no your eyes or anything

310
00:20:52,770 --> 00:21:01,230
like that the second one is if any of

311
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,830
the content in the RCD claims does have

312
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:09,390
any URLs then you must sign with an

313
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:11,340
integrity claim digest so if anybody's

314
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,789
new to that it's a digest over the

315
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:18,029
content that the urls point to there's a

316
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:21,210
there's a serialization mechanism that

317
00:21:18,029 --> 00:21:23,880
tells you which order to do the URLs and

318
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:28,529
insert the content and to the digest and

319
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:33,000
all that other stuff and the third one

320
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:36,179
is the case where you know you might

321
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,549
have some non-authoritative users

322
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:45,270
signing so you want to use some

323
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:47,519
mechanisms that are built into 80 to 26

324
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:52,649
certificates

325
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:56,940
to essentially say you must use this

326
00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:58,830
integrity digest in signing it so that

327
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,779
you know when the when the call is

328
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,649
initiated and the RCD contents

329
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:09,179
incorporated you know it's tied back to

330
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:16,918
the the JWT constraints that were in put

331
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:19,169
into the into the certificate itself and

332
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:22,830
I guess I forget if I put a must there

333
00:22:19,169 --> 00:22:24,840
but I guess I wouldn't be a must it's if

334
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:31,830
you have that scenario if you have that

335
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:35,330
use case then you use that technique the

336
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:38,189
other big topic any questions on that

337
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:45,480
hopefully I captured it how we discussed

338
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:49,919
it okay the next major topic is we

339
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:53,639
talked about you know for a couple of

340
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:57,799
reasons like compact form and alignment

341
00:22:53,639 --> 00:23:01,918
with other you know just plain old sip

342
00:22:57,799 --> 00:23:10,350
mechanisms of using call info we wanted

343
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:12,359
to create a new call info purpose I

344
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:13,889
think is the verb that I sort of read

345
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:17,460
out of that of j-card

346
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:18,119
so in other words add to the currently

347
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,289
defined

348
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:24,720
I think it's info icon and card which

349
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:26,460
card really means be card in that case

350
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,820
so we wanted to create one that was

351
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:38,220
specific to our CD with a purpose of J

352
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:40,470
card so I submitted that draft you know

353
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,869
there's the basic you know description

354
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,690
of what we're using it for things like

355
00:23:42,869 --> 00:23:48,299
that I also went through and I

356
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:52,590
incorporated I thought maybe it was a

357
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:55,619
good idea to explain you know and maybe

358
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,850
have some normative things around which

359
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:02,689
properties of J card should be

360
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:06,350
used I'm curious what people think about

361
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:11,060
that I'm actually thinking that instead

362
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:13,610
of in this sip core draft it might be

363
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:16,970
good actually to keep that in the stir

364
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:20,060
RCD draft because you know other people

365
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,770
might have other opinions for what you

366
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:24,230
know that the uses of j-card

367
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:27,950
our first sip for other applications or

368
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:29,650
things like that so I was more targeting

369
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,160
you know interoperability where

370
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:35,990
terminals may want to display certain

371
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:38,570
logos in certain ways you know icon

372
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,940
should be certain sizes you know I I

373
00:24:38,570 --> 00:24:42,830
didn't know how far to go there so I'm

374
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,980
just curious if anybody has any feedback

375
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,429
about how far we should go with that you

376
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,780
know is that just gonna be a rat hole or

377
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:53,030
is that something we should do or should

378
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,310
we just do that from a industry

379
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,490
perspective independent of IETF I could

380
00:24:55,310 --> 00:25:00,080
see that as a solution as well sounds

381
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:08,210
like a great opportunity for bike

382
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:12,260
shedding yeah okay so yeah so I sent a

383
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:14,510
message to the SIP core mailing list and

384
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,070
we can discuss it there but I'm thinking

385
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:21,430
like keeping it as simple as possible

386
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:24,830
it's probably the best policy there I

387
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:26,690
also gave some details about compact

388
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:31,030
foreign you know

389
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:36,850
explicitly using this call info J card

390
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:43,149
and then also a display name for the

391
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:47,270
where the name claim that's in our CD

392
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:49,340
and I removed as we discussed the other

393
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:51,889
call info tokens cuz we just wanted to

394
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:58,990
focus on J card and keep it simple there

395
00:25:51,890 --> 00:26:01,250
as well and that's the major changes I

396
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:06,140
don't know if there's any questions or

397
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:10,550
comments about that one thing you know

398
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:12,200
looking deeper into call info call info

399
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:16,668
uses a URI

400
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:20,539
the the parameter right after so there's

401
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:22,100
a question of you know it's probably the

402
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:25,039
case that we want to incorporate this

403
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,908
info like a J card info directly in the

404
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,100
invite somehow and John and I didn't get

405
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:33,799
a chance to talk about it but he

406
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:35,389
mentioned there's some hacks that may be

407
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:38,960
putting in the body or something like

408
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:40,399
that so that John Peterson so everybody

409
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,210
who knows me knows that my favorite

410
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:46,428
thing in life is the data URL and that

411
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:48,260
this is a joke it's like the thing I

412
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:50,840
think is the most architectural sloppy

413
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,460
use of URLs and history of the universe

414
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,439
but there there are lots of ways to

415
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:56,120
actually just encode bodies right that

416
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,899
you can insert them into sip requests

417
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:02,090
and there's a so you get kind of my

418
00:26:59,899 --> 00:27:04,518
media type 4c ID which indicates that

419
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:06,949
you're actually pointing to a body that

420
00:27:04,519 --> 00:27:10,490
exists like elsewhere in the sip message

421
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,309
now I mean all these CID uses require my

422
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:15,470
multi-part and in the past my multi-part

423
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:17,928
support has been a bit spotty and sip

424
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,460
implementations so I mean that that's

425
00:27:17,929 --> 00:27:21,409
not a fantastic solution

426
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,480
I still think did URLs are a worse

427
00:27:21,409 --> 00:27:26,360
solution probably if you had to pick

428
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,279
something based on the way that we have

429
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,080
dealt with these things lately

430
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:32,059
it would be just encoding it in a header

431
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:35,090
writing the entire thing

432
00:27:32,059 --> 00:27:37,820
like you know is it a basic ste 4

433
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,399
parameter that we tack on to call info

434
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,529
itself that contains the entire j card

435
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,989
i'm sure that everyone who's thrilled

436
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:47,059
about the size of identity headers will

437
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,789
be you know very excited to see what

438
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:52,460
that will happen when you have logos and

439
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:56,000
icons like you know being a 64 encoded

440
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:58,070
these things but i mean at the end of

441
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,159
the day you know i think you do have to

442
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,100
bite the bullet on if you are gonna have

443
00:28:01,159 --> 00:28:06,679
these things incorporate large objects

444
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,059
like JPEGs that are like 64 K they're

445
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:10,460
they're going to be in by reference

446
00:28:08,059 --> 00:28:12,408
there's just not right and I think that

447
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:15,320
would be secondary anyways cuz it would

448
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:17,480
be you know the logo property of a VJ

449
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,610
card anyways so let me provide it that

450
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,460
we are not proposing to actually encode

451
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:23,990
those things probably we can have a

452
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,000
profile of J card which we wouldn't

453
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:28,100
specify in this call info document

454
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,200
specified the RCD document right right

455
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:31,850
that would say well here's here's some

456
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,440
kind of minimal representation that gets

457
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,080
you what you want specifies these URLs

458
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,960
that encode that and stick it into a

459
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,149
parameter or header and zip it won't be

460
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,560
too much worse than you know your

461
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:47,270
passports already are right so I mean

462
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,590
that's yeah the other alternatives are

463
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,550
we figure out some way to hack it into

464
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:54,230
that or we stick it on my body you know

465
00:28:52,550 --> 00:29:04,700
we use the data URL we're not we're not

466
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:06,950
using data URL Brian Rosen this is

467
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:10,190
probably not what you want but I'll just

468
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:14,540
make you aware that for emergency call

469
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:17,480
services we created a thing called

470
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,820
additional data which can hold up

471
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,440
currently it's an X card but we want to

472
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,470
make a J card version of that anyway so

473
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:29,530
we would help you do that

474
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:33,530
we do allow direct in the body or URI

475
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:39,879
indirect but that that thing exists if

476
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:39,879
you wanted to use it calling

477
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,709
the other thing is I did I didn't get a

478
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:52,760
chance to ask

479
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:56,840
I see how was online whether that's if

480
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:59,500
that's addressed in EC name or not she

481
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:08,540
wants a comment now or I can ask offline

482
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:14,060
I'd be a little curious there - the

483
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:15,830
other topic so ya know it no further

484
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:17,840
comments on that everybody's sort of

485
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:36,830
happy with us going down that rabbit

486
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:38,689
hole okay the other one is a topic I've

487
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,429
gotten the requests and I've seen it

488
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,460
actually used in the industry where

489
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:47,630
people are putting things like call

490
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:50,240
reason and some other things that are

491
00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:55,010
maybe more specific to the call versus

492
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,990
specific to the caller and you know the

493
00:30:55,010 --> 00:31:00,740
first instinct was uh let's just stuff

494
00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:03,020
it all in our CD but I think we want to

495
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:05,270
sort of purposefully think about you

496
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:10,460
know things that are related to caller

497
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:11,150
versus you know information that's part

498
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,880
of a call

499
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:16,610
I know handing has a call info thing

500
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,750
that's related to like typing the caller

501
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:24,860
and they're you know like what side of

502
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:27,740
the fence is that on so just curious if

503
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:32,600
people have opinions on on that topic to

504
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:35,240
go are you going back to the know I I

505
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,990
have something from the jabber room yep

506
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,650
holla asks what is not addressed in ECM

507
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:44,660
I don't know that was my question - huh

508
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,070
I didn't get a chance to take a look at

509
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:51,140
the draft but the question is are the

510
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,970
are all yeah if I believe it's using

511
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,100
call info and I guess the question is

512
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:56,660
you know are they all externally

513
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:58,730
referenced data

514
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,290
or is there some way that the data has

515
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:06,760
actually been incorporated into the head

516
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:09,250
or not John Peterson again yeah it's um

517
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,570
you know to degree that you seen em like

518
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:13,250
incorporates things like logos like how

519
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,149
does it do it and in particular has the

520
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:19,460
whole structure that like you know the

521
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:21,620
URLs to logos and so on exist in encode

522
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:24,050
it in call it though right I think

523
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:25,370
that's that's the question and this this

524
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,169
is an attempt to look really just look

525
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:28,820
at what the encoding structure should be

526
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:30,170
for this and it would be great if this

527
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:31,790
is a point where we could actually be

528
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:34,340
aligned just on the encoding structure

529
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:35,870
yeah just looking to see if that problem

530
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:39,560
has already been addressed somewhere

531
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:41,179
else then you know or I mean if it's

532
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,070
just using standard calling both and

533
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,390
that's fine too I mean the the thing

534
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,889
Brian was talking about the additional

535
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:48,140
info that actually sounds pretty

536
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,730
promising probably I'll take a look at

537
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,650
that

538
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:54,380
yeah I am really interested in this this

539
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:57,020
question of what call info really means

540
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:58,880
and what j-card really means because aj

541
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:00,980
card is just B card right in V card is a

542
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,920
way that you describe someone's like

543
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:06,620
contact information and related stuff

544
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:08,060
about who a person is and like there

545
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,919
does seem to be a fundamental

546
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:12,860
distinction between like the function of

547
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,250
card and the function of you know things

548
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,229
like reason which are not about who this

549
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,480
entity is this place in that call it's

550
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:21,770
really that's more like caller info at

551
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,510
the end of the day like the stuff that's

552
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:25,970
in card we get into what they call

553
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:28,550
reason is I think it could potentially

554
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,410
be an entirely separate a component of

555
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:31,940
entirely separate data structure there

556
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:33,950
are a couple of other examples of things

557
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:39,550
that work along these lines that I can

558
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:39,550
think of one of them is URLs for

559
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:44,420
interacting outside the call usually

560
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:45,620
post call interaction is the kind of

561
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:46,970
thing that you know I can enterprise

562
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,169
want to be able to deliver to an end

563
00:33:46,970 --> 00:33:50,060
user or so if they could like click a

564
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,880
URL after a call or even if they didn't

565
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:56,960
answer the call and those things aren't

566
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,820
like J card or you know B card they're

567
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,120
something that is specific to who that

568
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:04,580
particular entity is that and and really

569
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,399
what the call was about and that seems

570
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,649
to be the same for call reason so just

571
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,500
architectural II I think both of these

572
00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:12,600
things can fall

573
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,389
in the scope of our CD of rich call data

574
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:17,549
a component of rich call data is who is

575
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:19,290
this joker who is placing this call and

576
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:21,600
all the things that are kind of Jake our

577
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,159
dish will help answer that component of

578
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:24,629
it it just could be there's a need for a

579
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,000
separate data structure I think that it

580
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:29,790
would still be under the RCD rubric but

581
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,659
would cover things like call visa that

582
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:32,940
do to seem to be kind of like

583
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:34,950
architectural a separate we just seem

584
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,649
like weird to hack J card for like call

585
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:39,359
reason right because like it's you J

586
00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:40,830
card is like you know supposed to tell

587
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,270
you who this person is that supposed to

588
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,969
tell you like you know why they're

589
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:48,719
calling it's not I think supposed to be

590
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,310
dynamic that way but you know this if

591
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:53,310
anybody else has any views about whether

592
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,080
kind of B card it should be extensible

593
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:56,489
this is it more dynamic than I think it

594
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,860
is and I'm just gonna miss this over the

595
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:02,339
years or does it make sense to have this

596
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:05,100
kind of separation between what you know

597
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:11,250
who would the caller info and the call

598
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:14,520
info Brian Rosen channeling the Halla

599
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:16,770
in the jabber room the info parameter

600
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,860
delivers plain text metadata but

601
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:21,860
utilizes the data URL scheme of RFC 2396

602
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:36,750
we don't have the same concerns on

603
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:38,040
hacking on genetics I'm just discussing

604
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:40,140
with John was on talking about there

605
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:41,880
with a vCard vCard was designed that all

606
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:43,710
of the data and it was mirja belen other

607
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,660
things it was persistent in savable I

608
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,130
mean this type of information vCard

609
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,470
would break the merge of all semantics

610
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:51,450
of e card so I mean I totally support it

611
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:53,520
being in something separate it it

612
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:55,230
doesn't map to the I mean it'll be a

613
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,600
problem if you try and stuff it right in

614
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:59,280
the car I don't know enough about J card

615
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,920
but presumably those same problems

616
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,980
Nestle's to direct mapping yeah it's

617
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:06,690
just a JSON version the other thing I

618
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:09,240
was going to bring up too is like I can

619
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:10,890
see definitely use cases of you know

620
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,060
especially thinking about the integrity

621
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:16,920
stuff you know the person the person or

622
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,570
the company or whatever it never changes

623
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:21,930
but you know the reason for the call

624
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:24,000
does change and so you may want even

625
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:25,740
separation of the integrity part

626
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,220
as well so we might want to think about

627
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:30,959
that as well yeah I John person again I

628
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,730
think that makes a lot of sense I mean I

629
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,530
think one thing I would be interested in

630
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:36,210
knowing is if anybody thinks we there's

631
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:37,680
anything we can steal for this

632
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:40,770
I guess there's something out there

633
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,390
already that communicates roughly what

634
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:44,910
collinsville means versus what Collard

635
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,140
in pro means that and I'm not sure there

636
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:48,240
would be in the IHF of maybe like

637
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:51,629
outside the ITF is there something in

638
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,430
like some like let's see Typhon like I

639
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:56,670
don't know what it is but like somewhere

640
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:58,259
that someone has actually looked at you

641
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:59,850
know metadata that's associated with the

642
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:03,300
call that's intended to convey things

643
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:05,279
like reason but in an extensible data

644
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,750
structure that we could just incorporate

645
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,830
into this the same way we're just

646
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:08,910
stealing j-card

647
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:11,190
because if not we're gonna have to hack

648
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:13,440
it ourselves that's my plane right and

649
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:15,840
like in reason or intent would be

650
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,670
another phrase intent but like I said

651
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,080
it's it's gonna include things like your

652
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:20,430
URL for post call interaction and

653
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,860
there's gonna be like a bunch of stuff

654
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,350
that we're gonna be able to put into

655
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,120
that and so it has to be something

656
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,319
that's relatively extensible anybody

657
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:37,500
have any ideas CDRs that's not bad

658
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:39,210
well we found yeah John CDRs I mean

659
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:43,710
probably not things that were intended

660
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:47,310
for display to the called party

661
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:48,810
I think that's yeah not URLs for called

662
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:54,690
post call interactions but there might

663
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:56,520
be some things in there like a I know

664
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,080
well if anybody thinks of anything like

665
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:59,790
let us know because otherwise pretty

666
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,380
much we're gonna have to like make

667
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:07,410
something new for this I mean it

668
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:08,670
probably has to be something where you

669
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:13,109
know obviously we want to support a

670
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:15,210
minimum text but then you know it may be

671
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:17,550
an image it may be other things as well

672
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:19,740
so that's probably along the lines of

673
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:26,580
what we want as an extension that can

674
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:29,819
have different definitions of keys with

675
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:35,420
specific purposes and then the media

676
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,420
whether it's text or images or whatever

677
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:42,650
but we don't want to go to like HTML or

678
00:38:39,529 --> 00:38:50,000
anything like that I would assume or

679
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:51,440
maybe we do an okay I think that was all

680
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,299
the topics I wanted to talk about today

681
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:11,569
so thank you okay John I think you're

682
00:38:59,299 --> 00:39:12,470
gonna talk about the Oh be nice oh these

683
00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:13,579
ones are quick too

684
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:15,288
we're actually making good progress

685
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,240
getting through this we're totally not

686
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:18,410
going over we totally don't need an

687
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,250
interim meeting to follow this is

688
00:39:18,410 --> 00:39:23,089
fantastic

689
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:24,829
next next slide this is really just

690
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,150
saying what has transpired with these

691
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,920
two document since they escaped the

692
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,279
working group our benevolent overlord

693
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,920
mr. Roche took a hard look at the divert

694
00:39:31,279 --> 00:39:36,470
and OB documents got some very handy

695
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,730
knits Nobby and some more serious things

696
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:40,339
and did which I'll talk about in a

697
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:41,869
moment but in addition to Adams comments

698
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,640
actually as more people have been

699
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:47,000
looking at a will be and this is kind of

700
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:48,618
like a thing now turns out one piece of

701
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,150
feedback I've gotten loud and clear is

702
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,309
there need to be more text about

703
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,619
mitigation for this call back surface

704
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,299
substitution attack which is detailed in

705
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:58,640
the document now this is a case where an

706
00:39:56,299 --> 00:40:01,309
OB right where you know if the call is

707
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,490
coming in to a target and you want to

708
00:40:01,309 --> 00:40:06,529
try to impersonate a call to a target if

709
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:08,779
you as the attacker have some way

710
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:10,549
predicting that like an enterprise you

711
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:12,440
want to impersonate is already placing a

712
00:40:10,549 --> 00:40:15,319
call to the person that you want to

713
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:17,869
impersonate them to you can like do a

714
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:20,058
race condition against them right and if

715
00:40:17,869 --> 00:40:21,920
your call wins then when the called

716
00:40:20,059 --> 00:40:24,049
parties phone rings they'll go talk to

717
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,519
the CPS where passports restored in the

718
00:40:24,049 --> 00:40:26,779
out-of-band model they'll get this

719
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:28,819
passport that tells them Oh a call

720
00:40:26,779 --> 00:40:30,259
exactly like your looks just like your

721
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:32,329
call is actually in progress at the

722
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:34,970
moment fantastic and so I know that it

723
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:37,240
must be you I think it's an extremely

724
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:40,250
difficult attack - practically

725
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,288
execute the only conditions under which

726
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,599
it seems remotely plausible our callback

727
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:46,279
services these are cases where if you

728
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,750
imagine a big enterprise like American

729
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:49,970
Express or something

730
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:51,710
has a number that you or maybe even a

731
00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:54,049
webpage that you can put in and say hey

732
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,780
you know please call me have an agent

733
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:59,810
call me at the following number and if

734
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:02,540
you you know you're an attacker and you

735
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:04,490
did like 10,000 practice calls and timed

736
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,350
them against a random selection of

737
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:08,089
numbers that you control and got a good

738
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,680
sense of exactly how long it took for

739
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,590
their callback service to like emit a

740
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,960
call maybe then I could predict right

741
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,970
when I'm doing a callback to add them

742
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,980
then I could you know quit Addams number

743
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,890
into America's crisis webpage say call

744
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:24,710
me wait one point three seven seconds

745
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:26,330
launch my call and beat American Express

746
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,830
is called to Adam at just the time

747
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:31,670
American Express provisioned their

748
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:33,410
passport to the CPS so we put in smart

749
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,450
text about mitigation for that there are

750
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,190
a couple of ways to mitigate at the main

751
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:38,750
ones are reducing the window which the

752
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:40,940
passport is actually available in the

753
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:43,640
CPS including potentially putting it in

754
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:46,880
after you place the call the text is sad

755
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,279
for some time you know first you put

756
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,200
your passport in CPS and then you place

757
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,530
your call you can reduce the window on

758
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,089
that side and also the other thing talks

759
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,190
about is doing some kind of post call

760
00:41:56,090 --> 00:42:00,530
coordination and this is based on the

761
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,630
exposure of call state information on

762
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,980
both sides of the call and what this

763
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:07,250
requires really is that the enterprise

764
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,660
if it calls and and the Android phone

765
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:10,160
says hey I'm connected and the

766
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,750
enterprise says I'm not connected I I

767
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,240
got a busy signal or I got sent to

768
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:16,070
voicemail then you know that their

769
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,109
shenanigans it's somebody won the race

770
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,730
condition and if you're super paranoid

771
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:21,620
about this then you can implement things

772
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,660
like that what would be much simpler to

773
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:25,040
implement is a random timer that gives

774
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,629
you about two seconds of leeway and how

775
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,060
long your callback service takes to

776
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:32,120
execute its calls you did that on the

777
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:33,710
enterprise is it you know a hundredth of

778
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:35,390
the expense of implementing any other

779
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:38,270
things that I just described you would

780
00:42:35,390 --> 00:42:39,950
make this attack impossible but that

781
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,620
much said we have some more mitigation

782
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,689
stuff about that in there and we're

783
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:47,450
getting some preliminary data even about

784
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:49,010
how common predictable callback services

785
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:51,080
really are I don't think they're

786
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:54,860
actually very common in my experience

787
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:57,650
most callback services already have 30

788
00:42:54,860 --> 00:43:00,020
seconds worth of like random delay to

789
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,240
them just because of human interactions

790
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,160
and things

791
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,379
but there's some text in there to make

792
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:07,480
those people feel better we also added

793
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,980
some text about discovering a CPS

794
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,540
through provisioning as opposed to

795
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,970
having some kind of service discovery

796
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,130
function because and a lot of the toy

797
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:17,200
implementations of OB that are out there

798
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,700
today they're happening in more closed

799
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:20,649
environments right they're happening

800
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:22,779
these more enterprise environments and

801
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:24,670
as a consequence of that you really can

802
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:27,520
just provision well this is my CPS you

803
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:29,650
don't need to figure out who the CPS is

804
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:31,390
for a caller that you have no pre

805
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:35,290
association with they're doing this in a

806
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:37,029
much more constrained environment so

807
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:38,350
those have been added in addition to the

808
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:43,600
knits that haven't pointed out that I

809
00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:45,670
very much appreciate next slide undid so

810
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:47,500
I fixed the examples I'm Chris yeah just

811
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,080
one quick question so I assume when you

812
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:53,100
mean provision you mean that CPS is

813
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:55,150
protected as well in terms of access or

814
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:57,130
yeah these this would be I mean

815
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,470
effectively in those cases the CPS we

816
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,970
probably authenticate both parties the

817
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,740
person putting it in putting out it's an

818
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:04,359
intranet environment or you can assume

819
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:10,600
that security Association yeah okay

820
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:12,910
thanks so on div I fixed examples we had

821
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,190
some temp examples in there that really

822
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:18,279
need to be repaired they are hopefully

823
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:21,480
now correct they are hot from a actual

824
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:23,800
implementation that hopefully is working

825
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,780
there's a bit more discipline in json

826
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,670
language this is something adam pointed

827
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,310
out that there was really sloppy usages

828
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,380
of like what arrays and values and

829
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:34,240
elements and things like that were so i

830
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:36,340
tried to put in stricter language that

831
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,160
is correct how you're supposed to talk

832
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:40,750
about json and I had am also pointed out

833
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,759
that the language about how many divs

834
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,980
you need per redirection in these cases

835
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,890
where you have kind of multiple baseline

836
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:49,420
divs in a single passport for example I

837
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,089
know Martin's going to talk about our pH

838
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:55,540
if you have one our pH passport one

839
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:58,660
shaken passport that are in the same you

840
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:00,759
know invite you want to make sure that

841
00:44:58,660 --> 00:45:02,770
you don't end up having like exponential

842
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:05,200
multiplication of these if you go

843
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,520
through multiple redirections and so the

844
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,060
language is hopefully clear now that

845
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:12,009
there will be one non div passport for

846
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:14,500
you know each baseline passport without

847
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:15,820
a common origin guest in the message and

848
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,410
maybe a lot to unpack when actually say

849
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,610
it but the language in the draft I think

850
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:19,810
is clear about this and no longer

851
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:22,870
suggests this is an exponential

852
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:24,940
multiplication problem and I think that

853
00:45:22,870 --> 00:45:27,670
resolves the issues that is Adam saw

854
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:29,200
them of the major ones I hope so let me

855
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:31,090
know if there's anything more there I

856
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,830
did also and I don't have this on the

857
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:36,820
slide I know there's been some concern

858
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:39,250
in Addis that because of like attended

859
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:41,800
transfer sorts of use cases we should

860
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:45,460
make the window more generous for

861
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:46,990
passport expiry in these div cases and

862
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:48,760
these are cases where we're using like

863
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:50,410
like third-party call control or

864
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,660
something like that where you know you

865
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:54,430
you put a call in to someone and in

866
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:57,220
you're basically parked talk to me to an

867
00:45:54,430 --> 00:46:00,069
agent then that agent 3pc sees you out

868
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:02,890
to another party but wants to reuse the

869
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:06,160
original passport that you use to call

870
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,569
that agent at the start so there's some

871
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,609
guidance in there now that suggests yeah

872
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:11,890
in these cases if you have a trust

873
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,620
relationship between ultimately the the

874
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:17,920
transfer target and the transferring

875
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:19,990
entity it's probably safe to treat have

876
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,390
a little bit more flexibility about like

877
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:26,439
how old the original passport was that

878
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:29,589
ended it in the color martin dali 18 t

879
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:33,220
well an example of that is in support of

880
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:36,610
9-1-1 for transfer where you know you

881
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:40,569
end up at an agent that agent stays on

882
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:44,140
the call and then forwards the original

883
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:47,920
signing to you the ultimate destination

884
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:50,620
for verification there so there's an

885
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,450
example of some type of relight type

886
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:53,890
function sure I mean of course these

887
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,569
problems all go away if you use refer

888
00:46:53,890 --> 00:46:59,500
instead through you see which would be

889
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:01,690
great but here we are and it's 2020 in a

890
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,930
few weeks and we still aren't really

891
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:05,650
using prefer so we were supposed to so

892
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,029
given that that seems to be the

893
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:09,700
situation and there's nothing we can do

894
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:11,680
about it I relaxed that interval and you

895
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:16,919
you can be more generous with kind of

896
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,919
scale passports for that next slide

897
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:24,790
oh yeah I see no slide about this every

898
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,350
time so I did send a note to the list a

899
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:30,910
couple weeks ago talking about whether

900
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:32,319
we should bother to errata 8220 for this

901
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:34,480
issue of whether you need quote marks

902
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,270
around the PPT values in the identity

903
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,700
header parameter this is something that

904
00:47:37,270 --> 00:47:43,060
I'll admit the text in 84 is not

905
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:45,730
particularly helpful and we have baked

906
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:48,130
into however the rph draft and the div

907
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:51,040
draft doing this with quotes around the

908
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:52,870
values for PPT miss has induced me at

909
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:57,430
least to be like let's make it firmly

910
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:59,470
crooked that way and you know I think

911
00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:02,080
that the mailing was traffic about this

912
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:03,879
I got like three responses and it was it

913
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,890
was like two or like yeah I just quote

914
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,290
it and one was like nah don't quote it

915
00:48:05,890 --> 00:48:10,839
anybody else wants to like find that

916
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,300
thread and reply and say like what they

917
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:15,010
want that would be helpful and I would

918
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,540
then be happy to errata this to whatever

919
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:17,770
people want but I really didn't feel

920
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:21,970
like there's enough like consensus

921
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:26,550
around what we should actually do this

922
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:30,399
is Chris I probably can't adequately

923
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:32,290
recall what the comment was but I did

924
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:37,240
get some comments internally that we're

925
00:48:32,290 --> 00:48:41,440
sort of saying the a B and F in 3261

926
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:44,290
don't allow for it quotes I don't know

927
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,710
if David recalls that and maybe can make

928
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:50,500
a better comment than I can but that

929
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:54,010
would be a factor wouldn't it yes it's

930
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:57,100
that true the ABF of 3261 preclude

931
00:48:54,010 --> 00:49:00,240
having parameters and sip be quoted you

932
00:48:57,100 --> 00:49:00,240
did the a be enough Ryan do you remember

933
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:04,750
look it up please I miss Q yeah we've

934
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,580
got a few minutes here so feel free to

935
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,040
look up : as a comment Morgan dojo I

936
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:16,960
mean doesn't this problem go back to you

937
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:19,120
know 44:24 does it I don't know I have

938
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:21,310
the vague memory it does and if it does

939
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:23,380
you you can't break everything that's

940
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:24,040
been done since 2006 like you've got to

941
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:28,390
leave it like it is

942
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:30,970
you mean 4475 was there for support well

943
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:33,640
no baby we're we're not I think really

944
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:35,828
constrained by what people did and 44 74

945
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:37,660
I mean I'm sure it does right I'm sure

946
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,880
that that's exactly why it's this way

947
00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:42,609
because we did something like in 2006

948
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:45,069
and we're we just cloned it for this but

949
00:49:42,609 --> 00:49:48,759
but it means that ever I mean given this

950
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:50,619
replaces not updates that it means like

951
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:52,509
you can't have everybody that's

952
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:54,700
producing those identities with that

953
00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:56,079
hasn't upgraded to the latest I mean you

954
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,549
have to have backwards compatible at

955
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,170
some level with that or you're gonna

956
00:49:57,549 --> 00:50:00,910
break every identity on every these

957
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:03,009
things and it'll be a hundred percent

958
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:04,660
reason why every vendor will go we're

959
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,049
not deploying that because it breaks our

960
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:07,359
stuff

961
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:09,970
yeah the excuse we all need not I know

962
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,038
it all the SBC vendors who will be like

963
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,078
wait I he like was compliant with this

964
00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:17,619
way that identity worked and like PPT

965
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:19,359
well we didn't have PPT and you I mean

966
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:21,130
I'm not sure this is a problem but I

967
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,960
mean if it comes up that everything as

968
00:50:21,130 --> 00:50:25,089
soon as you turn this on I want to as

969
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:26,619
soon as you install one new SPC every

970
00:50:25,089 --> 00:50:28,420
one of my old phones displays the

971
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:30,519
identity of the call is broken with I

972
00:50:28,420 --> 00:50:32,410
mean icon like people will turn it off

973
00:50:30,519 --> 00:50:33,999
I'll tell you this is this is absolutely

974
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:35,440
the number one thing from

975
00:50:33,999 --> 00:50:37,930
interoperability testing there's a

976
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:39,549
problem is that some people are doing it

977
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,868
quoted some people are doing it uncoated

978
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:42,339
and there apparently some

979
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:45,430
implementations it just refused to

980
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:46,930
accept quoted and like you know even

981
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:50,680
though like that's what we wrote into

982
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:53,109
the div and the are pH specs it's like

983
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,720
any examples is like you know everything

984
00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:57,339
in there and so yeah if we're if we're

985
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,618
gonna change this we should change it

986
00:50:57,339 --> 00:51:00,730
now and then fix it in div so that it's

987
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:03,069
not quoted because right now it's

988
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:12,880
crooked right so Brian you have a

989
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:16,869
verdict for us on double quotes are

990
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:22,900
allowed okay oh really well we don't

991
00:51:16,869 --> 00:51:29,920
escape them you know play a parameter a

992
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:36,970
header parameter yeah I think we do too

993
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:39,009
I think we do too okay I mean here's my

994
00:51:36,970 --> 00:51:40,509
real point I think we need some

995
00:51:39,009 --> 00:51:42,400
consensus around this week I know we

996
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:44,200
took a hum about this like last year and

997
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,730
it we all agreed we're going to do this

998
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,950
quoted and then like everybody

999
00:51:46,730 --> 00:51:50,930
keeps freaking out about you know but

1000
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,089
the a B and F that's in it usually for

1001
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:54,649
doesn't like it works that way and like

1002
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,630
if as long as there is an agreement

1003
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:58,790
we're gonna do it quoted well Loretta it

1004
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,670
right but I mean I'm trying I'm trying

1005
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:12,200
to build enough of a consensus that it

1006
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:23,060
is worth doing in errata we have a bunch

1007
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:24,950
of remote people please use the mic so

1008
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:27,259
it does I'm saying that one and half

1009
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:30,140
years back I think we did that hum and

1010
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:33,700
and it you know porn RBI Jake until that

1011
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:36,350
it was not quoted then good code it so

1012
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:39,020
so my inclination would be to errata

1013
00:52:36,350 --> 00:52:40,730
this provided it is not illegal in RFC

1014
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:42,500
3261 say that these things are supposed

1015
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:44,359
to be quoted just because we've already

1016
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:46,910
baked it into our ph which is already

1017
00:52:44,359 --> 00:52:49,790
out right so we'd be arriving that - if

1018
00:52:46,910 --> 00:52:51,560
we're gonna reverse ed and like right

1019
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,820
adam wrote and this is just as an

1020
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,869
individual contributor when i think

1021
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,640
about the way that we want to address

1022
00:52:53,869 --> 00:52:57,020
this and this sort of came up when

1023
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,270
you're talking about the Interop issues

1024
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,580
that people are kind of crete lee

1025
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:03,290
encountering I think we probably want

1026
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:04,910
something a little more complex than we

1027
00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:07,130
could do in just a simple errata

1028
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,899
we might want is a very short document

1029
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,250
that says when you generate these put

1030
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,900
quotes around it when you receive them

1031
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,619
you need to be able to handle both well

1032
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,540
and that's whatever

1033
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:16,850
what's we're advising implementers to do

1034
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:18,290
in the field is that so yes right so

1035
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:19,700
that's what we want people to do then we

1036
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,920
want to formalize that and I think that

1037
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,118
probably goes well beyond the spirit of

1038
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,580
what air water are supposed to represent

1039
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,570
okay okay maybe we can find in

1040
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:31,640
occasionally rappelling for an update

1041
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:35,240
you're calling for like a a one-page

1042
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,100
solid stock so we'll do it again

1043
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,899
provided that nobody's gonna come and

1044
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:41,569
say yeah well but it should be unquote

1045
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:43,910
it then like what's nice about that is

1046
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:45,740
it gives us a lot more we know what the

1047
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:48,170
process is for taking an internet draft

1048
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:50,689
and pushing it out the door and it's

1049
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:52,580
going to make this a lot less ok fiddly

1050
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:54,560
then we did talk about we want Nerada

1051
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:56,660
and then it falls meaning actually

1052
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:58,850
you're entirely correct mr. edge that is

1053
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:00,259
a excellent suggestion that will give

1054
00:53:58,850 --> 00:54:02,150
everyone opportunity to speak now

1055
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:08,530
forever hold your peace and like well

1056
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:08,530
past is a consensus document sold next

1057
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:15,860
guy here Obi is coming soon to tell a

1058
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:17,240
chat near you you know I think we do now

1059
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:19,820
that we have the framework and

1060
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:22,310
architecture pro-v out I suspect there

1061
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:25,700
will be some new documents that are

1062
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:26,900
going to talk about these very specific

1063
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:29,870
use cases in which people want to use

1064
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:31,280
Obi there's the public option I've heard

1065
00:54:29,870 --> 00:54:33,290
a lot of people interested and trying to

1066
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,840
figure out how to do public Obi and

1067
00:54:33,290 --> 00:54:38,210
public Obi is really cool and it could

1068
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:41,030
be meaningful for a number of solutions

1069
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,610
out there in the universe I am NOT going

1070
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:46,430
to do all this work myself especially

1071
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:47,960
not on the public option but if there is

1072
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:50,720
a will to get those things done then I

1073
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:52,970
will certainly pitch in the private

1074
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:54,470
option is the one that I think is more

1075
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:56,359
interesting as kind of what some of

1076
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:57,830
these more enterprises use cases look

1077
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,480
like maybe the enterprise is interacting

1078
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:02,240
with that smartphone app things like

1079
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:03,920
that those I think are because they are

1080
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:07,279
practically starting to appear in the

1081
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,780
field now this is not hypothetical we

1082
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,910
probably do have enough data to

1083
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:12,110
standardize something air about what the

1084
00:55:10,910 --> 00:55:13,879
guidance should be for that use case

1085
00:55:12,110 --> 00:55:15,320
which we did not have when we were

1086
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,970
building this framework and architecture

1087
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,830
so I'd expect we'll probably at least

1088
00:55:16,970 --> 00:55:24,049
see that one coming down the pike

1089
00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:26,390
relatively soon anything else people

1090
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:28,340
want to say about this anymore we should

1091
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,319
be I just have one question where's that

1092
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:33,200
update gonna be processed this doesn't

1093
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:40,160
seem like the right place the updates 82

1094
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:42,290
24 on Adams you want to ad sponsored

1095
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,299
Adam Adam wrote here that's what I was

1096
00:55:42,290 --> 00:55:46,009
going to say is if we think we can get

1097
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:48,590
this out the door by March I'm happy to

1098
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:50,350
go ahead and try to push it forward and

1099
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:53,810
I obviously could hand it off after that

1100
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:55,850
but ideally we'd have it done

1101
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:57,470
you know before I'm gone yeah I mean

1102
00:55:55,850 --> 00:56:00,799
again it's a one page document and then

1103
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:03,700
you know in just coming out so you'll

1104
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:07,580
have it done by the end of the week

1105
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:10,520
thank you you have any more and I think

1106
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:13,259
I do any more slides I think I'm good

1107
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:15,859
okay so it seems like a next step

1108
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:45,990
during the discussion was my point

1109
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:48,060
minutes reflect okay John do you talked

1110
00:56:45,990 --> 00:56:49,410
about divert as well already right it

1111
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,040
was one slide deck that's what I

1112
00:56:49,410 --> 00:57:20,879
remembered

1113
00:56:50,040 --> 00:57:25,500
okay Martin Europe okay the Nina EF

1114
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:31,700
community you know made a request of the

1115
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:36,380
IP n and I for signing of the are pH for

1116
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:40,319
civil 9-1-1 calls for yes I net

1117
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:47,550
similarly to what we did for government

1118
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:58,440
priority services ETS WPS and so next

1119
00:57:47,550 --> 00:58:00,600
slide okay so in the the rigid the first

1120
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:10,980
signing our pH for government priority

1121
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:14,279
services we built upon the twenty 8225

1122
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:20,660
for inclusion of a cryptographically

1123
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:25,800
signed our pH header field their

1124
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:26,670
registry was created so that additional

1125
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:30,570
new

1126
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:34,170
would be easier for Standardization

1127
00:58:30,570 --> 00:58:38,690
within Ayane and so what this document

1128
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:42,590
here is provides new assertions for

1129
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:46,140
emergency services call origination and

1130
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:50,370
emergency services call back and so the

1131
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:53,730
new assertion values are es org for the

1132
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:57,420
emergency services origination and yes

1133
00:58:53,730 --> 00:59:02,040
call back for emergency services call

1134
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:04,590
back we had a conversation at the last

1135
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:08,360
ipn and I'm meeting so the example I

1136
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:11,220
gave it to Mike where you you make

1137
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,600
emergency services call you end up at

1138
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:18,029
emergency service operator but then

1139
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:21,000
needs to transfer you and when they

1140
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:24,000
transfer you it's not a hard transfer

1141
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:28,320
they stay on the call and it's more like

1142
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,680
a conference and so we talked about do

1143
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:35,100
we need new assertion for that and the

1144
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:37,830
answer would be no because the original

1145
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:41,970
signing of the passport would be passed

1146
00:59:37,830 --> 00:59:44,790
along during that transport process okay

1147
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:48,299
and so that's the reason for not

1148
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:55,410
requesting a a 1 for the for the

1149
00:59:48,300 --> 01:00:01,860
transport case next slide and so the

1150
00:59:55,410 --> 01:00:06,450
syntax that we're proposing is for the

1151
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:09,930
orig the orig to Yen calling party

1152
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:16,890
number now here's something where this

1153
01:00:09,930 --> 01:00:20,549
can be either 9-1-1 or you RN service

1154
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:22,589
you were n as in you are NSO s yeah John

1155
01:00:20,550 --> 01:00:23,730
Peterson we need to fix that yeah so

1156
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:25,290
that you can actually have that you're

1157
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:30,360
in in there this is another like short

1158
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:32,460
draft that somebody needs to do not

1159
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,680
necessarily leave talked about this

1160
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,540
rapport yes I'm aware that there there's

1161
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:38,669
a little bit of crufty text and if

1162
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:40,390
you're 24 that seems to imply this can

1163
01:00:38,670 --> 01:00:43,480
really have to be like a safe person

1164
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:45,700
you are basically so yes we will we will

1165
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:47,230
patch something now you're welcome to do

1166
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,019
it in this draft you want to be honest

1167
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:51,369
but I would be fine if somebody wants to

1168
01:00:50,019 --> 01:00:52,899
take some existing draft and just have a

1169
01:00:51,369 --> 01:00:55,599
section there it says by the way this

1170
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,849
updates are C 82 24 to say that it's

1171
01:00:55,599 --> 01:01:02,589
okay to put it like an SOS you are n

1172
01:00:57,849 --> 01:01:06,640
into the you know the desk field I happy

1173
01:01:02,589 --> 01:01:08,529
to help write text for that yeah we

1174
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:10,390
actually a discussion about a related

1175
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:12,509
topic I don't know Morgan if you want to

1176
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:17,019
talk about that now or later the the

1177
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:18,910
fact that you know for cellphones that

1178
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:20,828
don't have SIM cards in them you still

1179
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:24,430
need to support 9-1-1 and there's no

1180
01:01:20,829 --> 01:01:27,670
telephone number associated so what do

1181
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:31,480
you do for orage when there's no

1182
01:01:27,670 --> 01:01:33,690
telephone number and I was wondering is

1183
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:37,539
there something that can represent

1184
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:40,559
unknown like a u RN or something like

1185
01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:43,559
that or should we make something up for

1186
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,559
curious

1187
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:50,859
Brian Rosen you want an ID not just

1188
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:52,359
unknown it doesn't have to be a

1189
01:01:50,859 --> 01:01:54,220
telephone number but there needs to be

1190
01:01:52,359 --> 01:01:56,049
some oh that was that was part of the

1191
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:58,660
that was part of the discussion we had

1192
01:01:56,049 --> 01:02:01,809
an IP n and I Brian that there would be

1193
01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:05,170
there would there would be some thing

1194
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:10,180
that would syntactically mean you know

1195
01:02:05,170 --> 01:02:13,029
it's not that it's anonymous but that

1196
01:02:10,180 --> 01:02:16,868
the originating carrier can't verify the

1197
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:22,869
identity of the origination originator

1198
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:24,009
of the call like so I guess my question

1199
01:02:22,869 --> 01:02:26,019
is do you want something like an mg or

1200
01:02:24,009 --> 01:02:27,400
IMEI that actually is uniquely

1201
01:02:26,019 --> 01:02:29,558
identifiable you just want something it

1202
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:34,960
says like it's okay that I vouch for

1203
01:02:29,559 --> 01:02:37,269
this person I heard Martin say you he

1204
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,799
can't vouch for the person you you you

1205
01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:40,118
can't vouch for the person but you can

1206
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:43,180
vouch for the device which is all you

1207
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:45,430
ever device provide for all that all

1208
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,169
that all the emergency services guys

1209
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:50,078
care about is that two calls at the same

1210
01:02:47,170 --> 01:02:51,819
from the same uninitialized phone have

1211
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,160
the same identifiers okay all they care

1212
01:02:51,819 --> 01:02:56,430
about okay so let's let's take a step

1213
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,009
under what does you know what and what

1214
01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:02,799
why do you think you know it this is not

1215
01:03:00,009 --> 01:03:06,069
your subscriber so you have no knowledge

1216
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:12,009
of their IMEI or any identifiers

1217
01:03:06,069 --> 01:03:13,779
whatsoever GSM network whatever right or

1218
01:03:12,009 --> 01:03:15,039
at CUA network and so there's the low

1219
01:03:13,779 --> 01:03:17,200
level network identifier that they

1220
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:22,299
utilize it's unique in order so that you

1221
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:25,359
can like signal their radio I mean the

1222
01:03:22,299 --> 01:03:26,769
device knows that the service provider

1223
01:03:25,359 --> 01:03:28,598
network doesn't know doesn't know that

1224
01:03:26,769 --> 01:03:30,129
yeah but but I think that's ok right

1225
01:03:28,599 --> 01:03:33,099
we're just saying that you need some

1226
01:03:30,130 --> 01:03:36,069
unique identifier that I guess would

1227
01:03:33,099 --> 01:03:38,049
that be used for call backer it's for

1228
01:03:36,069 --> 01:03:40,599
call origination it's the origination

1229
01:03:38,049 --> 01:03:43,329
only it's just to identify the two calls

1230
01:03:40,599 --> 01:03:44,380
from the same phone or are this from the

1231
01:03:43,329 --> 01:03:46,390
same phone it's all they care about is

1232
01:03:44,380 --> 01:03:48,579
it is that we know that they're from the

1233
01:03:46,390 --> 01:03:52,058
same phone correct you don't know

1234
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:54,609
anything else so in other words if we

1235
01:03:52,059 --> 01:03:57,190
created or just maybe we can reuse some

1236
01:03:54,609 --> 01:04:00,038
existing like you are on right that just

1237
01:03:57,190 --> 01:04:02,440
contains some just just a UID of some

1238
01:04:00,039 --> 01:04:03,700
kind that is gonna be created by the

1239
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:06,549
service providers that would be

1240
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,960
sufficient for this function okay let's

1241
01:04:06,549 --> 01:04:09,250
so let's just figure out what exactly

1242
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:13,109
what that you were in should be I'm sure

1243
01:04:09,250 --> 01:04:13,109
there's something we can reuse for this

1244
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:21,910
so we does so for the callback for the

1245
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:23,829
same phone that is it that then the

1246
01:04:21,910 --> 01:04:27,640
operator will ask that a callback number

1247
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:29,140
no no so basically for callback is you

1248
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,538
make a call but for whatever reason you

1249
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:34,379
get disconnected and so now the

1250
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:36,519
emergency network is calling you back

1251
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:40,269
right okay so like if you dial

1252
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:42,279
nine-one-one and hang up the and then

1253
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:44,859
you actually got to the to the peace app

1254
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:45,970
the peace apps gonna call you back and

1255
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:47,410
that's what we're that's what we

1256
01:04:45,970 --> 01:04:50,259
referring to as a callback here correct

1257
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:53,170
but the I think I agree with what Chris

1258
01:04:50,259 --> 01:04:55,990
mentioned right if I have no phone

1259
01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:58,509
number associated with my device right I

1260
01:04:55,990 --> 01:05:00,569
do not have a subscription then I make

1261
01:04:58,509 --> 01:05:03,640
the call then how do I get the call that

1262
01:05:00,569 --> 01:05:07,058
there's a there's an identifier okay

1263
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:07,910
there's a node and and olive brine speak

1264
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:10,039
to he knows York

1265
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:12,618
extra better than I'd know Brian Rosen

1266
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:14,569
so at least at the moment and I don't

1267
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:15,289
think the carriers are promising

1268
01:05:14,569 --> 01:05:17,599
anything new

1269
01:05:15,289 --> 01:05:20,240
you can't call back in an uninitialized

1270
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,710
advice and I don't think anybody's

1271
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:24,859
asking for that I don't think the

1272
01:05:21,710 --> 01:05:28,430
network can do that right so that isn't

1273
01:05:24,859 --> 01:05:36,339
it doesn't matter you can't call it back

1274
01:05:28,430 --> 01:05:42,950
back okay and that is it thank you

1275
01:05:36,339 --> 01:05:48,020
so is this a document that people want

1276
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:50,058
to adopt and obviously we'll take it to

1277
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:53,059
the list regardless of the answer in

1278
01:05:50,059 --> 01:05:55,640
this room but go ahead yeah John

1279
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:57,589
Peterson yes I I think it is and you

1280
01:05:55,640 --> 01:05:58,879
know my only question about it is we've

1281
01:05:57,589 --> 01:05:59,990
talked about a couple of other things it

1282
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,240
sounds like it might be useful to

1283
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:04,250
specify along with this do we kind of

1284
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:06,439
need a stir or working group document

1285
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:08,809
that is how did you serve from refuse to

1286
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:10,730
services that contains this and that

1287
01:06:08,809 --> 01:06:12,799
stuff every all the different you are n

1288
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,029
stuck we need to do and like is it just

1289
01:06:12,799 --> 01:06:15,890
seems like there's a bucket of stuff

1290
01:06:14,029 --> 01:06:18,470
that needs to be done or do you just

1291
01:06:15,890 --> 01:06:20,629
want to kind of do this alone and have

1292
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:23,379
another document that is gonna specify

1293
01:06:20,630 --> 01:06:25,279
okay here's where you are an SOS lives

1294
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:27,049
inequity how that should work with tast

1295
01:06:25,279 --> 01:06:28,250
and things like that especially the

1296
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:29,990
question for Martin in terms of just how

1297
01:06:28,250 --> 01:06:32,569
you want to organize those I think

1298
01:06:29,990 --> 01:06:35,029
there's a follow-up question which is

1299
01:06:32,569 --> 01:06:40,000
are there other places that the you are

1300
01:06:35,029 --> 01:06:42,200
n SOS would appear than just a passport

1301
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:43,640
yeah so that it exists in their

1302
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:48,288
specification already for how to use

1303
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:50,538
your an SOS in like base one yeah so the

1304
01:06:48,289 --> 01:06:53,029
point is this is just specifying what

1305
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:54,710
the procedure like there may be unique a

1306
01:06:53,029 --> 01:06:57,680
s and BS procedures that are associated

1307
01:06:54,710 --> 01:07:00,170
with receiving a call for you RN as

1308
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,669
what's right and like I mean I had to

1309
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:04,339
write him forgive I had to write him 400

1310
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:06,200
be like and I wouldn't be surprised if

1311
01:07:04,339 --> 01:07:07,279
there wasn't something unique about the

1312
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,720
way this was supposed to work

1313
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:10,069
and some of the things we've just been

1314
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,259
talking about suggesting you know

1315
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:14,119
probably is so I guess my question is do

1316
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:16,369
we want a more kind of general document

1317
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:17,990
that talks about how we're gonna deal

1318
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:20,390
with emergency services situations and

1319
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,500
stir you know or to kind of just want to

1320
01:07:20,390 --> 01:07:23,720
do this tactically

1321
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:25,430
soon that that then some other not gonna

1322
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,259
reference this where it actually

1323
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:30,799
describes more of like how you do

1324
01:07:27,260 --> 01:07:33,770
Emergency Services overall Briar Rose

1325
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:36,680
just to be clear the urine typically is

1326
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:38,150
not in to it's typically in well doesn't

1327
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:40,790
matter what's in to what matters it's in

1328
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:49,070
the request URI that's where it is the

1329
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:53,900
request you've got just one more thing

1330
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:56,420
to note and so it doesn't come look like

1331
01:07:53,900 --> 01:08:02,390
it's going to come serious seriously in

1332
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:05,720
serial form the other namespaces in our

1333
01:08:02,390 --> 01:08:08,960
in the our pH name one is for I think

1334
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:11,209
there's there's there's two defined for

1335
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,310
mission critical push-to-talk which is

1336
01:08:11,210 --> 01:08:19,759
the responder so in the US that would be

1337
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:24,559
for firstnet and I've been trying to

1338
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:27,560
reach out to see if they would want you

1339
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:30,410
know signing of our pH for their calls

1340
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:33,319
and I haven't gotten a positive answer

1341
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:39,460
and the examples there would be there's

1342
01:08:33,319 --> 01:08:44,750
a Katrina event and someone is calling

1343
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:47,750
from the event to Washington to FEMA as

1344
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:50,359
an example now they may also be against

1345
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:52,399
WPS user which would likely be the

1346
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:54,620
signing that could occur but they may

1347
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,799
they don't necessarily have to be and

1348
01:08:54,620 --> 01:09:00,229
and therefore you know what do they want

1349
01:08:57,799 --> 01:09:04,040
priority handling for those calls that

1350
01:09:00,229 --> 01:09:06,349
Brian Rosen I know being involved with

1351
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:09,200
this particular set of folks involved in

1352
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:12,560
firstnet and they don't have a clue and

1353
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:14,720
and in your inclination here is 100%

1354
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:16,759
correct of course they want to have this

1355
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,350
yes we're going to have to do this

1356
01:09:16,759 --> 01:09:20,630
probably also going to have to do the

1357
01:09:18,350 --> 01:09:23,529
DoD one and and the other and there's a

1358
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,529
whole set for DoD

1359
01:09:26,689 --> 01:09:31,769
yeah there's a there's a meeting in

1360
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:34,560
January with mitre and I'm gonna be

1361
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,670
talking on 5g security and I'll bring

1362
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:40,470
that up there

1363
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:45,180
to see what they say so my intuition is

1364
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:47,130
that this could go first and all that

1365
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:50,820
other stuff needs to be sorted out and

1366
01:09:47,130 --> 01:09:54,120
can come later just to not to get the

1367
01:09:50,819 --> 01:10:00,480
parts we know we're stable done because

1368
01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:03,320
does anyone see it differently okay

1369
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,370
thank you thank you appreciate the time

1370
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:10,759
all right we're at the any other

1371
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:10,760
business part of the agenda is there any

1372
01:10:12,020 --> 01:10:18,600
okay so two decisions were that we're

1373
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:21,030
going to have a working group last call

1374
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:24,300
on delegated certs after the new year

1375
01:10:21,030 --> 01:10:27,259
and we're gonna have a call for adoption

1376
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:29,940
of the document that Martin just briefed

1377
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,580
all right I'll say one more thing to

1378
01:10:29,940 --> 01:10:34,950
John Pearson which is like now that

1379
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:37,350
delegation and OB are wrapping up in

1380
01:10:34,950 --> 01:10:38,639
addition doing future OB stuff one thing

1381
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:40,230
that I am hearing more about in the

1382
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:41,760
industry that I think field probably

1383
01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:44,370
does need to come back as connective

1384
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,220
identity actually this is something that

1385
01:10:44,370 --> 01:10:49,650
we floated an initial draft about like a

1386
01:10:47,220 --> 01:10:51,780
year or so ago but hasn't been on the

1387
01:10:49,650 --> 01:10:53,129
front burner but these are all the use

1388
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:54,719
cases where you want to try to figure

1389
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:57,120
out when you're placing a call who

1390
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:59,100
you've actually reached and to be able

1391
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,040
to use stir in the backwards direction

1392
01:10:59,100 --> 01:11:03,480
rather than the forwards direction there

1393
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:07,230
are a couple of variations on this

1394
01:11:03,480 --> 01:11:09,179
including doing pre call star checks of

1395
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:11,250
various kinds if you have a telephone

1396
01:11:09,180 --> 01:11:13,680
number that you know you're about to

1397
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:15,750
call that you can see in a UI actually

1398
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,460
be able to see like RCD data associated

1399
01:11:15,750 --> 01:11:19,140
with who it is you're calling before you

1400
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:23,190
press call and to know that it's secure

1401
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:25,470
things like that this this is something

1402
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:27,299
that is already hinted at in the

1403
01:11:25,470 --> 01:11:30,330
connected identity draft that was

1404
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:32,970
submitted like a year or so ago this is

1405
01:11:30,330 --> 01:11:34,890
something that I'm hearing some more

1406
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:35,500
pressure from in the marketplace so that

1407
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:42,010
will

1408
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:44,340
they come back next time thank you have

1409
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:44,340
a good week
