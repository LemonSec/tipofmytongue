you know if I want to open I would like

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,810
to do you know like different types

6
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:19,770
that's what I want to do yeah so do you

7
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:23,310
know how to do that yeah but how do you

8
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:28,350
write I mean I would like to open each

9
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,149
slide to another tab but I don't want to

10
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:41,639
waste my time on

11
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:46,140
oh you open manually all the slide you

12
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:59,340
don't have the right click and yeah

13
00:01:46,140 --> 00:02:02,009
that's a yeah okay that's the tree yeah

14
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:12,590
yeah that I think I can do switch

15
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:12,590
exactly again so what time is it

16
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:47,420
good evening everyone I think if you're

17
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,500
not expecting to attend the 8th session

18
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,500
then you're in the wrong room

19
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,830
I'm wondering if people on emetic who

20
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,829
can hear me

21
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:21,810
so please note that there is a note well

22
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,980
that applies to the meeting I think you

23
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:32,180
you know that not well very well

24
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:36,358
otherwise just read it very quickly so

25
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,629
starting the agenda I'm going to ask for

26
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:47,099
who who can be who can play the role as

27
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:52,079
a minute taker it sounds the mic doesn't

28
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:55,219
work who could be the minute taker

29
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,219
[Music]

30
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:12,589
no minute taker who could be the job of

31
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,590
scribe who volunteers for

32
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:42,260
do we have a volunteer 4-minute taker

33
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:45,170
and job scribe okay so thank you for

34
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,349
Jessica Chavez crab so we need a minute

35
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,350
taker

36
00:04:51,970 --> 00:05:07,030
no volunteers okay okay so is there a

37

to help

39
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,480
[Music]

40
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,990
so no one is willing to help for the

41
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:42,860
flaminia ticker that would be appreciate

42
00:05:50,970 --> 00:06:22,750
we're looking for a minute thicker okay

43
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:27,280
so let's start this flame is the latest

44
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:30,520

so we got jabber

50
00:06:52,060 --> 00:07:03,820
minute ticker here's the blue sheets so

51
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:06,040
please sign and I'm gonna provide

52
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:20,469
some time for a band to provide any

53
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:26,530
comment so the the current draft we have

54
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:34,830
are the key group calm the group Chrome

55
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:34,830
OS core and the MQTT TLS profile I

56
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,410
suggest we start with the group calm

57
00:07:45,669 --> 00:08:08,799
yeah yeah you can or do you want to say

58
00:07:51,710 --> 00:08:08,799
something fresh Jessica as you wish

59
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:26,929
okay so fine Francesca I just want to

60
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:32,328
confirm with the remote participant if

61
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:52,600
they do hear me or hear Francesca hello

62
00:08:32,328 --> 00:09:04,160
hi no I'm telling you any did it is nope

63
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:09,320
nope nope yes thank you so this is an

64
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:15,560
update to the a ski group document a

65
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:18,350
quick recap this document to specify how

66
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,540
to get keys and authorizations to group

67
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:22,940
members to join a group communication

68
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:24,349
scenario this is the general one and

69
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,410
then the profile the application

70
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:29,660
profiles define exactly what group

71
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,750
communication protocol and security

72
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:35,529
protocol are used and so this is

73
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:38,089
structure with the first phase that is

74
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:41,180
defined in ACE with the transition

75
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:43,850
request response and token post and then

76
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:47,029
there is additional steps which are

77
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:52,670
joining request response group rekeying

78
00:09:47,029 --> 00:09:55,540
and secure group communication that are

79
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,540
also defined here

80
00:09:55,710 --> 00:10:05,279
so Version three has it's been updated

81
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,870
following reviews of version two so

82
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,380
thank you very much Ludwig and Daniel

83
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:14,190
for providing those reviews these were

84
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,010
addressed in the mailing list and we

85
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:19,680
agreed mostly with with the comments we

86
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:21,630
had and we have incorporated them please

87
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,609
get back to us if you're not satisfied

88
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:25,050
with our answer we haven't heard

89
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,270
anything yet so we assume that

90
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:32,569
everything is fine also at IDF 105 there

91
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:36,089
was some discussion and offline chat

92
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:39,660
brought mostly from Carsten and Jim that

93
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,850
suggested that we Resta fie our

94
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,270
[Music]

95
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,630
interface so instead of relying on type

96
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,800
of request and response that we create a

97
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:51,779
restful interface at the key

98
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,599
distribution center and this is the

99
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:57,029
major difference in this document also

100
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,820
we did what I think our major

101
00:10:57,029 --> 00:11:02,310
improvement on up in Appendix A which

102
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,140
specify requirements of the application

103
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,949
profiles that have to build on this

104
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:11,730
document we also got a new review from

105
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:14,190
Jim of version 3 we already discussed

106
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,500
this review with Jim offline and we

107
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:18,270
agreed on a way forward there is no

108
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,130
major problems with it and also

109
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,470
yesterday we got the review from Peter

110
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:24,900
so thank you very much we haven't had

111
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:27,720
time to look at this review comments but

112
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:29,670
we quickly scan through I don't see any

113
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,660
major issue with it I don't know if

114
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:38,089
Peters online but if he is anything that

115
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:43,430
anything is worth discussing now please

116
00:11:38,089 --> 00:11:48,320
come and comment it so we can do that

117
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:51,420
but yeah some so about the major update

118
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,800
Resta fication so now we we define an

119
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:58,709
interface at the key distribution center

120
00:11:52,800 --> 00:12:03,089
of different resources so we have the

121
00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:07,680
some number of resources under these ace

122
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:09,329
group /g ID g ID is the group identifier

123
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,988
and we assume that it

124
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:15,779
key distribution center maintains one

125
00:12:12,989 --> 00:12:18,600
resource per security group and this

126
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:22,079
resource supports get and post meta

127
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,989
method get would get the group key

128
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,609
material post would allow a node to post

129
00:12:24,989 --> 00:12:29,670
its own public key to the key

130
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:31,649
distribution center and the response

131
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,488
will return the group key material and

132
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:39,089
all the public keys of the nodes other

133
00:12:34,489 --> 00:12:42,569
resources are public key that is under

134
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:44,819
the group ID that will allow a node to

135
00:12:42,569 --> 00:12:47,248
get all the public keys of the nodes in

136
00:12:44,819 --> 00:12:50,969
the group or request certain number of

137
00:12:47,249 --> 00:12:53,360
public keys thanks to the nodes

138
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,579
identifiers then we have policies

139
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,920
getting the group policies how these are

140
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:01,229
the finest application profile dependent

141
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,889
then there is something called context

142
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:07,410
number or CTX num that allows to get a

143
00:13:04,889 --> 00:13:10,199
version of group key material this this

144
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:13,350
number is incremented by one every time

145
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:17,459
the group is Rashid and then there is

146
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:21,419
the node resource or endpoint that

147
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:24,559
supports get and post methods a member

148
00:13:21,419 --> 00:13:26,399
would do a get to these resource to get

149
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,249
individual key materials to protect

150
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:33,360
outgoing messages or it would go at post

151
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:35,869
to request to leave the group and I see

152
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,879
Carsten has a comment

153
00:13:35,869 --> 00:13:42,389
yeah custom moment there are three pairs

154
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:47,489
of getting post there and I think the

155
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:49,730
first and the third are idiomatic I can

156
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:53,879
barely hear you could you speak a bit

157
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:56,459
okay there are three pairs of given post

158
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,649
there and and I think the first and the

159
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:03,118
third idiomatic

160
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:06,569
the second really is one of those cases

161
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:10,369
where we designed fetch for yeah and so

162
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:18,360
we got this comment from Jim as well and

163
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:20,429
actually let's go to that slide they

164
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,190
have it yeah that's the that's a fourth

165
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:24,720
point using post or a public key

166
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:29,340
of note seems like the wrong method

167
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,040
James suggested fetch we didn't go with

168
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:35,010
fetch because that is optional

169
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,990
like in co-op it's not mandatory to to

170
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:41,700
have like you can have monetary to have

171
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:44,100
post either exactly the same status okay

172
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:47,880
I thought that would if you implement

173
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:52,040
co-op according to specification you

174
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:54,540
have to have post is that not the case

175
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:58,140
can I just defines the number of methods

176
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:07,439
and which of these you actually provide

177
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:12,750
as a server that's up to you okay Klaus

178
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,940
close yeah I just assumed that like the

179
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:18,480
beta base co-op implementation would not

180
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,900
necessarily have fetch because it came

181
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,300
later and you know it's not us yes so so

182
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:25,980
that's why we there is little point to

183
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,530
add something to co-op and and then

184
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,070
continue using the workarounds that were

185
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:34,980
necessary five years ago so I think we

186
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:37,500
should just assume it's clear and I mean

187
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,380
it's not not the amount of code you have

188
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:45,650
to write for supporting this is kind of

189
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:51,810
very small okay so okay we will add that

190
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:56,189
thank you for that yeah so this is what

191
00:15:51,810 --> 00:16:00,119
we did so far and then we got we defined

192
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:04,800
the operations that by specifying what

193
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:07,320
endpoint to contact so we said for doing

194
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,859
a joining of a group you do this request

195
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,740
for doing retrieval of updated key

196
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:16,890
material or new key material or public

197
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,950
keys or group policies or in key

198
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:26,189
material version etc we define what

199
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:30,350
method on which resource so we have we

200
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,270
have planned the update of version four

201
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:35,970
following genes review so the main

202
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:37,020
difference is that instead of having

203
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:41,970
this node

204
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:44,520
path we will now have one node resource

205
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,970
per member of the node per member of the

206
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,069
group

207
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,480
so before we had just a node path there

208
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:50,700
would be the same for all the members

209
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,270
and now we're gonna have a different one

210
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,270
for each member

211
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:05,130
so instead of using get to get the KDC

212
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,740
to produce and return the individual key

213
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:11,819
material james's that suggested we use

214
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:14,160
foot and we use get instead to get the

215
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,459
group key material plus individual key

216
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:21,660
material that would allow also to

217
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:24,360
observe that resource and finally

218
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:27,660
instead of post to leave the group Jim

219
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,540
suggested delete so we thought these

220
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:32,190
were all very good ideas and unless

221
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:37,590
objections we'll go ahead and do this

222
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:40,470
change just to have a sense of the room

223
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:46,050
is there anyone disagreeing with us or

224
00:17:40,470 --> 00:17:49,110
having any comment with that do do

225
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:54,629
people have a clear opinion or people

226
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:57,899
are fine either way I guess that we will

227
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:59,460
do the update and see if it's gonna be

228
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:06,090
easier to understand once the update is

229
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:11,030
done and then following that we will

230
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:13,740
have to do some update to the operations

231
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:19,889
yeah this is all covered by the previous

232
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:22,320
slide as well so there is also some

233
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:27,990
minor or other comments following Jim's

234
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,450
review so the first one was if the

235
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:32,610
client contacts the KDC endpoints not on

236
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,770
the secure channel it gets an error for

237
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,110
one and authorized and Jim was

238
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:39,629
suggesting that we include the AAS

239
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:42,389
creation hints so the response to the

240
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:47,610
token post in the errors payload we

241
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:50,940
thought that's a good idea so second

242
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:57,320
point is because of the change of three

243
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:57,320
source from node to the to the node name

244
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,680
every node will need this node name even

245
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,160
if this node is just monitoring it's not

246
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:10,560
gonna send any message so it does not

247
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,940
need an identifiers for the group but it

248
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:20,820
does need some type of identifier for or

249
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:25,680
name for this another comment was about

250
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:28,800
sending the array of certificate instead

251
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:30,540
of the UI of key repository refine with

252
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,090
that and then the usual

253
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:36,780
finally the using fetch instead of post

254
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:40,379
so we go ahead and do that and also we

255
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:45,379
got the comments from Peter that we will

256
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:49,790
add but we didn't see anything major yet

257
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:52,050
so yeah that's it unless there are

258
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:58,200
comments or questions from the jabber

259
00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:07,320
may be any any remote participant has

260
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:11,400
any questions comments okay so I mean

261
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:14,040
I'd like to understand if the I mean if

262
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:16,500
if there are any comments or opinion on

263
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,820
how to move the draft forward any

264
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,340
comments so that we can move faster we

265
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,179
basically just need to do this update

266
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:27,870
now yes

267
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:31,260
well not but there is no I would like to

268
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:33,929
avoid that comments comes you know once

269
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:37,310
so it's it's time to to raise your

270
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,310
opinion if you have any

271
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:56,510
because man gently for implementers it's

272
00:20:51,440 --> 00:21:01,060
quite useful to know whether a draft

273
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:05,540
currently is quicksand quicksand or

274
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:07,280
whether it's ready to implement so I

275
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,450
think at some point we should simply say

276
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,180
okay

277
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:13,280
we are done shifting things around

278
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:17,570
please go ahead implement it and then we

279
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,310
read more feedback so I think personally

280
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,560
that this draft has improved a lot with

281
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:23,090
this update and it's not ready to

282
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:26,300
implement because we want to do this

283
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,459
next update first and once we have

284
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,070
processed these comments for this update

285
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:34,370
and Peter's comments and if you don't

286
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:36,770
get any major objection I think we that

287
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:41,479
would be that will be it and possibly

288
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:44,780
before next idea so I would propose that

289
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,920
we actually in the front matter of the

290
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:53,300
draft at some point say hey this is an

291
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:55,280
implementation draft so we ask people to

292
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,129
implement it because we are done making

293
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,170
changes on our own and we know would

294
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:04,700
like to make only changes that are based

295
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:08,180
on feedback from implementers yeah that

296
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,220
should be a standard procedure because I

297
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:13,070
think when people implement this they

298
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:15,440
will find other interesting but they

299
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,389
won't when they think it's moving we

300
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:22,040
usually do state that when we post the

301
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,740
update on the mailing list but yeah yeah

302
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:27,440
but I think it really put into the draft

303
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:37,190
right after the abstract in the note

304
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:40,250
section sure so do you have any do you

305
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:49,670
want to implement that as soon as it's

306
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:53,510
ready or yes okay Jim shot from the

307
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:57,530
jabber I think a minimum of two drafts I

308
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:59,210
think he need means draft versions are

309
00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:00,020
going to be needed before it is

310
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:05,360
considered too

311
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:08,300
be stable so update four and five I

312
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,120
would interpret it that okay if you get

313
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:13,960
comments on version 4 and we feel like

314
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:17,570
we have enough comments sure

315
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:24,140
so version for tomorrow and five the day

316
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:28,490
after okay any additional comments so

317
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:46,010
maybe Jim can you explain why we need a

318
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:48,590
version 5 so Jimmy's coming based upon

319
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:51,440
how fast things have been going in the

320
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:55,129
past and the fact that we're basically

321
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:57,650
major architectural changes I won't be

322
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:59,960
surprised if the next version 4 is going

323
00:23:57,650 --> 00:24:02,330
to have to have some fairly major

324
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,100
updates in version 5 before things are

325
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:10,639
finished okay okay fair enough

326
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:16,159
and so version 4 when could we expect to

327
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:21,170
have that version 4 is that I mean a

328
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:24,140
month maybe a month maybe two no there

329
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:29,150
is Christmas in between you ain't right

330
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:29,900
it on the plane okay so December that's

331
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:38,650
what I'm hearing

332
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:45,970
yeah sure or generate okay perfect so

333
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:45,970
next issue is that slide

334
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:56,310
so I guess this is my chance to point

335
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:59,110
out that Jim had tried to ask a question

336
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:00,429
to prompt me about the things I was

337
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,889
supposed to be talking about at the

338
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:07,150
start when I was still getting in a

339
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:09,790
little flustered so Jim wanted to ask

340
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:12,190
when the reviews are gonna happen

341
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:13,389
reviews gonna happen for the two drafts

342
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:16,150
that are currently in publication

343
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:20,830
requested the profiles for DTLS - no

344
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,570
scar so I had sort of been playing those

345
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:24,580
unhold a little bit while we were

346
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,620
working through the comments on the the

347
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:28,750
core framework which is in very good

348
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,000
shape I think Ludwig and I were syncing

349
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,300
up earlier today and we have like four

350
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,820
points left that needed a few tweaks so

351
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:40,750
it's pretty solid and we're unlikely to

352
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:43,419
need more changes to the framework that

353
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:48,310
will require cascading changes into the

354
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,590
profiles so I should unhold if you will

355
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:53,260
the two frameworks they're waiting

356
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:57,100
review and so I'll select those back

357
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:59,500
into my review queue I think I've got

358
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,860
two drafts from second vent then I need

359
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:06,700
to look at first and then these the two

360
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:09,969
profiles will be after that in my ad

361
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:12,460
review queue the week when I get back

362
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,260
from here is mostly booked already

363
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,150
I've had people pestering me about

364
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:20,260
resolving their discusses or my

365
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:22,810
discusses on their documents but I think

366
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:29,820
the the week or two after that I should

367
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:36,120
have time to get back to this queue so

368
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:39,340
three weeks from now Thank You Ben and

369
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:45,489
when you we appreciated the good review

370
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:48,520
you provide hello this is Marco Tioga

371
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:52,410
from rileys this is another working

372
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:55,590
document and an application profile base

373
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,590
to support

374
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:11,250
just closer yeah okay market order from

375
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:15,420
rice this is an application profile of

376
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:20,010
ace also working document the support

377
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:23,730
group was called communication and it's

378
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:26,250
of course an instance of a scam that's

379
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:29,210
what that was presented before here in

380
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:32,100
particular we describe how client can

381
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,290
join an Oscar group in an authorized way

382
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:36,179
through the respective manager get the

383
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:37,770
key material to participate in your

384
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,170
communication secure with group of score

385
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:42,000
and as a current group member also have

386
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:44,910
further interaction with the group

387
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,100
manager to get latest updated new key

388
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:51,030
material and so on according to this

389
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:53,490
flow chart the were a few points raised

390
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:55,860
at the previous meeting on this draft

391
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:57,780
just quickly not on them we are still at

392
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,070
meeting for the time being three

393
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,600
different alternatives for the join node

394
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,730
to agree with the group manager on the

395
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,939
exit algorithms and related parameters

396
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:13,410
used for signing in the group that we

397
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:15,540
believe can definitely coexist we solved

398
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:18,900
actually the other three open points on

399
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:21,690
how to signal the exact encoding

400
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,640
protocol the keys in a group and how the

401
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:25,080
client can prove up process can prove

402
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,040
the possession of its own private key to

403
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:29,220
the group manager

404
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:30,750
upon joining essentially through a

405
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,780
challenge from the group manager plus

406
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,280
it's a month and we are also now

407
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:38,430
mandating that the group manager

408
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:41,520
preserves the very same sender IDs group

409
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:46,500
members in case it fully Ricky's and the

410
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:49,590
group of course thanks a lot for the

411
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,020
review gave us actually right during the

412
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:56,669
the past meeting that we processed for

413
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:59,160
this update on top of that we introduced

414
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:02,220
also coordinating with SQL comm the

415
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:05,640
concept of group name that now has

416
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:08,370
nothing to do with the oscar group ID

417
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,690
not to mention we were tools previously

418
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,729
use 0

419
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:15,450
by the and so on this is just plain

420
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,769
important identifier that is used to get

421
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:18,720
the access token to present the group

422
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:21,450
manager and then later on to refer to

423
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,820
the group the journalist was just

424
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:26,190
renamed as group membership resource Koz

425
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,019
is not about joining anymore for current

426
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:31,440
group members that's the resource access

427
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:33,059
to to have further more interaction with

428
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,470
with the group manager but that's just a

429
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:36,600
matter of renaming and we are providing

430
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:38,519
an example path for that and then we

431
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,620
have a number of profile specific

432
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,799
qualifications on the behavior and the

433
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,320
duties of the group manager as

434
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,899
responsible for checking compatibility

435
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:51,450
of public keys in the group against the

436
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:53,580
ones provided by the join node upon

437
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:56,429
joining and exact Asians it has to take

438
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,620
upon a new node and not joining the

439
00:29:56,429 --> 00:30:02,190
group or current member leaving the

440
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:06,840
group of course now this is also lying

441
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:09,090
with the rest base product considered in

442
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,970
s click on that Franchesca presented and

443
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:14,158
we reference to that couple of details

444
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:16,620
we were signalling the exact encoding

445
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,629
publication in the group considering

446
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,559
values for the CWT confirmation method

447
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:24,509
registry so we we get rid we got rid of

448
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,629
the old register we were defining and

449
00:30:24,509 --> 00:30:29,429
just reusing an existing one if there

450
00:30:27,629 --> 00:30:31,199
are no objections we are considering to

451
00:30:29,429 --> 00:30:32,970
recommend the size of 8 bytes for the

452
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,460
challenge nuns returned by the group

453
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:37,649
manager they'll be aligned essentially

454
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,559
with a choice and there is now in the

455
00:30:37,649 --> 00:30:43,879
oscar profile and we got the question

456
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,370
from jewish out actually for SQL comm

457
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:51,209
that we think of specifying in profiles

458
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,008
like this one there are cases where the

459
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:54,960
group manager doesn't actually have the

460
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:57,539
opportunity to return announced to the

461
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,129
client for producing a signature for

462
00:30:57,539 --> 00:31:01,889
proof of possession like the case where

463
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:04,769
in the first profile the access token is

464
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:07,289
conveyed you ready handshake itself in

465
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:09,750
that case a challenge can actually be

466
00:31:07,289 --> 00:31:12,210
the TLS exporter of the vehicle session

467
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:17,519
and that's essentially what the nqt

468
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:19,980
profile is also doing during the join

469
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:23,580
request same thing we think recommending

470
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,619
an 8 byte nouns we clarify that

471
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:27,840
signature for possessions computing

472
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:30,600
especially using the very same signing

473
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:34,168
key despite the journey not in the Oscar

474
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:35,879
group and in the joining response when

475
00:31:34,169 --> 00:31:38,999
returning public keys of current group

476
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:42,149
members to the joining node here comes

477
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:43,799
about identifying the exact associated

478
00:31:42,149 --> 00:31:45,719
group members which is something the

479
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,820
Prophet has to define and here we're

480
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,190
defining that that identifier is the

481
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,529
sender ID of that member in the group

482
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:56,629
which is also included into the public

483
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:56,629
itself as value of the key ID field

484
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:02,369
according to the same interface of

485
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,659
course it's possible to ask the the

486
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:06,330
latest key material and we are

487
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:08,369
simplifying that as happening where for

488
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:11,100
instance enough messages are failed to

489
00:32:08,369 --> 00:32:13,320
be a correctly processed or verified or

490
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:15,928
the material the material is expired and

491
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,759
we are also exemplifying the case when a

492
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:19,769
group member can get back to the group

493
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:23,489
manager to ask for new individual key

494
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:25,830
material and in particular we say a new

495
00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:28,799
sender ID and that is especially the

496
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:31,049
case when the sender sequence number of

497
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,119
a group member robz around so in order

498
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,859
to be able to restore from zero it has

499
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,449
to change its own sender key material

500
00:32:34,859 --> 00:32:38,070
and that can be practically at you

501
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:43,109
getting a new sender ID and read

502
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:47,158
arriving it's non center context the

503
00:32:43,109 --> 00:32:50,549
other operation worth noting is possible

504
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:51,960
of course to leave the group this is

505
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,200
just consistent with the current format

506
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,720
of whisky comm in that case across the

507
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,330
group manager frees up the sender ID

508
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:02,789
value of the leaking node and unless the

509
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:05,480
public key of that knot is used in

510
00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:08,100
another group the public is also removed

511
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,049
when it comes about getting public keys

512
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:12,899
of other members either get all of them

513
00:33:10,049 --> 00:33:15,269
with a get or specifying a subset of

514
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:16,649
group members the request in all these

515
00:33:15,269 --> 00:33:18,739
interested in having the public keys

516
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:22,008
again identifying them with respective

517
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:22,009
sender IDs

518
00:33:22,609 --> 00:33:27,499
implementation wise we have numbering

519
00:33:24,989 --> 00:33:31,259
implementation in californium from rice

520
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:33,480
it's aligned with this draft although

521
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,330
for time being we are covering only the

522
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:40,350
joining process full version based

523
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:43,199
on a post request and currently supports

524
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:45,449
as associated transport profile used by

525
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,660
the client both retailers profile and

526
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:50,660
your profile being you

527
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:57,389
Ludwick sites this address isn't correct

528
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:00,379
anymore I transferred the repository to

529
00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:00,380
you yesterday

530
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:08,090
Thanks so of course we'll continue with

531
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:10,259
this consider especially the full

532
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:14,160
restful interface for the group manager

533
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,740
other implementations I'm aware of Peter

534
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,779
van der stock in the court and not sure

535
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:23,489
about the exact status but Jamie is also

536
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:26,070
kind of working of this so as a summary

537
00:34:23,489 --> 00:34:27,449
most of the update is of course has been

538
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,030
of course updating this draft to the

539
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:32,699
latest redesign in SQL defining and

540
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:35,640
details expected from profiles of SQL

541
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,678
come a few open points we have in my not

542
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:41,100
address for the next update which will

543
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,050
be of course about chasing improvements

544
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:49,679
in sto comm continuing implementation

545
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:54,419
and interrupting I'm just so if we use

546
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:58,500
the the exporter I mean what is the size

547
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:01,770
of the exposure the GLS exporter don't

548
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,710
remember my heart because I just expect

549
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:09,300
it to be a little bit longer than a bite

550
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:13,560
yeah okay right and so these are the

551
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:16,020
questions you're raising or I mean is a

552
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,430
right there are no objections for anyone

553
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:23,640
we plan to go like this how does this

554
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:26,180
move it so I'm coming to it after some

555
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,799
time I may need some hand-holding here

556
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:30,480
isn't there an implicit assumption in

557
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,630
the whole design that all the group

558
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:38,370
members use public keys of a certain

559
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:41,250
type or is it like so if one group

560
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,200
member uses public keys of certain curve

561
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:46,230
that the other group member doesn't care

562
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,180
about what happens it's up to the group

563
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:49,980
member to the group manager to the side

564
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,930
was a type of public history

565
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,300
and how they're encoded and it's up to

566
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:57,750
joining not to comply with that so the

567
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,339
group member can say that you are not

568
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,900
allowed to join the node because you

569
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:02,820
don't have the public key in the same

570
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:05,190
format as the rest of the group members

571
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:07,619
correct I don't see this documented

572
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,839
anywhere in the draft I think this is a

573
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,150
big big assumption that every group

574
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,130
member then would use the same curve so

575
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,859
even if some of the group members have

576
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:19,680
moved to a curve that is stronger if

577
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:21,690
there is one or few that that use a

578
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,899
weaker curve the rest of the group would

579
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:26,670
be stuck to that maybe it's fine for

580
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:28,160
your use case but at least it should be

581
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,210
documented

582
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:32,578
what's the quincies were announced that

583
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:34,380
the group manager and enforces a check

584
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:35,970
against what the join node tries to

585
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:40,500
provide and what it is expected in the

586
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:43,618
group yeah but like you know curves get

587
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:45,990
updated so how do you now ensure what

588
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:48,089
crypto agility like I want to move to a

589
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:52,819
new curve but I am stuck because all the

590
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:52,820
other group members are are not updating

591
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:17,170
that was it my way yeah that's yeah is

592
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:20,410
that how would you how do you think you

593
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:22,480
is that the problem or how do you plan

594
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,710
to address that we haven't seen like

595
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,690
that so far I think it can be

596
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:27,970
complicated to admit that every group

597
00:37:25,690 --> 00:37:30,190
member can do whatever he wants

598
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:32,049
everyone should be in the same page with

599
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:35,590
final decision the group manager that

600
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:37,510
can in principle change on the run the

601
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:41,970
type of public is enduring calling us on

602
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,970
but everyone has to converge eventually

603
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,560
because the the problem I would see is

604
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,490
that if you have device that are not

605
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:56,470
updated and then all the I mean it's the

606
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:58,930
least you have the one that is imposing

607
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:01,419
the weak security that's that so I think

608
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,549
it's it's fine as long as you document

609
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:06,160
it so just say that the group manager is

610
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:08,950
the one that decides when we move to the

611
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,870
stronger crypto curve for example so

612
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:13,390
those which haven't been updated won't

613
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:14,920
be able to join the group but this is

614
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:21,910
something that still worth at least

615
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:24,700
having in the document agree thanks also

616
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:26,859
provide some recommendations about the

617
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:30,040
node when you I mean when you design a

618
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:33,760
node and you put it so that should avoid

619
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:40,000
this situation that's that right thank

620
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:42,130
you okay so um any comments I'm just

621
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,260
wondering do you have how would you go

622
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:48,240
from the the exporter to the eight bytes

623
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:48,240
do do you have actually a plan for that

624
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:53,110
there's a user's truncate or that's a

625
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:55,510
possibility women we won't talk about

626
00:38:53,110 --> 00:39:00,690
that yet okay that's an instinctive

627
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:06,460
answer to coming from Jim okay so the

628
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:08,920
NIST has a strong recommendation how to

629
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,310
do that do we have a strong

630
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,869
recommendation how to move from some

631
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,369
bytes to eight it's something that

632
00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:18,990
affects the impurity profile as well I

633
00:39:17,369 --> 00:39:20,460
believe because they are doing the same

634
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:27,839
thing in one particular proof of

635
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:29,940
possession okay Jim from the Jabbar the

636
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,759
exporter allows you to set the size for

637
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:38,220
exporting so you can have it fights okay

638
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:46,039
so there is no problem I didn't hear

639
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:46,038
that seems fine so next presenter

640
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,640
MQTT

641
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:18,370
okay yeah great should I start you can

642
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:20,440
start oh I mean I am can you order can

643
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:23,650
you comment the slide or do you ask me

644
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,980
to do I will have to say next slide okay

645
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:30,070
good

646
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:33,130
good morning at least for me so I'll be

647
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,410
presenting the MQTT TLS profile of ace

648
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:41,350
this is Cheatham Cheng from nominate

649
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:43,450
next slide please so after the draft was

650
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:47,130
accepted as a workgroup item in Prague

651
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:50,020
in ITF 104 we pushed two major changes

652
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:51,610
based on Jim's and Daniel's very

653
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:54,610
extensive comments thank you very much

654
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:56,080
for that I highlighted the major changes

655
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:58,420
it's just sampled there have been

656
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:00,880
various different minor changes as well

657
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:05,800
the first version in the first version

658
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,410
zero one we've revised the order of how

659
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:11,350
we present the different versions of

660
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:14,620
MQTT and the solutions we provide

661
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:16,960
through ace we make the MQTT version 5

662
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:19,630
the recommended version and explained

663
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,090
the interactions for MQTT version 3 wine

664
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:24,730
as a reduced set of interactions for

665
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:26,500
backward compatibility we also clarified

666
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:31,060
which endpoints are used between the

667
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:34,180
different entities in version 0 2 again

668
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:36,009
based on Jim's comments we clarified the

669
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:38,440
different methods that the client can

670
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:43,210
use to authenticate and authorize over

671
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:46,090
at Els and MQTT and moved the old set

672
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:49,950
info explanation for token transport

673
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:52,860
from the appendix back to the main text

674
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:57,609
next slide please

675
00:41:52,860 --> 00:42:00,010
so one of the questions that was raised

676
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:02,110
in the reviews was it wasn't clear which

677
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,750
end points and which protocols were used

678
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:06,790
between different entities we clarified

679
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:08,650
that between the client and the broker

680
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:14,410
which is the resource server in our

681
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:18,340
profile we mandate the use of mqtt over

682
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:20,379
a TLS and the communication is published

683
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:24,260
subscribe

684
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:27,440
we also use HTTPS between client and

685
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:28,700
authorization server and HTTPS between

686
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:31,550
the resource server and the

687
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,589
authorization server but we of course

688
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:36,290
accept the possibility of using other

689
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:38,509
protocols in between client and

690
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,369
authorization server and resource server

691
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:41,869
and authorization server including co-op

692
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:43,670
I mean could you see but it was out of

693
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:46,250
scope the description was out of the

694
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:48,140
scope the reason why we went with these

695
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:51,349
choices when we were describing the

696
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:54,529
profile was looking at the MQTT broker

697
00:42:51,349 --> 00:42:57,650
implementations in the practice and

698
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:59,569
noticing that they already support HTTP

699
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:05,270
based back-end communication like the

700
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:08,808
mosquito broker we basically also

701
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:10,730
described the profile with the JSON

702
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:14,540
encoding but of course it makes the

703
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:18,319
ports Ybor and we followed again the

704
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:20,420
same with the tokens JSON web token or C

705
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,420
board web token with proof of possession

706
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:26,540
one thing that needs to be clarified is

707
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:28,849
based on the discussion between high

708
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:33,200
nests I think that was raised whether

709
00:43:28,849 --> 00:43:35,180
the descriptions for pop for jot is at

710
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,520
the same maturity as in this workgroup

711
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:39,230
and whether we have to be making more

712
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,980
clarifications or waiting on other

713
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,809
solutions from other work groups next

714
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,619
slide please

715
00:43:43,809 --> 00:43:50,660
and for the client in a second for a

716
00:43:48,619 --> 00:43:52,970
version version or two the major

717
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:55,359
clarification was on how the client

718
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:58,459
authenticates and authorizes to the

719
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,920
resource server and looking at the

720
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:03,170
different options through TLS and MQTT

721
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:06,559
and and this was a table of course

722
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:08,990
produced by Jim as well we basically

723
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,819
looked at the four options the case

724
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,479
where there is no authentication in

725
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:16,849
either of the layers this represents the

726
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,470
public topics where there is no

727
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:21,200
permission required to publish or

728
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:24,589
subscribe and also it describes the case

729
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,960
we're all set info following the

730
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:32,200
security properties of the core draft

731
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:33,780
indicate the recommended and described

732
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,250
authentication method

733
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:42,750
is in the in the draft is anonymous over

734
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:45,780
TLS and ace authentication in for the

735
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:49,110
client where the client provides the

736
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:53,130
token during connecting to the mqtt

737
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:54,960
server broker we also support the case

738
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,260
where token is not provided and this

739
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,990
triggers AAS discovery for the case

740
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:05,180
where the authentication is done at the

741
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:07,649
TLS layer we basically have the same

742
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:11,430
descriptions based on the DTLS

743
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:14,520
authorized draft where there are our PK

744
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,950
or PS game modes supported in the case

745
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:20,210
of our PK the token must be provided

746
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:24,359
through the outset info before

747
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:26,790
attempting the connection and for the PS

748
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:31,260
K it can be of course provided over the

749
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:33,480
PS k identity when both are used to

750
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:35,190
authenticate the client we say we should

751
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:38,430
this should not be done this is over

752
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:40,860
authenticating the client and we

753
00:45:38,430 --> 00:45:43,350
described it as token in connect would

754
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:48,570
overwrite any permissions during the TLS

755
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:50,940
handshake next slide please

756
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:52,800
for the outside info this was described

757
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,520
in the appendix as a possible solution

758
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,650
if when the authentication is happening

759
00:45:56,520 --> 00:46:04,650
over TLS this follows the similar

760
00:46:00,650 --> 00:46:08,490
descriptions in the DTLS profile where

761
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:08,970
it's the same security properties as

762
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:11,640
well

763
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,859
it's a publish only topic about D broker

764
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:17,640
supports nobody can subscribe to it

765
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:21,900
other than the broker itself and in the

766
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:23,700
cases where this publication this

767
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:26,640
published message is sent with the

768
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:28,980
quality service level higher than 1 the

769
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:31,339
broker may also return a response code

770
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:34,620
not authorized however there is a slight

771
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:37,020
meaning difference here because in MQTT

772
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:38,730
they're not authorized represents that

773
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:41,040
the publish message is not authorized

774
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:43,740
not that the token is not valid so there

775
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:46,560
might be something to consider here to

776
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:47,578
clarify in the draft and the broker

777
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,180
stores and indexes

778
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:52,589
all the tokens and then find the clients

779
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:56,328
during the connection based on this

780
00:46:52,589 --> 00:47:00,299
index next slide please

781
00:46:56,329 --> 00:47:03,180
for the case that we describe and

782
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:06,569
recommend in the draft the

783
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:08,700
authentication during the ACE and MQTT

784
00:47:06,569 --> 00:47:11,849
handshake when the client sends the

785
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,799
first connect message we assume that

786
00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:17,999
they took that there are two ways to do

787
00:47:13,799 --> 00:47:21,680
it the first case where the client

788
00:47:17,999 --> 00:47:26,279
passes the token as well as it's work on

789
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:28,489
tongue challenge to the broker and then

790
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:30,839
using this proof of possession

791
00:47:28,489 --> 00:47:33,809
information the broker validates the

792
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:36,390
client and the second option is a

793
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:38,910
challenge response handshake but where

794
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:41,279
the client passes only the token to the

795
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:44,190
broker and then broker challenges the

796
00:47:41,279 --> 00:47:47,819
client and expects a response that it

797
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:49,650
can validate the proof of possession we

798
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:51,989
described two cases because the first

799
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:55,229
one is the only available one to the

800
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:57,180
Infinity version three one one mqtt

801
00:47:55,229 --> 00:48:00,660
version three one one does not support a

802
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:03,419
challenge response flow but it can be

803
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:05,808
supported in the MQTT version five based

804
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:08,779
on Jim's recommendations we've

805
00:48:05,809 --> 00:48:11,239
considered the challenge to any using to

806
00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:14,819
communicated through the TLS exporter

807
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:16,739
and things but we decided here as was

808
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:18,660
this you know also raised by the

809
00:48:16,739 --> 00:48:20,430
previous presenter whether this

810
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,109
challenge input should be configurable

811
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:22,799
should what lengths should be

812
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:25,529
recommended

813
00:48:22,799 --> 00:48:28,559
I was thinking 16 bytes but maybe it is

814
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:30,509
to come to a group consensus or what we

815
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,619
recommend in terms of challenge sizes

816
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:36,299
and of course we will also need a group

817
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:39,749
input on whether we describe this

818
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:41,160
correctly and what kind of labels we

819
00:48:39,749 --> 00:48:46,169
should be registering for the TLS

820
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:49,140
exporter label the same length issue

821
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:51,989
also is open for the challenge response

822
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:52,910
flow which is the second option next

823
00:48:51,989 --> 00:48:55,380
slide please

824
00:48:52,910 --> 00:48:58,828
for just completeness like I'll describe

825
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:00,930
the case where there is no token but the

826
00:48:58,829 --> 00:49:03,570
method of authentication is a nice

827
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:05,490
in that case the broker will return and

828
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,120
not authorize connection acknowledgment

829
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:12,330
and it will use the user property in

830
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:14,250
MQTT defined - for the broker to provide

831
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:17,690
additional information to the client and

832
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:20,310
AS creation hints and be put in here

833
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:22,200
again this is not possible for MQTT

834
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:24,600
version 3.1 which doesn't allow

835
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:28,200
additional information to be put into

836
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,029
connect so it will be just a disconnect

837
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,689
and not authorized for infinity version

838
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:38,090
three one one next slide please

839
00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:40,500
so at the moment we basically revised

840
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:44,040
extensively the draft based on the

841
00:49:40,500 --> 00:49:46,530
chairs comments and we basically think

842
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,830
that there should be some clarifications

843
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:52,980
needed in the way that you know length

844
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:55,950
of the challenges and the TLS exporter

845
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,720
labels and whether we've explained the

846
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:59,069
different encodings correctly and how

847
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,080
the proof of possession is done I think

848
00:49:59,070 --> 00:50:05,270
that needs it still checked up a bit

849
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:07,770
more and implementation wise there isn't

850
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:09,810
prototype implementation for NPT version

851
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:11,150
three one one but we've started a

852
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:14,070
collaboration with Edinboro University

853
00:50:11,150 --> 00:50:16,230
which is looking at implementing the NPT

854
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:19,670
version 5 version and I think Jim is

855
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:22,770
also working on an implementation a

856
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:25,110
question to the group whether the draft

857
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:27,870
should stay at quantize like this or

858
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:29,760
should it also include the payload

859
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:34,140
encryption for the published message

860
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:37,080
based on the group comb draft so those

861
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:39,200
are all I would like to present today to

862
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,200
you

863
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:52,259
thank you have any recommendation from

864
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:56,370
the room Francesca is coming hi

865
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:58,950
Francesca just first a note about the

866
00:50:56,370 --> 00:51:02,069
fact that the encryption is not exactly

867
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:05,100
in the a ski group calm is in the pub

868
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:08,310
sub profile that is individual document

869
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:12,150
right now yeah it wouldn't even need to

870
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:13,319
use the a ski group calm for that and I

871
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,229
do think

872
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:17,359
yes I think that would be good to have

873
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:21,959
to describe that Oh

874
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:29,209
for mqtt as well so okay yeah I support

875
00:51:21,959 --> 00:51:41,368
that which means we have to wait for the

876
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:45,569
website to be published if we do it if

877
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:48,479
Signum defines that for mqtt referencing

878
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:52,759
the pub side profile then yes that would

879
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:57,899
be you will need to get the pub sub done

880
00:51:52,759 --> 00:51:59,579
Jim from from the jabber says I think

881
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:04,920
that it can be done in a separate draft

882
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:09,749
without any issues yeah and talking

883
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:12,150
about that just um from from me now yes

884
00:52:09,749 --> 00:52:14,669
he can be done in a separate draft it is

885
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:16,739
already in the pub sub it could split

886
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:21,119
out of the pub sub and we did discuss

887
00:52:16,739 --> 00:52:23,699
that before in this working group and

888
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:28,049
the recommendation was let's not take it

889
00:52:23,699 --> 00:52:35,309
out so yeah we're going back and forth

890
00:52:28,049 --> 00:52:42,779
with that but yeah I have a comment on

891
00:52:35,309 --> 00:52:45,150
was like six yes it was right on the

892
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:47,489
right side that proof of possession mode

893
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:50,039
so you returned the challenge and rated

894
00:52:47,489 --> 00:52:55,019
by the broker and you sign or Mac that

895
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:57,420
challenge alone yeah you may consider

896
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:59,549
what we are doing in in the profile I

897
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:02,160
presented before where something similar

898
00:52:59,549 --> 00:53:04,440
happens but what the client signs is

899
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:06,449
actually that challenge concatenated

900
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:09,359
with announced it generates of its own -

901
00:53:06,449 --> 00:53:11,459
oh I see yeah I've considered - a

902
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:14,219
similar option as well I think I'll take

903
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:17,038
a look at it mm-hmm just because it's

904
00:53:14,219 --> 00:53:18,989
better to avoid pushing someone to sign

905
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:22,650
something not including something

906
00:53:18,989 --> 00:53:27,240
generated by a by itself - I understand

907
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:29,339
I say in that case probably it will

908
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:31,200
to whatever is passed through the tls

909
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,880
exporter maybe because it's something

910
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:36,210
that both the client and the broker

911
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,760
knows but yeah that's the way everyone's

912
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:41,940
cryin generated you know it's just fine

913
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:44,040
generated okay the thing is that then

914
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:46,650
you have to include that nouns generated

915
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:49,710
by a client also in the second response

916
00:53:46,650 --> 00:53:53,490
you send to the okay I think that's

917
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:58,770
possible in the o'the data in MQTT I'll

918
00:53:53,490 --> 00:54:03,509
take a look hi this is mode can we go

919
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:05,609
back to the last slide so again

920
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:07,410
pardon me for my lack of knowledge but

921
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:10,109
what's the use case for encrypting the

922
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:13,710
published message would it still be

923
00:54:10,109 --> 00:54:17,180
discoverable after decryption or what

924
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:20,700
what's the use case so the publish

925
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:22,589
message this is basically addressing the

926
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,720
comment where the broker sees everything

927
00:54:22,589 --> 00:54:28,020
that is published as a payload to a

928
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:29,549
topic in that case the only the payload

929
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:31,560
will be encrypted and the published

930
00:54:29,550 --> 00:54:34,080
topics will be visible and only the

931
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,940
clients that are authorized to read what

932
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:40,080
the message is about can read it but

933
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:42,480
they can still discover the topic itself

934
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:45,420
so it won't affect the topic discovery

935
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:47,400
it won't affect the fact that broker

936
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,859
knows it's received messages to that

937
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:52,830
topic but it will affect the brokers

938
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:59,310
ability to read those messages okay

939
00:54:52,830 --> 00:55:01,710
thank you and you had a question in one

940
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:05,940
of your slides which concerns the length

941
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:09,150
of I think it's similar to the previous

942
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:12,240
presenter where I was curious whether as

943
00:55:09,150 --> 00:55:16,980
a group we're recommending a length for

944
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:20,040
challenges and I would like to make sure

945
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:22,349
that the district is basically agrees to

946
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:28,320
whatever is agreed in general in the

947
00:55:22,349 --> 00:55:32,810
group yeah so has a group any feedback

948
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,810
to provide would be helpful

949
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:43,700
Benny's coming to the mic bank a doc we

950
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:45,170
had been Caidic we had a little bit of

951
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,720
discussion of the jabber room and

952
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:51,770
seeming likely that eight bytes is gonna

953
00:55:47,720 --> 00:56:00,020
be the right trade-off here okay thank

954
00:55:51,770 --> 00:56:02,120
you good so Mohit what's the reason for

955
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:05,330
picking eight bytes is it saving some

956
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:08,420
message processing because generally the

957
00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:10,069
trend is to 6 to 16 and above so I'm

958
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:17,120
trying to understand why we are settling

959
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:20,570
with it and I had the same question yeah

960
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:26,089
so the idea is that this is a very time

961
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:28,040
limited challenge and so you get sort of

962
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:30,320
you get you're getting like the channel

963
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:34,509
binding sort of property the attacker

964
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:36,410
would need to guess the exact value so

965
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:37,850
uniqueness as opposed to collision

966
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:42,230
resistance so you don't need the

967
00:56:37,850 --> 00:56:45,529
birthday attack at the birthday paradox

968
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:47,900
attack strength reduction and because

969
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:51,110
we're in a constrained environment you

970
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:52,790
want to save the bytes basically we

971
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:55,880
already have precedent for using like

972
00:56:52,790 --> 00:57:00,620
the eight by authentication tag for CCM

973
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:01,940
and like I'm not super happy about it

974
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:04,160
because I'm used to the the big iron

975
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:07,250
cases very confuse the big novices and

976
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,899
not have to worry about it but given all

977
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:16,010
the president I think the the trade-off

978
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:21,050
is likely to end up at eight bytes so I

979
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:22,940
think that you should cut you should

980
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:28,010
have a security consideration at least

981
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:30,800
on the size and explain because I don't

982
00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,470
see why what we're defining in this

983
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:38,780
working group cannot be used outside of

984
00:57:33,470 --> 00:57:40,790
the constraint device sis so I think

985
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:44,420
that was being commenting in the

986
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:46,779
security considerations another question

987
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,900
I had was whether this should be

988
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,809
described

989
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,999
as length as of the challenge

990
00:57:50,809 --> 00:58:01,430
configurable with a minimum size

991
00:57:52,999 --> 00:58:13,939
recommendation of 8 bytes it sounds

992
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:17,299
better would you want it configurable

993
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:27,470
like on a per broker basis or a per

994
00:58:17,299 --> 00:58:29,329
group or like broker broker basis I was

995
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:32,499
considering that as a per broker basis

996
00:58:29,329 --> 00:58:32,499
suggestion when it is

997
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:42,109
you mean per day for broker deployment

998
00:58:38,779 --> 00:58:45,369
where the broker would basically tell

999
00:58:42,109 --> 00:58:47,660
what input challenge sizes it expects I

1000
00:58:45,369 --> 00:58:49,190
that's what I had in mind when saying it

1001
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:57,710
but you know the main point is to be

1002
00:58:49,190 --> 00:59:00,980
clear about let's go that is perhaps a

1003
00:58:57,710 --> 00:59:02,989
little more flexibility than it's clear

1004
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:05,930
we need but it's also not clearly wrong

1005
00:59:02,989 --> 00:59:17,720
so we can talk about more all right

1006
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:19,660
think about it I guess but can't think

1007
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:22,519
of any immediate attacks but I think

1008
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:24,529
there's no reason to do this flexibility

1009
00:59:22,519 --> 00:59:27,410
if you're happy with it just stick with

1010
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:32,440
it don't see any reason to more than 8

1011
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:35,690
16 32 or con as I said can't think of

1012
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:41,809
something immediately but may cause us

1013
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:43,279
trouble later on ok I prefer to keep it

1014
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:45,529
simple I just want to make sure that

1015
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:50,720
it's future proof basically and it's a

1016
00:59:45,529 --> 00:59:58,009
fits to the protocols that is included

1017
00:59:50,720 --> 01:00:00,830
in the draft ok so I because I'm hearing

1018
00:59:58,009 --> 01:00:07,750
different things so

1019
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:11,600
I I understand that having an 8-bit

1020
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:16,580
8-byte it's not a problem

1021
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:21,980
here is there anyone an understanding

1022
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:25,840
something different so we can keep it

1023
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:25,840
that way that's my understanding

1024
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:35,150
yeah I'm um I don't know if you see the

1025
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:38,840
room but I don't hear anyone saying

1026
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:43,820
otherwise so I guess you can't go with

1027
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:47,000
eight bytes okay do you think you can

1028
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:50,990
provide an update let's say in December

1029
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:54,640
I should be able to yes no problem okay

1030
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:56,109
so my expectation is that this draft

1031
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,270
needs

1032
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:02,230
maximum to more version before the

1033
01:00:59,270 --> 01:01:05,780
working group last goal mm-hmm

1034
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:07,610
when in December and another one in

1035
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:13,180
January because everyone everyone's

1036
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:13,180
gonna review the draft in January so

1037
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:20,319
okay so thank you very much thank you

1038
01:01:18,370 --> 01:01:27,700
[Music]

1039
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:27,700
bye-bye and

1040
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:43,430
so now I sweep I try to keep my computer

1041
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:47,150
open but is always in sleep mode anytime

1042
01:01:43,430 --> 01:02:01,129
I want to look at the agenda so yeah so

1043
01:01:47,150 --> 01:02:03,289
you're gonna do this one so yes first

1044
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:07,069
document that is not a working of

1045
01:02:03,289 --> 01:02:13,999
document of this session the pub/sub

1046
01:02:07,069 --> 01:02:17,299
profile for ace I just wanted to add the

1047
01:02:13,999 --> 01:02:20,390
slide about motivation and a quick recap

1048
01:02:17,299 --> 01:02:22,970
so this document defines how to use ace

1049
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:27,859
to authorize nodes and Parisian keys for

1050
01:02:22,970 --> 01:02:30,169
co-op pub/sub it also defines how to

1051
01:02:27,859 --> 01:02:33,619
protect coops of communication using

1052
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:40,269
those keys and this second part can

1053
01:02:33,619 --> 01:02:43,160
definitely be applied to mqtt as well so

1054
01:02:40,269 --> 01:02:46,508
it was submitted the first time at IDF

1055
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:49,999
98 so it has seen quite a few review

1056
01:02:46,509 --> 01:02:52,700
updates it also got several news it got

1057
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:56,480
positive feedback he got support during

1058
01:02:52,700 --> 01:02:59,180
previous meetings and has been updated

1059
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,960
according to the updates on a ski group

1060
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:01,910
um

1061
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:05,630
look could you make sure you check the

1062
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:11,509
jabber just in case thank you okay

1063
01:03:05,630 --> 01:03:14,739
thanks so there is some related work to

1064
01:03:11,509 --> 01:03:17,809
this document the core co-op pub/sub

1065
01:03:14,739 --> 01:03:21,829
that is an adopted working group

1066
01:03:17,809 --> 01:03:26,599
document and i hope it's gonna be done

1067
01:03:21,829 --> 01:03:33,739
soon and then the mqtt pub/sub that is

1068
01:03:26,599 --> 01:03:37,579
an ace adopted working your document so

1069
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:41,089
I only have this slide the status is the

1070
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:43,790
document is updated version six complies

1071
01:03:41,089 --> 01:03:49,250
with a ski group comm there is a plan up

1072
01:03:43,790 --> 01:03:52,400
data version seven which is keep the key

1073
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:55,550
to the update to comply with a ski group

1074
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:57,740
comm we would like to or I would like to

1075
01:03:55,550 --> 01:04:00,440
clarify and expand on the fact that the

1076
01:03:57,740 --> 01:04:02,299
protection of content applies to MQTT

1077
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:07,670
pub/sub as well as co-op pops up right

1078
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:09,650
now it's not it's possible but maybe

1079
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:12,490
it's not clear enough in the document so

1080
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,690
I would like to clarify that and

1081
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:17,839
possibly improve on encryption and

1082
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:21,230
content protection also if possible to

1083
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:23,900
get reviews from the mqtt authors to

1084
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:29,630
make sure that they satisfies what they

1085
01:04:23,900 --> 01:04:31,550
had in mind and before I do so I would

1086
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:37,940
like to get adoption from this working

1087
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:42,350
group so that we can move forward so

1088
01:04:37,940 --> 01:04:46,490
know it yet again can we go back to the

1089
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:50,750
previous slide so I understand that coop

1090
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:52,310
ops of an mqtt pops up are different or

1091
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:54,620
there is some some details that are

1092
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:56,600
different but architectural II there's a

1093
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:59,810
publisher there is a broker and there is

1094
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:02,060
a there are subscribers so is like I'm

1095
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:05,210
trying to understand okay the difference

1096
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:08,960
between how the keys are used for MQTT

1097
01:05:05,210 --> 01:05:13,460
so and and let me just say something

1098
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:15,680
that yeah I try to express in previous

1099
01:05:13,460 --> 01:05:19,010
meetings but it's good to recap here as

1100
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:22,460
well this draft is basically two parts

1101
01:05:19,010 --> 01:05:27,760
the first part is a profile of coop

1102
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:32,570
pub/sub as MQTT has a profile for MQTT

1103
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:36,050
and the second part is how to use those

1104
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:39,980
keys to protect the content of the

1105
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:42,110
publication and that part is applicable

1106
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:47,330
to both MQTT and pops up because they're

1107
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:49,370
all pub/sub so you can use that and we

1108
01:05:47,330 --> 01:05:51,230
did have discussion before we go back to

1109
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:52,490
should we split it should we not split

1110
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:55,340
it should we keep it together should we

1111
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:57,140
adopt one to both I don't know so we had

1112
01:05:55,340 --> 01:06:00,289
this discussion before

1113
01:05:57,140 --> 01:06:03,529
and the result was yes we want this or

1114
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:06,589
I'm recapping what you know you can find

1115
01:06:03,529 --> 01:06:09,799
in previous meetings good feedback yes

1116
01:06:06,589 --> 01:06:11,808
we support this no do not split it

1117
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:17,900
because this is simple enough to have in

1118
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:20,809
one document so I would be supportive of

1119
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,200
adopting this document and I still had

1120
01:06:20,809 --> 01:06:26,900
one question about the first first part

1121
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:29,299
so you said it's it's a profile of coop

1122
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:33,109
pops out yeah what does that mean

1123
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:37,759
it's profile of phase four pops up so

1124
01:06:33,109 --> 01:06:39,470
it's - so is it a lightweight profile or

1125
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,200
is it defining how to do security for

1126
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:45,769
coop pops up and the original coop pops

1127
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:50,419
up has no security there or is how to do

1128
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:54,140
ace to get keys to pub/sub clients so

1129
01:06:50,420 --> 01:06:56,170
publish and subscribers thank you thank

1130
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:56,170
you

1131
01:06:57,819 --> 01:07:09,259
because moment in the same vein when

1132
01:07:03,650 --> 01:07:14,539
another pub/sub comes up I want to do

1133
01:07:09,259 --> 01:07:17,299
this for MU P what do I have to do the

1134
01:07:14,539 --> 01:07:21,349
second part would apply of this document

1135
01:07:17,299 --> 01:07:22,910
because that is general pops up it's I

1136
01:07:21,349 --> 01:07:25,460
mean if there is a content there is a

1137
01:07:22,910 --> 01:07:30,078
broker publish a subscriber you have

1138
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:32,809
keys you can use that can I use it right

1139
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,210
away or do I need this glue that is in

1140
01:07:32,809 --> 01:07:40,789
the first part can you use it right away

1141
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:46,809
or in the first part now you can use

1142
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:54,079
that right away okay you mean with mqtt

1143
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:57,559
yeah like any pops up so the underlying

1144
01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:01,660
question of course is there are forms of

1145
01:07:57,559 --> 01:08:04,930
pops up they don't have a broker and

1146
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:09,440
well then I guess you would depend on

1147
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:10,799
what is the structure of the pub/sub but

1148
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,620
this is about in

1149
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:15,750
of content you know generally yes you

1150
01:08:13,620 --> 01:08:20,519
can use that yeah that's what I'm aiming

1151
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:23,640
at that the very old part here really is

1152
01:08:20,520 --> 01:08:29,390
the the content interruption so if I'm

1153
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:34,680
using 0 mq with norm which is a

1154
01:08:29,390 --> 01:08:38,060
reasonable way to do pops up I this is

1155
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:40,799
really just multicast groups and and

1156
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,200
some people central the Marty has proven

1157
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:46,319
some other people are receiving from the

1158
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:49,429
multicast group can I go ahead and use

1159
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:49,430
this yeah

1160
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:52,590
[Music]

1161
01:08:55,290 --> 01:09:01,649
seek them from the jabber the name of

1162
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:05,130
that draft is pops up

1163
01:09:01,649 --> 01:09:08,729
something-something will that change if

1164
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:12,120
it also describes stuff applicable to

1165
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:15,839
MQTT she was under the impression that

1166
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:18,660
this or rad the stuff are applicable to

1167
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:21,660
amputee t like the payload encryption

1168
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:26,068
would be described in the mqtt TLS

1169
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:28,710
profile so I'm not sure I got all of

1170
01:09:26,069 --> 01:09:32,400
that but the first part was about the

1171
01:09:28,710 --> 01:09:35,430
name of the draft which at the moment is

1172
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:38,129
coop yes because that was born as a

1173
01:09:35,430 --> 01:09:40,740
profile of coop pops up yes when it

1174
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:43,890
starts now to describe things applicable

1175
01:09:40,740 --> 01:09:45,420
to we can change I didn't think it was

1176
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:47,640
necessary because you know it's just

1177
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:49,560
being updated I was hoping we would get

1178
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:52,319
it adopted so at that point we can also

1179
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:55,260
consider changing the draft name and

1180
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:57,680
then the second part was yes she was

1181
01:09:55,260 --> 01:10:00,300
under the impression that this

1182
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:08,760
description of payload encryption would

1183
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:09,930
go into the MQTT draft so I mean we

1184
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:14,010
discussed it before in a previous

1185
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:18,660
meeting me and her write that this is

1186
01:10:14,010 --> 01:10:22,710
applicable to both like this can be

1187
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:24,510
reused in in MQTT I just put it there

1188
01:10:22,710 --> 01:10:26,489
because I thought that was the

1189
01:10:24,510 --> 01:10:32,760
simplest thing to do to have it in the

1190
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:34,440
same draft but before like I mean this

1191
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,000
is not even adopted working group

1192
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:42,599
document I would like to get it there

1193
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:48,330
before we can we think about how to

1194
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:53,670
reshuffle things around switching to the

1195
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:55,800
gym shop I would like to see a single

1196
01:10:53,670 --> 01:10:58,110
content encryption format for both

1197
01:10:55,800 --> 01:11:01,440
versions and not a different one for

1198
01:10:58,110 --> 01:11:04,860
each yeah but that's that's the idea

1199
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:06,870
I think it's right now the draft is

1200
01:11:04,860 --> 01:11:11,460
written as it only applies to co-op

1201
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:13,620
pub/sub and I plan on clarifying that's

1202
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:18,540
not the case but it's already not the

1203
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:22,580
case and another hat switched back to

1204
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:26,550
Signum she would be fine with that

1205
01:11:22,580 --> 01:11:29,670
having one yes yeah just make sure that

1206
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:38,100
it's somewhere where the MQTT

1207
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:43,890
implementers will find it yes Kirsten

1208
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:47,880
yeah so the question what do we put

1209
01:11:43,890 --> 01:11:50,220
where and when and so on mostly is a

1210
01:11:47,880 --> 01:11:52,860
question of timelines and who gets

1211
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:57,780
normative reference as to what and so on

1212
01:11:52,860 --> 01:12:00,200
so III think that should be solvable the

1213
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:02,880
question really that is not entirely

1214
01:12:00,200 --> 01:12:11,190
clear to me yet maybe that also was

1215
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:13,770
behind Jim's question was is the the

1216
01:12:11,190 --> 01:12:17,219
interface between the second part and

1217
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:19,470
the first part sufficiently well

1218
01:12:17,220 --> 01:12:21,470
understood excuse me is the interface

1219
01:12:19,470 --> 01:12:25,790
between the second and the first part

1220
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:28,410
sufficiently well understood that I

1221
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:31,789
would be able to just go ahead and to my

1222
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:36,590
0 mq profile next week

1223
01:12:31,789 --> 01:12:39,079
I think so if you don't think so please

1224
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:45,619
let me know that means we can improve

1225
01:12:39,079 --> 01:12:58,460
you we simply have to test that that's

1226
01:12:45,619 --> 01:13:05,058
my goal anyway so so I would again asked

1227
01:12:58,460 --> 01:13:05,659
chairs for so as anyone who read the

1228
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:14,480
draft

1229
01:13:05,659 --> 01:13:15,789
I think Francesca as well yeah I think

1230
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:17,959
so

1231
01:13:15,789 --> 01:13:20,329
also several people who are not present

1232
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:24,130
I know for a fact that Gemma has read

1233
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:24,130
the draft that Peter has read the draft

1234
01:13:24,789 --> 01:13:40,480
demo so okay so I think we have who

1235
01:13:35,869 --> 01:13:40,480
would be against a call for adoption

1236
01:13:45,519 --> 01:13:54,429
against yeah I guess a draft being

1237
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:54,429
adopted against adoption

1238
01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:09,080
no no I mean I'm asking if anyone as

1239
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:15,769
anything against this document being

1240
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:17,510
adopted before I start the call so

1241
01:14:15,770 --> 01:14:19,070
basically if you have something against

1242
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,670
this talking being adopted go to the mic

1243
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:32,870
and explain so I guess otherwise mailing

1244
01:14:22,670 --> 01:14:39,140
list anyway okay so my guess is well I

1245
01:14:32,870 --> 01:14:42,080
think there is no need to hum because I

1246
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:45,680
don't see I mean I don't see any purpose

1247
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:47,269
of having a ham here we're gonna provide

1248
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:52,030
we're gonna send that to the mailing

1249
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:56,240
list and so well what I like is that a

1250
01:14:52,030 --> 01:14:58,460
few more people read the draft and who

1251
01:14:56,240 --> 01:15:06,980
would like to commit to review the draft

1252
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:09,670
once adopted okay we got four okay so

1253
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:12,290
Klaus Marco Carson Mohit I think that's

1254
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:17,240
one point is that and anymore please

1255
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:22,430
Signum yeah I don't know she she tears

1256
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:27,530
I'm willing tearing her so we will yes

1257
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:32,600
thank you okay so we will move for the

1258
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:36,620
adoption on the mailing list thank you

1259
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:39,410
and and yeah for now I keep it as one

1260
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:43,940
document and I hope when we have

1261
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:45,740
synchronized with MQTT authors and move

1262
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:49,400
forward with adoption we can really

1263
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:51,050
discuss if if the structure of having

1264
01:15:49,400 --> 01:15:57,019
these two parts in the same document is

1265
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:59,780
fine or not yeah thank you okay so I

1266
01:15:57,020 --> 01:16:02,410
mean I'm probably this week or next week

1267
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:05,950
I'm gonna start the cool adoption and

1268
01:16:02,410 --> 01:16:05,950
we'll see where it is

1269
01:16:15,559 --> 01:16:29,960
let's go profile market Lanka this is

1270
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:31,009
another profile vase but the transport

1271
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:34,039
profile vase

1272
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:36,559
in the original sentence like your score

1273
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:38,719
profile or details profile and this is

1274
01:16:36,559 --> 01:16:42,530
about enabling a client and the resource

1275
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:45,230
server to communicate using Oscar or

1276
01:16:42,530 --> 01:16:47,059
grupo score especially at the previous

1277
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:48,739
meeting we were asked especially to

1278
01:16:47,059 --> 01:16:51,289
clarify the applicability and the need

1279
01:16:48,739 --> 01:16:54,669
for this and to fix a possible

1280
01:16:51,289 --> 01:16:57,650
vulnerability for impersonation attacks

1281
01:16:54,670 --> 01:17:01,010
so why do we need this you have group of

1282
01:16:57,650 --> 01:17:04,190
score for secure communication among

1283
01:17:01,010 --> 01:17:07,340
group members point is how do you

1284
01:17:04,190 --> 01:17:10,250
enforce access control a given group

1285
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:12,980
member access the resources at another

1286
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:16,309
group member in a group and you don't

1287
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:18,919
need to do big things in some simple use

1288
01:17:16,309 --> 01:17:21,380
cases where essentially being authorized

1289
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:23,690
to access a group and get in the group

1290
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:25,550
key material is essentially fine to be

1291
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:28,098
authorized to do anything at any

1292
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:30,500
resource at any group member and you're

1293
01:17:28,099 --> 01:17:32,659
just fine it's not fine

1294
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:34,610
in other use cases with we need

1295
01:17:32,659 --> 01:17:37,098
something more complex and you need to

1296
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:40,389
individually authorize each client to do

1297
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:42,320
particular things at other group members

1298
01:17:40,389 --> 01:17:44,929
essentially you want to distinguish

1299
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:47,440
different clients per different access

1300
01:17:44,929 --> 01:17:49,849
rights they are supposed to have

1301
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:53,030
practical examples that we improved in

1302
01:17:49,849 --> 01:17:55,969
the introduction of the draft first

1303
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:58,159
example thing of a set a group of logs

1304
01:17:55,969 --> 01:18:00,500
and you want some class of clients to be

1305
01:17:58,159 --> 01:18:02,839
able to check the status of locks only

1306
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:05,449
while other clients can be able to check

1307
01:18:02,840 --> 01:18:06,739
the status and also change it so think

1308
01:18:05,449 --> 01:18:09,289
of different kinds of users like

1309
01:18:06,739 --> 01:18:11,509
children or parents or especially you

1310
01:18:09,289 --> 01:18:13,579
want the logs to actually act as servers

1311
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:16,309
only so not to be able to open lock

1312
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:18,530
other logs in the first place a more

1313
01:18:16,309 --> 01:18:21,050
complicated use is really the building

1314
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:24,230
automation was provided but they problem

1315
01:18:21,050 --> 01:18:25,699
from botnet there are bug net

1316
01:18:24,230 --> 01:18:28,280
applications where you may have a class

1317
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:29,150
of clients like light switch that are

1318
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:32,360
supposed to perform

1319
01:18:29,150 --> 01:18:35,389
only low-priority commands while fire

1320
01:18:32,360 --> 01:18:38,049
panels can perform essentially any kind

1321
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:41,600
of emitted commands plus set the system

1322
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:43,810
at the status where only high-level

1323
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:46,580
authorized clients can perform

1324
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:48,890
high-level operations essentially you

1325
01:18:46,580 --> 01:18:51,080
want to enforce the different categories

1326
01:18:48,890 --> 01:18:54,140
of client to do all the things they're

1327
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:55,519
supposed to do so you need fine-grained

1328
01:18:54,140 --> 01:18:59,240
access control that you can in fact

1329
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:02,030
achieve using ace and that being said

1330
01:18:59,240 --> 01:19:05,630
then you have a problem because current

1331
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:07,730
profiles of ACE don't enable a client

1332
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:10,010
and resource server to use group secure

1333
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:13,549
communication even if you consider the

1334
01:19:10,010 --> 01:19:15,380
Oscar profile you go for it a client

1335
01:19:13,550 --> 01:19:17,240
post an access token to a server they

1336
01:19:15,380 --> 01:19:19,610
establish a no score context they can

1337
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:21,889
use Oscar but at the same time they

1338
01:19:19,610 --> 01:19:23,929
cannot legitimately use group or score

1339
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:25,970
as an alternative or at the same time

1340
01:19:23,930 --> 01:19:27,950
they have to stick to the single

1341
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:29,920
protocol indicated by the profile score

1342
01:19:27,950 --> 01:19:32,540
so bottom line you cannot have together

1343
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:35,210
group of score for secure communication

1344
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:38,420
and fine-grained access control and for

1345
01:19:35,210 --> 01:19:42,080
three days and this profile is exactly

1346
01:19:38,420 --> 01:19:44,780
about fill in this gap it builds over

1347
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:47,150
the Oscar profile latest version

1348
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:49,040
essentially admits to communication

1349
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:51,950
protocols in the same profile or score

1350
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:55,640
and group of score assuming both parties

1351
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:57,860
are already in the correct Oscar groups

1352
01:19:55,640 --> 01:19:59,660
so like in the Oscar profile first of

1353
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:01,940
all they establish a pairwise Oscar

1354
01:19:59,660 --> 01:20:06,500
context of course and then the idea is

1355
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:08,389
to first bind the access token not only

1356
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:11,450
to the pairwise context but also the

1357
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:14,120
group context and second to bind the

1358
01:20:11,450 --> 01:20:17,420
pairwise context also to the group

1359
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,920
context so you achieve the same

1360
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:22,040
properties you have from the Oscar

1361
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:24,380
profile plus essentially proof of group

1362
01:20:22,040 --> 01:20:27,080
membership of the client thanks to the

1363
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:30,320
binding between the token and also the

1364
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:32,840
group context how is this achieve

1365
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:34,460
it's about slightly extending the

1366
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:36,320
messages of the Oscar Pro fellows and

1367
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:38,390
essentially and the derivation of the

1368
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:41,120
pairwise context so in the access token

1369
01:20:38,390 --> 01:20:42,340
request the client provides the es

1370
01:20:41,120 --> 01:20:45,550
also the

1371
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:48,270
it uses in the Oscar group the group

1372
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:52,060
identifier and its own public key

1373
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:55,659
together with the signature completed on

1374
01:20:52,060 --> 01:20:57,790
something the slide using its own

1375
01:20:55,659 --> 01:21:01,119
signing key essentially to prove the AES

1376
01:20:57,790 --> 01:21:04,330
possession of its own private key what

1377
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:06,219
the sign well what we are proposing is

1378
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:08,099
using something related to that secure

1379
01:21:06,219 --> 01:21:10,449
association between client and

1380
01:21:08,099 --> 01:21:12,040
authorization server for instance if

1381
01:21:10,449 --> 01:21:14,589
they are communicating using the TLS

1382
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:16,630
they can assign an exporter if they are

1383
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:19,000
communicating using a score they can

1384
01:21:16,630 --> 01:21:22,060
essentially provide an output from HK DF

1385
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:24,550
extract involving information related to

1386
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:28,840
the pairwise Oscar context between the

1387
01:21:24,550 --> 01:21:30,310
two laying around the AES produces well

1388
01:21:28,840 --> 01:21:33,099
an access token response back to the

1389
01:21:30,310 --> 01:21:35,820
client that includes again those same

1390
01:21:33,099 --> 01:21:38,349
parameters provided before by the client

1391
01:21:35,820 --> 01:21:40,799
and those parameters together with the

1392
01:21:38,349 --> 01:21:43,929
public key of the client are also echoed

1393
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,540
into the access token that can be the

1394
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:49,989
later on delivered to the resource

1395
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:52,210
server this is essentially the outcome

1396
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:55,869
of input and discussion with Jim in

1397
01:21:52,210 --> 01:21:58,360
order to avoid a naughty group member

1398
01:21:55,869 --> 01:22:00,909
another group member in the same group

1399
01:21:58,360 --> 01:22:05,080
of this client essentially impersonate

1400
01:22:00,909 --> 01:22:07,210
is client using the wrong sender ID at

1401
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,040
least this way you are providing the

1402
01:22:07,210 --> 01:22:11,770
resource server with an opportunity to

1403
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:14,800
check that the public key in the token

1404
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:18,179
actually matches with a sender ID that

1405
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:20,830
comes in the token in the salt parameter

1406
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:22,840
then your sinusoid derive a pairwise

1407
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:25,199
Oscar contest between client or server

1408
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:28,449
just like in the Oscar profile

1409
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:31,360
considering just a few more pieces of

1410
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:32,769
information when composing the

1411
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:34,750
parameters that are used for deriving

1412
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:37,540
the pairwise contact so essentially the

1413
01:22:34,750 --> 01:22:39,550
context that is composed not only of the

1414
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:42,280
analysis exchanged between the client

1415
01:22:39,550 --> 01:22:45,340
and the resource server but also of the

1416
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:47,769
group ID of the Oscar group it was

1417
01:22:45,340 --> 01:22:50,469
indicating in the access token the salt

1418
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:53,290
is composed also of the sender ID of the

1419
01:22:50,469 --> 01:22:55,960
client in your group and if not empty

1420
01:22:53,290 --> 01:22:57,730
the masters although the Oscar group

1421
01:22:55,960 --> 01:23:00,610
the master secret is composed

1422
01:22:57,730 --> 01:23:02,650
considering not only the master secret

1423
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:05,559
indicating with the token but also the

1424
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:07,269
master secret of the group and then the

1425
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:11,380
context is just derived according to the

1426
01:23:07,270 --> 01:23:13,060
derivation procedure of Oscar as an

1427
01:23:11,380 --> 01:23:15,700
example that of course hides a lot of

1428
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:17,320
all of the low-level details here we

1429
01:23:15,700 --> 01:23:20,320
have a client series for servers

1430
01:23:17,320 --> 01:23:22,210
assuming all of them already in the

1431
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:24,040
oscar group the client asks for an

1432
01:23:22,210 --> 01:23:26,800
access token so indicating also its own

1433
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:28,050
sender ID in the oscar group and the

1434
01:23:26,800 --> 01:23:30,700
group idea of the group and that

1435
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:33,370
information is echoed back also in the

1436
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:35,800
access token then the client posts the

1437
01:23:33,370 --> 01:23:38,769
resource server one exchange if Nancy's

1438
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:40,620
derivation of the pairwise Oscar context

1439
01:23:38,770 --> 01:23:44,140
as described below

1440
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:46,570
well the client repeats the very same

1441
01:23:44,140 --> 01:23:49,120
procedure to post an access token to our

1442
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:51,160
sto and of course the Scopes here can be

1443
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,760
different in the T requested access

1444
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:54,780
token

1445
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:57,310
they also derive a pairwise context and

1446
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:59,230
at this point well we are admitting by

1447
01:23:57,310 --> 01:24:01,330
construction in this profile that it's

1448
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:03,250
fine for the client to communicate with

1449
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:05,080
the resource servers either with Oscar

1450
01:24:03,250 --> 01:24:07,990
or with group of score and in this

1451
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:11,440
example there's a first Oscar request to

1452
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:13,179
our s1 followed in by a multicast

1453
01:24:11,440 --> 01:24:16,000
request targeting the whole group so

1454
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:17,440
both our s1 and rst that of course is

1455
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,740
protected with a group of score

1456
01:24:17,440 --> 01:24:23,469
context so you can enforce fine-grained

1457
01:24:20,740 --> 01:24:25,719
access control with specific groups with

1458
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:31,420
specific scopes as I agree with the

1459
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:33,430
tokens so it's a new proposed transport

1460
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:36,100
profile of ACE essentially for having

1461
01:24:33,430 --> 01:24:39,550
fine-grained access control as expected

1462
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:41,860
in ace plus clientele resource servers

1463
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:43,510
that can use model your score has only

1464
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:46,870
possibility right now with the profiles

1465
01:24:43,510 --> 01:24:50,740
available but also group of score it's

1466
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:54,040
supported by at least one real world use

1467
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:56,559
is coming from back net and we are

1468
01:24:54,040 --> 01:24:58,300
essentially pairing the group in the

1469
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:02,320
pairwise context as well as the token

1470
01:24:58,300 --> 01:25:04,810
with also the group context this is an

1471
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:06,670
update that replies to previous

1472
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:09,310
questions comments we got there was

1473
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:12,090
meeting now we'd appreciate

1474
01:25:09,310 --> 01:25:12,090
reviews to this document

1475
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:30,450
this is been kenick so I have to

1476
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:32,550
apologize I was just looking at this

1477
01:25:30,450 --> 01:25:34,410
stuff for the first time like today

1478
01:25:32,550 --> 01:25:36,510
and I'm you're generally in favor of

1479
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:38,730
fine-grained access control and whatnot

1480
01:25:36,510 --> 01:25:43,200
and all this good stuff I'm just trying

1481
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:45,570
to understand basically why we need both

1482
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:49,019
this and the stuff we already have and

1483
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:52,889
is it may be that there are some devices

1484
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:55,320
or situations that can do the sort of

1485
01:25:52,890 --> 01:25:58,410
base group communications with us car

1486
01:25:55,320 --> 01:26:00,990
but they can't do this or just it takes

1487
01:25:58,410 --> 01:26:03,000
time longer to develop group score as

1488
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:05,219
such doesn't cover access control it's

1489
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,580
just about protecting messages so that

1490
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:11,550
can be processed by a group of devices

1491
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:14,960
right but you know the work that you

1492
01:26:11,550 --> 01:26:21,270
just presented is is overkill for

1493
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:24,120
situations that could use that but would

1494
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:26,430
it still meet all of the use cases that

1495
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:30,480
did that would you scale that I could

1496
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:32,360
require right in production and one of

1497
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:34,469
them is actually coming from buck net

1498
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:36,990
where they can't imagine a problem like

1499
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:39,270
this with different classes of clients

1500
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:40,889
that you need to do or not do different

1501
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:42,950
things so you won't go enforce this

1502
01:26:40,890 --> 01:26:46,500
level of granularity for access control

1503
01:26:42,950 --> 01:26:53,130
so you need something like ace right I

1504
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:57,390
guess my question would be more like if

1505
01:26:53,130 --> 01:27:00,710
we did this document and and like threw

1506
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:06,300
away the other one who would be sad

1507
01:27:00,710 --> 01:27:08,190
which is the other one the Oscar group

1508
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:11,250
communication that does not have fine

1509
01:27:08,190 --> 01:27:14,820
granularity oh that doesn't cover this

1510
01:27:11,250 --> 01:27:16,290
that's about authenticating the client

1511
01:27:14,820 --> 01:27:18,030
to communicate with the group manager

1512
01:27:16,290 --> 01:27:20,340
just forgetting the crema the key

1513
01:27:18,030 --> 01:27:22,080
material to get into the group this is a

1514
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:24,960
cluster about what happens after that

1515
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:28,700
I say okay thank you I'm sorry for my

1516
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:28,700
confusion thank you

1517
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:33,450
so there's no fair lapping at all this

1518
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:35,930
is just a continuation of our timeline

1519
01:27:33,450 --> 01:27:35,929
so today

1520
01:27:37,740 --> 01:27:44,280
so I'm just gonna ask how many people

1521
01:27:41,440 --> 01:27:44,280
have read to draft

1522
01:27:50,560 --> 01:28:04,910
are you cool with her Francesca

1523
01:27:53,210 --> 01:28:08,440
yeah Jim okay so my guess is that it's a

1524
01:28:04,910 --> 01:28:14,719
little bit too soon for the adoption but

1525
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:21,620
I didn't want any comment or anyone and

1526
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:25,239
has any what obviously are there any

1527
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:31,150
reasons you didn't read the draft or

1528
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:31,150
it's long I have to admit okay

1529
01:28:32,920 --> 01:28:47,300
is there anyone that's gonna read the

1530
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:48,769
draft mm-hmm I hope people on me take

1531
01:28:47,300 --> 01:28:54,650
all the people on mythical we're gonna

1532
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:59,690
read the draft yeah I think it's for now

1533
01:28:54,650 --> 01:29:05,059
it's a little bit too soon that's my my

1534
01:28:59,690 --> 01:29:08,449
opinion but the thing is that the

1535
01:29:05,060 --> 01:29:21,320
problem I have is what to expect for the

1536
01:29:08,449 --> 01:29:24,849
next time that's my okay okay so I'm I'm

1537
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:28,820
I think for today it's a little bit too

1538
01:29:24,850 --> 01:29:32,930
too early to to to have planes for the

1539
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:35,830
adoption or not adopting the draft but

1540
01:29:32,930 --> 01:29:39,320
I'm I would like that Marco can at least

1541
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:42,710
have a clear plans on what he has to do

1542
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:45,040
for the next step so so just for the

1543
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:47,000
record for from the Jabbar there are two

1544
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:51,590
reviews okay

1545
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:56,270
actual reviews so and are they happy

1546
01:29:51,590 --> 01:29:58,130
with the draft or they will be coming

1547
01:29:56,270 --> 01:30:02,570
they will read the draft they thought

1548
01:29:58,130 --> 01:30:05,179
they will they come it okay good so I

1549
01:30:02,570 --> 01:30:07,340
think that Ben is a point we should

1550
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:11,630
clarify better at what point of the

1551
01:30:07,340 --> 01:30:16,760
lifetime this comes in okay yeah yes so

1552
01:30:11,630 --> 01:30:21,350
I think you know what to do

1553
01:30:16,760 --> 01:30:22,580
and please update the draft pretty soon

1554
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:26,020
so that the people that come in to

1555
01:30:22,580 --> 01:30:30,920
review don't forget they have committed

1556
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:35,810
and Francesca got the names of the

1557
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:38,810
people that committed so yeah so I think

1558
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:41,390
next step is to maybe update a little

1559
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:45,020
bit a draft but I mean don't overkill

1560
01:30:41,390 --> 01:30:46,969
and then I mean more people need to

1561
01:30:45,020 --> 01:30:50,900
review before we can proceed to the

1562
01:30:46,969 --> 01:30:55,100
adoption I think that's the if anyone is

1563
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:58,070
find the draft I mean use less I mean

1564
01:30:55,100 --> 01:31:00,550
they have to stay it as a as soon as

1565
01:30:58,070 --> 01:31:00,549
possible

1566
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:13,790
okay so when are we expected to finish

1567
01:31:08,619 --> 01:31:17,599
now so can you say a few words briefly

1568
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:19,690
about the two remaining drafts yes I was

1569
01:31:17,600 --> 01:31:32,170
next presenter than was about Ludwig

1570
01:31:19,690 --> 01:31:38,360
okay but we okay so you can do this one

1571
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:41,060
yes be very very fast yes just a few

1572
01:31:38,360 --> 01:31:44,210
words this is another restful interface

1573
01:31:41,060 --> 01:31:46,670
for the oscar group manager this is not

1574
01:31:44,210 --> 01:31:48,199
intended for candidate group members or

1575
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:50,659
current group members like the profile

1576
01:31:48,199 --> 01:31:52,638
we presented before this is intended for

1577
01:31:50,659 --> 01:31:55,699
an administrator that as the first thing

1578
01:31:52,639 --> 01:31:57,739
wants to create those core groups set

1579
01:31:55,699 --> 01:32:00,710
update their configurations and

1580
01:31:57,739 --> 01:32:04,690
parameters and possibly delete oscar

1581
01:32:00,710 --> 01:32:06,920
groups it essentially describes

1582
01:32:04,690 --> 01:32:09,259
resources in the group manager for doing

1583
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:11,449
that and operations on them for an

1584
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:13,550
administrator acting as client that of

1585
01:32:11,449 --> 01:32:14,869
course is to get an access token to be

1586
01:32:13,550 --> 01:32:19,580
able tries to do that at the group

1587
01:32:14,869 --> 01:32:21,650
manager first of all the idea is very

1588
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:25,340
much inspired to latest intended

1589
01:32:21,650 --> 01:32:26,599
redesign of the APS for a co-op pops a

1590
01:32:25,340 --> 01:32:29,389
broker in fact you can see in this

1591
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:32,119
picture on the group manager we propose

1592
01:32:29,389 --> 01:32:34,880
that a single clip collection resource

1593
01:32:32,119 --> 01:32:40,280
and then one group confirmation resource

1594
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,540
for each created active Oscar groups so

1595
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,750
essentially on the group collection

1596
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:46,790
resource you can send a get to retrieve

1597
01:32:44,750 --> 01:32:48,530
the list of active groups or you can

1598
01:32:46,790 --> 01:32:50,150
send the post to create a group

1599
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:52,670
specifying the name and its

1600
01:32:50,150 --> 01:32:56,509
configuration parameters and we are

1601
01:32:52,670 --> 01:32:58,550
defining how to default to not specify

1602
01:32:56,510 --> 01:33:00,770
parameters and the response back will

1603
01:32:58,550 --> 01:33:03,949
include as a confirmation the name of

1604
01:33:00,770 --> 01:33:06,280
the group and the parameters enforced by

1605
01:33:03,949 --> 01:33:08,480
the group manager in the configuration

1606
01:33:06,280 --> 01:33:10,550
that is possible of course to retrieve

1607
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:13,070
the current configuration or update it

1608
01:33:10,550 --> 01:33:15,380
or to delete the group just

1609
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:18,469
acting on the resource specific for that

1610
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:20,500
group so interfacing the group manager

1611
01:33:18,469 --> 01:33:22,940
for the application restful for

1612
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:26,960
administrator wrist will create

1613
01:33:22,940 --> 01:33:28,219
configure delete Oscar groups as far as

1614
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:30,349
I know Peter when their stock has an

1615
01:33:28,219 --> 01:33:32,810
implementation already in the Corp plan

1616
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:34,460
to start one in California on the

1617
01:33:32,810 --> 01:33:37,760
recommendation from Jane we started this

1618
01:33:34,460 --> 01:33:40,400
as an experimental document so I wonder

1619
01:33:37,760 --> 01:33:43,429
if this is appropriate or can instead be

1620
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:50,920
a standard track document we ask for

1621
01:33:43,429 --> 01:33:50,920
reviews okay good yeah

1622
01:33:52,840 --> 01:34:04,579
so very quickly draft basically it's

1623
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:09,589
about being able to get notified when a

1624
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:12,170
token affecting you gets revoked so the

1625
01:34:09,590 --> 01:34:15,290
idea is when token is revoked the client

1626
01:34:12,170 --> 01:34:18,170
or the research server that is affected

1627
01:34:15,290 --> 01:34:22,190
by that token wants to know about that

1628
01:34:18,170 --> 01:34:24,139
and why are we not revoking tokens at

1629
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:28,509
the moment there is a draft

1630
01:34:24,139 --> 01:34:30,770
RFC in off but it's about the client

1631
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:34,040
revoking its own tokens when it doesn't

1632
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:36,650
need them anymore but in IOT space we

1633
01:34:34,040 --> 01:34:38,449
think there are use cases where the AAS

1634
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:40,759
or the resource owner would want to

1635
01:34:38,449 --> 01:34:43,219
revoke tokens and then how did the

1636
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:47,389
client and the resource server learn

1637
01:34:43,219 --> 01:34:49,880
that and the idea is when you register a

1638
01:34:47,389 --> 01:34:51,860
client or a resource server at the

1639
01:34:49,880 --> 01:34:55,369
authorization server you create a

1640
01:34:51,860 --> 01:34:58,940
resource and this resource is gettable

1641
01:34:55,369 --> 01:35:02,150
or get observable in coop

1642
01:34:58,940 --> 01:35:05,169
by the client or the resource and on

1643
01:35:02,150 --> 01:35:09,790
this resource the AAAS publishes which

1644
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:14,659
tokens are revoked and not yet expired

1645
01:35:09,790 --> 01:35:19,900
that's the short version do we need a

1646
01:35:14,659 --> 01:35:19,900
longer version eventually

1647
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:30,140
try to spencer curity question ludwik is

1648
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:32,180
it bound to IOT devices or can this

1649
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:34,370
notification also be used on the big bad

1650
01:35:32,180 --> 01:35:38,980
internet but currently it's defined for

1651
01:35:34,370 --> 01:35:41,809
co-op so thanks yes you can use it but

1652
01:35:38,980 --> 01:35:45,200
it would be easy enough to define

1653
01:35:41,810 --> 01:35:48,260
something similar for HTTP but currently

1654
01:35:45,200 --> 01:35:51,050
the draft doesn't okay

1655
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:54,560
Thank You Ludwig thank you all for

1656
01:35:51,050 --> 01:35:55,100
coming and I think the meeting is

1657
01:35:54,560 --> 01:35:59,170
adjourned

1658
01:35:55,100 --> 01:35:59,170
