2
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,639
okay

3
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:56,179
the time has come everybody please

4
00:01:44,639 --> 00:01:56,179
shuffle in and find a place to sit okay

5
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:06,590
how many people in the room have never

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,590
seen the no well never ever okay

7
00:02:07,789 --> 00:03:04,230
great okay a couple of housekeeping

8
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:07,260
things my co-chair is home pneumonia so

9
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,630
if you see people that wherever it is

10
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,340
the screen that shows people that are

11
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:15,329
trying to get a word in edgewise from

12
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:18,510
remote places and I don't see it do

13
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:21,870
something let me know that that there's

14
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,959
somebody who wants to do that and what

15
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:28,620
what screen is that on that should be on

16
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:35,220
one of them hi there you're looking at

17
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:39,780
me like okay yesterday I asked for a

18
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:44,549
jabber scribe and a note-taker I have

19
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:46,319
gotten Herbert you're willing to do

20
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,420
notes okay thank you very much

21
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,208
appreciate that I'm looking for a jabber

22
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,600
scribe who's willing to be a jabber

23
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:53,600
scribes

24
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,030
well maybe we don't have a jabber scribe

25
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,730
okay so if you're a speaker and you're

26
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,799
talking you're supposed to stand I'm

27
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:13,170
standing on top of a red X

28
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,139
they usually have a box you're supposed

29
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:33,539
to stand here that has something do with

30
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:37,289
me deco now our agenda we expected to

31
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:41,639
have an invited talk from Renu which is

32
00:04:37,289 --> 00:04:44,210
a net n ran in Uganda and that guy sent

33
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:49,490
me a note yesterday saying that his

34
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:53,849
thesis defense got moved to right now so

35
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:56,220
he's not going to be here so the agenda

36
00:04:53,849 --> 00:05:00,840
as we stand today we have Jen talking

37
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,990
about her proposal for cash entries in

38
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,690
first hop routers and then we have some

39
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:09,419
other drafts that have had some level of

40
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:13,469
discussion on the list and I'll invite

41
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:16,080
the authors of those to come up Jen

42
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:18,419
you'll have about 30 minutes and the

43
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,500
rest of these guys probably have around

44
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,919
20 or 15 so and Jen you're looking at me

45
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:28,530
and saying you need an hour okay

46
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,640
okay so

47
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:31,640
[Music]

48
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:51,510
no no wait a minute

49
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:54,419
and I go to the meeting materials it

50
00:05:51,510 --> 00:06:03,570
should give me the slides that you sent

51
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:05,820
right yeah I know you uploaded them I

52
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,219
saw that they were there scroll down

53
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:12,840
scroll down I think it's down the bottom

54
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:20,220
of the page normal yeah okay

55
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:22,830
good deal and you get that hello please

56
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,120
raise your hand if you know what this

57
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:32,570
talk is about what

58
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:40,830
okay so we'll have quick recap then sir

59
00:06:32,570 --> 00:07:01,200
no screen yeah I think we need a full

60
00:06:40,830 --> 00:07:03,950
screen for customer problem okay it

61
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,950
doesn't work anyway

62
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:31,929
oh yeah this one Oh Oh perfect yeah so a

63
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:34,149
quick recap

64
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:36,609
so what the problem is the problem is

65
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:40,719
when host joins the network

66
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:43,479
it sends RS it gets back an array and

67
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:45,490
that array in one packet gives host

68
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,219
everything the host needs to connect to

69
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:51,610
internet it now gets a global address it

70
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:54,189
gets router IP address and MAC address

71
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,789
so host start singing a lot of traffic

72
00:07:54,189 --> 00:08:00,129
to different destinations and that point

73
00:07:57,789 --> 00:08:02,259
of time router successful you're out all

74
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:05,080
those packets outside but the router

75
00:08:02,259 --> 00:08:06,849
still does not have any neighbor cache

76
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:09,339
entry for the host global address

77
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:12,998
because the router doesn't have any

78
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:15,759
reason to then traffic return traffic

79
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:18,699
starts coming back router caches one

80
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,709
packet drops the rest of the packet and

81
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,479
starts neighbor discovery process the

82
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:26,259
resolution process for the host global

83
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:30,339
address which leads to some packets

84
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:32,050
being dropped and if host implement some

85
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:34,328
kind of program companies with some

86
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,120
exponential back-off hosts might

87
00:08:34,328 --> 00:08:39,399
actually consider the network to be

88
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,318
unreachable for example if you and I

89
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,630
hope you I actually using v6 on the

90
00:08:41,318 --> 00:08:46,689
network here you might notice that for

91
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:49,389
example Android phones it takes five to

92
00:08:46,689 --> 00:08:51,550
seven seconds before it will show you

93
00:08:49,389 --> 00:08:53,649
that Wi-Fi has connectivity actually

94
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,899
because of this because under o it sends

95
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:57,880
probes probes are not coming back until

96
00:08:55,899 --> 00:09:00,040
neighbor discovery completes the next

97
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,339
part next probes are sends five seconds

98
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,920
later and so on so yeah in ideal world

99
00:09:03,339 --> 00:09:08,050
it would be nice if by the time the

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,779
returning traffic is coming back router

101
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:13,120
already has some information about the

102
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:16,930
host global address right so we avoid

103
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,910
this by design packet loss so and

104
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,060
actually in before everything works fine

105
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,810
because host sends our advertising say

106
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:28,089
before addresses routers put that ipv4

107
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,430
address and they are cache and everyone

108
00:09:28,089 --> 00:09:31,809
is ready so in duels that network nobody

109
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,969
noticing a problem because of high

110
00:09:31,809 --> 00:09:36,019
tables so as soon as you turn over for

111
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:39,110
your customers and your managers are

112
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:44,379
come very on Hagen so we discussed it

113
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:49,819
last time draft document was adopted and

114
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:52,910
as per discussion we had I had split the

115
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:55,160
draft in two because this is about a

116
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,769
correctional problem about the solution

117
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,449
actually in the six-month area because

118
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:04,040
apparently we need slightly tweaked

119
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:05,929
neighbor discovery so the current

120
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,269
version of the draft still describes

121
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:13,369
what the problem is and enumerates

122
00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:16,639
various approaches to solution and the

123
00:10:13,369 --> 00:10:20,839
proposed solution is now described in

124
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:22,519
the draft which I posted six-man and I

125
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,119
also moved security consideration

126
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,309
section to the six-month graft because I

127
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:29,749
think security consideration talks about

128
00:10:28,309 --> 00:10:32,540
the proposed solution so it should

129
00:10:29,749 --> 00:10:37,119
belong to that draft so basically and

130
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:41,660
also the draft suggests that host

131
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:44,059
advertise in addresses in Ansari Statten

132
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:48,079
ace routers received Ansari sturdiness

133
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:51,350
and create incomplete cache entry I

134
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:55,008
think eager suggested that instead of

135
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:58,490
learning from unsolicited ace routers

136
00:10:55,009 --> 00:11:01,910
could also learn from Dodds just looking

137
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:03,799
at all that packets received it's one of

138
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:07,129
the potential ways to solve the problem

139
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:09,559
however I suspect the problem is that

140
00:11:07,129 --> 00:11:13,220
now routers needs to receive all that

141
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:15,709
traffic which not necessary one routers

142
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:17,929
to receive and also there might be kind

143
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:20,569
of race conditions there because host

144
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:24,470
sends that packet router receives it

145
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:27,229
that packet oh I need to get a new host

146
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:30,679
a new address router would start

147
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:32,869
proactive labor resolution but address

148
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,970
could still be in tentative straight in

149
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:40,339
which case the host would not respond to

150
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:44,389
an S so proposed solution host should

151
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:47,259
send an ace and Solis tetanus when they

152
00:11:44,389 --> 00:11:49,790
configure new address new global address

153
00:11:47,259 --> 00:11:51,800
what routers should do

154
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,120
routers and I'm not sure here what to

155
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:58,250
say we can say they may or they should

156
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,220
populate their caches upon the receiving

157
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:04,250
unsolicited A's and actually if you keep

158
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:08,690
it as male and it's not even any changes

159
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:11,480
to neighbor discovery 48 61

160
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:15,800
because the current version of the RFC

161
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:18,530
says unsolicited an ace should not

162
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:21,770
create any new cache entries and I read

163
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:24,110
through not as actually may if needed

164
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:26,240
oh probably it's a good idea that

165
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:28,070
routers should create and rest upon

166
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,320
receiving unsolicited analysis actually

167
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:32,000
subject to discussion all we can have

168
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:35,870
this discussion in 6 min on Thursday

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,430
where I have 15 minutes so basically not

170
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:40,400
so many changes to the draft just

171
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,560
splitting into and discussing gleaning

172
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:47,569
from duplicate address detection packets

173
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:50,930
instead of unsolicited an ace so yeah

174
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:53,180
and plus yes I said two sections move to

175
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:57,500
six month after security consideration

176
00:12:53,180 --> 00:13:00,099
and how we can ensure that no disruption

177
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:04,460
opinion in case of duplicate addresses

178
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:07,460
so it's actually it and it would be nice

179
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:14,300
to hear some comments suggestions what

180
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:15,590
shall we do Dave so I was one of the

181
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,329
people that have not read your draft so

182
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,880
thank you for the quick introduction now

183
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:21,320
that you gave that was useful you

184
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,760
mentioned that you added other options

185
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,960
and so I don't know what things you

186
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,630
didn't talk about that you might include

187
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,380
but I think both of the ones that you

188
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:32,390
presented have various disadvantages and

189
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:34,550
I was gonna ask if you had a third

190
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,670
option that you already covered which is

191
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,979
to do a neighbor solicitation on receipt

192
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,229
of a packet more or less like you do in

193
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:45,110
our PF check or something like that in

194
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,460
the hopes that by the time you might get

195
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:48,830
a response to that package you were

196
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,150
forwarding any you receive the first

197
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,030
packet and you're gonna forward it on

198
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,160
and your in your diagram okay and so the

199
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,449
issue with doing on the neighbor

200
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,920
advertisement is you might never get

201
00:13:56,450 --> 00:14:00,260
packets you're gonna consume at cache

202
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,510
entries and then you have you also have

203
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,740
issues with all these that say well does

204
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,390
this mean that if you

205
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,160
we're running out of cash entries you

206
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,300
might kick something out in order to put

207
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,800
something in which you were then never

208
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,150
use in the future that's just an

209
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,040
operational issue you should discuss

210
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,660
that will happen with no matter which

211
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,920
approach you take right yeah you might

212
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,060
proactively create a neighbor cache

213
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,530
entry that you never need for anything

214
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:20,959
right and you may flush your cache and

215
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:23,480
and so on but my main question was do

216
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,770
you have an option by which and have you

217
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,600
looked at the option by which you do

218
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:29,270
neighbor discovery when receiving a

219
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,670
package you're gonna forward yes it's

220
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:33,800
not in the draft I was thinking about

221
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:35,900
that but I made sure you would like to

222
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:40,849
hear from router implementers because

223
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:43,610
now we start kind of we will start using

224
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,880
beta play to send some signals to

225
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:51,710
control plane and I am not sure if it's

226
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,180
a really good idea so we could we could

227
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,650
put it on the drafts we can discuss it

228
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,079
here like I'm I'm just trying to

229
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,060
enumerate possible approaches and I

230
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,920
don't think I shall decide what's the

231
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:04,130
best one I'd like to use a collective

232
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:07,339
wisdom of the group so a quick interrupt

233
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:17,720
here are we having the six-man

234
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:20,540
discussion here confused right because I

235
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,060
think we we either need to move the food

236
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:24,380
code rafter to six men saying okay here

237
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,300
is a problem I don't even try to

238
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,010
enumerate solution on this graph so do

239
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,260
we want me to move all possible

240
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,270
solutions section my understanding and

241
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,540
Bob you might want to chime in on those

242
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,939
was that the six-man chairs wanted the

243
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:41,060
protocol issues to be moved to six men

244
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:44,570
and the operational issues left in six

245
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:47,540
36 hours yeah so we have a part which

246
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:48,740
says ok here is a problem right so then

247
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:51,589
there is a part which says there are

248
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:54,050
possible approaches to solution and I'm

249
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,600
not sure where this belongs because and

250
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:58,819
then there is a decision okay out of all

251
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,430
those things we decided to do this this

252
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,050
is this which belongs to chicks man so

253
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:05,300
if you since there's a whole possible

254
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,339
list of things we might want to do

255
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,849
belongs to chicks man I can easily a

256
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:12,850
move wrong approach that

257
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:19,100
it just moving terms between copy and

258
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,100
paste from one document to another sir

259
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,000
Warren Kumari Google I just going to

260
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:26,220
mention the Dave Taylor suggestion

261
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,920
potentially is terrifying because then

262
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:30,600
if you're a transit router for example

263
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:33,180
you have to be really careful you don't

264
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,589
do that for every packet that you see or

265
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:43,920
everything desk to you where someone

266
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:46,370
scans hi I'm Bob hinden 6-man co-chair I

267
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,949
mean I I'm not sure I care too much

268
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:51,839
where the different possible ways of

269
00:16:49,949 --> 00:16:56,910
doing it as described could be either

270
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:59,190
could be both a week if there's you know

271
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,469
the working group accepts this then we

272
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:04,049
want to have a document that describes

273
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:08,309
one of them they care more about that

274
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:11,309
part that's helpful okay in question for

275
00:17:08,309 --> 00:17:13,980
you is Jen on your agenda yes she is

276
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:16,949
okay I think I'll have time to actually

277
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:18,959
talk about this - yes I could 15 minutes

278
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,850
and six men and half an hour here and

279
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,360
I'm done with my slides I don't know if

280
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:26,639
you want to have a discussion about

281
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:28,889
various options and which option we

282
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,419
actually want to take to six men all we

283
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:32,460
want to have discussion about all

284
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:35,490
options in six men and let six Munda

285
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,740
side which one to pick up well and I'm

286
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,660
willing to have you discussed the

287
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:42,059
problem in the different ways that it

288
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:44,250
might be addressed get operational input

289
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:46,350
that might you know biased at one way or

290
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,470
another but I really want to leave the

291
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:52,379
ultimate discussion on protocol to six

292
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:54,960
men so this is Dave I agree with

293
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,919
everything that Fred said my question

294
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,500
that I'd actually don't know the answer

295
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,940
to is the decision of whether this is a

296
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,700
problem that needs solving

297
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,190
is that a six man question or as at a v6

298
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:07,200
ops question whether it needs solving is

299
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:08,880
probably operational yeah okay then

300
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,650
shall we ask that here because there is

301
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,419
a document that's in here which is

302
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:14,010
supposed to talk about the issues but

303
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:15,720
that's different from saying and the

304
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,580
discussion of sufficient that we

305
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,080
actually need a solution because if

306
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,580
that's actually a consensus this group

307
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,010
then saying that to six men will be

308
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:26,370
important so I think we adopted this

309
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:27,200
document I in v6 ops last time so I

310
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,000
think

311
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,950
kind of agreed that this problem worth

312
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,180
solving maybe discussing is a the fact

313
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,680
you have a working document certainly

314
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,660
proof that it's worth discussing right

315
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:41,060
there are some things we have RFC's for

316
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:42,590
they say here's the problems and we are

317
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:45,350
choosing to not solve them that is a

318
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,449
possible outcome is asking the question

319
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:50,300
it wasn't the document like do nothing

320
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:52,070
is it an approach there is a section

321
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,629
saying we can do it just don't Ison and

322
00:18:52,070 --> 00:19:00,980
let packets to be dropped on the floor

323
00:18:53,630 --> 00:19:02,990
that's fine so Warren Warren quarry like

324
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,730
maybe it would be useful to ask the room

325
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,560
if there's consensus that this needs

326
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:07,940
solving just so that when six-man

327
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,710
happens we're gonna be like v6 UPS

328
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:12,590
obviously thinks it needs solving just

329
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,120
as a thought well at IETF 105 I've got a

330
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:17,780
pretty strong hum out of the room that

331
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:20,300
the vendors or the operators wanted to

332
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:25,070
see the problem solved and maybe we

333
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:28,159
should ask for a redo of that hum you

334
00:19:25,070 --> 00:19:32,810
people now that they understand what the

335
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:34,880
draft is about and touch okay so if this

336
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,300
is a problem you feel is important to

337
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:40,850
solve

338
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:48,950
please hum if you'd rather not solve it

339
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:51,530
please huh okay so the eyes went okay so

340
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,690
I guess we can have some discussion and

341
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:56,899
six men about possible solutions and

342
00:19:53,690 --> 00:20:00,170
yeah I'm still looking for comments on

343
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:04,690
this one as humans that solutions list

344
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:07,430
might move to six-man area right but I

345
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,860
problem problem statement isn't the

346
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:15,110
draft here so but I it's quite short one

347
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:16,879
there is not much to say Sarah if I if I

348
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:22,250
get a little more comment Seattle to

349
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:24,500
post 0 1 YES on looking for way to

350
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,650
improve the document well let me invite

351
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:29,870
questions we've already had some at the

352
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:37,160
mic but do we have other people who want

353
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:39,610
to chime in on this seeing none okay

354
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,610
thank you

355
00:20:52,330 --> 00:21:26,689
and Mark I'm about to bring you up I

356
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:28,730
think so now after and well fred is

357
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:30,679
doing what can I just say is the note

358
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:33,159
taker it really would be helpful if

359
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:35,389
somebody would do the Jabbar thing

360
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:37,549
because I had to come back here and

361
00:21:35,389 --> 00:21:39,229
start taking names and this is a big

362
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:49,010
room can somebody please get on Jabbar

363
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:52,760
and just strauber thank you that's the

364
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,539
first idea for bin 2 647 back in 2005

365
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,360
course um

366
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:58,039
this is my very fun it's just introduced

367
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,100
a drafter a little while back

368
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:08,450
default ipv6 only addressing for non

369
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:12,709
internet devices okay so recently I've

370
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:15,260
got a new printer at home ipv6 capable

371
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,789
not know why default according the spec

372
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:22,190
sheet it supports a whole stack of stuff

373
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:25,908
over ipv6 which is broadly good one of

374
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:29,450
those directions right there again as

375
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:31,730
you might do if you're in this room you

376
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,450
run an nmap against the global public IP

377
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:34,610
address on it

378
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:38,860
and you see quite a lot of stuff I won't

379
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:42,500
go through it you can see stuff there

380
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:46,668
there's UDP some few oddities which I'll

381
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:50,510
talk about supportive protocols as well

382
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:52,429
tcp UDP l expected there's some ones

383
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:52,650
that i'm not that happy with there and I

384
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:56,430
will

385
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,660
by default globally the first two are

386
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:59,880
sort of necessary they're printing

387
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,460
protocols but their own unauthenticated

388
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:04,380
open to the internet so people can print

389
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:07,080
to my printer if they work out the ipv6

390
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,650
address I've no idea why it's got a to

391
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:13,530
FTP server running by default SNMP is

392
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,450
there yes it's got a public read/write a

393
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:20,250
read-only community readwrite is not

394
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:22,110
private but it's not much better I have

395
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:23,730
no real idea why it's got this Ventrilo

396
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:26,729
thing on it apparently it's just

397
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,700
proprietary what think maybe there's

398
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,620
some sort of printing capability in it

399
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,030
it's also got mdns listening which is

400
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,459
somewhat understandable because it will

401
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,230
just do a wild card socket bind but that

402
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,180
being said it could possibly be

403
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:44,550
exploited or exhausted by unicast I

404
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,260
don't need a global ipv6 address in my

405
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:49,680
printer or my prinnies coming from the

406
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,150
link local lawyer always so the trouble

407
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,270
are I've got is that I've gotta just a

408
00:23:51,150 --> 00:23:57,300
single SSID fairly simple setup probably

409
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:59,570
coming from most consumers and so

410
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:02,220
therefore my printer configures one I

411
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:05,840
could of course as a technical person

412
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:08,940
create a new SSID and make it Yule only

413
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,980
but of course inconvenient multicast DNS

414
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:13,410
doesn't work

415
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,160
I do have an upstream network firewall

416
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:20,820
and that's probable but devices can only

417
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:22,740
assure what they can control and if I

418
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,659
pretend to be a non-technical user which

419
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,110
I think's a useful thing to do imagine I

420
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,340
don't know how any of this magic works

421
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:34,340
those sorts of things are really beyond

422
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:37,169
a non-technical users capabilities a

423
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,120
broader thought I've had is that because

424
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:42,240
devices configure IP v6 addresses

425
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,020
regardless of you know what the pio pio

426
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,590
czar or DHCP when a device is configured

427
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:51,750
with a mobile ipv6 address and goers

428
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:53,610
sort of imply Internet connectivity it's

429
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,590
sort of a bit of an implication that we

430
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:58,520
believe that all internet facing

431
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,899
software is internet proof and evidence

432
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:04,980
is showing otherwise twenty years after

433
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:06,450
SNMP exploits and so on a bit of a

434
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:08,340
stretch but I sort of think

435
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:10,140
that the end-to-end argument may apply a

436
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,540
bit or at least one way I think of it is

437
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,790
it's soda saying do things whether a

438
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:16,139
motto salts matter the most and do

439
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,170
things where the best knowledge of what

440
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,670
is and isn't required is available or in

441
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:23,580
other words if you want something done

442
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:26,970
properly you need to do it yourself so

443
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:29,399
my proposal and suggestion is that for

444
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,080
devices where it's clear and obvious to

445
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:33,690
a vendor that the device doesn't need

446
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:36,179
internet access by default it only

447
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:39,930
configures your lies either by slack or

448
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:44,250
dhcpv6 and it only accepts packets from

449
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:46,050
you Eliza wait locals which would reduce

450
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:47,970
the attack service by default and

451
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:51,210
generally make devices a bit more

452
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:53,430
internet safe by default there would be

453
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,230
an override for a competent system in

454
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:56,730
Australia so if a printer like mine was

455
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,360
deployed in an office or something like

456
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:01,950
that or so on some people weren't I've

457
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:05,010
proposed this I said yesterday you know

458
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,500
you should use mad or manufacturer usage

459
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:10,590
description the goal seems somewhat

460
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,480
similar although the network is sorted

461
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,340
to enforce the security policy rather

462
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,950
than the device itself so talk about low

463
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,139
powered IOT devices and the network

464
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:20,910
being configured with access control

465
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:23,790
lists and so on it's much more discrete

466
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:26,520
as well which is fair it requires a

467
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,830
supporting mud server infrastructure and

468
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,430
it assumes a local network administrator

469
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:36,090
to manage this and monitor et cetera

470
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:38,010
well the typical non-technical home user

471
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:42,060
is not going to be a capable of not

472
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:44,370
doing that effectively so in comparison

473
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,740
this is a very simple mechanism it's

474
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,419
binary it's either on the internet or

475
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,070
not and if it's not on the internet

476
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,200
whatever services it running it's

477
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,879
running out reachable from it doesn't

478
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,130
require the technical administrator and

479
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,270
it could also be seen as a complement to

480
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,650
mud and firewall another example I've

481
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:04,020
had some experience with electricity

482
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:06,180
smart meters now they must really be

483
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,770
using you allies because you don't want

484
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:09,510
your electricity meter infrastructure

485
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,830
sitting on the internet at all because

486
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:14,550
of DDoS and electricity networks

487
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:16,830
sabotage so this mechanism could be seen

488
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:19,430
to be enforcing that requirement of

489
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,290
safety for these sorts of devices

490
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,300
another comment somebody had was about

491
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:25,830
the idea of using having these devices

492
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:27,510
through their own firmware upgrade well

493
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,550
if that's the model of software

494
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:31,590
maintenance that the manufacturers

495
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:33,270
choosing well then yes it's clear and

496
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:37,260
obvious sister vise does need internet

497
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,720
access however an alternative idea to

498
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:41,610
that is that maybe for something that is

499
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,250
it's a it's limited just to firmware

500
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:47,189
upgrades then the device actually does

501
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,860
on demand global addressing so when the

502
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:51,720
device does its periodic probe to see if

503
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,379
there's a new version of firmware it

504
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,810
goes and acquires rul a global address

505
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:00,660
does a check there's no software update

506
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:02,879
available it it deprecates it and just

507
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,630
continues to be available via relay or

508
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:10,610
local and all the same thing if there's

509
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:24,720
an upgrade so sort of that middle ground

510
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:26,580
any thoughts or questions I'm a bit

511
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,260
scared because now I have a printer

512
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,820
which I can install in the office and

513
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,690
printer which I cannot install on

514
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,570
surface right

515
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:36,510
what can install in office what what

516
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:39,659
can't because if if the device doesn't

517
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,160
get global address yep I cannot use it

518
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,980
in the routing infrastructure in his

519
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,840
office right well it uses it you alive

520
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,940
that is when you throw out you Elaine's

521
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,840
over in addition to oh thank you very

522
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,420
much yeah

523
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,129
why so now I need so that you don't use

524
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:58,400
things on the internet you realize well

525
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:03,270
let's see if he's doing that already

526
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:04,860
know so like I bet you can switch that

527
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,800
off of giving you an all so like if you

528
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:10,080
just want link local just disable slack

529
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:13,200
on me just disable except I don't think

530
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:17,939
like I want you alive as well you you

531
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,700
won't so like I'm I kind of concern

532
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:22,320
about encoding into the device its

533
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,210
behavior so someone needs to make a

534
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,159
decision is going to make a decision for

535
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,200
me what kind of addresses the device

536
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,060
yeah and I think that's the thing that

537
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,860
would be a technically competent person

538
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:38,470
who could make that decision

539
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:40,178
it's where is grandma's and whoever are

540
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:43,420
not going to be capable of making that

541
00:29:40,179 --> 00:29:45,790
decision well I suspect that if it's a

542
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,290
problems at the hip even there needs to

543
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,270
be the catechol tourist not acts not

544
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:51,070
allowing incoming connections right

545
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:53,200
sorry guys a bit what I was saying about

546
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,470
we assume we seem to be sort of assuming

547
00:29:53,200 --> 00:30:00,760
it all software is internet proof and

548
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:02,890
it's not so like again I don't think we

549
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,080
need to encode into the device and in

550
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:10,750
you elation mind kicks what what kind of

551
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:13,389
how to say it yeah so like if device has

552
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,850
a globe has v6 connectivity it should

553
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:18,010
have be six connectivity and so

554
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:20,500
otherwise yeah we really would need to

555
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:22,090
have a sticker on the printer box right

556
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,070
you can connect two printers this

557
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:26,678
internet or that printer could not be

558
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:29,020
connected to internet right because I

559
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:31,299
don't think you know the duration plan

560
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,679
because we bought a special device we

561
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:35,139
already have enough problems with all

562
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:36,790
these smart devices which could do v6

563
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:38,919
properly and this just adds additional

564
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:41,379
complication so how do I know if my

565
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:43,750
smart sensor all this Internet of Things

566
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:47,230
stuff need to connect to internet to you

567
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:49,210
well that's where the manufacturer you

568
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:51,010
know smart meter as an example smart

569
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,710
meter manufacturers don't manufacture

570
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,280
their devices to be on internet that's

571
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,770
clear and obvious to them so so

572
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,480
obviously if I have a you infrastructure

573
00:30:59,770 --> 00:31:03,340
I want to connect to those devices from

574
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,600
my infrastructure again I don't think

575
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:07,059
it's a good idea to suggest that

576
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:34,600
everyone who uses it needs to enable you

577
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:37,480
a lace okay Fernando my question is is

578
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,370
there any requirement in order for

579
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,290
example an ICC

580
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:45,729
perfectly lay critics it well it I look

581
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:49,780
I realized that I am effectively

582
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:53,140
suggesting that okay all up all our RFC

583
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,030
simle 70 or 662 I for CP or whatever the

584
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:59,580
lighter that all requires you Eliza

585
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,580
generated and advertised my sisters okay

586
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:11,170
somehow in your presentation were assume

587
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:15,100
you know if the device were to configure

588
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:17,740
global address and a ula for example it

589
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,290
would end up leaf listening on both

590
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:24,340
addresses in practice does that's what

591
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:26,770
happens of course but I think that's a

592
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:29,919
sign that there's something probably an

593
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:32,440
API that's that's missing in the sense

594
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:34,960
that you could have a device with both

595
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:38,440
global and for example you lay addresses

596
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,630
and those applications that don't really

597
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,500
need global connectivity could just bind

598
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:47,620
the UA areas so you could configure the

599
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:51,070
global address but only vine those ports

600
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:52,600
to the ula address I reckon you've

601
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,070
written a draft on this and I missed the

602
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,709
meet I've had this idea of myself as

603
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:58,480
well

604
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,980
the questioner a software you know

605
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,720
developers gonna do that for each and

606
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:04,660
every service listening on my printer or

607
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,770
so on and so forth it sort of this is

608
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:10,750
sort of where as much as discrete

609
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:13,810
application level security stuff appeals

610
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,920
to my into end philosophy I sort of

611
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:16,810
think there's something much more

612
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,360
fundamental at sort of the the the IP

613
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:22,419
layer it's a it's a blunt object it's a

614
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,219
blunt enforcement agree but it sort of

615
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:28,690
it becomes a binary thing is it on the

616
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:30,550
internet or not but is it like to be on

617
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:32,350
the internet or Dena fee has to be on

618
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,050
the Internet what I mean is that for

619
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:38,080
example I I could ambition that an

620
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:40,780
application could for example somehow

621
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,970
signal to the operating system okay

622
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,260
this service is supposed to be local

623
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,720
this service is supposed to be global

624
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,150
and based on that you'd bind that port

625
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,830
to for example some subset of the

626
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:53,230
addresses that you have unfortunately we

627
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:56,019
don't have such an API

628
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:58,500
first instance on the slide if it's

629
00:33:56,019 --> 00:34:01,299
clear and obvious to the vendor that

630
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:03,820
it's gonna be on the internet or not you

631
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:06,340
know if it's ambiguous this wouldn't

632
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:09,339
apply but if there's certainly you know

633
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,469
device cases I look at light bulbs for

634
00:34:09,339 --> 00:34:13,270
example the the ipv6 enabled light bulbs

635
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:14,799
you might have a central controller in

636
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:16,780
your house that might be on the internet

637
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,760
that might download the firmware that

638
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,889
provides your remote access to your

639
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:23,710
lights light bulbs but the light bulb

640
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:25,899
itself might not possibly shouldn't be

641
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,210
on the internet so it would it would

642
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,739
enforce this and say well even though I

643
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:32,399
might be able to configure a global

644
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:34,779
address I won't because I'm a light bulb

645
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,379
the light switch or the central

646
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:40,060
controller would configure both so

647
00:34:38,379 --> 00:34:42,759
that's sort of where that that boundary

648
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,810
I'm I'm thinking is yeah but for example

649
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,149
if you have a device like you were

650
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:49,929
mentioning that has automatic updates

651
00:34:46,149 --> 00:34:51,759
for example yeah at least during that

652
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,159
window of time when the device is

653
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,670
checking with some server over there

654
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,520
whether there is an update or not there

655
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:03,520
will be a window where the device can be

656
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,710
attacked okay so that's that's an

657
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,710
indication that also the application

658
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:10,690
should somehow you know signal to the

659
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:12,849
operating system whether it's support

660
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:15,520
the the application is supposed to be

661
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:17,230
you know internet Richville or not I'm

662
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,690
not agreeing I suppose the thing to

663
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:21,960
think about is that if a device has a

664
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:26,410
global address for us a second or two

665
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:29,740
versus 24/7 that they do now it's it's

666
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:34,029
it's it's a quorum and it's not perfect

667
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:37,328
I'm not selling it as perfect but it's

668
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:38,560
just you know my printers already like I

669
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:40,240
had to do a firmware upgrade on it

670
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,910
because there was a remote exploit the

671
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,979
the password on telnet was default to

672
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:50,348
admin or something like this this is

673
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:53,230
2019 the the approach of trusting people

674
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,550
to build internet proof software is not

675
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,960
working I'm not saying there's a

676
00:35:54,550 --> 00:36:03,520
solution but it's an incremental

677
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:06,430
defense-in-depth and that that's thanks

678
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,580
if that's it okay thank you for nanda

679
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:13,359
the virtual queue is Dave and Eric and

680
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:14,410
Geordie so Dave Dave Taylor the only

681
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,410
thing that you mentioned that gave me

682
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,759
pause is the bottom line on the slide

683
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,190
when you're talking about only accept

684
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,520
packets from you LA's or blink like oh

685
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,630
sorry

686
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,340
look there it sorry I was gonna say that

687
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:28,390
too but I figured that's probably what

688
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,820
you meant

689
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:33,100
that's what has a danger of operational

690
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:36,790
issues because the case that I'm worried

691
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:39,339
about is where the printer only has is

692
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:40,570
following this rule and the other device

693
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:43,690
that one that's trying to print to it is

694
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:45,160
on link and only has a GUI yeah but it's

695
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,840
on link and so you can where you could

696
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:49,000
open a discovery for it you know it was

697
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:50,980
on link okay and this could happen if

698
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:53,910
say one of those a slack only and then

699
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,290
the one is dhcpv6 only or there was some

700
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,580
time out when you were trying to do the

701
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:59,950
request or whatever so there's

702
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,110
operational issues and so if you were to

703
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,700
extend it to say or you have reason to

704
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:05,320
believe that it's on link because your

705
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,730
arrays or whatever on says it's not link

706
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,270
prefix you'd have less operational

707
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,780
problems

708
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:12,940
yeah and that I I certainly did think a

709
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,480
bit about that scenario I was thinking

710
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:19,740
more imagining a only device on another

711
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,270
subnet somewhere trying to reach this

712
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:25,629
but it seemed to me that sort of you

713
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:32,609
Ally has this notional it's internal

714
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:34,690
traffic so internal devices it yeah yeah

715
00:37:32,609 --> 00:37:38,049
okay Eric thank you

716
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:41,560
I see a major flow somewhere in your

717
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:46,180
approach you assume that ula or even

718
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:49,210
link-local are safe can be trusted and

719
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:52,390
it's not the case there is a printer on

720
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:56,050
this audience s ID here by the IETF

721
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:58,060
which can be acted by 1000 people so it

722
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:01,210
is the printer safer because it's using

723
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:03,130
you la vie for than a billion people on

724
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:05,859
the internet are surprised but typically

725
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:08,140
you will get a firewall so but whatever

726
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,710
is and then the other point is well you

727
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:16,799
la you see maybe a slash 64 or the slash

728
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:21,120
48 of your ula I would actually just

729
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,210
all seven it and then the last point

730
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:26,279
right maybe you know there is an attack

731
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:29,640
ipv4 to be sure but typically where you

732
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,190
were downloading a malware on your PC

733
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,810
and it was scanning inside so basically

734
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:35,460
to attack behind the net

735
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,480
so the same thing could apply your new

736
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:43,220
el ABC this this super mediated value is

737
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:47,100
thin but element of this I guess yeah I

738
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:49,080
it it's trying to be incrementally

739
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:52,380
better than what's out of the box you

740
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:54,740
know printer like this for example you

741
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:57,300
can we can lobby to have you know

742
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:00,689
fifteen different software developers

743
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:02,820
develop internet proof software if we

744
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:05,160
could get that to happen we wonderful we

745
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:06,600
wouldn't have any of these issues but

746
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,210
they just don't seem to be going well

747
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:12,000
and just for your information my slash

748
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,550
48 at home is fully open by the way yeah

749
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,650
yeah yeah scared for that one okay so

750
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:18,600
you met a point where I need to cap the

751
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,000
line we're gonna get no new people in

752
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:23,730
lines Jordi palette

753
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,640
most of what I was going to set has been

754
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:30,630
set already but my my general impression

755
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,830
is I am not really sure it's so clear

756
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:36,420
and so obvious to a vendor if a device

757
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:38,370
will be in that situation or not because

758
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,880
sometimes it depends on where you are

759
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:47,130
installing it and as a general comment

760
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:49,950
if we are trying to do security increase

761
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:52,380
with this I'll rather say it will be

762
00:39:49,950 --> 00:39:55,980
much better to improve the security in

763
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,860
the sense of mandating some kind of

764
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:02,700
firewall rules by default in devices or

765
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:07,740
in the sea peace I think that trying to

766
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:09,629
make you lace up a level in every

767
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,479
network that can have this kind of

768
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:15,690
devices is a big operational complexity

769
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,110
and in general I don't recommend it to

770
00:40:15,690 --> 00:40:21,930
my customers i I ask them to go away as

771
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:24,420
much as possible of you allies because

772
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:26,580
the reality from the operational

773
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,180
perspective is that it adds a lot of

774
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:29,180
complexity

775
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:36,759
hi Andrew mark thanks very much I must

776
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:39,850
say I was listening to this I'm kind of

777
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:41,290
on the fence here on the one hand I see

778
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:44,259
what you're trying to achieve on the

779
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:48,190
other hand I look at this and I go we've

780
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:50,710
lived for the last 25 years with the lie

781
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,690
that net is a security mechanism and

782
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:56,140
there is security through office keishon

783
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:59,800
and this to me would seem to propagate

784
00:40:56,140 --> 00:41:02,830
that lie which worries me it also

785
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:04,480
concerns me that if there is an attacker

786
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:06,460
and you implement something like this

787
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,260
although the lies going to do is look

788
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:10,900
for something with a global address on

789
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,510
the same network and he's going to come

790
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:15,160
in that way and I'm not sure that you

791
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:17,410
really gain anything

792
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,520
considering the operational complexity

793
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:24,670
that you introduce I do think that we

794
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,780
could look at a better security posture

795
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:31,330
on the CPS and the edge rather than

796
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,210
going through this I'd also say that I

797
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:36,069
for one don't trust my vendors to decide

798
00:41:34,210 --> 00:41:37,960
what needs to be on the internet or not

799
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:40,320
if I my coffee machine needs to be on

800
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:43,359
the internet that's my choice you know

801
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:46,840
support so just the thought - if you got

802
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,910
your Apple iPhone or your Android phone

803
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,590
plugged into the network here you're

804
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,960
trusting Apple and Google to be doing

805
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:54,760
that already because I haven't found a

806
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,740
firewall interface in my phone yet and

807
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,690
I'm sure no one else here has either so

808
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,368
this is actually sort of happening

809
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:02,500
already with the controversies about

810
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:04,420
centralized we got centralized device

811
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,740
security for a lot of our devices as it

812
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:11,350
is look I'm very much an advocate of

813
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,689
hosting I'm Steve elephant's distributed

814
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:16,330
firewalls paper from 1999 was a

815
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:20,740
mind-blowing thing to read about 15 20

816
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:23,500
years I'm tight so I'm talking about

817
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:25,419
host ones not networked ones so I'd like

818
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:29,320
to assume there's no network foil like

819
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,260
Eric's network this is sort of like a

820
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:37,510
very coarse viewpoint on that rather

821
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:39,550
than very distinct etc so I if we could

822
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:43,060
get people to develop implement very

823
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:43,810
discreet very effective per server space

824
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:46,450
firewall was in

825
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:53,470
in their house that would be a good

826
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:54,700
thing yeah I like the term boiling the

827
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:57,100
ocean I'm not saying that would be

828
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:59,430
boiling the ocean but it's it's turn up

829
00:42:57,100 --> 00:43:03,310
stove a bit

830
00:42:59,430 --> 00:43:04,569
David summer terrace erupting it's kind

831
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,430
of echoing some of the other what other

832
00:43:04,570 --> 00:43:07,990
people said but like like you said you

833
00:43:06,430 --> 00:43:09,669
know putting on your non-technical users

834
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:11,799
head on and trying to think from their

835
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:13,360
perspective is interesting different

836
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:16,210
examples you gave like printer in the

837
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,680
home or smart meters and I think if you

838
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,910
think of examples like smart meters it

839
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,379
makes sense because it's more

840
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,509
black-and-white at the same time you

841
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:24,040
have a very technical person managing

842
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:26,410
the networks and deploying then hosts

843
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,190
there right whereas if you think of a

844
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:32,290
printer scenario in consumers home

845
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,250
actually the is a lot more grey which I

846
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:35,440
think someone else can point it out

847
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:37,840
because usually these kinds of devices

848
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,670
which are marketed and sold to consumers

849
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,470
that don't know how to configure things

850
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:43,750
have all these like add on extra

851
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:46,120
features like print through the cloud or

852
00:43:43,750 --> 00:43:48,850
oh yeah my MA knows that right it's so

853
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,529
when as a non-technical person I want to

854
00:43:48,850 --> 00:43:52,450
enable this feature and if I get

855
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:55,270
delivered device which vendor says well

856
00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:56,410
most of our user base is in point to the

857
00:43:55,270 --> 00:43:58,450
internet stuff so we'll do you have a

858
00:43:56,410 --> 00:44:01,270
default I might go to my router and then

859
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,830
like open up the firewall so that it can

860
00:44:01,270 --> 00:44:04,810
talk to the Internet and then expect it

861
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,779
to work but then find out I have to go

862
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:10,000
read a book on how ula works in order to

863
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:12,190
get this to work the way it is supposed

864
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,600
to which I think you're trying to make

865
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,730
it easier for users but then you're

866
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,650
gonna make a harder for users to that

867
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:19,270
aren't technical at the same time which

868
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,530
is the operational complexity which I

869
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:26,230
think some people have pointed out as

870
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:30,390
well hi George I had kept the line you

871
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:33,310
ended the line yeah boy thanks easy

872
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:34,660
maybe look I'll finish on one thing and

873
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:36,220
I'm not really suggesting this but maybe

874
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,290
Google nature do sprinters like that

875
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,480
produce phones and Apple do to take care

876
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,600
of all our to our security anyway thank

877
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,600
you

878
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,929
[Music]

879
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:21,999
how how many people was in in Montreal

880
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:25,839
looking at this presentation just health

881
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:27,970
okay because I wanted to avoid repeating

882
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,230
everything but what I am going to do is

883
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:34,859
to to go quickly through it okay so what

884
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,859
is this about

885
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:43,559
oops this is not working as fullscreen

886
00:45:45,509 --> 00:46:00,720
okay more or less okay so what happens

887
00:45:55,509 --> 00:46:03,430
when when you have category not in

888
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,669
caches and content delivery networks is

889
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:08,980
that they do some kind of bypassing to

890
00:46:06,670 --> 00:46:13,140
avoid the car all the traffic going

891
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:18,579
through the category nut okay so we have

892
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:20,098
a case which I believe it's it's going

893
00:46:18,579 --> 00:46:23,799
to happen everywhere

894
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:25,900
we're under santino network alessandro

895
00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:29,099
which is one of the co-authors of the

896
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:32,410
document was saying hey I succeeded to

897
00:46:29,099 --> 00:46:33,249
implement ipv6 I want to use for six

898
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,308
Forex lat

899
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:39,430
but I have the problem that that will

900
00:46:36,309 --> 00:46:43,839
mean most of the traffic going to the to

901
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:46,808
the Syrians will become now ipv4 instead

902
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,499
of staying in ipv6 because which for six

903
00:46:46,809 --> 00:46:49,989
Forex lat

904
00:46:47,499 --> 00:46:54,839
it could be converted to two ipv4 right

905
00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:58,410
so why that happens if I can move this

906
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:58,410
correctly let's see

907
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:18,879
it should go war which full-screen and

908
00:47:08,289 --> 00:47:22,690
that's it okay interesting interesting

909
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,700
okay so the the the thing is that in a

910
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:27,609
typical four six four excel at

911
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:32,200
deployment you have the CP which has

912
00:47:27,609 --> 00:47:35,680
dual stack devices and then you have the

913
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:39,089
one link which is ipv6 only and then

914
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:42,549
this one link is connecting to both the

915
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:45,038
ipv6 internet and today people for

916
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:50,319
internet bill the not 64 okay and you

917
00:47:45,039 --> 00:47:53,950
have also DNS and maybe dns64 what

918
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,769
happens is that if we I guess you will

919
00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:03,009
need to go move this screen every slide

920
00:47:56,769 --> 00:48:07,598
when you have an ipv6 capable device the

921
00:48:03,009 --> 00:48:10,630
traffic from the LAN network in the user

922
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,720
will go this way so clearly because the

923
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:17,200
CDN is dual stack we will get dual stack

924
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:19,598
and sorry ipv6 and 2n okay so that's

925
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,859
that's the perfect case that's the ideal

926
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,799
situation now what happens if we have an

927
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:29,799
ipv4 only device and a very clear

928
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:34,390
example is Smart TVs or set-top boxes is

929
00:48:29,799 --> 00:48:38,759
that even if the CDN is dual stack god

930
00:48:34,390 --> 00:48:43,569
the set-top boxes looking is for an ipv4

931
00:48:38,759 --> 00:48:46,359
address and of course the dns64 and the

932
00:48:43,569 --> 00:48:49,720
next 64 will give him and I pin for

933
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:54,430
dressed so we will be using all the way

934
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:57,669
through for that flow then at 64 even if

935
00:48:54,430 --> 00:49:00,578
we have already converted that to a TV

936
00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:04,269
sixth as the green part of the of the

937
00:49:00,579 --> 00:49:06,849
arrow but we will convert it again to

938
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:08,618
ipv4 okay it don't make any sense it

939
00:49:06,849 --> 00:49:11,680
doesn't make any sense because we could

940
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:14,289
probably find a way for the already

941
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,990
converted to a pv6 traffic to keep going

942
00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:20,330
as

943
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:23,089
ipv6 to the CDN so this will be the idea

944
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:26,119
the idea will will be to keep the

945
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:32,600
already converted by the silat so it's a

946
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:35,690
nut for six to keep going until the CDN

947
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:37,850
as ipv6 instead of converting twice in

948
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:40,070
the nat64 and of course that means that

949
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:43,430
all that traffic that go to the CDN

950
00:49:40,070 --> 00:49:45,740
probably about 60 65 percent seventy

951
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,740
percent of the traffic will not go

952
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:53,000
through the nat64 which is already a lot

953
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:57,200
of traffic now this is the situation I I

954
00:49:53,000 --> 00:50:00,950
already mentioned for set of boxes Smart

955
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:05,470
TVs which very few of them will go like

956
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:10,810
this like all ipv6 n2n there will be

957
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:15,410
okay there will be others which are not

958
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:17,810
using ipv6 and there is still a lot of

959
00:50:15,410 --> 00:50:19,970
Smart TVs I check it with several Smart

960
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:22,820
TV vendors and they are not going to

961
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:25,189
date them so unless you buy a new Smart

962
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:27,260
even two years from now they all wants

963
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:30,920
most of the time will not get updated to

964
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:31,609
support ipv6 they will go this this way

965
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:33,920
okay

966
00:50:31,609 --> 00:50:37,700
so they will do a translation a

967
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,340
stateless translation in the salaat ipv4

968
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:43,220
to ipv6 and then again a stateful

969
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:44,630
translation in the indian at 64 from

970
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,910
ipv6 to AP before

971
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:51,760
again no sense because we have a

972
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:55,310
dualistic CDN so what we want to do is

973
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:57,230
to conserve somehow that translation

974
00:50:55,310 --> 00:51:02,140
that has been done already by the CP and

975
00:50:57,230 --> 00:51:05,240
and keep going as ipv6 until the Syria

976
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:09,740
work it out three possible approaches

977
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:12,370
for this one of them is a DNS routing

978
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:18,680
based solution which means basically

979
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:21,470
that the CDN should provide addresses

980
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,569
from the well-known prefix or the

981
00:51:21,470 --> 00:51:27,259
network specific traffic's depending on

982
00:51:23,570 --> 00:51:29,570
which one is using their ISP so that

983
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:33,680
will just work okay that's one approach

984
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:35,150
but it has some some issues that we have

985
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,569
described it in the document and it

986
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:40,160
seems it's not the best way to do that

987
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:42,640
in fact when we have been talking with

988
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,620
different CDN providers some of them

989
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,779
maybe will do that but some others said

990
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,730
no we are not going to do that okay it

991
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:51,800
adds a lot of complexity to our

992
00:51:49,730 --> 00:51:54,080
operations and and we don't want to do

993
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:58,190
that way so we have a second approach

994
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:01,730
which is using explicit address mapping

995
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,770
tables okay this is already define it I

996
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:05,240
don't remember the receipt number but

997
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,030
it's something that is being used

998
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:15,020
already for some time ago and the idea

999
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:17,660
is that not 64 the still happened and

1000
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:22,100
under C they are already doing all the

1001
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:26,410
DNS thing so because the C is also the

1002
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:29,509
proxy we can have an internal mapping

1003
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:34,660
automatically created okay so the idea

1004
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:40,370
is that by looking into the traffic flow

1005
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:43,100
the CP can guess is not for sure but it

1006
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:47,950
can guess that a device is an IP before

1007
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:53,390
only device and if it can guess that

1008
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:57,770
then he can create an entry to make this

1009
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:59,509
magic okay if the guess is not done

1010
00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:01,640
correctly we are not breaking anything

1011
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,020
the traffic will be converted twice but

1012
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,270
we are not breaking anything

1013
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:10,730
so that's that's the interesting point

1014
00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:14,750
here so this is an example so we have a

1015
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:15,440
website that has an a tracker and a quad

1016
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:19,520
what

1017
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:22,340
record we there will be an entry created

1018
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:24,980
to link the a record with the equity

1019
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:27,700
records so automatically when this

1020
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:30,830
device is trying to look for the a

1021
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:34,600
record it will automatically go to the

1022
00:53:30,830 --> 00:53:37,580
AP v6 thing right

1023
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:39,200
we have went already into several

1024
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,819
versions of this document I think this

1025
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,649
is version number four because we

1026
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:45,050
discovered several things that may

1027
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:48,320
happen for example one of the things

1028
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:52,760
that was discovered is maybe there is

1029
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:57,170
not a single ipv6 address matching a

1030
00:53:52,760 --> 00:54:01,130
single ipv4 one so Indo in that case we

1031
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:03,290
are just discarding the translation we

1032
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:09,710
are not trying to optimize the traffic

1033
00:54:03,290 --> 00:54:11,840
in order to avoid that okay well this is

1034
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:14,210
a little bit of of the explanation of

1035
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:19,040
all the details that we have work it out

1036
00:54:14,210 --> 00:54:21,470
and this is the change that we have done

1037
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:23,300
in the last review so this is the

1038
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:26,689
important view you already have read

1039
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:30,940
this draft before this version there was

1040
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:35,030
a very extensive email from Eric nearing

1041
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:39,110
and we have some some private email

1042
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:42,710
exchange he was saying basically that if

1043
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:46,100
we do this way this is not sufficient in

1044
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:49,250
order to ensure that individual

1045
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:51,140
applications are also able to keep the

1046
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:55,190
existing connections so we may be

1047
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:58,040
breaking the operations of the CDN okay

1048
00:54:55,190 --> 00:55:01,760
so he was suggesting basically what with

1049
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:04,910
it that instead of using the explicit

1050
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:07,520
address mapping for just creating the

1051
00:55:04,910 --> 00:55:11,569
DNS connection from the a record to the

1052
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:16,370
quad a record we just make possible to

1053
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:19,850
create a stateful NAT entry among those

1054
00:55:16,370 --> 00:55:23,660
two addresses okay so that means that

1055
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:26,029
even if the DNS change depending on TTLs

1056
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:27,920
or whatever happens the existing

1057
00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:29,329
connections will still survive he was

1058
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:32,119
mentioning the example of

1059
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:34,640
that if you keep changing that obviously

1060
00:55:32,119 --> 00:55:36,829
the video will meet to restart recover

1061
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,700
and so on and you will be breaking it

1062
00:55:36,829 --> 00:55:43,039
old all the way so that that's basically

1063
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,769
the thing that we change it

1064
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:49,640
I don't think ok we have one additional

1065
00:55:45,769 --> 00:55:52,910
approach which is instead of the CPE

1066
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:57,200
creating these explicit address mapping

1067
00:55:52,910 --> 00:55:59,390
tables we can do something and we have

1068
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:00,769
not done too much work on that because

1069
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:04,759
we don't believe this is the best

1070
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:08,988
approach we can do something so the ISP

1071
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:13,789
sent to the CPS or the C piece query

1072
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:17,269
from the ISP the explicit mappings the

1073
00:56:13,789 --> 00:56:20,569
problem with that is how we make sure

1074
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:23,209
that those mappings are getting updated

1075
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:25,279
fast enough to accommodate to CDN

1076
00:56:23,209 --> 00:56:29,109
changes so that's the reason we don't

1077
00:56:25,279 --> 00:56:32,719
believe this is a possible available

1078
00:56:29,109 --> 00:56:35,479
approach and it has also the complexity

1079
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:38,259
on looking for which protocol we use for

1080
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:42,259
doing those signaling between the CP

1081
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:44,089
with the isp and so on and I think

1082
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:46,309
that's it

1083
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:51,259
well there is one additional detail I

1084
00:56:46,309 --> 00:56:54,140
almost forgot today you can move it a

1085
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:57,469
little bit high fret you can move it a

1086
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:59,598
little bit high so there is one

1087
00:56:57,469 --> 00:57:02,959
additional interesting thing that we

1088
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,449
just at the moment have as a common in

1089
00:57:02,959 --> 00:57:08,499
the in the document which is that today

1090
00:57:05,449 --> 00:57:13,940
we don't have any solution for having

1091
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:18,140
ipv6 only services talking which ipv4

1092
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:23,809
only devices now if we go for this

1093
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:27,680
optimization and we create let me go up

1094
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:29,690
if we create a fake a record no no the

1095
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,739
previous is light but the bottom part

1096
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:40,459
yeah that one if we create a fake a

1097
00:57:33,739 --> 00:57:42,860
record in an ipv6 only service we are

1098
00:57:40,459 --> 00:57:45,770
not breaking anything because anyway

1099
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:49,130
a IP before devices are not able to use

1100
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:52,490
that service but if the CP has this

1101
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,910
optimization it will work ok so we

1102
00:57:52,490 --> 00:57:57,799
believe we don't break anything but

1103
00:57:54,910 --> 00:58:08,440
instead we are providing a solution for

1104
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:15,800
those ipv4 only devices and that's it ok

1105
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:17,420
so comment Tomatoes ok I don't see

1106
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,530
anybody charging the mic we'll go to

1107
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,530
your next presentation

1108
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:33,259
maybe yep yeah go for it Julia I'm not

1109
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:38,240
going to reiterate everything I said in

1110
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:41,690
Montreal about fake DNS records but I

1111
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:44,240
have to ask considering everything that

1112
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:47,060
was said in Montreal about fake a

1113
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:48,770
records what's changed since then

1114
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:53,930
because if I remember correctly there

1115
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:57,020
was quite a queue about that I I think I

1116
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:59,750
think the Kiwi was not for that part of

1117
00:58:57,020 --> 00:59:03,470
the of the graph it was for the other

1118
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:06,560
for the other part and I think we which

1119
00:59:03,470 --> 00:59:09,560
which what Eric the inputs from Eric I

1120
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:11,540
think we have resolved it it we are

1121
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,270
waiting for for inputs from from other

1122
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:17,259
people but it sounds like you don't like

1123
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:21,110
fake a records is that a fair statement

1124
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:24,080
yeah but in any case that's that's an on

1125
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:25,640
to the draft so in fact my suggestion is

1126
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:32,480
probably that need to move to another

1127
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:35,900
draft a different place hi third notch

1128
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:37,400
Akamai I'm real quick about this is I'm

1129
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:40,850
wondering if we should also be

1130
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:44,240
consulting with the folks who are

1131
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:48,589
looking at shifting DNS away from the

1132
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:51,109
the local ISPs and consulting with them

1133
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:54,890
about the activities around that that a

1134
00:59:51,110 --> 00:59:55,790
number of the application and/or browser

1135
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:58,250
vendors

1136
00:59:55,790 --> 01:00:00,740
are currently investigating because that

1137
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:04,760
has a potential to significantly impact

1138
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:06,919
these technologies we we have already a

1139
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:10,970
specific section in the document about

1140
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:15,160
that and basically our conclusion is if

1141
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:17,480
you are not using the DNS from the ISP

1142
01:00:15,160 --> 01:00:20,000
you will not take advantage of the

1143
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:28,130
optimization but the optimization is not

1144
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:34,970
breaking it see at home from telecom in

1145
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:38,810
some countries is a closed network which

1146
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:42,020
means that does not have any connection

1147
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:46,960
with public denied so I think that's

1148
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:46,960
this kind of scenario should be included

1149
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:55,910
the point is in those cases are those

1150
01:00:52,580 --> 01:01:02,420
services already ipv6 enable as well

1151
01:00:55,910 --> 01:01:10,549
no no then it's not difficult to upgrade

1152
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:13,490
the CPE to support ipv6 but that's

1153
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:17,390
that's my point if they that close

1154
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:19,930
network for IP TV services is not ipv6

1155
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:23,839
enable we don't have an impact on that

1156
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:28,399
okay so Jordi let me take you back to

1157
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:31,790
Jarrod's comment bypassing the ISP you

1158
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:36,590
basically argued that the optimisation

1159
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:38,770
wouldn't break anything in the same case

1160
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:42,470
but in an enterprise environment

1161
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:46,009
Enterprise often have very specific

1162
01:01:42,470 --> 01:01:49,910
rules about DNS and are actually pretty

1163
01:01:46,010 --> 01:01:52,940
concerned about do H and do T because

1164
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:55,879
they bypass the corporate in information

1165
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:59,150
security policy and so there has been

1166
01:01:55,880 --> 01:02:03,890
some work done in chrome and in in

1167
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:08,420
Firefox in order to not not break that

1168
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:09,720
so is it sufficient to say well yeah but

1169
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:14,730
I didn't break anything

1170
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:16,288
I think you may have I can mess with the

1171
01:02:14,730 --> 01:02:18,930
information security polls

1172
01:02:16,289 --> 01:02:21,960
I can check I can check again but my

1173
01:02:18,930 --> 01:02:25,680
observation is that if you are not using

1174
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:28,079
the DNS from the ISP the optimization

1175
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:31,410
will not work ISP in this case being the

1176
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:34,559
enterprise the enterprise exactly so

1177
01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:36,180
that's that's why I say if the CPE is

1178
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:39,180
not able to do optimization because

1179
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:42,598
there is not a possibility to use the

1180
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:44,578
DNS from the from the ISP you are not

1181
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:47,039
breaking it you are not changing the

1182
01:02:44,579 --> 01:02:48,420
existing situation right you don't apply

1183
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,210
the optimization that might be a

1184
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:53,849
question of viewpoint I can I can double

1185
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:57,059
check again but but we have look at into

1186
01:02:53,849 --> 01:03:01,349
that several times yeah okay anybody

1187
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:03,690
else failing that then let's move on to

1188
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:05,730
yeah and and do me a favor

1189
01:03:03,690 --> 01:03:09,240
I I think I may have gotten this right

1190
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:13,410
so click on that see if maybe it's

1191
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:15,930
working yeah let's see much better okay

1192
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:18,868
so I present it also this document in uh

1193
01:03:15,930 --> 01:03:22,169
in Montreal and I updated it because I

1194
01:03:18,869 --> 01:03:24,029
got comments from Eric I think and Marc

1195
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:25,650
and someone else I don't remember I

1196
01:03:24,029 --> 01:03:29,250
think I got comments for him from at

1197
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:32,970
least two or three people this document

1198
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:35,279
I started initially in 2006 at that time

1199
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:40,680
not not too many people was paying

1200
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:42,779
attention to that but I realize it after

1201
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:44,759
a few years that a lot of people is

1202
01:03:42,779 --> 01:03:48,750
using what I was trying to say in the

1203
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:49,559
document from 2006 and in fact there is

1204
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:53,339
explicit

1205
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:56,460
dhcpv6 prefix delegation option to

1206
01:03:53,339 --> 01:03:58,920
exclude that prefix so that goes a small

1207
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:01,770
part of my original document from 2006

1208
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:05,160
which is okay let's get to customers

1209
01:04:01,770 --> 01:04:07,410
last 48 and let's use the first as last

1210
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:09,960
64 for the for the point-to-point link

1211
01:04:07,410 --> 01:04:15,390
for the Wan link okay so there is

1212
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:18,029
already a document that that is using

1213
01:04:15,390 --> 01:04:20,279
that but is not describe it in any other

1214
01:04:18,029 --> 01:04:22,319
place so that document is just saying

1215
01:04:20,279 --> 01:04:24,030
okay you can exclude the prefix for what

1216
01:04:22,319 --> 01:04:27,990
it's not explained

1217
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:30,080
for what okay so what I am trying to do

1218
01:04:27,990 --> 01:04:33,990
in this document is to explain that and

1219
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:38,520
take a novel review about how we can do

1220
01:04:33,990 --> 01:04:41,370
point-to-point links so summary we start

1221
01:04:38,520 --> 01:04:45,450
the document saying that yes RFC's seven

1222
01:04:41,370 --> 01:04:47,759
six one six four describes that one of

1223
01:04:45,450 --> 01:04:50,850
the possibilities is one two seven and

1224
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:53,460
that document which is being misread by

1225
01:04:50,850 --> 01:04:55,529
a lot of people is not saying that's the

1226
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:58,440
only way that's the mandatory way that

1227
01:04:55,530 --> 01:05:00,900
document is that must be supported by

1228
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:03,720
routers okay so there is not a very

1229
01:05:00,900 --> 01:05:06,600
clear idea because the people read that

1230
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:08,490
document like hey I need to use one two

1231
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:12,060
seven not that's not what the document

1232
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:14,310
is saying so I clarify that and again

1233
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:17,130
that document of course is not excluding

1234
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:19,620
other options and in fact I I keep doing

1235
01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:26,120
a survey among ISPs that are deploying

1236
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:29,970
ipv6 and about 62% of them are using

1237
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:33,120
slash 64 instead of a slash 1 to 7 62

1238
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:37,529
percent is a lot it's not just peanuts

1239
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:40,049
ok a new section in the document that

1240
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:42,480
somehow was suggested by Eric and also

1241
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:45,750
mark provided some some inputs on that

1242
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:47,520
is reviewing again the ping pong problem

1243
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:49,740
ok because that was the main reason for

1244
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:53,280
the previous documents to go into into

1245
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:57,149
that then we describe the different

1246
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:59,730
perfect choices like as last 64

1247
01:05:57,150 --> 01:06:03,000
I added some text with reference to

1248
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:07,980
mitigations for that added some text for

1249
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:09,720
the slash 127 to ensure that if that's

1250
01:06:07,980 --> 01:06:13,230
being you said you need to make sure

1251
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:15,450
that both endpoints are using the 1 2 7

1252
01:06:13,230 --> 01:06:19,440
otherwise you still have the same ping

1253
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:22,080
pong problem I added a reference to 1 to

1254
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,570
6 I think Fred asked it for that because

1255
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:28,370
he was surprised that people was using 1

1256
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:28,370
to 6 or somebody asking for that and

1257
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:36,300
additional small changes in that section

1258
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:37,460
then we change it a little bit also this

1259
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:40,310
section

1260
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:42,440
I was using addressing pipes and it was

1261
01:06:40,310 --> 01:06:45,350
a suggestion to say addressing scopes

1262
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:49,270
well I seen some documents type scopes

1263
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:52,069
but yeah I am fine so keep it scopes

1264
01:06:49,270 --> 01:06:56,180
global unicast addresses almost didn't

1265
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:58,750
change it maybe some typos in the UL s

1266
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:03,950
section I added a split reference to RFC

1267
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:06,440
675 to link local I was using a number

1268
01:07:03,950 --> 01:07:08,060
it and yes again some people is using a

1269
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:09,920
number it but it's true is not correct

1270
01:07:08,060 --> 01:07:12,650
so we changed that to link local

1271
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,190
addresses only and then we go also to

1272
01:07:12,650 --> 01:07:19,730
describe what are the options for the

1273
01:07:16,190 --> 01:07:20,810
prefix pool including what I just

1274
01:07:19,730 --> 01:07:23,330
mentioned at the beginning which is

1275
01:07:20,810 --> 01:07:26,690
using the first slash 64 from the

1276
01:07:23,330 --> 01:07:30,680
customer prefix whatever is the last 48

1277
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:32,830
or is less 56 or whatever this is a

1278
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:35,690
picture about some of the data that I

1279
01:07:32,830 --> 01:07:38,240
before like the the number of people

1280
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:40,580
that is using at the 62% of people that

1281
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:44,509
is using already is last 64 instead of

1282
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:46,819
slash 1 to 7 and that's it basically so

1283
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:49,070
so not not measure changes in the

1284
01:07:46,820 --> 01:07:54,370
document just updating some sections

1285
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:54,370
clarifying some text and that's it

1286
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:06,530
questions ok once again I don't see

1287
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:09,830
people charging the mic so our next

1288
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:12,260
presentation thank you next presentation

1289
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:14,660
is gonna be remote Fernando's online

1290
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,550
somewhere in Fernando I think you

1291
01:08:14,660 --> 01:08:21,250
actually need to click on something in

1292
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:21,250
order to meet oh there you are

1293
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:30,920
ok so and I'm getting your slides I

1294
01:08:29,330 --> 01:08:34,040
don't know if he in the orderly in the

1295
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:35,750
agenda was the CPE first and then the

1296
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:39,819
slacker unum can we do the problem

1297
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:39,819
statement first sure

1298
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:50,858
so we're we have very go

1299
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:35,319
I'm sure this is intended to be easy to

1300
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:41,000
use so so that one okay so I'm on your

1301
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:44,660
heading the slide perfect to you I'm

1302
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,180
Kryon I will be presenting a document on

1303
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:50,029
the reaction of slack to flash

1304
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:54,380
remembering events you might remember

1305
01:09:50,029 --> 01:09:56,480
that at the prior IDF meeting both in

1306
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:58,940
six-man and basic swabs we had been

1307
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,389
discussing this topic at the time we had

1308
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:05,299
a single draft that essentially had the

1309
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:07,610
program statement discussed operational

1310
01:10:05,300 --> 01:10:11,810
mitigations and also discussed like

1311
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:14,299
possible protocol improvements based on

1312
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:17,240
the feedback that we received since then

1313
01:10:14,300 --> 01:10:19,340
what we did is split the original

1314
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,639
document into three different documents

1315
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:24,770
so this is the first piece of it which

1316
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:30,490
essentially just contains the problem

1317
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:33,500
statement so next one so essentially

1318
01:10:30,490 --> 01:10:36,800
there are a number of scenarios in which

1319
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:39,170
you might face a flash remembering event

1320
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,390
which essentially means that all out of

1321
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:45,020
the sudden a prefix becomes invalid and

1322
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:47,570
a new Ballad prefix is introduced of

1323
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:50,030
course that means that the host will end

1324
01:10:47,570 --> 01:10:54,230
up with stale network configuration

1325
01:10:50,030 --> 01:10:56,719
information and ipv6 connectivity will

1326
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:59,959
normally fail obviously in cases where

1327
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:04,850
happy eyeballs is employed that will

1328
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:12,110
mean that ipv4 will be employed instead

1329
01:11:04,850 --> 01:11:14,900
of ipv6 next slide so in most of the

1330
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:16,420
discussion that we had on the on the

1331
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:19,160
mailing list

1332
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:19,790
many people were focusing on a single

1333
01:11:19,160 --> 01:11:23,870
scenario

1334
01:11:19,790 --> 01:11:26,780
you where essentially you have a nice P

1335
01:11:23,870 --> 01:11:30,440
that is providing dynamic prefixes to

1336
01:11:26,780 --> 01:11:33,590
users and SE p router crashes and

1337
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:38,320
reboots and that's when the flash

1338
01:11:33,590 --> 01:11:40,940
remembering event is phased but actually

1339
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:45,440
in the document we were covering like

1340
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:48,259
several examples for example there's a

1341
01:11:45,440 --> 01:11:51,200
possible scenario where is switchboard

1342
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:53,840
is moved to a different villain in that

1343
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:57,320
case that never will face a flash

1344
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:59,180
remembering event it could also happen

1345
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:03,710
that for example the net worries

1346
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:08,660
partition so when the RAS are sent by

1347
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:12,290
the routers to essentially invalidate or

1348
01:12:08,660 --> 01:12:15,889
replicate the the prefixes those are

1349
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:18,740
lost so essentially when the

1350
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:22,730
productivity is resumed you will face

1351
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:25,790
the flash remembering event - there are

1352
01:12:22,730 --> 01:12:27,740
scenarios where you might be manually

1353
01:12:25,790 --> 01:12:30,650
configuring your network and you just

1354
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:33,260
change network configuration you just

1355
01:12:30,650 --> 01:12:36,410
kill the demon and start it again and

1356
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:39,950
and restarted and that would also mean a

1357
01:12:36,410 --> 01:12:42,380
flash remembering event and then last

1358
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:44,840
but not but not least there's the

1359
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,850
scenario that health has been mostly

1360
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:51,110
discussed discussed on the mailing list

1361
01:12:46,850 --> 01:12:54,620
which is the case where CPU router for

1362
01:12:51,110 --> 01:12:58,610
example crashes and reboots and you know

1363
01:12:54,620 --> 01:13:01,930
since the ISP is doing dynamic prefixes

1364
01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:05,059
the CPE gets a different prefix and

1365
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:12,320
again the flash remembering event of

1366
01:13:05,060 --> 01:13:16,700
course just as a note short adidas RV on

1367
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:19,280
on ISPs and he included a question on

1368
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:23,300
whether ISPs were doing dynamic or

1369
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:28,000
stable prefixes and 37% of them were

1370
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:31,960
doing dynamic prefixes okay next slide

1371
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,589
so what does this document do

1372
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:36,469
essentially as I

1373
01:13:33,589 --> 01:13:38,119
mentioned before we originally had a

1374
01:13:36,469 --> 01:13:42,019
single document that tried to do

1375
01:13:38,119 --> 01:13:44,629
everything analyze the problem also

1376
01:13:42,019 --> 01:13:47,149
discuss possible operational mediations

1377
01:13:44,629 --> 01:13:50,300
and also discuss possible protocol

1378
01:13:47,149 --> 01:13:53,959
updates to improve the reaction of slag

1379
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:57,019
to renumbering events and based on the

1380
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:59,260
feedback that we received we ended up

1381
01:13:57,019 --> 01:14:02,389
splitting the document into three pieces

1382
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:07,189
now this specific piece that we are

1383
01:14:02,389 --> 01:14:11,869
discussing here essentially analyzes the

1384
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:15,109
this problem describes some operational

1385
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:17,509
mitigations for example in the specific

1386
01:14:15,109 --> 01:14:20,239
case were that I was referring to

1387
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:22,939
regarding the CPU router noting that if

1388
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:24,978
you were doing stable prefixes of course

1389
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:28,999
the Prophet the problem would be

1390
01:14:24,979 --> 01:14:31,729
mitigated and also that you might

1391
01:14:28,999 --> 01:14:34,369
operationally tweak the lifestyles that

1392
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:37,219
you use for the pios options that you

1393
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:40,398
ever tries in the erase so obviously

1394
01:14:37,219 --> 01:14:42,499
that wouldnt avoid problem but would

1395
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:46,280
limit the amount of time during which

1396
01:14:42,499 --> 01:14:49,429
this problem persists

1397
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:51,169
unless this document essentially points

1398
01:14:49,429 --> 01:14:53,719
to the other two documents noting that

1399
01:14:51,169 --> 01:14:55,099
okay this is the problem there are some

1400
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:58,729
things that you know you might do

1401
01:14:55,099 --> 01:15:05,209
operationally but probably there is work

1402
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:08,269
to do in other areas next slide so you

1403
01:15:05,209 --> 01:15:09,919
know so far I think that you know when

1404
01:15:08,269 --> 01:15:13,269
it comes to the problem statement the

1405
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:16,818
document is pretty stable so our

1406
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:21,289
question as authors is whether this is

1407
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:24,189
something that you know false feel that

1408
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:24,188
we should be working on

1409
01:15:32,790 --> 01:15:41,950
do use the same mic I don't know Fred

1410
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:44,320
that's asking a lot Barbour Stark 80 I

1411
01:15:41,950 --> 01:15:46,840
actually think this is a good idea thank

1412
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:48,580
you for an end oh and thank you for

1413
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:51,820
putting up with all the discussion on

1414
01:15:48,580 --> 01:15:56,200
all the lists boy you've got more

1415
01:15:51,820 --> 01:16:01,389
staying power than I do I'd like to see

1416
01:15:56,200 --> 01:16:03,670
it move forward Journal in Cola

1417
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:05,410
yeah I agree this is a problem and I

1418
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:07,330
actually like the document and the

1419
01:16:05,410 --> 01:16:08,980
current form when it's not going into

1420
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:10,900
like how we're going to change the

1421
01:16:08,980 --> 01:16:12,700
protocol to fixes but talks about

1422
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:15,820
operational problem and operational

1423
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:22,389
solutions yes sir I Thanks for writing

1424
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:24,429
it yeah I think we're out of this okay

1425
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:25,990
so I don't see other people charging the

1426
01:16:24,430 --> 01:16:30,930
mic I'm gonna move you to your next

1427
01:16:25,990 --> 01:16:30,929
presentation Fernando okay

1428
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:13,210
okay okay the second presentation is

1429
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,799
about the other piece of the document

1430
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:19,870
the second piece of the document where

1431
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:22,900
we were trying to essentially provide

1432
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:25,480
recommendations to CPU routers to try to

1433
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:30,879
behave nicely in the event of renewing

1434
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:33,540
events next slide so this is a typical

1435
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:37,350
residential ipv6 deployment of course

1436
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:39,519
there's a CPU router doing the ACP

1437
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:42,100
version six perfect delegation with the

1438
01:17:39,520 --> 01:17:48,970
ISP and is doing slack on the local

1439
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:51,640
network next slide so what happens in

1440
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:54,720
many scenarios is that when for example

1441
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:58,990
with a CPU Robert crashes and reboots

1442
01:17:54,720 --> 01:18:01,090
and the seat and the CPU rudder does the

1443
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:03,820
ACP prefix delegation again

1444
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:07,600
it gets a different prefix but the thing

1445
01:18:03,820 --> 01:18:11,170
is that if the CPU router doesn't record

1446
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:14,320
on stable storage the prefixes that it

1447
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:17,950
has been delegated before it doesn't

1448
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:20,110
have the knowledge to actually these try

1449
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:22,780
to disable or duplicate the prefix on

1450
01:18:20,110 --> 01:18:26,610
the local network of course in that case

1451
01:18:22,780 --> 01:18:29,139
the hosts end up with stale that were

1452
01:18:26,610 --> 01:18:31,299
configuration information and you know

1453
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:34,420
the problem that we were discussing

1454
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:40,570
before you know applies and is facing

1455
01:18:34,420 --> 01:18:42,280
here next slide so what this document

1456
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:45,570
tries to do is essentially provides

1457
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:49,120
recommendations to CPA routers to behave

1458
01:18:45,570 --> 01:18:52,200
nicely in the event of renumbering

1459
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:54,099
events in some of the cases it's

1460
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:56,530
recommendations that are taken from

1461
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:58,690
protocol specs or other documents for

1462
01:18:56,530 --> 01:19:02,710
example one of the things that these

1463
01:18:58,690 --> 01:19:04,929
documents says is that CPU routers must

1464
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:06,790
face out like stale network

1465
01:19:04,930 --> 01:19:08,580
configuration information that's

1466
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:12,460
actually already in RFC

1467
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:15,010
7080 for the thing that we are adding in

1468
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:17,650
this document is to require the

1469
01:19:15,010 --> 01:19:19,989
delegated prefixes to be store on stable

1470
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:22,379
storage because if they are not

1471
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:24,909
essentially open Russian tribute event

1472
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:28,030
the CPU rotor will not have the

1473
01:19:24,909 --> 01:19:32,530
necessary knowledge to do that

1474
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:35,259
another thing is a requirement that the

1475
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:37,300
CPU rotor essentially implements the the

1476
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:39,849
proper prefix delegation and slack

1477
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:42,909
interface essentially meaning that the

1478
01:19:39,849 --> 01:19:48,150
life times that are used by slack never

1479
01:19:42,909 --> 01:19:52,659
span past the DHCP prefix lifetime

1480
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:56,469
that's a requirement in the DHCP version

1481
01:19:52,659 --> 01:19:59,289
six specification already the final one

1482
01:19:56,469 --> 01:20:01,300
that we have in this light is that it

1483
01:19:59,289 --> 01:20:04,869
has been reported to us I think it was

1484
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:10,599
Ted lemon that reported this that some

1485
01:20:04,869 --> 01:20:15,249
boxes when you when you reboot them they

1486
01:20:10,599 --> 01:20:19,900
send the HTTP version 6 release meaning

1487
01:20:15,249 --> 01:20:24,610
that even if open a reboot event the CPU

1488
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:27,339
router would get the same prefix since

1489
01:20:24,610 --> 01:20:30,429
the city router did their release then

1490
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:32,769
in that case it will probably get a

1491
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:34,269
different perfect this time if I

1492
01:20:32,769 --> 01:20:37,860
remember correctly

1493
01:20:34,269 --> 01:20:40,929
Ted lemon had posted you know other

1494
01:20:37,860 --> 01:20:44,438
suggestions on other things that the the

1495
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:48,219
CPU routers you know should probably be

1496
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:51,249
doing so this is essentially like a very

1497
01:20:48,219 --> 01:20:53,499
preliminary list of some of the things

1498
01:20:51,249 --> 01:20:57,599
that we would expect from from CPU

1499
01:20:53,499 --> 01:20:57,599
routers next slide

1500
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:03,489
so as before of course these the the

1501
01:21:01,689 --> 01:21:06,519
list of recommendations that we had in

1502
01:21:03,489 --> 01:21:11,409
the previous slide can be augmented but

1503
01:21:06,519 --> 01:21:13,689
I guess a more basic question is you

1504
01:21:11,409 --> 01:21:17,289
know whether it's worth doing it and

1505
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:20,249
whether for us as authors whether Forks

1506
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:27,130
on the working group think this is a

1507
01:21:20,249 --> 01:21:29,110
document worth working on with this you

1508
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:31,519
have a document insects fan that's

1509
01:21:29,110 --> 01:21:34,558
correct yeah

1510
01:21:31,519 --> 01:21:37,070
so Jordy and then I'm sorry I don't know

1511
01:21:34,559 --> 01:21:37,070
your name

1512
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:45,799
Fernando I I think you are too

1513
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:50,639
optimistic quiz the recommendation that

1514
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:54,690
CP bender should save the information in

1515
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:56,909
stable storage I wish it happens but it

1516
01:21:54,690 --> 01:22:01,469
will not it will not because doing that

1517
01:21:56,909 --> 01:22:04,379
increase a lot the price of the of the

1518
01:22:01,469 --> 01:22:07,650
CP and this kind of cities typically are

1519
01:22:04,380 --> 01:22:12,719
meant to be very very cheap there are

1520
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:15,780
many kinds of flash memories and some of

1521
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:18,269
them are meant to basically be able to

1522
01:22:15,780 --> 01:22:20,670
reflash it a few times and after that

1523
01:22:18,269 --> 01:22:24,900
they will fail they will not work

1524
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:28,320
anymore so asking the Bender's to to be

1525
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:32,098
able to save a prefix once per week or

1526
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:36,268
once per month I don't really think it

1527
01:22:32,099 --> 01:22:39,059
will succeed so I rather think we should

1528
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:41,519
go for a different solution and in

1529
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:45,059
addition to that the problem is always

1530
01:22:41,519 --> 01:22:49,889
that even if we finally decide to go in

1531
01:22:45,059 --> 01:22:51,929
that direction I am NOT optimistic that

1532
01:22:49,889 --> 01:22:53,099
the people will update the CPS in fact

1533
01:22:51,929 --> 01:22:55,380
one of the problems that we are having

1534
01:22:53,099 --> 01:22:57,900
with AP v6 deployment is that most of

1535
01:22:55,380 --> 01:23:01,260
the vendors don't provide new versions

1536
01:22:57,900 --> 01:23:04,670
of of filler for the CPS and that's the

1537
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:08,219
same for the transition mechanism so I

1538
01:23:04,670 --> 01:23:10,199
rather think that we should look much

1539
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:14,130
better for a solution from the DHCP

1540
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:17,250
server or something like that I would

1541
01:23:14,130 --> 01:23:21,300
say that - I probably agree a lot with

1542
01:23:17,250 --> 01:23:23,099
what you're saying but well we were you

1543
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:23,820
know discussing the topic and possible

1544
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:27,539
solutions

1545
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:29,518
there were Forks arguing you know it

1546
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:33,989
would be nice if the CPS we're doing

1547
01:23:29,519 --> 01:23:36,119
this and so what we came up with is a

1548
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:39,178
set of let's say recommendations such

1549
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:42,750
such that if you are a vendor a CPU

1550
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:45,090
router vendor and you want to behave

1551
01:23:42,750 --> 01:23:50,099
more nicely to these events okay

1552
01:23:45,090 --> 01:23:52,290
is what you know you should be doing but

1553
01:23:50,099 --> 01:23:55,550
I probably agree with many of the

1554
01:23:52,290 --> 01:23:55,550
comments that you made on the mic

1555
01:23:56,840 --> 01:24:03,300
Fernando firstly thank you very much for

1556
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:05,869
me I like what's in here and I would

1557
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:08,580
definitely support it proceeding I do

1558
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:11,880
agree with a lot of what Rudy said about

1559
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:14,280
well people may ignore this etc I don't

1560
01:24:11,880 --> 01:24:17,489
think that's a reason not to do it

1561
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:19,349
particularly because once you do this

1562
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:23,040
and you've got that recommendation in

1563
01:24:19,349 --> 01:24:25,260
standards it creates a situation where

1564
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:29,099
guys like myself when we go out of RFPs

1565
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:32,820
in the market can say you must comply to

1566
01:24:29,099 --> 01:24:35,719
this and we you don't have it in a

1567
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:39,389
document I don't have that option and

1568
01:24:35,719 --> 01:24:42,150
that alone would say to me that this is

1569
01:24:39,389 --> 01:24:43,590
worthwhile proceeding with and thanks

1570
01:24:42,150 --> 01:24:50,940
for your efforts I would fully support

1571
01:24:43,590 --> 01:24:53,820
this thank you Tim winner is un hol so

1572
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:55,739
you know I had a question about in your

1573
01:24:53,820 --> 01:24:57,869
draft you say you know when we've done

1574
01:24:55,739 --> 01:25:00,388
testing for flash free numbering on CPS

1575
01:24:57,869 --> 01:25:02,639
what we see for the slack side is often

1576
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:04,590
they'll deprecated the address they used

1577
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:07,170
to have but by always putting it in a

1578
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:08,489
Pio once right and so then the hosts if

1579
01:25:07,170 --> 01:25:10,650
they miss that packet on the lossy

1580
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:12,449
network would never get it I see in your

1581
01:25:10,650 --> 01:25:15,929
as you say you know any prefix that was

1582
01:25:12,449 --> 01:25:18,178
previously transmitted it should

1583
01:25:15,929 --> 01:25:19,260
continue to send with zero my question

1584
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:21,810
was for how long

1585
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:23,760
i you say like any and I think that

1586
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:26,250
probably too long you probably want to

1587
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:27,869
bind it to the previous valid lifetime

1588
01:25:26,250 --> 01:25:30,000
or something you don't want it to go on

1589
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:32,339
forever yeah exactly

1590
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,130
okay I would put some words around that

1591
01:25:32,340 --> 01:25:36,540
because currently it says any prefix

1592
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:39,540
okay and that's also probably an

1593
01:25:36,540 --> 01:25:41,940
indication that that you know folks

1594
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:45,150
might also be willing to use more you

1595
01:25:41,940 --> 01:25:46,830
know a prepay lifetimes because if we if

1596
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:49,170
they keep using the lifetimes that we

1597
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:52,110
currently do like you know prefer for a

1598
01:25:49,170 --> 01:25:54,300
week valid for a month that means that

1599
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:56,369
in theory you should be trying to

1600
01:25:54,300 --> 01:25:58,020
deprecate those prefixes for you know

1601
01:25:56,369 --> 01:25:58,750
that's much time which obviously doesn't

1602
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:05,500
make

1603
01:25:58,750 --> 01:26:07,960
any sense at all Java so I think it does

1604
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:11,050
make sense to specify recommendations

1605
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:13,450
for outer vendors because obviously some

1606
01:26:11,050 --> 01:26:15,460
of them will ignore recommendations but

1607
01:26:13,450 --> 01:26:17,050
still some implemented might look at

1608
01:26:15,460 --> 01:26:18,850
them otherwise it doesn't make sense to

1609
01:26:17,050 --> 01:26:22,870
publish any router requirements at all

1610
01:26:18,850 --> 01:26:25,630
and also it helps to as Anna mentioned I

1611
01:26:22,870 --> 01:26:27,970
defined requirements and tasting

1612
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:30,400
criteria so we basically say what we

1613
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:35,890
shall expect from CPS and that

1614
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:38,440
requirement should be there yeah exactly

1615
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:39,970
just just to clarify my point I am NOT

1616
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:42,040
saying that we should not do that

1617
01:26:39,970 --> 01:26:44,380
I am saying that in addition to that we

1618
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:47,010
should also approach from the other side

1619
01:26:44,380 --> 01:26:51,220
because I think part of the problem is

1620
01:26:47,010 --> 01:26:54,040
the concerns that we have that we should

1621
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:58,380
use non persistent prefixes that's

1622
01:26:54,040 --> 01:27:01,269
creating a lot of problems to us I think

1623
01:26:58,380 --> 01:27:04,210
we need to show there is peace that the

1624
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:06,760
model that we are using for ipv4 is

1625
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:09,780
broken and that's going to create

1626
01:27:06,760 --> 01:27:12,520
probably other problems that we didn't

1627
01:27:09,780 --> 01:27:14,380
see right now so this is probably not

1628
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:17,140
the only problem of using dynamic

1629
01:27:14,380 --> 01:27:19,870
prefixes so probably we should provide

1630
01:27:17,140 --> 01:27:21,400
better tools from the is beside to also

1631
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:23,519
resolve the problem so we can resolve

1632
01:27:21,400 --> 01:27:28,269
the problem in two sites not just one

1633
01:27:23,520 --> 01:27:31,240
well to that point inserting myself into

1634
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:34,440
queue seems like the simplest approach

1635
01:27:31,240 --> 01:27:39,790
is not to use stable storage which dies

1636
01:27:34,440 --> 01:27:42,610
provably dies but to put something in an

1637
01:27:39,790 --> 01:27:44,620
RA that says I have a new prefix

1638
01:27:42,610 --> 01:27:50,110
whatever I may have told you before

1639
01:27:44,620 --> 01:27:52,930
please consider invalid and I thought

1640
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:56,190
about that for at least a minute you

1641
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:58,810
know I don't make any great claims but

1642
01:27:56,190 --> 01:28:04,000
that that might be an approach to

1643
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:10,450
consider in the case okay so thank you

1644
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:12,760
for Nando where I'm going to go a last

1645
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:15,070
couple of years we've found a youth

1646
01:28:12,760 --> 01:28:17,410
well ron and i have found it useful to

1647
01:28:15,070 --> 01:28:20,380
pull the working group after a meeting

1648
01:28:17,410 --> 01:28:25,170
and say what do you think about some

1649
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:27,790
draft that was on the on the agenda and

1650
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:30,250
people have often made some pretty good

1651
01:28:27,790 --> 01:28:32,260
comments in email when when they can get

1652
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:38,800
back to the ranch and think about things

1653
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:42,340
I detect a comment about to come I just

1654
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:46,030
wanted to to check something and I may

1655
01:28:42,340 --> 01:28:50,470
be wrong here but does the facility not

1656
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:53,259
already exist to send a zero TTL or a to

1657
01:28:50,470 --> 01:28:54,880
force a withdrawal of what's already

1658
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:58,000
been out there and then you could

1659
01:28:54,880 --> 01:29:00,010
reissue which would cause a new prefix

1660
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,930
but I could be wrong on that but I do

1661
01:29:00,010 --> 01:29:07,350
have vague memories of it you can um

1662
01:29:04,930 --> 01:29:11,710
prefer that you cannot invalidate

1663
01:29:07,350 --> 01:29:16,030
because there's text in are seeing 3861

1664
01:29:11,710 --> 01:29:18,430
that says that if you receive a valid

1665
01:29:16,030 --> 01:29:23,380
I'm smaller than two hours you should

1666
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:25,420
ignore it also Fred you this is Bernie

1667
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:29,140
volts also you wouldn't want to use just

1668
01:29:25,420 --> 01:29:30,820
a single bit because it's back to the

1669
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:32,500
old problem of how many times you send

1670
01:29:30,820 --> 01:29:36,400
that are a right so it's probably a

1671
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:38,770
router routing advertisement sequence

1672
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:40,719
number or something that you want so if

1673
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:43,480
that changes these you've got a

1674
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:45,850
different configuration and you know the

1675
01:29:43,480 --> 01:29:47,679
old stuff should be thrown away okay

1676
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:53,500
well like I said thought about that for

1677
01:29:47,680 --> 01:29:55,210
at least a minute so mark I sort of have

1678
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:57,120
a bit of background on this ago i 8 to

1679
01:29:55,210 --> 01:29:59,980
10 years ago i was working on production

1680
01:29:57,120 --> 01:30:02,349
basics deployments for internet in South

1681
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:04,750
in Australia and was working with CPA

1682
01:30:02,350 --> 01:30:08,260
vendors and even though internet went

1683
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:09,790
with stable prefixes I also thought

1684
01:30:08,260 --> 01:30:11,410
about thought about this situation and

1685
01:30:09,790 --> 01:30:12,670
actually wrote some are red beady

1686
01:30:11,410 --> 01:30:15,120
options that are already there and

1687
01:30:12,670 --> 01:30:18,100
they're they're publicly available

1688
01:30:15,120 --> 01:30:20,380
you can't you you can't advertise a

1689
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:24,840
valid lifetime lower than two hours so

1690
01:30:20,380 --> 01:30:27,070
there's a any do s that denial service

1691
01:30:24,840 --> 01:30:29,800
protection in there but the other thing

1692
01:30:27,070 --> 01:30:31,389
I've realized is that I think the most

1693
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:34,920
effective solutions are the ones that

1694
01:30:31,390 --> 01:30:37,120
are applied where the problem exists and

1695
01:30:34,920 --> 01:30:39,159
the further with the way I see this

1696
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:42,880
partly is this factor of trouble getting

1697
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:45,280
CPE vendors to follow it updating all

1698
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:49,540
the hosts is perhaps even a bigger

1699
01:30:45,280 --> 01:30:51,130
problem I've also learned that sometimes

1700
01:30:49,540 --> 01:30:53,230
education is cheaper than just more

1701
01:30:51,130 --> 01:30:54,969
technology and so I wonder a lot of

1702
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,500
these I Spees I suspect they're doing it

1703
01:30:54,969 --> 01:30:59,350
just because they're following on from

1704
01:30:56,500 --> 01:31:03,070
the way they've done ipv4 a broadband

1705
01:30:59,350 --> 01:31:05,710
which is the way they've done dial-up so

1706
01:31:03,070 --> 01:31:07,690
I'm not fundamental I'm sort of not

1707
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:11,140
against making things more robust in CP

1708
01:31:07,690 --> 01:31:12,790
or hosts but I'm just a bit skeptical of

1709
01:31:11,140 --> 01:31:15,489
its effectiveness because of partly what

1710
01:31:12,790 --> 01:31:18,159
I've seen with CPE I've got an old

1711
01:31:15,489 --> 01:31:21,699
presentation from 2011 ah smog about hmm

1712
01:31:18,159 --> 01:31:23,920
how good or bad ipv6 CP is I recently

1713
01:31:21,699 --> 01:31:26,500
heard that there's still memory leaks in

1714
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,590
CP a 10 years later

1715
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:31,929
so there's if you want to play with some

1716
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:32,920
of these options play with red beady

1717
01:31:31,929 --> 01:31:35,140
because they're already there it's

1718
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,670
deprecated prefix and decrement

1719
01:31:35,140 --> 01:31:40,480
lifetimes to address some of these

1720
01:31:36,670 --> 01:31:44,280
things but I've certainly you know be

1721
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:48,480
advocating encouraging eye space to

1722
01:31:44,280 --> 01:31:50,679
adopt more stable models just because

1723
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:56,739
that's sort of where the problem exists

1724
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:59,650
fundamentally essentially we're trying

1725
01:31:56,739 --> 01:32:01,690
to tackle the problem you know from

1726
01:31:59,650 --> 01:32:03,879
different sites so it's not that we are

1727
01:32:01,690 --> 01:32:08,469
we think that the solution is only on

1728
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:10,030
the CPS or only on the host or we are

1729
01:32:08,469 --> 01:32:13,020
essentially trying to approach it

1730
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:16,000
problem different ways yeah I just a

1731
01:32:13,020 --> 01:32:19,150
broader well well adjusting parameters

1732
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,460
in CPE or this in CPS and adjusting host

1733
01:32:19,150 --> 01:32:22,150
parameters he's not quite boiling the

1734
01:32:21,460 --> 01:32:23,949
ocean

1735
01:32:22,150 --> 01:32:25,690
I think the boiling the ocean option is

1736
01:32:23,949 --> 01:32:27,489
multipath transport layer protocols

1737
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:35,440
because then who cares about what IP

1738
01:32:27,489 --> 01:32:38,620
address you use you okay hello

1739
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:40,570
Metro City from a safari lt's I found

1740
01:32:38,620 --> 01:32:42,309
your proposal about seven feet of

1741
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:44,559
configuration is very interesting

1742
01:32:42,310 --> 01:32:48,480
because have you tried to consider other

1743
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:50,890
devices except of for a CPS in this case

1744
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:54,190
other types of devices it could save

1745
01:32:50,890 --> 01:32:56,530
this configuration for example the IOT

1746
01:32:54,190 --> 01:32:59,740
rotor for example out you wrote it's not

1747
01:32:56,530 --> 01:33:02,559
the device it it could be rebooted in

1748
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:05,620
much frequent times and CPS or for

1749
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:10,480
example if you have some IOT systems it

1750
01:33:05,620 --> 01:33:14,940
has it includes the transportation

1751
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:17,830
system or for example Health's medical

1752
01:33:14,940 --> 01:33:19,990
measurements on the human bodies yes on

1753
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:23,140
or in the hospitals this system could be

1754
01:33:19,990 --> 01:33:26,469
rebooted much more frequently and in

1755
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:28,240
this case I think your proposal about

1756
01:33:26,470 --> 01:33:33,880
the saving of the configuration could be

1757
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:36,660
applied to this case yeah I mean we use

1758
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:40,930
the term CPU rubber because that's the

1759
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:45,940
actually this word was triggered by an

1760
01:33:40,930 --> 01:33:47,380
ISP that was facing this problem but

1761
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:49,120
yeah I agree with what you're saying I

1762
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:52,180
mean we could make the document more

1763
01:33:49,120 --> 01:33:56,160
general applying to other you know not

1764
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:58,930
just CPU routers okay so I support the

1765
01:33:56,160 --> 01:34:02,139
documents it to you you were trying to

1766
01:33:58,930 --> 01:34:08,860
push and it's all thank you for your

1767
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:11,410
attention thank you yeah Marconi yeah I

1768
01:34:08,860 --> 01:34:14,349
think as so people said there there are

1769
01:34:11,410 --> 01:34:16,300
more long-term solutions thinkable but

1770
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:18,520
if their solutions include like yet the

1771
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:20,830
world should go to static addresses I'm

1772
01:34:18,520 --> 01:34:22,480
afraid the market is against us people

1773
01:34:20,830 --> 01:34:24,550
stick to what they know there's so many

1774
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:26,530
dynamic address you won't convince all

1775
01:34:24,550 --> 01:34:29,860
is fish - I like oh yeah let's just go

1776
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:32,110
static I do see certain solutions in

1777
01:34:29,860 --> 01:34:35,019
terms also on the DHCP server side but

1778
01:34:32,110 --> 01:34:36,730
as a quick fix and I think I support

1779
01:34:35,020 --> 01:34:38,830
Andrew in the statement is I think we

1780
01:34:36,730 --> 01:34:41,200
should move this forward at least as an

1781
01:34:38,830 --> 01:34:43,330
intermediate until we solve for instance

1782
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:45,040
like you said DRI protocol because

1783
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:47,840
that's gonna take a long time this

1784
01:34:45,040 --> 01:34:50,060
appears to be a short term

1785
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,190
for what is a real problem in the market

1786
01:34:50,060 --> 01:34:55,699
so let's let's move it forward than she

1787
01:34:52,190 --> 01:34:56,500
was we can do in this place okay thank

1788
01:34:55,699 --> 01:35:00,019
you

1789
01:34:56,500 --> 01:35:01,790
so at any rate what I was getting at was

1790
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:06,260
what what is going to be our work plan

1791
01:35:01,790 --> 01:35:10,489
basically between now and between now

1792
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:14,630
and IETF 107 we've got some interesting

1793
01:35:10,489 --> 01:35:18,440
events that will consume our time in the

1794
01:35:14,630 --> 01:35:20,690
u.s. we have Thanksgiving next week in

1795
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:22,669
most parts of the world people celebrate

1796
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:26,360
Christmas and that two week or maybe two

1797
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:28,340
weeks in in the other the rest of the

1798
01:35:26,360 --> 01:35:33,139
world they celebrate Chinese New Year's

1799
01:35:28,340 --> 01:35:37,280
and that gets interesting so what I

1800
01:35:33,139 --> 01:35:39,920
think I want to do is basically use the

1801
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:43,219
first three weeks in December in the

1802
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:46,610
first three weeks in January and send a

1803
01:35:43,219 --> 01:35:49,639
note referencing one of these documents

1804
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:53,269
that we've got and asking for people's

1805
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:55,670
comments and part of that will be in

1806
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:58,159
Fernando I know you're waiting for this

1807
01:35:55,670 --> 01:36:00,739
question do you want to adopt this as a

1808
01:35:58,159 --> 01:36:02,659
working group draft Fernando would

1809
01:36:00,739 --> 01:36:08,419
really like to see these his two

1810
01:36:02,659 --> 01:36:11,449
documents adopted so that's what I

1811
01:36:08,420 --> 01:36:13,880
expect to do it might be Ron sending the

1812
01:36:11,449 --> 01:36:17,210
email but that that's what I expect to

1813
01:36:13,880 --> 01:36:19,099
do as far as collecting comments and

1814
01:36:17,210 --> 01:36:21,080
working group status on the drafts you

1815
01:36:19,099 --> 01:36:24,530
can be looking forward to that and

1816
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:31,159
please feel free to say something when

1817
01:36:24,530 --> 01:36:33,590
we send those notes so with that do we

1818
01:36:31,159 --> 01:36:35,449
have any other business are there things

1819
01:36:33,590 --> 01:36:44,060
that we should be talking about at this

1820
01:36:35,449 --> 01:36:46,489
point mr. Ferrell T's basically we would

1821
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:48,590
like to receive some help and discussion

1822
01:36:46,489 --> 01:36:52,699
from the group regarding the draft that

1823
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:54,770
we have at v6 ops it was not in the

1824
01:36:52,699 --> 01:36:58,669
agenda list but if you have some time

1825
01:36:54,770 --> 01:37:01,789
free maybe we could present it and do to

1826
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:04,340
see what people think about it

1827
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:07,969
if it's possible I'd avoid doing things

1828
01:37:04,340 --> 01:37:12,110
so where are we at for time well we've

1829
01:37:07,969 --> 01:37:17,090
got what 23 minutes I don't have it in

1830
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:18,530
the I can't can't quickly present it

1831
01:37:17,090 --> 01:37:32,059
from here

1832
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:33,349
do you have it on a flash drive so do

1833
01:37:32,059 --> 01:37:41,630
you have it on a flash drive

1834
01:37:33,349 --> 01:37:48,949
yes or no okay I think that's gonna take

1835
01:37:41,630 --> 01:37:53,179
longer than we've got so okay so I think

1836
01:37:48,949 --> 01:37:55,480
we're gonna adjourn so thank you much

1837
01:37:53,179 --> 01:37:55,480
