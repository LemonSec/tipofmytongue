1
00:00:04,520 --> 00:01:11,229
yes hello hello welcome to the perigee

2
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,229
session thank you for coming everyone

3
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,829
get right into it

4
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:17,090
there's no well I'm sure you've already

5
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,369
seen this from the morning session if

6
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,340
you haven't please familiarize yourself

7
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:26,149
with this keep in mind going forward for

8
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,459
the session a couple of Ministry of

9
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:34,789
notes before we get started

10
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:37,340
blue sheets are somewhere up here did

11
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:39,889
you pass and run we will pass the blue

12
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:44,240
sheets around please fill them out we

13
00:01:39,889 --> 00:01:50,119
need to jabber scribe we do okay great

14
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:51,169
as well as a minute taker oh great

15
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:52,729
excellent

16
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,249
[Music]

17
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:59,060
this is the agenda pretty sure for we're

18
00:01:55,249 --> 00:02:01,369
gonna couple presentations from sort of

19
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:04,849
researchers in the area and then some

20
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:08,030
individual draft presentations does

21
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:09,739
anyone have any comments or adjustments

22
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:14,640
they'd like to make before we get

23
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:17,490
started so I think

24
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,329
so Joe offered to do a quick update for

25
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:26,160
one of the adopted jobs that we have

26
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:31,920
either maybe come up so Joff censorship

27
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:35,660
is an adopted RG draft and Joe offered

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,280
to like give a quick overview and update

29
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:41,520
yeah so this is a draft that's been

30
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,680
alive for a very long time I've made

31
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,320
absolutely no progress since the last

32
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,780
IETF because I changed jobs and my job

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:55,140
now is been uh difficult so to speak but

34
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:57,930
anyway I have a list of issues I think I

35
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:59,970
just threw in the chat I may not have

36
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,750
hit return Christian if you want to hit

37
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,310
return on my computer they'll post but

38
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:09,080
I'm hoping to get through those in

39
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:13,410
December and that's I guess the update

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:17,100
thanks already thanks Joe

41
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:18,480
when the update comes you going to take

42
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,930
a look provide some feedback on the list

43
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,429
and that would be helpful going forward

44
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,860
with that we can get into the

45
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,870
presentations of the presenter for the

46
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:40,890
first talk could please come up this

47
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:45,410
professor Shoukri here do we have

48
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:48,410
professor Liu do you want to go first

49
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,410
perfect

50
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:53,289
and from scripts and you thank you for

51
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:56,530
imitation and today I will share our

52
00:04:53,289 --> 00:05:01,180
research on privacy preserving my home

53
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:03,849
oh home amorphic encryption and my talk

54
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,820
was divided into two paths first ever

55
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:09,910
introduced some Merrick back ones of

56
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,180
homo encryption and then I reintroduce

57
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:16,720
the main applications of homework

58
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,450
encryption and now let's begin with the

59
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,229
first part

60
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:27,190
okay that's simple definition what is

61
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:30,330
homophily encryption and both of these

62
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:33,400
tours are variations for example

63
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:37,510
encryption is the process of encoding of

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:43,239
a message and a meaningful message into

65
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:47,830
randomness like message for example we

66
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,460
can use the side Caesar cipher I used

67
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:56,409
which was invented about 2,000 years ago

68
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:59,909
and in this encoding the message welcome

69
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,530
to NTU can be transformed to a

70
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:06,220
meaningless message

71
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:10,359
the key is dusta to shift every

72
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:13,539
character three positions and what is

73
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,979
homomorphism home of ism is a structure

74
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:20,200
preserving map and that's it will

75
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:25,260
preserve the Arabic breaker structures

76
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:25,260
and combined it together

77
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:34,230
we'll get the whole mafia encryption so

78
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:41,010
that's the definition of homogeneous and

79
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:46,930
if we can preserve the arabika structure

80
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:50,440
then we get the home of encryption that

81
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:53,830
means if we have the mass encryption of

82
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:58,090
the message one to message N and also a

83
00:06:53,830 --> 00:07:00,490
function f we can just simply computed

84
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:09,969
the unencrypted data and the get the

85
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:11,410
encryption of F F M like this so now we

86
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,570
have the definition of how much

87
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,760
encryption it's a special kinds of

88
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:20,140
encryption algorithm that supports

89
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:23,530
subtext the computation and there are

90
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,320
mainly two types of hama encryptions and

91
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:28,719
the first type is a partial homomorphic

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,409
encryption and the second type I is

93
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,900
fully Houma in Houma encryption and for

94
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:38,440
the first the type it's only support

95
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:42,520
single operations such as addition or

96
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,280
multiplication and it was used the in

97
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:49,150
data aggregation or some construction of

98
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:54,640
MPC protocols and it is very easy to

99
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:56,440
design such a kind of algorithm and but

100
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,810
for the second type of form of

101
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:02,920
encryption the follicle mark encryption

102
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:06,760
we required to support unlimited numbers

103
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:11,440
of operations and it can both supports a

104
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:13,780
multiplication and addition and a little

105
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,650
surprise it is very difficult to design

106
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:20,169
such kinds of encryption algorithms it

107
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:23,530
was named at the holy grail of the

108
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:26,530
cryptography area and remains at the

109
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:31,109
open problem of about 30 years and it

110
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:34,150
does result of our entry in 2009 and

111
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:37,010
between these two types of form of

112
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:40,939
encryption there are many method helps

113
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,889
of algorithms for example the humorous

114
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:44,810
some words home of encryption

115
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:50,750
it's a keen supporter limited the

116
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:54,199
numbers of operations and it is also

117
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:58,519
widely used in the area of privacy

118
00:08:54,199 --> 00:09:00,589
protecting okay said this is a brief

119
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,850
history of home of encryption

120
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:08,350
I taste nearly as old as the public

121
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,930
encryption itself it was first proposed

122
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:17,570
in 1978 and after 30 years development

123
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:20,540
the First Folio movie encryption

124
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:24,050
occurred and after that's about ten

125
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:25,910
years we have the folio moving here they

126
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,680
were developed a very quick light and

127
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:32,360
then now we have many public

128
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:36,680
implementations which we can get from

129
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,930
the github oh and and elsewhere and the

130
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:44,209
standardization process is already

131
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:46,010
underway and for the standardization for

132
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,819
the partial home of encryption we

133
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:52,939
already have a standard that was

134
00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:55,699
published by ISO this year it includes

135
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:58,940
two algorithms which is the exponent

136
00:09:55,699 --> 00:10:02,079
show alchemist encryption and the pad

137
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:06,380
encryption algorithm and for the case of

138
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,959
fully homomorphic encryption and the

139
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:12,519
researchers and the government have

140
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:18,790
already organized for workshops

141
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:23,089
processing and okay this is a list of

142
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:27,050
the mainly current open source libraries

143
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:30,769
for home of encryption and and for

144
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:35,180
integer or finished field operations we

145
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:38,720
have Cu an HD lab and on the hand rhythm

146
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:44,540
and for the bullying gates operation we

147
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:46,970
have tfhe in the effort aw and this our

148
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,420
alpha baker in the internet we can get

149
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,420
so freely

150
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:58,270
now to use the Hamoui encryption in real

151
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,840
applications the most factor we care

152
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:05,020
about is the performance and that there

153
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,260
are mainly three kinds of operations the

154
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:11,579
integer arithmetic and the proxy proxy

155
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:15,760
the arithmetic and the bull engage and

156
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:18,970
for arithmetic operations currently we

157
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:25,150
have very fast computations are integers

158
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:28,920
or fixed point numbers for limited atoms

159
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:32,050
of operations if we want to achieve

160
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:35,770
unlimited time approaches then I took

161
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:38,290
was not that efficient because of the

162
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:43,470
slope the scraping technique currently

163
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:43,469
and for bullying circles the

164
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:51,270
bootstrapping is seems very fast for

165
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:55,840
example we need 13 milliseconds for one

166
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:58,840
operation of the n kind of gates but

167
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:01,390
since any real application if we

168
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,960
constructed by using the boolean gate

169
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:08,380
gates and it may take many gaze

170
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:12,030
operations so the real applications may

171
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:15,160
be less efficient now let's see some

172
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:18,400
tests the results of the different kinds

173
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,800
of libraries if we want to do the

174
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,840
integer addition or multiplication for

175
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,290
example we want to do the integer

176
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:29,710
addition then we can use the exponential

177
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:32,920
argument or pallium or just simple

178
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,830
lettuce based encryption and the

179
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,370
performance is very good of example we

180
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:41,589
only need to one microsecond for the

181
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:44,400
exponential argument and the women need

182
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:48,880
eight microseconds for the Palio and

183
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:52,480
less than one microseconds for the

184
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,420
lettuce based encryption but this three

185
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,960
kinds of libraries cannot support the

186
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:01,449
operation of a multiplication and if we

187
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,640
want to support some multiplication then

188
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,850
it will be less efficient

189
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,959
for example the seal library King

190
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:14,260
completes the interior edition in six

191
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,479
micro second and also for one

192
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:19,390
millisecond for the operation of

193
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,769
multiplication and if we want to do

194
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:25,990
unlimited operations of addition and

195
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:30,940
multiplication then we can use the AG

196
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:34,990
lab it may takes five milliseconds for

197
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:36,100
the addition and about 200 milliseconds

198
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:39,250
for multiplication

199
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:42,910
it is much slower and if we want to do

200
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:46,720
the interior addition by using the basic

201
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,209
boolean gates then it takes about one

202
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,600
second to complete the addition

203
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:57,760
operation and about 20 seconds for

204
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,519
multiplication so it's much slower with

205
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:04,450
the bullen's also the boolean circuit is

206
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,279
Matsuura but we can construct any kinds

207
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:11,079
of operation by using the blowing gates

208
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:14,050
for example we can design the the

209
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:16,839
circular for integer addition and the

210
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,479
flows number addition and subtraction

211
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,810
and a multiplication or even the square

212
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,709
root operation or the sine function or

213
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,540
the exponential function that we can

214
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:31,810
construct any kinds of functions by

215
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,880
using the bull engage and it is much

216
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:37,209
slower for example the exponential

217
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:43,750
function may takes about 100 and some

218
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:46,149
save for our seconds okay and now let's

219
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:48,579
begin the second parts how to use

220
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:52,480
homomorphic encryption to provide the

221
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:56,469
privacy protecting generally speaking we

222
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:59,790
can solve the piracy problem by using

223
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:02,680
home of folly for Morgan who very simply

224
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,550
the frame worker is firstly in the first

225
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:09,099
step we just encrypt our data's and then

226
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,800
we do any kinds of operations on the

227
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,930
cipher text and finally our the user

228
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,630
does that to decribe to the surf text

229
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:17,560
and get the results of the computation

230
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,490
so

231
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:23,258
it is very simple but this kind of

232
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:26,129
realization it's always not very

233
00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:29,980
efficient of our real applications and

234
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:33,339
so we need to design different kinds of

235
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:35,559
protocols are specific protocols for

236
00:15:33,339 --> 00:15:38,470
different kinds of applications for

237
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:41,170
example in the data collection data

238
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,439
retrieval is a sharing and a determining

239
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:47,079
we may need to design the protocol of

240
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:50,559
data aggregation private information

241
00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:53,800
retrieval and private set intersection

242
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:57,670
and the privacy preserving computation

243
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:01,029
protocols to design these kinds of

244
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,939
protocols we may use many kinds of or

245
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:06,309
primitives and for example the

246
00:16:03,939 --> 00:16:08,019
differential privacy technique the

247
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:11,860
searchable encryption function

248
00:16:08,019 --> 00:16:15,160
encryption on even the oblivious Ram and

249
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:17,769
the searching secret of sharing and

250
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,170
oblivious transfer or garbled circuit

251
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:24,759
today we are mainly focused on the

252
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:27,399
common morphic encryption now let's

253
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:30,040
begin with the very simple application

254
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:33,370
that's in occurs in the data collection

255
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:38,709
and the left a the famous feature

256
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:42,250
published the banister it shows that the

257
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:44,888
power usage gets from the smart meters

258
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:47,939
may leak the information of the users

259
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:50,470
what you are doing your home for example

260
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:52,779
from this video when we get the

261
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,870
information that the user may be get up

262
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:59,939
in the morning before AIDS and prepare

263
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:04,899
his breakfast and then washing and then

264
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:09,730
about went to eat his lunch and went to

265
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:15,309
get to sleep so in this scenario we need

266
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:18,699
to aggregate the data the power usage of

267
00:17:15,309 --> 00:17:20,859
each hot work each user and get a

268
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:23,189
summarizations and send this

269
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:28,569
summarization to the control center and

270
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:31,210
this is mainly the most simple and the

271
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:33,908
most mature application of home

272
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,730
encryption in this case the online needs

273
00:17:33,909 --> 00:17:42,100
additive homem of encryption for example

274
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:45,970
we can just add the usage of each harm

275
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:48,820
together and according to the tables

276
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:53,799
previous we can see that addition is

277
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:57,730
very efficient and in case of data

278
00:17:53,799 --> 00:18:01,210
retrieval for example the user want to

279
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:04,360
get some public database access some

280
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:07,570
public database although the data itself

281
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,539
is public but the access pattern will

282
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:13,960
leak the privacy of the users for

283
00:18:10,539 --> 00:18:16,450
example if we are access patented

284
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,419
database then the server may know what

285
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:24,130
kind of product this company will be

286
00:18:19,419 --> 00:18:30,010
playing that you two took to construct

287
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:33,090
and theoretically we made it seem that

288
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:36,360
we may add only way it is to get

289
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:41,949
download all the details in the database

290
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,979
because even if one item is not touched

291
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:48,279
that then the server may know that the

292
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:53,250
user is not interest on these kinds of

293
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:56,320
data and so this is very efficient

294
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:59,830
previously we can solve this problem by

295
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,439
using multi servers and we need to

296
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:04,629
assume that these servers I will not

297
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:07,539
concluded together to recover the

298
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,419
privacy of the users but this kind of

299
00:19:07,539 --> 00:19:14,440
assumption is not reasonable for most of

300
00:19:10,419 --> 00:19:16,299
the real applications so let's see how

301
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:19,539
to protect the privacy by using

302
00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:24,820
homomorphic encryption that the user

303
00:19:19,539 --> 00:19:29,110
only need to encrypt every index by a

304
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:31,450
separate text and for the item he want

305
00:19:29,110 --> 00:19:34,629
to get he does the encrypt one for

306
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:38,620
example that the eyes index and for all

307
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:42,580
other index he just encrypt 0 and then

308
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,750
the server will multiply each data to

309
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:50,289
the ciphertext

310
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:53,919
and we know that for for the index I the

311
00:19:50,289 --> 00:19:57,400
X I will be encrypt this position will

312
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,309
get in quick encrypt of XII for our

313
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,130
other positions will be the encrypt of

314
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:05,918
Bureau then this server summarize all

315
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:08,559
the staff tags together and only to send

316
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,750
one ciphertext to the user and then the

317
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:15,090
user can be grabbed it and it gets what

318
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:18,340
he wants so in this simple protocol and

319
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:21,610
the server that the communication pen

320
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:24,760
wise that the server sent back to the

321
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,820
user is only one ciphertext but the

322
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:31,330
users do need to send many subtext to

323
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:34,178
the server we can optimize this protocol

324
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:37,149
are very simply for example we can

325
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:40,600
divide the potatoes in the server into

326
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:43,330
one hundred blocks and in this case the

327
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:47,110
user only need to send one hundred the

328
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:49,270
ciphertext and the server all like I

329
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:53,020
need to send over one hundred suffer

330
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:58,840
texts the back so instead of sending

331
00:20:53,020 --> 00:21:02,350
about to us to a ten thousand subtext in

332
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:04,809
this case we all I need to send 200 a

333
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:11,080
server text is a balance between the

334
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:13,780
truth passes and we can make if we use

335
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:17,370
the most of the more powerful form of

336
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:21,820
encryption we can make this project

337
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:25,270
still simpler in this case the user only

338
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:29,918
need to encrypted enix I want only one

339
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:35,500
self text and this server for each index

340
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:40,750
he doesn't finish the compare operation

341
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:44,530
and if i equal to j then it will be

342
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:47,799
encrypt of one and for all other

343
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:50,200
positions it will be in subtext of zero

344
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:53,139
so and he still summarize all the

345
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,309
subtext the NS and the results back so

346
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,520
in this protocol we only need two to

347
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:59,800
ciphertext

348
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,000
and communication bandwidth is very

349
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:06,280
efficient but we have already seen that

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:11,620
fall aha moment inclusion may be not

351
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:14,050
that efficient so we can improve this

352
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,379
protocol by our very careful design of

353
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:20,290
macedon coding methods we can encode the

354
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:23,470
message instead of encrypted the message

355
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:26,710
directly we just encrypted it to a

356
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:29,530
polynomial for time limits

357
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:33,240
I will not have enough time to describe

358
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:36,970
the technical details so I would like at

359
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,120
this equation and in this case we only

360
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:43,830
need the additive hormone encryption and

361
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:47,860
to complete the Equality test and

362
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:53,409
achieve the bandwidth efficiency and the

363
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:56,530
computation physician together this a

364
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:59,500
more complete scenario maybe the user

365
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:04,270
want to outsource his data to the server

366
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:07,840
in this case all the data's X is also

367
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:11,290
the encrypt a safer text and in the last

368
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:17,139
scenario it is a plain text so in this

369
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:20,050
case we may need to to do much more

370
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:23,460
about the design of the protocol and the

371
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:26,190
encoding to avoid the usage of

372
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:28,990
multiplication and only use the

373
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:31,260
computation for additional home of

374
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:36,330
encryption and makes the protocol and

375
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:38,890
more efficient and in this case

376
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,010
besides the operation of a read

377
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:45,130
operation the user may be want to update

378
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:48,100
his data's stored on the server then the

379
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:51,940
writes operation may also leak his

380
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:54,840
privacy so to protect this kind of

381
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:58,600
privacy we mainly the more complex

382
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:02,590
oblivious Ram techniques and I will not

383
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:05,439
describe that this thing here ok that's

384
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:07,750
the case of a data retrieval not let's

385
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,270
say that they are the case of for data

386
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,110
sharing in this case Alice and Bob both

387
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,510
have to

388
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,699
parrots at it assess and they want to

389
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:21,190
computer the intersection it is a very

390
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:23,140
simple as Nauru obviously we can solve

391
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,360
this problem by using the hash function

392
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:28,000
for example Alice just said that each of

393
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,870
his value the hash value of each of his

394
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,940
data to Bob and Bob send back each value

395
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:38,469
the hash value to Alice and then each of

396
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:41,320
them every of them can just compare the

397
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:44,590
hash values and to find out their

398
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:48,850
intersects but this protocol is notice

399
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:52,539
cure forgiven boy if the the space of

400
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:55,510
Alice and Bob's in the setter is not big

401
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:58,769
enough then we can search all the

402
00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:02,980
possible inputs and find that data's and

403
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:06,039
we can also we can resolve this problem

404
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:10,840
by using a very different exchange like

405
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:14,139
protocol and this is secure but as in

406
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,949
Bob also needed to many to do many kinds

407
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:21,479
of module exponential computations which

408
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:26,970
is very time-consuming and with himavan

409
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:29,559
homomorphic encryption we can intend

410
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:33,760
only a few more minutes okay okay ah

411
00:25:29,559 --> 00:25:36,220
that's the finish so we can we can

412
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,200
design a particle based hormone-free

413
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:42,669
encryption and to the Equality test and

414
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:46,570
LSD dances and the encryption which is

415
00:25:42,669 --> 00:25:48,399
data and the Bob does this - every of

416
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:52,210
his data and the multiplayer random

417
00:25:48,399 --> 00:25:54,580
number if X is equal to ID and Alice

418
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,549
will gets the encryption of Bureau and

419
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,590
if X is not equal to Y and Alice will

420
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:04,289
get a random number so he'll find out

421
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:06,850
their intersections okay with the

422
00:26:04,289 --> 00:26:12,340
quality tests that we designed in the

423
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:15,969
data retrieval protocol we can design

424
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,039
our more efficient protocol to come to

425
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:23,440
resolve this kind of for applications

426
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:24,740
and finally is the privacy preserving in

427
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,290
this money

428
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,660
the two phases in neural networks and

429
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:32,300
the training phase and the prediction

430
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,860
phase and the remaining folks on the

431
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:37,280
prediction phase because the training

432
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,189
phase is self in the plain text is still

433
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,220
very time-consuming and but the

434
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:46,820
prediction is in plain text it's

435
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,620
efficient now and the the first step we

436
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:53,419
need to analyze what kinds of

437
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:56,000
competitions we'll need in application

438
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,150
of neural networks for example the

439
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,280
commercial convolution there's is a

440
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:05,150
simply the computation of matrix

441
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:08,450
multiply a vector and the loot layer ok

442
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:12,050
is we need to comparison in this

443
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,050
direction and in the for connection they

444
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:20,030
are we also need computation of matrix

445
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:23,530
multiply vector and so we can design a

446
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:25,520
very simple protocol to complete the

447
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:28,760
computations based on the bullying

448
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,030
bullying gates although we can see that

449
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,929
it is very inefficient and we can

450
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:37,970
achieve the operation of the linear

451
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:40,460
operation by using additive homo be

452
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:44,570
inclusion but in this case we cannot

453
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:46,550
compute the active layer or the signal

454
00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:50,809
or the redo function by using the

455
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:55,178
additive home encryption this is what we

456
00:27:50,809 --> 00:27:57,649
are still research now and ok friendly

457
00:27:55,179 --> 00:28:01,220
it were concluding with komova

458
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:03,410
encryption firstly we can achieve the

459
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:06,559
bull and circular gates at the X or in

460
00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:09,350
the end and the arithmetic addition and

461
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,590
multiplication and with these rhythms we

462
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:13,760
can achieve many any kinds of algorithm

463
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,139
or bullying

464
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:21,080
circuit and then we can so any kind of

465
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,900
generic or some problem with a generic

466
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,240
resolution and we also can design as

467
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,730
basic approach calls for each kinds of

468
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,110
applications and we can get efficient

469
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:35,030
solutions okay thank you

470
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:37,428
all right yeah unless anyone has a very

471
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,780
very quick question or comment perhaps

472
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:40,040
we can move on to the

473
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:47,418
presentation thank you very much for

474
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:52,870
coming can the presenter for the first

475
00:28:47,419 --> 00:28:52,870
presentation come up yes thank you

476
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:21,669
alright ah hello everyone

477
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,940
and you need to stay in the thinker's oh

478
00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:30,909
here alright ok it's for the benefit of

479
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:33,519
the remote people my name is Reza I'm an

480
00:29:30,909 --> 00:29:35,830
assistant professor at NUS I run the

481
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,830
data privacy and transporting machine

482
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:41,350
learning lab and today I'm going to talk

483
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:47,559
about the privacy risks of machine

484
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:53,379
learning but I need to start with how

485
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:55,809
does this ok perfect so I need to start

486
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:58,899
with a very important concept of

487
00:29:55,809 --> 00:30:01,750
inference attacks if you have some data

488
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:03,158
about individuals it's possible to

489
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,100
combine it with some other information

490
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:08,259
and use advanced statistical methods or

491
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,000
machine learning algorithms to infer

492
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:12,730
further information about those

493
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,889
individuals this has been shown many

494
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:19,870
times in the research community and on

495
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:21,789
different types of Delta for example on

496
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:26,320
Facebook Likes you can infer information

497
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:30,610
about personal data and also it could

498
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,189
help to identify whose data is in the

499
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:36,250
data set for example for location data

500
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:38,259
you just give me five random locations

501
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,279
from their trajectories you are almost

502
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:43,240
unique in the world

503
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:47,169
alright so this is a this is basically

504
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:49,539
the main risk of sharing the data itself

505
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:52,179
either it can infer some sensitive

506
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:54,759
information further than what is already

507
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,649
in the data or identify the individuals

508
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:59,049
in the data set so there has been a lot

509
00:30:56,649 --> 00:31:01,570
of efforts on how to protect data

510
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:03,279
privacy data sanitization through

511
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:06,490
removing sensitive information or

512
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,100
removing identities has been one idea

513
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,580
but and there's a huge business on this

514
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:14,529
by anonymizing data but what is missing

515
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:17,080
there is you know what is the definition

516
00:31:14,529 --> 00:31:20,139
of privacy because the bad news is that

517
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,740
by removing identities or sensitive

518
00:31:20,139 --> 00:31:22,090
information

519
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,660
from the data you don't make the data

520
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:28,709
privacy preserve okay anonymous data or

521
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:31,660
anonymized data isn't but there is not

522
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:34,990
anonymized which means that the attacker

523
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:36,670
can link the anonymize data to the true

524
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:39,010
identities of the entities in the data

525
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,900
set or is not data anymore which means

526
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,940
that you have to destroy it so much to

527
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,000
break the link between identities and

528
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,640
the data basically what happens is that

529
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,160
an attacker has some background

530
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:53,440
information that links it with the data

531
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:55,870
that you release to infer information

532
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,290
about the data which is not in the

533
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:01,780
release information right and this can

534
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:04,540
go for like different types of data and

535
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:07,360
recently we have also shown that machine

536
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,889
learning algorithms can extract patterns

537
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,250
from the data even it has been

538
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:16,420
obfuscated a lot so if you see this kind

539
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:18,790
faces in the that are used for

540
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:19,450
anonymizing data it's not anonymous

541
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,460
anymore

542
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:24,490
so machine learning models can can

543
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:27,120
reconstruct the identity of individuals

544
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:30,429
so in general this is what I call

545
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,729
inference avalanche there is some piece

546
00:32:30,429 --> 00:32:35,620
of information that is released there is

547
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:38,350
some information that the attacker has

548
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:42,010
combined together can lead to more

549
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:43,959
inference about the individuals whose

550
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,309
data was used for a computation and

551
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,620
doesn't matter what type of computation

552
00:32:45,309 --> 00:32:49,660
I'm going to give you some information

553
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:55,178
about at an oil statistics and machine

554
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:57,280
learning and for example for for

555
00:32:55,179 --> 00:33:00,220
statistics you have some data you want

556
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:03,070
to release many statistics about the

557
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,809
data records in your data set the

558
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:08,200
attacker can run an inference attacker

559
00:33:04,809 --> 00:33:11,410
to identify which data sets could have

560
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,120
produced these statistics and as you

561
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:18,190
increase the number of statistics that

562
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:19,570
you about your data set the plausible

563
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:23,260
later said that could have produced

564
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:25,030
these data 6 reduces and some of them

565
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,760
have higher probability of being the

566
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:29,649
true original data set and it has been

567
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,950
shown that the attacker can actually

568
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:34,520
reconstruct the via the full data set

569
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,840
with

570
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,310
negligible error as the number of

571
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,580
statistics increases even if the

572
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:46,510
statistics are noisy a little bit all

573
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,480
right or it can be used to identify

574
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:53,150
whose data was using the in the data set

575
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,260
for example NIH is to release the

576
00:33:53,150 --> 00:34:00,130
statistical information about the DNA of

577
00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:02,750
individuals who are in their data sets

578
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:07,179
so the allele frequencies if you're

579
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:09,560
familiar with the DNA data and from that

580
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:13,580
researchers managed to find out whose

581
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,570
data isn't that data set that resulted

582
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:19,790
in this summary statistics which are

583
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:21,710
very harmless right so just I'm just

584
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:24,320
releasing the average value of each

585
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:26,360
attribute but but if there are so many

586
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,980
of those statistics the attacker can

587
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:33,110
actually identify whose data is in the

588
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:36,290
data set and this had consequences a lot

589
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:39,080
of data holders now stop releasing their

590
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,210
data stop releasing the statistics about

591
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:43,969
their data and so on and so forth

592
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:46,070
now I just want to move to what is the

593
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:49,069
topic of this talk that I want to

594
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:51,080
briefly talk about and that is the

595
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:53,270
information leakage through machine

596
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,060
learning models right so you would say

597
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:57,620
well if I'm anonymizing data yeah there

598
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,259
are a lot of attributes which are in the

599
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,509
data set I understand how the attacker

600
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,970
can join this data set with some other

601
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:07,400
it is to reconstruct the identities if

602
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:10,370
you really as a statistics maybe I can

603
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:12,980
tell why this can lead to the inference

604
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:14,509
attacks but machine learning models even

605
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,740
those who design machine learning model

606
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,590
don't know why the machine learning

607
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:21,290
models work right so then how can an

608
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,700
attacker exploit the information which

609
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:25,910
is embedded in a machine learning model

610
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,310
to infer the data set that was used for

611
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:30,350
training of it so in a setting that we

612
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:33,680
have is that we have some data set and

613
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:36,110
that we use using some training

614
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,589
algorithms to construct a model that

615
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:42,920
does for example a classification for us

616
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:46,670
at the time of inference or the test

617
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:48,359
what you do is that you send some data

618
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:51,329
points and the model tells

619
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,239
you what is the probability of each

620
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:56,039
class associated to the data that you

621
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,049
have shared all right very simple very

622
00:35:56,039 --> 00:35:59,460
useful there are a lot of services out

623
00:35:58,049 --> 00:36:02,009
there machine learning as services

624
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:03,660
provided by cloud service providers

625
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:06,480
today that you don't even need to

626
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:08,430
understand how machinery works you just

627
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,319
upload your data they train a model for

628
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:13,618
you and then you have this very simple

629
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:15,989
API through which you can access it all

630
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,119
right and also you know we know that

631
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:20,279
machine learning is eating the world so

632
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,069
everyone is now using machine learning

633
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:26,930
for everything any data that they have

634
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:29,970
so it's very important to ask whether

635
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:32,009
the predictions that I get from the

636
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,828
model actually leak any information

637
00:36:32,009 --> 00:36:36,989
about the data that was used to train

638
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:38,519
the model but note that at the time that

639
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:41,549
you get the predictions the data is gone

640
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:44,189
right so at first phase one we train the

641
00:36:41,549 --> 00:36:45,480
model now in Phase two we just interact

642
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:47,839
with the model you send the query you

643
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,400
get a prediction right so how can this

644
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,349
leak information about the training data

645
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,869
I mean before that I need to clarify

646
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:56,220
what leakage means because when you

647
00:36:54,869 --> 00:36:58,019
interact with a model you learn

648
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:59,759
information from the model right you

649
00:36:58,019 --> 00:37:02,368
didn't know that this patient is

650
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:04,200
susceptible to cancer now you know you

651
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:08,369
didn't know whether you need to invest

652
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,499
in this plan or invest in the other plan

653
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:12,539
but now you know which one is more

654
00:37:10,499 --> 00:37:14,160
important right you didn't know these

655
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:16,499
things before interacting with the model

656
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,980
so not any information that you learn

657
00:37:16,499 --> 00:37:22,169
from the model is privacy violating so

658
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:25,710
what is leakage here if I can learn

659
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:27,960
something about you by interacting with

660
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:30,089
the model that I could have not learned

661
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,799
if you were not in the data set means

662
00:37:30,089 --> 00:37:35,150
that the model is leaking information

663
00:37:31,799 --> 00:37:38,249
about you right because if I get some

664
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:41,009
model and then I interact with the model

665
00:37:38,249 --> 00:37:42,749
and I learned that you know half of the

666
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:44,700
population or male half of the

667
00:37:42,749 --> 00:37:46,558
population or female it doesn't matter

668
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:49,049
if your data was there or not right so

669
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:52,710
this is just generic patterns about the

670
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:56,029
data but if I learned that the chance

671
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:59,760
that an individual particular individual

672
00:37:56,029 --> 00:38:02,760
has cancer

673
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:04,470
but I couldn't tell that while just

674
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,480
looking at the general patterns of the

675
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,618
population means that the model is

676
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,800
leaking information about that

677
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:14,310
individual right so this is what we call

678
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,190
leakage and one more particular way of

679
00:38:14,310 --> 00:38:18,660
measuring leakage is to tell whether by

680
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,280
interacting with the model I can tell

681
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,589
whether your data was used in the

682
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,890
training set of the model or not okay

683
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:30,270
and this is what we investigated as I

684
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,450
said there is machine learning as a

685
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:37,230
service Google Amazon markers of others

686
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,149
provide this data sorry this service and

687
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:41,520
you have no idea what models they

688
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,550
trained and the attacker has no idea to

689
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:49,380
tell what models they trained but it can

690
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:52,310
access the model through this API so

691
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,430
what we went and we designed an attack

692
00:38:52,310 --> 00:39:00,600
that can tell with a very high accuracy

693
00:38:55,430 --> 00:39:04,919
so for this data that was some customers

694
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:07,730
purchase data that was used to train a

695
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:12,300
model online on Google and Amazon

696
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:13,920
platforms with close to 90% accuracy you

697
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:17,160
could tell whether your record was part

698
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,980
of the training set or not and the only

699
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,960
access window of access to the model is

700
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,420
just a prediction I send a query get a

701
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,150
prediction and from that I want to tell

702
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:29,400
whether some particular data was part of

703
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:34,260
the training set or not so these are

704
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:37,440
award-winning set of algorithms tell us

705
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:39,900
that there is a huge risk of using

706
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,210
sensitive data while we're training

707
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,280
machine learning models so so that

708
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,690
because we don't know how the model is

709
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,260
trained therefore there is no way to

710
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:51,119
extract information about the model some

711
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:54,660
very simple statistics that I want to

712
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,890
show to you is that basically the models

713
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:00,629
are more confident on the data that they

714
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:03,000
have seen compared to the data that they

715
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:04,740
haven't seen and this piece of

716
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,830
information could be exploited by the

717
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:09,299
attacker right so the behavior of the

718
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:11,119
models with respect to the data that

719
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:13,480
they have seen during the training is

720
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,340
quite different from the behavior

721
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,619
the models with respect to the data that

722
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,359
they see for the first time right and

723
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:21,220
this is statistical difference could be

724
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:26,920
exploited by the attacker and this is

725
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:29,890
exactly what we explored if the model is

726
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:31,570
released for various reasons now you

727
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:33,940
hear about transparency in machine

728
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:36,000
learning so the yes okay on what model

729
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:39,369
do you use for certain decision-making

730
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,350
you might have even access to the model

731
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:43,869
parameters this is what we call the

732
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:46,779
white box access in the model you know

733
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:50,350
how the model come up with with a

734
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:52,720
decision and you know if you look at

735
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:56,220
these different types of machine

736
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:58,839
learning tasks they extract all sorts of

737
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,368
simple to very complex features about

738
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,859
the data that help you then later on

739
00:41:00,369 --> 00:41:04,840
classify the data and what we ask is

740
00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:08,040
whether the parameters of the model each

741
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:10,780
information for those of you who want be

742
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,910
interested in the techniques basically

743
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,660
there is a training algorithm there's an

744
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:18,399
optimization problem that we solve for

745
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:22,060
coming up with with a model and that

746
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,920
optimization problem the way that we go

747
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:27,150
through different values of the

748
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,710
parameters until we solve the the

749
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:33,190
optimization problem and we find out the

750
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:36,970
final model totally depends on the data

751
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:41,980
that was used for training them all so

752
00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:44,649
the footprint of the data can be seen

753
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:46,660
and extracted from the model parameters

754
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:49,810
and this is exactly what we looked at

755
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,109
and again some other statistics that can

756
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:54,070
show that the behavior of the model

757
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:57,490
parameters with respect to training of

758
00:41:54,070 --> 00:42:00,160
test data is different and what we did

759
00:41:57,490 --> 00:42:02,439
was that we looked at where you will

760
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:04,810
generalize models out there the best

761
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:07,320
machine learning algorithms that are out

762
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:09,850
there for some benchmark data set and

763
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:12,700
what shows is that the ones that are

764
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:16,930
even the best in terms of accuracy that

765
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:20,290
generalize the best leak the most they

766
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:23,339
have huge capacity these machine

767
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:26,320
learning models have so many parameters

768
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,960
to embed the function that they want to

769
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,890
learn

770
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,869
and they use some of this capacity to

771
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,330
learn the task the rest is used to

772
00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:36,800
memorize information and that's a

773
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:39,170
footprint right so we went through all

774
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,900
these different values of parameters by

775
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:44,750
looking at the data and later on the

776
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:47,540
attacker can can exploit this and in

777
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:50,510
fear whose data was in the training set

778
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:55,220
and even reconstruct the data that was

779
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:57,109
used during the training so today I'm

780
00:42:55,220 --> 00:43:01,939
asking this question if you look at

781
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:04,609
different privacy regulations it says

782
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,290
that the personal data or any

783
00:43:04,609 --> 00:43:09,140
information which are directly or

784
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:11,869
indirectly related to an identified

785
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:13,549
around at fybel natural person so

786
00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,830
basically the information that can help

787
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:17,930
you to single out an individual and say

788
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:19,640
okay this is this this information is

789
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:22,940
related to this particular individual

790
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:26,210
and now I'm saying okay that the models

791
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:29,480
enable us to single out individuals from

792
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:34,940
any data and until ok this data was

793
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:37,400
using the training set now can we let me

794
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:40,400
just simply release models or use models

795
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:42,109
in the cases where some attacker can can

796
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:45,650
have access to it or on trusted entity

797
00:43:42,109 --> 00:43:48,819
have access to it it's it's a it's a big

798
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:52,880
question is model

799
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:55,460
personal data should we treat models

800
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,089
similar to the way that we treat raw

801
00:43:55,460 --> 00:44:01,520
data because what the attacks show is

802
00:43:59,089 --> 00:44:04,609
that you can infer a whole lot of

803
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:06,380
information about the models from the

804
00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:11,480
models about the training data right so

805
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:14,420
it's a big question here so I want to

806
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:20,540
just say a few words about what to do

807
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:22,280
right so as privacy experts the first

808
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,690
thing that that we do is to just

809
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,570
identify why you need to use the data in

810
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:32,119
what process and what is your trust

811
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,460
model do you trust the machine on which

812
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:37,940
you do the computation to trust the

813
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:39,500
entity that is going to see the the end

814
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,610
result of the computation what is a

815
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,110
trust model

816
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,300
and based on the trans model based on

817
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:46,220
why you want to use the data we can

818
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:49,760
design privacy-preserving computations

819
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:51,290
that protect against these kind of

820
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,240
inference attacks whether you're

821
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:55,750
outsourcing the data whether it's a

822
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,819
collaborative type of computation

823
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,280
whether you want to do data analytics or

824
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:05,390
you want to enable data release for

825
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,820
acceleration and visualization all of

826
00:45:05,390 --> 00:45:13,129
these need different types of tailored

827
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:16,280
defense mechanisms so for privacy

828
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,870
tourism and computation in order to

829
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,350
protect against the attacks that I

830
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:23,600
mentioned what do we do do we need to

831
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:27,470
make a choice and one choice that we

832
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:30,410
make is to just say what I am I'm fine

833
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:35,330
if general patterns about the data set

834
00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:38,390
are shared but I want to protect the

835
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:39,980
information about individuals right we

836
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,480
need to allow some information to be

837
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:43,010
shared otherwise the data is useless

838
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,650
right the computation is useless

839
00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:48,230
so what computations what kind of

840
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:50,990
information do I allow to to be to be

841
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:52,460
communicated the general patterns the

842
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:56,149
ones that are not dependent on

843
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:58,040
individual records and at the same time

844
00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,890
I want to protect information leakage

845
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:03,770
about individuals I don't want one data

846
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:05,420
point to significantly change the result

847
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,780
of the computation so that the attacker

848
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:10,850
can exploit in other words if you want

849
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,250
to go and collect data or convince the

850
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,900
customers or the data holders to provide

851
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:16,760
data for you for your computation you

852
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:19,600
want to tell them that well whether you

853
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:22,460
participate or you don't participate

854
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:24,200
right the information that someone can

855
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,180
learn about you by observing the results

856
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:28,609
of the competition is the same or more

857
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:31,009
or less the same right because you

858
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:34,100
helped us to learn the general patterns

859
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:40,910
but your specific patterns are not

860
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:43,880
leaked a few other techniques that I

861
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:47,990
refer to them as sharing without sharing

862
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:50,330
you have huge data set you want to

863
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:52,149
release this data set or you want to

864
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,090
learn something from the data set

865
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:57,870
instead of

866
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:59,940
sharing the data why not constructing

867
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:02,250
another data set which is very similar

868
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,320
but not the same as the original data

869
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:07,290
this is through the process of data

870
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:08,580
synthesis and the data synthesis itself

871
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:11,580
should be done in a privacy-preserving

872
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:14,250
manner so that the results the data set

873
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:16,770
that is release cannot be linked back to

874
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,440
the original data set right and we're

875
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:24,990
designing techniques that can probably

876
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:27,330
using mathematical rigor show that there

877
00:47:24,990 --> 00:47:32,040
is no way to link back the release data

878
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:35,880
from the original data and nevertheless

879
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:38,100
you can infer you know you can construct

880
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:40,980
models on the synthetic data you can run

881
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,170
statistics on the on the synthetic data

882
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:47,310
and then use it for whatever purpose

883
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:51,480
that you another one is collaborative

884
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:53,610
learning and the idea is that and this

885
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,850
is this is very important because in

886
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:59,490
many cases we have many entities that

887
00:47:56,850 --> 00:48:00,930
have data but but they don't trust each

888
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:02,970
other to share the data with each other

889
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:06,319
right but they have the same task

890
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:10,020
multiple banks multiple hospitals

891
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:15,800
multiple financial even different

892
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:18,600
departments in one organization and the

893
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:22,860
the platform that that you're designing

894
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:26,390
allows these different entities to learn

895
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:29,120
the same machine learning model together

896
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:34,080
without sharing the data with each other

897
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,420
but sharing some hints about how they

898
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,069
are constructing their models but in a

899
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:39,930
privacy-preserving manner so that those

900
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:42,230
hints also don't leak information about

901
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:45,419
the individual records in their citizens

902
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:51,110
these are just two examples of how we

903
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:51,110
can construct mechanism that can enable

904
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:58,410
privacy preserving computation I'll stop

905
00:48:54,330 --> 00:49:00,660
here and be happy to take questions but

906
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,899
if you want you can also look at our

907
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:07,500
website to find out more about our

908
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,480
research results thanks

909
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:16,230
all right Thank You Reza are there any

910
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:21,570
questions like once going twice

911
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:24,750
ah that's away from dkg hi Daniel Kahn

912
00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:27,660
Gilmore ACLU thanks for presenting this

913
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:31,490
year I think it's useful information and

914
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,390
background for folks to have at the IETF

915
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,569
especially as we move towards things

916
00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:38,640
like software-defined networking and

917
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:42,480
other kinds of mechanisms that might

918
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,220
incorporate machine learning in ways

919
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,460
that I I'm personally kind of terrified

920
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:50,848
of I was curious about your point about

921
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:56,130
personal data whether you know if

922
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:57,510
there's any attempt to classify so one

923
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:59,730
of the things that gdpr and other

924
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:02,460
similar privacy regulations require or

925
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:05,400
want to encourage is the ability to have

926
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:06,869
your data removed from the data set and

927
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:09,450
I'm wondering if you think of models

928
00:50:06,869 --> 00:50:12,869
machine learned models as potentially

929
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:16,319
containing personal data if anyone has

930
00:50:12,869 --> 00:50:18,720
attempted to categorize different

931
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:22,280
machine learning models as models that

932
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,049
you could remove your data from that is

933
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,609
not only can your information be added

934
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:28,650
to the model to make the model more

935
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:30,920
accurate but that at some later date you

936
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,330
could take an existing model and and

937
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:35,520
knowledge about a person's information

938
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:38,430
and effectively remove them from the

939
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:40,530
data set is there any attempt to break

940
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:43,740
that kind of does the question make

941
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:47,400
sense yeah so basically there are two

942
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:51,598
ways to look at this problem right one

943
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:53,820
is by construction right when when I

944
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:58,200
include your data in the training set

945
00:50:53,820 --> 00:51:03,170
can I minimize is the influence of your

946
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:05,609
data to the model so that somehow

947
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:09,000
approximately everybody's data is

948
00:51:05,609 --> 00:51:11,310
removed already right so I learned the

949
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,200
general patterns but the information

950
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,670
about it in the individual or the

951
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,450
influence of each individual on the

952
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:21,660
model is bounded right so somehow

953
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:24,270
everybody's data is remove

954
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,859
except that like there is this small

955
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:28,530
epsilon information about each

956
00:51:25,859 --> 00:51:33,000
individual which which which influences

957
00:51:28,530 --> 00:51:36,810
the model so it is one way to to look at

958
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:38,700
it and the second way is well if I want

959
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:40,470
to totally remove all the bits of

960
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:44,129
information that you contributed to the

961
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:46,379
model can we provide the provable

962
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:49,890
guarantee that now your data is removed

963
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:52,200
for certain types of models is much

964
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:54,868
easier for complex models I don't know

965
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:59,220
such as deep learning there does not

966
00:51:54,869 --> 00:52:01,230
exist a provable technique yet but but

967
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:03,359
people are working on it so this is a

968
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:05,369
problem that that researchers are

969
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,869
working on it on how to I shouldn't

970
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:09,349
prove that all the information about

971
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:11,580
your data is removed from the model

972
00:52:09,349 --> 00:52:13,170
because otherwise you can just now

973
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,299
retrain the whole model but you don't

974
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,790
want to do that right so how can i with

975
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:19,400
minimal effort remove all the

976
00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:22,650
information and prove the guarantee

977
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:23,760
proof yeah you can only retrain it if

978
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:25,380
you've actually kept all of your

979
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,330
training data around right in which case

980
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:29,339
you may that that requires you to store

981
00:52:27,330 --> 00:52:31,529
even more personal data in order to

982
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:33,150
retrain with a smaller so you don't want

983
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,450
to retrain right so what I'm saying is

984
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:38,760
that overall you want to have minimal

985
00:52:36,450 --> 00:52:41,609
effort but provable guarantee that the

986
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:43,470
data is completely removed if you train

987
00:52:41,609 --> 00:52:45,900
it with differential privacy as this is

988
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:48,089
what we are we are doing now then the

989
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:52,020
the influence is already minimum okay so

990
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:54,150
how much more guarantee can you provide

991
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:59,060
then then that's an open question right

992
00:52:54,150 --> 00:53:01,380
for complex models your chrysocolla

993
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:04,049
trying to put together this talk in the

994
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:14,880
last talk I know there's been a fair

995
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:15,960
amount of work on on trying to build and

996
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,640
there's been a fair amount work on

997
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,260
trying to build learning models that

998
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,440
don't involve the central server ever

999
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:23,160
having access to your specific data

1000
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,550
using things like homework for

1001
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:28,680
encryption dollars and more techniques

1002
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:32,490
does that have any substantial impact on

1003
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:34,049
this on this problem ie fuses techniques

1004
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,720
you don't have to worry about release of

1005
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:37,420
the models

1006
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:41,290
or is that not solve the problem yes so

1007
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:44,560
these are two different trust models

1008
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:46,660
right so who the adversary is right is

1009
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:49,359
the adversary the one who is doing the

1010
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:51,460
computation or is the adversary the one

1011
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:53,770
who is observing the result of the

1012
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,349
computation right so what I was talking

1013
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,880
about mostly is about the adversary's

1014
00:53:55,349 --> 00:54:00,099
observe the result of the conversation

1015
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,160
all right so let's say for example if

1016
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:05,950
you have a central server that blindly

1017
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:08,020
trains the model for you later on you

1018
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:10,839
use the model for certain applications

1019
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:12,790
then the inference attack is against the

1020
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:14,710
one who can observe the mulcher yeah no

1021
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:17,319
I understand but I guess my question I'm

1022
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:21,099
getting at is that many situations in

1023
00:54:17,319 --> 00:54:23,680
which the adversary is the is is is the

1024
00:54:21,099 --> 00:54:25,180
people doing them is the site which is

1025
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:27,310
doing the training itself right which is

1026
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:28,299
the machine learning site and that's why

1027
00:54:27,310 --> 00:54:30,400
you want these privacy-preserving

1028
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,050
training systems and so I guess the

1029
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:34,030
question I'm interested in is is that a

1030
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,339
stronger model in the sense that if you

1031
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:37,900
were in the formal sense of strong

1032
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:39,549
namely that if you were protecting as

1033
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:41,530
that model do you also protect against

1034
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:44,079
this kind of attack no no no no okay so

1035
00:54:41,530 --> 00:54:46,089
these are two different types of attacks

1036
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,790
basically one one is the attacker who

1037
00:54:46,089 --> 00:54:52,960
observes the other one is the one that

1038
00:54:48,790 --> 00:54:54,940
infers later on with whatever is or

1039
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,260
catch you later yeah so you have n

1040
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:57,970
numbers you want to compute the average

1041
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,010
somebody computes the average for you

1042
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:02,020
without seeing the numbers right

1043
00:55:00,010 --> 00:55:05,560
somebody observes the average value

1044
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:08,890
right these are two attackers you don't

1045
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:11,290
you want to hide the averaging but also

1046
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:13,750
you want to hide the fact that my data

1047
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:19,560
was used as one of these n data records

1048
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:21,569
Thanks all right thank you as a

1049
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,799
[Music]

1050
00:55:21,569 --> 00:55:28,290
presenter for the next hour come up

1051
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,290
please Sandeep

1052
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:14,230
hello can you owe me hello guys so this

1053
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:17,259
is a talk about how we can improve

1054
00:56:14,230 --> 00:56:20,740
privacy preservation by using a method

1055
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:22,600
of personal tagging it at the source so

1056
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:25,299
let me start with some basics what is

1057
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:27,549
log data so obviously so we all

1058
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:30,400
understand log data is nothing but a

1059
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:33,220
record of information activity of a user

1060
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:38,920
system or an application so the lot of

1061
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:40,330
devices application services do log the

1062
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,870
information about the activity of the

1063
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:45,460
user so log data is always useful to

1064
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:48,220
many actors in the systems whether it's

1065
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,960
a developer who can use it for debugging

1066
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:52,120
troubleshooting purposes also it could

1067
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:54,370
be operationally useful to monitor

1068
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:57,430
system performance measurements Layton

1069
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:59,680
sees and not and of course now nowadays

1070
00:56:57,430 --> 00:57:01,540
for marketing to do analysis on the

1071
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:04,089
systems who understand what is the user

1072
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:06,730
behavior what is the user usage of a

1073
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:10,990
system of a service resource usage

1074
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:14,020
metrics and things like that and a very

1075
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:16,089
important obviously the use of log is

1076
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:20,500
security monitoring so we all already

1077
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:23,650
have a lot of tools which can consume a

1078
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:25,480
lot of blocks and be able to determine

1079
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:28,180
what happened to an event if there's a

1080
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,730
security breach if there is a anti abuse

1081
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:32,649
or a fraud so logs are very useful

1082
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:34,480
source of information to go back track

1083
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:37,890
and figure out what happened to the

1084
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:41,880
system and what went wrong in the system

1085
00:57:37,890 --> 00:57:44,200
so this is a basic life cycle of a log

1086
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:46,240
if you look at right from this

1087
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,790
generation of the log to its

1088
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:50,799
preservation it starts right from the

1089
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,830
source where a user activity gets

1090
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,450
triggered and it could be any

1091
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:58,210
intermediary in the path looking at the

1092
00:57:55,450 --> 00:58:00,879
user flow as its forwarding it or

1093
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:04,390
processing it so every system in the

1094
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,890
path does contribute some information

1095
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,190
about what is happening to the user and

1096
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:08,430
what

1097
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:13,180
system itself is doing with the user and

1098
00:58:08,430 --> 00:58:16,330
user activity typically we have many

1099
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:19,509
devices in the system so that kind of

1100
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:22,450
generate these locks and at the end of

1101
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:24,220
the cycle comes the log preservation so

1102
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,990
now the question is what you do with

1103
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:29,410
some of the log data that you have

1104
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:33,540
collected so there could be many

1105
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:37,060
organizations do invest on tools that

1106
00:58:33,540 --> 00:58:39,640
have some kind of protection to the

1107
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:41,320
locks that are generated because we see

1108
00:58:39,640 --> 00:58:42,940
a lot of locks now being shared with

1109
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:44,800
third party services for either

1110
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,110
monitoring or marketing purposes as we

1111
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:50,680
saw so there is always an activity to

1112
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:52,750
reform the log redact it in terms of the

1113
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:55,149
data that the log already has and then

1114
00:58:52,750 --> 00:58:58,500
eventually give it to a third party or

1115
00:58:55,150 --> 00:59:01,090
outsource it to different vendors to

1116
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:04,690
process the logs and then come up with

1117
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:08,170
some interesting information so if you

1118
00:59:04,690 --> 00:59:10,540
look at the logs logs have been that for

1119
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:12,250
many decades right so we have seen right

1120
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:13,779
from the Network Devices to applications

1121
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:16,120
generating the logs so what has

1122
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,260
fundamentally changed from the log

1123
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:22,000
semantics so obviously there is more

1124
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,430
personalization of the log itself so

1125
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:28,960
there is more applications that are

1126
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:31,569
trying to pin the user information into

1127
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,920
a log so obviously and another trend

1128
00:59:31,570 --> 00:59:35,710
that we are seeing is locks are no

1129
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:37,960
longer just owned by an organization or

1130
00:59:35,710 --> 00:59:40,990
owned by a department in the

1131
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:42,910
organization so it's more shared either

1132
00:59:40,990 --> 00:59:44,890
within the organization or across

1133
00:59:42,910 --> 00:59:47,950
boundaries or of course geographies as

1134
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:50,440
well so largely for kind of purposes

1135
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:54,609
that we already saw and and also the log

1136
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:56,880
itself is no longer analyzed in in silos

1137
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:59,770
so it's basically combined with other

1138
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,570
events of the user or the system so

1139
00:59:59,770 --> 01:00:02,920
there's tools that can do indexing and

1140
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,130
then come out with a common

1141
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:07,900
understanding of what the user or a

1142
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,540
system or a service is trying to do so

1143
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:15,730
it's no longer just in silos

1144
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:19,540
there is also cases where the log itself

1145
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:22,270
can be vulnerable especially when

1146
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,810
when you're sharing with the third party

1147
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:27,130
services the log data can be vulnerable

1148
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:29,440
which can result in sensitive data

1149
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:31,680
leakage so obviously also app also has a

1150
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:34,090
lot of regulations in terms of how you

1151
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:37,118
handle your log data and how do you

1152
01:00:34,090 --> 01:00:38,830
share it with different parties so and

1153
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:40,900
also a very important shift in terms of

1154
01:00:38,830 --> 01:00:44,410
the log usage is the monetization of the

1155
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:47,140
log so just going from from monitoring

1156
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:50,500
and management ability management to

1157
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,379
monetization so what about privacy and

1158
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:57,580
log so it's there are already

1159
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:59,109
organizations that define log data as

1160
01:00:57,580 --> 01:01:02,319
part of their privacy policies they

1161
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:05,080
basically address what which log data is

1162
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:07,000
being collected how they're using the

1163
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:10,900
log data and with whom they are sharing

1164
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:14,950
a lot of vendors do provide that user

1165
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:17,020
policy log usage policy but again the

1166
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:18,850
shift is now towards more regulation of

1167
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,160
the loss especially from a privacy the

1168
01:01:18,850 --> 01:01:23,980
privacy working groups are more focusing

1169
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:27,368
and regulating the log itself the log

1170
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:30,550
data itself so how so when we look at

1171
01:01:27,369 --> 01:01:33,730
log so we see a lot of challenges in

1172
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:35,140
terms of how do you identify something

1173
01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,359
that is sensitive in a log how do you

1174
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:40,210
protect the log so obviously is a lot of

1175
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:42,790
ways in which we can process the logs

1176
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:45,490
but at the same time it's very

1177
01:01:42,790 --> 01:01:47,800
subjective in terms of what a log what

1178
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:49,118
is sensitive data for in a log so it's

1179
01:01:47,800 --> 01:01:53,350
something that the application knows

1180
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:55,990
very well so this whether additional IP

1181
01:01:53,350 --> 01:01:58,420
addresses is something sensitive or

1182
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:00,339
personal again it depends on how the log

1183
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:03,609
is used and how it's collaborated with

1184
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:05,260
other events in the system but at the

1185
01:02:03,609 --> 01:02:08,170
same time we are seeing a lot of vendors

1186
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:09,940
providing various tools like machine

1187
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:13,180
learning data set dictionary based

1188
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:15,760
methods to actually go into the log read

1189
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:17,049
the log and find out what is very

1190
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:22,900
critical about the log and try to

1191
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:24,840
provide a way to mask it or hide it so I

1192
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:28,210
think if you look at what is happening

1193
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:32,950
in terms of the privacy preservation or

1194
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:33,670
data preservation in in locks so it it

1195
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:36,160
requires some

1196
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:38,799
kind of a framework that we see here

1197
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,440
like right from this generation to the

1198
01:02:38,799 --> 01:02:44,259
point of preservation of privacy

1199
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:46,690
preservation so it starts with log

1200
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:49,569
generation so this is a kind of a

1201
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:51,609
framework that we can envision in terms

1202
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:54,250
of the whole privacy even you apply

1203
01:02:51,609 --> 01:02:57,328
privacy to the log it starts from the

1204
01:02:54,250 --> 01:03:00,700
generation where potentially you can tag

1205
01:02:57,329 --> 01:03:03,010
the log with some kind of a metadata so

1206
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,569
some kind of an accession token or

1207
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:07,599
whatever right then there are various

1208
01:03:04,569 --> 01:03:10,779
ways to do that so imagine if we can at

1209
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:12,579
the source point to a system that this

1210
01:03:10,779 --> 01:03:15,250
data that I'm going to put it in a log

1211
01:03:12,579 --> 01:03:18,099
is going to be very sensitive or it's

1212
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:21,339
has some degree of sensitivity to it

1213
01:03:18,099 --> 01:03:24,519
right and that in turn can go into a

1214
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:27,819
detection system so where we don't have

1215
01:03:24,519 --> 01:03:29,229
to do any specific hard coding of course

1216
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:31,869
you can complement this with other

1217
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:34,240
existing methods and then be able to

1218
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:36,430
detect what is private data or personal

1219
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,979
data in the system and the log and then

1220
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:40,480
be able to additionally define what you

1221
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:42,789
want to do with the data whether you

1222
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:46,089
want to remove the field from the log or

1223
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:48,910
you just want to anonymize mask it or do

1224
01:03:46,089 --> 01:03:50,578
anything any actions specific to the log

1225
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:53,799
so and also you can have different

1226
01:03:50,579 --> 01:03:55,539
actions defined to different fields in

1227
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:57,220
the logs potentially so that's where we

1228
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:59,430
saw it could be differential reduction

1229
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:04,450
actions that you can enforce in the law

1230
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:07,089
so based on that idea so the proposal

1231
01:04:04,450 --> 01:04:11,049
here is to look at a way in which the

1232
01:04:07,089 --> 01:04:13,930
source can define some kind of metadata

1233
01:04:11,049 --> 01:04:16,630
so as I said like which can potentially

1234
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:19,598
indicate the interesting fields or

1235
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:21,640
sensitivity fields within the log that

1236
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,769
is being generated so most of us have

1237
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,589
standard long formats that most

1238
01:04:23,769 --> 01:04:31,209
applications use so imagine if you can

1239
01:04:26,589 --> 01:04:32,589
add another framework or another data to

1240
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:35,109
it saying that while you're defining

1241
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:37,269
this log also look at what is going to

1242
01:04:35,109 --> 01:04:40,390
be sensitive in the log so if you if the

1243
01:04:37,269 --> 01:04:42,939
source can assert that within the at the

1244
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:45,069
time of generation so it could be more

1245
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:47,839
useful or more deterministic in the way

1246
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:52,769
the data could be preserved or

1247
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:55,650
policy enforced so this is a an approach

1248
01:04:52,769 --> 01:04:58,950
that we investigated where you can add

1249
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:01,349
something like a PII data within a log

1250
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:03,989
so it could be at the field level saying

1251
01:05:01,349 --> 01:05:06,839
that every field you can tag it with a

1252
01:05:03,989 --> 01:05:08,849
private true or false kind of indicator

1253
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:12,209
or it could be at a log level where you

1254
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:13,739
can enumerate all the variables or all

1255
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:17,640
the identifiers in the log saying that

1256
01:05:13,739 --> 01:05:19,319
this the private feeds so this is not

1257
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,140
something new that is happening with a

1258
01:05:19,319 --> 01:05:25,589
lot of precedence in terms of how or the

1259
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:27,328
the whole method of identifying data so

1260
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:33,359
I hear some vendors that are already

1261
01:05:27,329 --> 01:05:35,849
doing one way or the other so the so

1262
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,369
each one has of course its own way in

1263
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:41,130
syntax or a CLI that they define to

1264
01:05:38,369 --> 01:05:43,769
pretty much define what private data is

1265
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:49,799
in a what constitutes a private data and

1266
01:05:43,769 --> 01:05:51,569
in a log so this is of course a proposal

1267
01:05:49,799 --> 01:05:53,489
that has been submitted so we'll be

1268
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:55,969
welcome to get feedback on what you

1269
01:05:53,489 --> 01:06:00,449
think in terms of this problem statement

1270
01:05:55,969 --> 01:06:02,729
so here is some hackathon results we

1271
01:06:00,449 --> 01:06:06,410
just try to put it together and try to

1272
01:06:02,729 --> 01:06:09,089
compare it but one of the reg X based

1273
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:11,609
approaches so obviously the results is

1274
01:06:09,089 --> 01:06:13,529
that that an explicit marking you have

1275
01:06:11,609 --> 01:06:17,249
of course has more deterministic results

1276
01:06:13,529 --> 01:06:19,529
with heuristics or maybe a data set

1277
01:06:17,249 --> 01:06:22,259
based approach you can get into wrong

1278
01:06:19,529 --> 01:06:24,180
classifications or Miska or something

1279
01:06:22,259 --> 01:06:29,430
else which is not private better getting

1280
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:32,219
mangled so that's it's a very short talk

1281
01:06:29,430 --> 01:06:34,499
and so you would be very interested to

1282
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:37,229
hear your feedback and what you think

1283
01:06:34,499 --> 01:06:39,718
would be the next steps and can we do

1284
01:06:37,229 --> 01:06:41,839
from a working group point of view thank

1285
01:06:39,719 --> 01:06:41,839
you

1286
01:06:47,059 --> 01:06:54,960
hi Daniel Congo Morgan thanks for this I

1287
01:06:51,710 --> 01:06:57,119
the your your point about the way that

1288
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,730
logs are shifting globally is I think

1289
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:04,319
very well taken and something I I don't

1290
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:08,130
know how traditionally the IETF has not

1291
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:12,808
bothered too much with what happens

1292
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:14,609
outside of the network protocol and the

1293
01:07:12,809 --> 01:07:17,160
this is now is starting to sort of

1294
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:19,799
starting to look at what gets into

1295
01:07:17,160 --> 01:07:21,598
what's what's stored as a result I think

1296
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:23,339
that's useful but I can imagine there

1297
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:29,400
might be some people who are scared

1298
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:30,839
about seeing mission creep or something

1299
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,490
around it but I do think that we that we

1300
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:33,630
should be addressing it I'm wondering

1301
01:07:32,490 --> 01:07:39,919
whether you've whether you've looked

1302
01:07:33,630 --> 01:07:42,750
also at systems for like deterministic

1303
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:46,200
or format preserving encryption for logs

1304
01:07:42,750 --> 01:07:48,900
yeah it seems like it sort of fits into

1305
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,368
this general framework I know that there

1306
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:54,839
was some discussion with Indy Prive

1307
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:56,430
about IP address within deep breath

1308
01:07:54,839 --> 01:07:58,410
the I don't remember there was other

1309
01:07:56,430 --> 01:08:00,720
discussion here the IDF about about that

1310
01:07:58,410 --> 01:08:02,339
kind of work and it might be worth

1311
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,439
trying to fold in these questions about

1312
01:08:02,339 --> 01:08:05,910
you know key rotation and things like

1313
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,480
that like what you can do with these

1314
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:13,529
when you have fields that you want to to

1315
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:16,408
scrub my one other piece of feedback for

1316
01:08:13,529 --> 01:08:18,000
this is that this seems to take for

1317
01:08:16,408 --> 01:08:20,309
granted the idea that the way that you

1318
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,939
identify PII as you say this field this

1319
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:25,080
PII and this field is not and well I

1320
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:26,750
think that's tempting from an

1321
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:29,488
engineering standpoint I think it is

1322
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:32,149
very unrealistic in terms of what

1323
01:08:29,488 --> 01:08:34,888
actually personally identifiable data is

1324
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:37,638
that I did is identifiable in

1325
01:08:34,889 --> 01:08:43,350
combination and not as specific fields

1326
01:08:37,639 --> 01:08:44,520
and so you could I mean my name is not

1327
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:46,679
personally identifiable because there's

1328
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:48,989
somebody else who has my same name but

1329
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:51,540
that in combination with my with say the

1330
01:08:48,988 --> 01:08:53,278
state that I live in is and so maybe the

1331
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:55,710
name is not be iin the state's not PII

1332
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:57,240
but the two together are P and so this

1333
01:08:55,710 --> 01:09:00,000
is this is a problem with the Const

1334
01:08:57,240 --> 01:09:00,769
PII itself but I think we need to be

1335
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,830
careful about

1336
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:06,600
enshrining that in in our data

1337
01:09:04,830 --> 01:09:08,970
representations yeah that's a good

1338
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:12,240
feedback thank you yes so just I'll just

1339
01:09:08,970 --> 01:09:14,730
respond as to your last point EKG also I

1340
01:09:12,240 --> 01:09:16,979
think we were definitely I see as your

1341
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:18,779
draft thing that we're just saying that

1342
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:21,000
PA equals true I think definitely agree

1343
01:09:18,779 --> 01:09:22,349
that that's not you know that's not

1344
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,990
sufficient I think one thing you were

1345
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:28,260
looking at was sensitivity level so you

1346
01:09:24,990 --> 01:09:30,300
could maybe classify certain fields as

1347
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,010
belonging to a certain set of feel you

1348
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:34,080
like in terms of how sensitive they

1349
01:09:32,010 --> 01:09:35,820
could be in combination with others and

1350
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,590
then you could have a policy where if

1351
01:09:35,819 --> 01:09:39,420
you know there's too many of these then

1352
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:49,080
you say that Oh redact all of them

1353
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:50,520
that's something we did think about this

1354
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,830
is interesting we have actually been

1355
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:55,320
trying to address this at the basic

1356
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:56,610
level because it's sexual a problem you

1357
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:59,460
have whenever you have an application

1358
01:09:56,610 --> 01:10:02,820
that generates logs today in Europe at

1359
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,320
least you have to defend and perfected

1360
01:10:02,820 --> 01:10:06,660
that personal information even just the

1361
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:08,639
IP addresses that are in the logs so we

1362
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:10,019
have been experimenting with for example

1363
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,120
and clipping the IP addresses in place

1364
01:10:10,020 --> 01:10:14,340
and in a way that they can be light of

1365
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:16,920
the cripton if necessary but with proper

1366
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:18,780
procedures in case of monitoring law

1367
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,000
enforcement in this kind of stuff so

1368
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,740
maybe it would make sense to have some

1369
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,290
kind of best practices across the

1370
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:27,420
industry on how to do this in a

1371
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:29,519
consistent way even if each application

1372
01:10:27,420 --> 01:10:32,850
even for the same kind of service has

1373
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:34,740
different log formats maybe but maybe

1374
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:37,500
some discussion on general principles

1375
01:10:34,740 --> 01:10:45,540
could be useful so that we get to a good

1376
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:48,740
way of doing this was heard Karzai two

1377
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:51,090
comments one actually did tkg's point

1378
01:10:48,740 --> 01:10:53,040
the ATF has a lot of protocols that

1379
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:55,440
actually shipped logs around in various

1380
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:56,730
formats including you know everything

1381
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,830
from and actually shipped straight in

1382
01:10:56,730 --> 01:11:00,509
DNS they're shipped in syslog they're

1383
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:02,040
shipped in syslog-ng they're shipped in

1384
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:03,150
net comp they're shipped and you know

1385
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:06,140
there's actually a lot of places where

1386
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,610
log information is sent an SNMP

1387
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:10,650
that so I like your approach a lot

1388
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,190
there's only one question that I had

1389
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,009
with it

1390
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:15,780
which is you specifically said no

1391
01:11:13,010 --> 01:11:17,010
hard-coded rules and I don't understand

1392
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:19,320
the motivation for that of why you

1393
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:21,330
wouldn't do both hard-coded rules and

1394
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:22,889
machine learning because her rule

1395
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:24,900
hard-coded rules are pretty much a

1396
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:26,640
guaranteed ground truth always will

1397
01:11:24,900 --> 01:11:28,049
match because I'm removing you know a

1398
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,850
user name field that I know about

1399
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:31,230
whereas if you just let the machine

1400
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:33,270
learning component take over it just

1401
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:35,759
make it a 80% chance of removing now

1402
01:11:33,270 --> 01:11:37,860
sometimes can you just debate it because

1403
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,430
I think you the question was about no

1404
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:46,889
hard coding was it that so go back a

1405
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:49,710
couple of slides that one this one yeah

1406
01:11:46,890 --> 01:11:53,280
so you said detect personal data and you

1407
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:54,750
had no heard coding okay and so I would

1408
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:58,139
think that you would want a combination

1409
01:11:54,750 --> 01:12:00,270
of a you know of an automatic you know

1410
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:01,830
machine learning best approach and you

1411
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:04,230
know expert knowledge where you know

1412
01:12:01,830 --> 01:12:04,680
it's always right yeah yeah that that's

1413
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:07,290
a good point

1414
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:09,810
so obviously it's going to be like a

1415
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:11,640
compliment to what mesh methods are

1416
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:12,810
already there so just that it could be

1417
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:14,880
another input for a machine learning

1418
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,310
model to see okay this is the indication

1419
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:19,590
from the source that the degree of

1420
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:22,620
sensitivity could be there so that way

1421
01:12:19,590 --> 01:12:25,050
it could be used well specifically I

1422
01:12:22,620 --> 01:12:27,750
would think I would use the log

1423
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:29,969
detection mechanism and with that

1424
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:31,890
augmented with you know expert knowledge

1425
01:12:29,969 --> 01:12:34,770
at the end so that the redaction took

1426
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:36,600
both you know the the fixed hard set of

1427
01:12:34,770 --> 01:12:38,610
rules and the machine learning component

1428
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:46,080
and then did either or of them you would

1429
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:47,099
remove this channeling Chris lemons from

1430
01:12:46,080 --> 01:12:50,430
Comcast

1431
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:53,190
from Java I think this was in response

1432
01:12:50,430 --> 01:12:54,960
to de cádiz comment which is what

1433
01:12:53,190 --> 01:12:56,849
happens off the network is often a

1434
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,980
consequence of what happens on the

1435
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:59,660
network it's easily in the scope in my

1436
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,320
opinion

1437
01:12:59,660 --> 01:13:06,510
what happens of the network what happens

1438
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:09,179
off the network is often a consequence

1439
01:13:06,510 --> 01:13:17,100
of what happens on the network and it's

1440
01:13:09,180 --> 01:13:20,040
easily in the scope in Ben Schwartz if

1441
01:13:17,100 --> 01:13:24,419
you're looking for a place at the IETF

1442
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:26,820
to do this kind of work I would suggest

1443
01:13:24,419 --> 01:13:29,519
narrowing scope here or narrowing

1444
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:32,070
generality and trying to look very

1445
01:13:29,519 --> 01:13:33,989
specifically at a specific existing

1446
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:36,688
systems that generate logs one that

1447
01:13:33,989 --> 01:13:39,409
comes to mind is HTTP request logging

1448
01:13:36,689 --> 01:13:41,969
which is of course almost universal

1449
01:13:39,409 --> 01:13:44,728
that's a case where the IETF has

1450
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:47,070
substantial authority and if we for

1451
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:49,860
example identified different kinds of

1452
01:13:47,070 --> 01:13:51,869
different specific header fields that

1453
01:13:49,860 --> 01:13:53,909
that should be logged differently in

1454
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:55,919
different circumstances that's something

1455
01:13:53,909 --> 01:13:58,138
that we could reasonably make a

1456
01:13:55,919 --> 01:14:01,199
recommendation about I also know that

1457
01:13:58,139 --> 01:14:06,269
there are there are people out there who

1458
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:09,079
believe that servers will log their HTTP

1459
01:14:06,269 --> 01:14:11,579
requests in different ways and have

1460
01:14:09,079 --> 01:14:15,599
encoded assumptions about that into how

1461
01:14:11,579 --> 01:14:19,320
their clients behave so for example I've

1462
01:14:15,599 --> 01:14:23,399
seen I've seen assumptions in systems

1463
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:27,209
related to doe that requests of the form

1464
01:14:23,399 --> 01:14:29,489
get will have their full query path log

1465
01:14:27,209 --> 01:14:33,829
but requests that are formed as a post

1466
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:33,829
will not have the post body logged right

1467
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:39,780
baby and that is in fact a popular that

1468
01:14:38,459 --> 01:14:41,039
is consistent with implementation but

1469
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:43,139
it's not something that's ever been it's

1470
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,300
documented and standardized maybe it

1471
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:47,639
should be yeah I think that's agreed

1472
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:48,959
that generalization is it a part part

1473
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:51,269
yeah because some of the vendors that we

1474
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:53,729
are seeing there again focused on a very

1475
01:14:51,269 --> 01:14:56,429
specific type of log that they want to

1476
01:14:53,729 --> 01:14:58,860
provide the redaction so the very

1477
01:14:56,429 --> 01:15:01,019
specific for instance they only look at

1478
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:04,259
HTTP packet or they only look at maybe

1479
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:06,599
SF CFL kind of a formatted log so but I

1480
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:09,679
think you're pretty right in terms of

1481
01:15:06,599 --> 01:15:12,179
saying that we have to narrow the scope

1482
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,969
one reason to keep it general was to

1483
01:15:12,179 --> 01:15:17,130
like have a deliberate decision to keep

1484
01:15:14,969 --> 01:15:19,409
it like a research document trying to

1485
01:15:17,130 --> 01:15:21,719
see explore the space essentially but I

1486
01:15:19,409 --> 01:15:23,459
agree like if subsequent jobs try to

1487
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:28,590
make it more narrow that would be it'll

1488
01:15:23,459 --> 01:15:31,590
belong in the IETF Thank You Allison

1489
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:32,669
Menken Salesforce thank you for the

1490
01:15:31,590 --> 01:15:37,229
great presentation

1491
01:15:32,669 --> 01:15:38,340
I support adopting this as an IEEE RTF

1492
01:15:37,229 --> 01:15:41,820
document just to

1493
01:15:38,340 --> 01:15:43,710
back to something that Ben just said I

1494
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:46,530
think you don't really have the option

1495
01:15:43,710 --> 01:15:48,900
of being very prescriptive but you can

1496
01:15:46,530 --> 01:15:51,570
actually provide of you can but it will

1497
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:54,629
won't be standard but you can provide

1498
01:15:51,570 --> 01:15:56,969
questions and guidance that can later be

1499
01:15:54,630 --> 01:16:00,390
valid valuable into the standards

1500
01:15:56,970 --> 01:16:02,670
process a thing that struck me about

1501
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:05,580
that was I mean there's a there's a

1502
01:16:02,670 --> 01:16:08,340
saying that the best logs for privacy

1503
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:10,530
are the ones you don't retain and you

1504
01:16:08,340 --> 01:16:11,910
you gave this great statement that you

1505
01:16:10,530 --> 01:16:14,099
know people have more and more reasons

1506
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:16,620
why they're retaining and using logs

1507
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:20,820
perhaps this document could also talk

1508
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:23,760
about kind of a time limit like at a

1509
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:26,670
certain point you really have made a

1510
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:28,230
tremendous loss of privacy by keeping it

1511
01:16:26,670 --> 01:16:30,300
beyond that point and give some of the

1512
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:33,480
reasoning for that and that might help

1513
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:35,940
to advise people to to improve their

1514
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:39,750
policies I know if you have a comment on

1515
01:16:35,940 --> 01:16:42,660
that okay so I think it also depends on

1516
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:45,230
the policy privacy policy itself right I

1517
01:16:42,660 --> 01:16:47,790
think there are a lot of organizations

1518
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:50,820
the regulations that define what is the

1519
01:16:47,790 --> 01:16:52,790
timeline I think it's a good input but

1520
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:55,380
we'll have to look at it from the

1521
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:57,780
privacy policy point of view and see if

1522
01:16:55,380 --> 01:17:00,570
we can put those guidelines but you are

1523
01:16:57,780 --> 01:17:04,050
right in terms of identifying a specific

1524
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:06,420
time limit as you said right it should

1525
01:17:04,050 --> 01:17:08,010
be useful at some point of time it may

1526
01:17:06,420 --> 01:17:11,120
be we have to be more pragmatic about

1527
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,120
that agree thank you

1528
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:18,060
it's Chris lemons of Comcast in the

1529
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:19,440
Jabra chart again consider the audience

1530
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,760
who will read this document

1531
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,740
people who write drafts that

1532
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:26,720
standardized or generate logs might be a

1533
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,719
good set of members for that audience I

1534
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:34,679
didn't quite get it can you repeat it

1535
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:36,480
again yes I'll repeat that consider the

1536
01:17:34,680 --> 01:17:37,650
audience who will read this document

1537
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:40,230
people who write drafts that

1538
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:44,120
standardized or generate logs might be a

1539
01:17:40,230 --> 01:17:44,120
good set of members for that audience

1540
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:51,389
thank you all right so there seems to be

1541
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,400
some interest in this document and

1542
01:17:51,389 --> 01:17:55,650
there's some overlap with work that's

1543
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:57,179
going on in the IETF can I get a quick

1544
01:17:55,650 --> 01:18:02,549
show of hands from people in the room

1545
01:17:57,179 --> 01:18:04,980
who have read this so a couple hands go

1546
01:18:02,550 --> 01:18:06,239
up how about a show of hands of people

1547
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:12,209
who are interested in this particular

1548
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:13,769
topic a lot more hands noted okay so I

1549
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:16,530
guess based on that I I'm gonna do a

1550
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:19,980
home for adoption right now so the

1551
01:18:16,530 --> 01:18:21,509
question is pretty simple if you support

1552
01:18:19,980 --> 01:18:26,089
adoption of this particular document

1553
01:18:21,510 --> 01:18:26,090
into the research group please home now

1554
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:36,839
and if you do not support adoption

1555
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:39,058
please home now all right so there seem

1556
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,739
to be stronger support for adoption of

1557
01:18:39,059 --> 01:18:44,610
course we'll confirm on the list and go

1558
01:18:40,739 --> 01:18:46,079
from there and if you have any comments

1559
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:47,670
on the document in the meantime please

1560
01:18:46,079 --> 01:18:48,808
you know reach out to the authors or

1561
01:18:47,670 --> 01:19:13,369
something on the list as well that'd be

1562
01:18:48,809 --> 01:19:16,500
helpful thank you thank you alright

1563
01:19:13,369 --> 01:19:18,299
hello everyone names Chris Wood this

1564
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,280
should hopefully be very quick because

1565
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:24,420
we talked about this last meeting in

1566
01:19:20,280 --> 01:19:25,739
Montreal or there was a talk similar

1567
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,840
today in our W paper that was presented

1568
01:19:25,739 --> 01:19:30,150
and we presented some results that were

1569
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:32,940
similar to it so this is just going to

1570
01:19:30,150 --> 01:19:34,589
go over the document that we have sort

1571
01:19:32,940 --> 01:19:37,259
of describing the network based website

1572
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:39,989
being a pending problem and ask you some

1573
01:19:37,260 --> 01:19:41,699
questions so some background for people

1574
01:19:39,989 --> 01:19:42,949
who were not there in Montreal and don't

1575
01:19:41,699 --> 01:19:45,678
really know what I'm talking about

1576
01:19:42,949 --> 01:19:49,138
website fingerprinting very vaguely or

1577
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:51,360
broadly is this class of attacks that

1578
01:19:49,139 --> 01:19:55,380
basically try to use metadata of some

1579
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:57,480
sort to figure out some sensitive

1580
01:19:55,380 --> 01:19:59,100
application data so a common example

1581
01:19:57,480 --> 01:20:01,410
this is looking at Ben

1582
01:19:59,100 --> 01:20:03,300
from TOS connections like the sizes of

1583
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:05,190
records or the timing of records that

1584
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:07,860
are sent over a particular connection in

1585
01:20:05,190 --> 01:20:11,580
trying to infer what application data is

1586
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:13,769
sent equally could be looking at the IP

1587
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:16,550
addresses of you know a particular

1588
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:19,050
connection in trying to infer what the

1589
01:20:16,550 --> 01:20:22,200
service or domain a particular

1590
01:20:19,050 --> 01:20:23,790
connection corresponds to we're not

1591
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,200
being super specific with this

1592
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:27,030
particular definition it's just

1593
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,450
generally about using metadata to

1594
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:33,000
identify a particular website or service

1595
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:35,670
and so this document sort of was born

1596
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:38,280
out of discussions with Ian Goldberg and

1597
01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:41,100
Tawang who are heavily involved in the

1598
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:44,099
Tor community basically asking whether

1599
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:47,010
or not all the attacks that have been

1600
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:48,660
done on tour or sort of relevant to or

1601
01:20:47,010 --> 01:20:52,410
applicable to you know things that we

1602
01:20:48,660 --> 01:20:54,750
would do on the ITF and moreover to what

1603
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:58,380
extent are these attacks applicable in

1604
01:20:54,750 --> 01:21:02,160
practice and do they scale well to you

1605
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:04,230
know the internet so in trying to you

1606
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:06,690
know get our heads around this we

1607
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:08,040
basically went and looked at a bunch of

1608
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:12,839
research papers that were published on

1609
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:14,550
this topic and summarized them both for

1610
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:15,930
our own knowledge and hopefully for the

1611
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:19,140
benefit of others who potentially read

1612
01:21:15,930 --> 01:21:21,000
this here's the outline of the document

1613
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,440
if you have not looked at it so it

1614
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,240
basically it goes and describes the

1615
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,490
general problem describes the known

1616
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:28,590
attacks that are that are in these

1617
01:21:26,490 --> 01:21:31,710
papers describe certain defenses that

1618
01:21:28,590 --> 01:21:33,960
are also been experimenting with and

1619
01:21:31,710 --> 01:21:37,140
have been deployed in practice to some

1620
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:38,850
extent particularly in the Tor space and

1621
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,740
then ask some open questions for how

1622
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:42,900
these might be relevant for you know

1623
01:21:40,740 --> 01:21:45,179
existing ITF protocols or ITF protocols

1624
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:46,740
going forward so pretty straightforward

1625
01:21:45,180 --> 01:21:48,630
very similar to Joe's draft on

1626
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:52,740
censorship tech in the sense that we

1627
01:21:48,630 --> 01:21:57,000
were just serving existing stuff so a

1628
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:58,980
question to people here are first is

1629
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:00,870
this useful to anyone besides me because

1630
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:02,549
I in writing this down I had to read a

1631
01:22:00,870 --> 01:22:06,090
lot of papers and that was useful so I'm

1632
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:09,980
learned something from it maybe it's

1633
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:13,030
useful to the IETF or I or TF who knows

1634
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:14,860
and if it is useful

1635
01:22:13,030 --> 01:22:19,599
should this happened here in perigee or

1636
01:22:14,860 --> 01:22:21,159
elsewhere who knows does the scope need

1637
01:22:19,599 --> 01:22:24,699
to change if we take things out remove

1638
01:22:21,159 --> 01:22:27,009
things whatever and similar to Joe's

1639
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:28,960
draft this is sort of problematic

1640
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:31,210
because the nature of this document is

1641
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:33,369
whenever new paper is published I go in

1642
01:22:31,210 --> 01:22:35,139
and summarize it and put it in and that

1643
01:22:33,369 --> 01:22:36,759
sort of implies that you know publishing

1644
01:22:35,139 --> 01:22:40,599
it something that's sort of stable is

1645
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:43,539
not perhaps the best way forward so I

1646
01:22:40,599 --> 01:22:48,099
will defer to the mic that was a lot of

1647
01:22:43,539 --> 01:22:50,199
questions all right I mean yeah go I

1648
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:55,360
mean yes this is absolutely useful um

1649
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:58,739
you know we you know there's like a long

1650
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,389
list of mechanisms that allow you know

1651
01:22:58,739 --> 01:23:04,808
that allow passive or active observers

1652
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:08,170
to determine what your you know what

1653
01:23:04,809 --> 01:23:09,969
browsing behavior is and you know once

1654
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:12,070
we finish like removing all the ones

1655
01:23:09,969 --> 01:23:14,440
that like just like steak flat out what

1656
01:23:12,070 --> 01:23:16,119
pressing behavior is you know eventually

1657
01:23:14,440 --> 01:23:18,129
this will come like the easiest way to

1658
01:23:16,119 --> 01:23:20,380
do it and so getting a handle on how to

1659
01:23:18,130 --> 01:23:23,289
fix that it seems like super critical

1660
01:23:20,380 --> 01:23:24,730
I think PRG seems like the right place

1661
01:23:23,289 --> 01:23:26,889
for this it's hard to see where else

1662
01:23:24,730 --> 01:23:28,329
it's gonna sit I don't think HTTP really

1663
01:23:26,889 --> 01:23:31,150
is gonna like know what to do with this

1664
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:33,789
um I think you know that the output of

1665
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:35,710
this work you know or recommendations

1666
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:36,849
for a shippi should do to like actually

1667
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:39,389
pretty figure pretty harder would be

1668
01:23:36,849 --> 01:23:42,429
something you could feed into HTTP um um

1669
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:45,039
I I agree like probably having an RFC

1670
01:23:42,429 --> 01:23:48,429
doesn't seem like super like how fol cuz

1671
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:50,949
it's kind of static um um you know I

1672
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:52,179
don't know maybe the IDF application

1673
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:53,888
process is lightweight enough that you

1674
01:23:52,179 --> 01:23:55,780
could like crank out new RC every year

1675
01:23:53,889 --> 01:23:58,020
or something but the existence of this

1676
01:23:55,780 --> 01:24:00,460
document seems like super helpful um so

1677
01:23:58,020 --> 01:24:04,030
I would encourage you to keep at it and

1678
01:24:00,460 --> 01:24:05,980
I guess I don't know the RTI process

1679
01:24:04,030 --> 01:24:07,840
well enough but you know a dump things

1680
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:09,459
working group items at the signal this

1681
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:12,520
is like something that we think is

1682
01:24:09,460 --> 01:24:15,699
important sometimes viable yeah it may

1683
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:17,800
be with respect to the how frequently

1684
01:24:15,699 --> 01:24:19,419
update the document may be the approach

1685
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:20,739
is just make it a github page or

1686
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,659
something and then I just update it

1687
01:24:20,739 --> 01:24:24,968
there and point people to it from the

1688
01:24:22,659 --> 01:24:26,679
purging thing I don't know yeah I'm

1689
01:24:24,969 --> 01:24:28,209
gonna I see Cullen's bike way behind us

1690
01:24:26,679 --> 01:24:31,329
so he has an opinion and how does that

1691
01:24:28,209 --> 01:24:32,979
work but this is a good work and you

1692
01:24:31,329 --> 01:24:34,449
should keep that Thanks

1693
01:24:32,979 --> 01:24:36,670
yeah I totally agree I think it's useful

1694
01:24:34,449 --> 01:24:38,709
for our chef and I think ietf I think

1695
01:24:36,670 --> 01:24:41,709
folks you're gonna get wider readership

1696
01:24:38,709 --> 01:24:43,150
from folks who just like with the

1697
01:24:41,709 --> 01:24:44,019
censorship graph people walk up to me

1698
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:45,489
and they're like wow this is really

1699
01:24:44,019 --> 01:24:48,599
helpful for a number of reasons and

1700
01:24:45,489 --> 01:24:53,438
they've never you know touched protocols

1701
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:55,780
I think the scope is right I do wonder

1702
01:24:53,439 --> 01:24:57,219
if there's gonna be a way to capture

1703
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:58,570
things that maybe don't make it

1704
01:24:57,219 --> 01:25:00,099
necessarily into the academic literature

1705
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:01,599
I know that's where you sort of started

1706
01:25:00,099 --> 01:25:04,469
from and maybe that's something to think

1707
01:25:01,599 --> 01:25:07,179
about like what what level does it reach

1708
01:25:04,469 --> 01:25:11,619
to make it in there and I guess in terms

1709
01:25:07,179 --> 01:25:13,389
of being living I don't know there's

1710
01:25:11,619 --> 01:25:16,150
nothing wrong with having an ID that

1711
01:25:13,389 --> 01:25:18,400
gets updated occasionally and and peeled

1712
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:21,638
off if we need something to point to as

1713
01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,829
canonical but yeah I don't know if I

1714
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:25,599
have anything useful to say there but

1715
01:25:22,829 --> 01:25:28,719
yeah thanks all right this is Joe from I

1716
01:25:25,599 --> 01:25:30,789
suck that just to clarify the criteria

1717
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,130
for the criteria for putting something

1718
01:25:30,789 --> 01:25:34,300
in this document was very low I had to

1719
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:35,949
do something with what's I figure

1720
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:38,559
bridging and it had to show up in my

1721
01:25:35,949 --> 01:25:41,699
Google Scholar Alert so that's pretty

1722
01:25:38,559 --> 01:25:44,530
much it this is general Khan Gilmore so

1723
01:25:41,699 --> 01:25:47,339
thanks for this seconding previous to

1724
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:51,219
commenters we definitely need this work

1725
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:53,530
the the framing of web site

1726
01:25:51,219 --> 01:25:55,329
fingerprinting I think is maybe a little

1727
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:58,809
bit confusing given the way that we're

1728
01:25:55,329 --> 01:26:01,449
talking about HTTP as transport these

1729
01:25:58,809 --> 01:26:03,939
days and so it might be worth trying to

1730
01:26:01,449 --> 01:26:06,820
think about what we want to talk about

1731
01:26:03,939 --> 01:26:08,679
there right yeah I'm a bit unhappy with

1732
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:10,478
the term website fingerprinting it's

1733
01:26:08,679 --> 01:26:13,449
just what's used traditionally in the

1734
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:14,979
literature typically because like it

1735
01:26:13,449 --> 01:26:16,030
started off in tour in that particular

1736
01:26:14,979 --> 01:26:17,499
way and they've just carried it forward

1737
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:19,509
so yeah if there's a better term the

1738
01:26:17,499 --> 01:26:21,249
more accurately capture what we're

1739
01:26:19,510 --> 01:26:22,869
trying to actually do today I will

1740
01:26:21,249 --> 01:26:24,789
happily use it not sure what it would be

1741
01:26:22,869 --> 01:26:25,808
so so what's interesting is that it used

1742
01:26:24,789 --> 01:26:26,679
to be that you'd say website

1743
01:26:25,809 --> 01:26:28,809
fingerprinting because you were

1744
01:26:26,679 --> 01:26:30,519
distinguishing between that and other

1745
01:26:28,809 --> 01:26:32,650
forms of network traffic fingerprinting

1746
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:34,739
but now that most network traffic wants

1747
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:36,969
to be HTTP traffic in the first place

1748
01:26:34,739 --> 01:26:38,468
all of a sudden we're back to kind of

1749
01:26:36,969 --> 01:26:40,760
network traffic fingerprinting point

1750
01:26:38,469 --> 01:26:43,789
yeah so so I'm not sure what

1751
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:45,699
balances as far as the live document or

1752
01:26:43,789 --> 01:26:47,690
whatever

1753
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:49,879
please keep working on it

1754
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:52,009
let's have revisions for it if it turns

1755
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:53,690
out that it's useful to say here's what

1756
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:56,300
we think network traffic fingerprinting

1757
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:57,980
looks like in 2020 that's a that's a

1758
01:26:56,300 --> 01:27:00,530
perfectly legitimate document to produce

1759
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:02,598
as long as we continue to revise that

1760
01:27:00,530 --> 01:27:03,920
you know the the baseline draft that

1761
01:27:02,599 --> 01:27:06,070
produces that so that maybe we want

1762
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:10,610
another one at four twenty twenty five

1763
01:27:06,070 --> 01:27:12,018
but that but but yeah I do I do think we

1764
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:14,900
need a place to collect this information

1765
01:27:12,019 --> 01:27:16,760
and we need a place to point people to

1766
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:20,030
when they start designing new protocols

1767
01:27:16,760 --> 01:27:24,469
as they inevitably will that make these

1768
01:27:20,030 --> 01:27:38,360
same mistakes again thank you just like

1769
01:27:24,469 --> 01:27:41,179
given up on the mic stand here gotta go

1770
01:27:38,360 --> 01:27:43,400
back to first principles here miss

1771
01:27:41,179 --> 01:27:44,960
Richard Barnes I'm just gonna +1 all the

1772
01:27:43,400 --> 01:27:47,119
comments about this being valuable work

1773
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,920
and caging mostly cover what I was

1774
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:51,018
thinking about you know extending to non

1775
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:53,420
web applications because like everybody

1776
01:27:51,019 --> 01:27:54,650
uses HTTP now and concerns for

1777
01:27:53,420 --> 01:27:57,110
fingerprinting what apps are on your

1778
01:27:54,650 --> 01:27:58,429
phone is very similar to consume a

1779
01:27:57,110 --> 01:28:01,369
fingerprinting what websites you're

1780
01:27:58,429 --> 01:28:03,289
visiting as far as stability like I

1781
01:28:01,369 --> 01:28:04,579
wouldn't be it doesn't seem like we

1782
01:28:03,289 --> 01:28:07,130
would fail here if we produced a

1783
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:09,619
snapshot at the time and revisited at

1784
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:12,409
the time a one thing that could be done

1785
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:14,239
to give this a bit more longevity is to

1786
01:28:12,409 --> 01:28:15,949
think about whether there's some you

1787
01:28:14,239 --> 01:28:18,169
know abstractions one could make over

1788
01:28:15,949 --> 01:28:20,329
the techniques in the literature and to

1789
01:28:18,170 --> 01:28:22,400
discuss general classes of attacks I

1790
01:28:20,329 --> 01:28:25,039
mean kind of call those out as guidance

1791
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:26,989
for things people to consider in in

1792
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:29,719
designing protocols we did this there's

1793
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:32,980
something similar a few years ago a few

1794
01:28:29,719 --> 01:28:35,420
IAB folks and I did a draft about

1795
01:28:32,980 --> 01:28:37,459
censorship techniques on ways you could

1796
01:28:35,420 --> 01:28:40,250
do blocking where we talked about

1797
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:44,090
generic classes of approach to that that

1798
01:28:40,250 --> 01:28:47,360
problem so to speak and in ways that in

1799
01:28:44,090 --> 01:28:48,710
the you know the advantages that the the

1800
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,839
ways they could be deployed and the

1801
01:28:48,710 --> 01:28:52,369
things they break and so I think a

1802
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:53,170
similar approach could could work here I

1803
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:54,969
haven't

1804
01:28:53,170 --> 01:28:56,950
I admit dived into the document real

1805
01:28:54,970 --> 01:28:59,110
detail but that would give that this

1806
01:28:56,950 --> 01:29:00,730
document a bit more longevity yeah good

1807
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:02,469
suggestion we haven't taken the time to

1808
01:29:00,730 --> 01:29:04,240
sort of try to generalize anything it's

1809
01:29:02,470 --> 01:29:05,680
really been just a brain dump of what

1810
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,690
we've discovered in the literature but

1811
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:13,630
that's a very good suggestion yeah thank

1812
01:29:07,690 --> 01:29:15,700
you hi Colin Perkins we'll see if this

1813
01:29:13,630 --> 01:29:18,580
microphone falls down before I finish

1814
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:21,970
talking see ya I think this work is

1815
01:29:18,580 --> 01:29:23,950
useful I think this research group is as

1816
01:29:21,970 --> 01:29:27,820
good a place as any to do the work and I

1817
01:29:23,950 --> 01:29:30,790
don't have any objections to that in

1818
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:34,120
terms of the the living document type

1819
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:37,390
thing if you've only ever published

1820
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:38,769
RFC's via the IETF side I think you'll

1821
01:29:37,390 --> 01:29:46,150
find the process is perhaps lighter

1822
01:29:38,770 --> 01:29:48,940
weight in the IRT F yeah I mean XML

1823
01:29:46,150 --> 01:29:52,990
fee-free but you know means you can add

1824
01:29:48,940 --> 01:29:55,030
pretty pictures no but I mean seriously

1825
01:29:52,990 --> 01:29:56,440
I think you're keeping this sort of

1826
01:29:55,030 --> 01:29:58,809
finger life as an internet draft and

1827
01:29:56,440 --> 01:30:00,940
occasionally pushing out snapshots as an

1828
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:03,030
RFC and makes a lot of sense you that

1829
01:30:00,940 --> 01:30:06,250
this is the state of the world as of

1830
01:30:03,030 --> 01:30:07,900
2020 or whatever it is and then just

1831
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,160
keep keep it ticking over and then in a

1832
01:30:07,900 --> 01:30:11,860
couple years time well we'll publish

1833
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:13,570
another one okay yeah that seems you

1834
01:30:11,860 --> 01:30:21,580
deal with me yeah we got plenty of RFC

1835
01:30:13,570 --> 01:30:23,290
numbers right yeah I'd might as well is

1836
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:25,120
it even opposed to us asking for

1837
01:30:23,290 --> 01:30:29,290
adoption right now please step up to the

1838
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:32,200
mic right now okay so all those in favor

1839
01:30:29,290 --> 01:30:39,550
of adoption of this document by Paigey

1840
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:44,740
please hum now all those not in favor of

1841
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:47,320
adoption please have now perfect same

1842
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:49,150
we'll take you to the list also and yeah

1843
01:30:47,320 --> 01:30:55,410
take it from there thanks Chris yeah

1844
01:30:49,150 --> 01:30:55,410
Thank You Bernie

1845
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:31,759
[Music]

1846
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:44,139
afternoon my name is Bernie niacin I am

1847
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:47,080
having a short presentation to frame the

1848
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:49,560
discussion of the next document is

1849
01:31:47,080 --> 01:31:53,380
presented by Eric Ries

1850
01:31:49,560 --> 01:31:55,840
so there is an activity going on called

1851
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:59,950
meetup missing elements for

1852
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:02,440
decentralized usable privacy and just

1853
01:31:59,950 --> 01:32:04,750
following background so we are working

1854
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:10,169
on solutions that are decentralized

1855
01:32:04,750 --> 01:32:12,850
end-to-end peer-to-peer for reasons of

1856
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:15,130
mitigating the adverse effects of

1857
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:16,600
process monitoring because it's an

1858
01:32:15,130 --> 01:32:20,230
attack to privacy and has been

1859
01:32:16,600 --> 01:32:22,060
documented in RC and centralized

1860
01:32:20,230 --> 01:32:23,530
elements are usually more prone to

1861
01:32:22,060 --> 01:32:25,330
attacks because if you have two

1862
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:28,030
centralized delavane you have everything

1863
01:32:25,330 --> 01:32:30,790
and if it's centralized the effect is

1864
01:32:28,030 --> 01:32:32,500
limited usable because message

1865
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:36,280
encryption has law for most Internet

1866
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:43,480
users I mean who of you has already

1867
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:46,240
tried to set up PGP not so many who of

1868
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:52,219
you managed to do that in less than one

1869
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:57,170
hour the first time okay

1870
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:59,420
a bit less anyway but whoever would

1871
01:32:57,170 --> 01:33:00,980
consider that people who are not

1872
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:02,990
attending the idea throwing something

1873
01:33:00,980 --> 01:33:06,799
completely different are able to set out

1874
01:33:02,990 --> 01:33:08,330
the PGP kind okay zero and that's

1875
01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:10,910
actually where it comes from we need

1876
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:13,940
folks fixed is usability challenged by

1877
01:33:10,910 --> 01:33:15,590
automation because people are simply not

1878
01:33:13,940 --> 01:33:17,750
able to do it on their own if they are

1879
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:20,200
not getting enough help and that's where

1880
01:33:17,750 --> 01:33:25,400
it's coming from is usable and privacy

1881
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:27,889
we consider privacy is a human right so

1882
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,629
this medical tech TV team show I can't

1883
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:32,000
go into all details but basically it's

1884
01:33:29,630 --> 01:33:34,340
about enhancements to application

1885
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:36,860
protocols for decentralized usable

1886
01:33:34,340 --> 01:33:40,280
privacy it's based on opportunistic

1887
01:33:36,860 --> 01:33:43,190
security and the whole thing emerged

1888
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:47,330
from the initiative of pepper pretty

1889
01:33:43,190 --> 01:33:49,280
easy privacy it's a foundation that

1890
01:33:47,330 --> 01:33:51,800
piece doing implementations in this area

1891
01:33:49,280 --> 01:33:53,599
but it's not limited to that it's also

1892
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:55,910
like other people working in the field

1893
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:58,340
for example autocorrect are invited to

1894
01:33:55,910 --> 01:34:01,010
participate directly actively contribute

1895
01:33:58,340 --> 01:34:02,750
to meet up and the goal is to define the

1896
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:04,940
missing pieces like key management

1897
01:34:02,750 --> 01:34:07,730
private key synchronizations message

1898
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:12,440
formats trust well change etc I can't go

1899
01:34:07,730 --> 01:34:14,629
into details of this we meet in

1900
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:18,200
so-called non working group sessions

1901
01:34:14,630 --> 01:34:19,960
during IDF meetings with the exception

1902
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:22,250
of this one

1903
01:34:19,960 --> 01:34:24,860
you're not having these kind of sessions

1904
01:34:22,250 --> 01:34:27,140
otherwise he had it last free IDF

1905
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:30,440
meetings I think we have a mailing list

1906
01:34:27,140 --> 01:34:32,390
set up made up at ITF talk and you can

1907
01:34:30,440 --> 01:34:35,719
subscribe there if you're interested in

1908
01:34:32,390 --> 01:34:37,400
the field and at some point in time we

1909
01:34:35,720 --> 01:34:39,500
are aiming for both to be an ideal

1910
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:43,639
working group and work on this a bit

1911
01:34:39,500 --> 01:34:45,710
more in the proto sense so what's there

1912
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:47,900
so far all these boxes for representing

1913
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:50,210
internet craft

1914
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:51,950
I don't know how much time we have that

1915
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:55,310
I can go into details of all the boxes

1916
01:34:51,950 --> 01:34:57,860
or should I just summarize okay yeah

1917
01:34:55,310 --> 01:34:59,690
right okay so basically then I talk

1918
01:34:57,860 --> 01:35:01,940
about the four corners like the pink

1919
01:34:59,690 --> 01:35:04,280
corner is more or less what has to do

1920
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:06,049
with handshake and Trust then there is

1921
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,030
the application corner which

1922
01:35:06,050 --> 01:35:10,429
the brown corner for example use it in

1923
01:35:08,030 --> 01:35:11,929
email but also instant messaging and we

1924
01:35:10,429 --> 01:35:13,940
are even using it for banking

1925
01:35:11,929 --> 01:35:16,460
transaction for example Swift Network is

1926
01:35:13,940 --> 01:35:18,888
using the same technology then we have

1927
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:22,510
the private key synchronization area

1928
01:35:18,889 --> 01:35:25,099
like that you have different devices and

1929
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:27,050
generate the key with one the ability to

1930
01:35:25,099 --> 01:35:28,429
encrypt your email and read the email on

1931
01:35:27,050 --> 01:35:30,710
the other devices usually don't work

1932
01:35:28,429 --> 01:35:31,880
unless we share the keys and we have a

1933
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:34,760
solution for that it's already

1934
01:35:31,880 --> 01:35:36,829
implemented and the green area is like

1935
01:35:34,760 --> 01:35:39,800
the core area with requirements the cost

1936
01:35:36,829 --> 01:35:40,790
of end what you hear as next is basis

1937
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:46,099
for that green area

1938
01:35:40,790 --> 01:35:47,840
it's the fret analyzes that out of the

1939
01:35:46,099 --> 01:35:50,420
fret analyzes that is discussed in this

1940
01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,849
next presentation requirements are

1941
01:35:50,420 --> 01:35:55,190
coming or part of requirements are

1942
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:59,059
coming so now we know where this next

1943
01:35:55,190 --> 01:36:02,019
presentation is fit to and I would end

1944
01:35:59,059 --> 01:36:02,020
or to in raqqa stem

1945
01:36:28,610 --> 01:36:41,009
okay I might need the speaker maybe not

1946
01:36:34,550 --> 01:36:45,080
like that so hello everyone thank you

1947
01:36:41,010 --> 01:36:49,730
for Pierre G and ITF for inviting me and

1948
01:36:45,080 --> 01:36:52,740
for this long-standing contribution I

1949
01:36:49,730 --> 01:36:56,190
want to break this presentation actually

1950
01:36:52,740 --> 01:36:59,460
it's a call for stimulate discussions

1951
01:36:56,190 --> 01:37:01,710
and to call for contributions under the

1952
01:36:59,460 --> 01:37:04,910
keywords a break down the title of this

1953
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:08,010
presentation on this four points a

1954
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:10,650
systematic analysis of security and

1955
01:37:08,010 --> 01:37:12,660
privacy threats for private messaging

1956
01:37:10,650 --> 01:37:14,610
and what I'm talking about private

1957
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:18,420
messaging I'm talking about emailing and

1958
01:37:14,610 --> 01:37:20,070
instant messaging okay are miracles many

1959
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:22,380
ways I'm a postdoc to give ambassador of

1960
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:27,920
Luxembourg and this is a joint work with

1961
01:37:22,380 --> 01:37:35,940
pet with Bernie Hansen and Nanak Carol

1962
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:38,640
character so very quickly is still a

1963
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:41,070
relevant problem private messaging in

1964
01:37:38,640 --> 01:37:43,620
mail and it's a message II so does

1965
01:37:41,070 --> 01:37:47,150
quickly in the numbers I'm not gonna

1966
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:50,309
sting - Matt's 3.7 billion users email

1967
01:37:47,150 --> 01:37:52,799
with a future predictions even more we

1968
01:37:50,310 --> 01:37:55,710
see a little bit dropping on the private

1969
01:37:52,800 --> 01:38:00,120
use but still like 75 billion users

1970
01:37:55,710 --> 01:38:03,260
approximately females here just to say

1971
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:06,630
on these numbers and the statistics that

1972
01:38:03,260 --> 01:38:08,610
these prominent these two are messaging

1973
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:12,630
applications actually are belong to a

1974
01:38:08,610 --> 01:38:14,670
single application provider and we see

1975
01:38:12,630 --> 01:38:17,640
this distribution roughly I would say

1976
01:38:14,670 --> 01:38:21,930
the percent of the world is under a

1977
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:24,000
single service provider so do have a

1978
01:38:21,930 --> 01:38:27,480
systematic way of analyzing the threats

1979
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:31,340
and the requirements what is usually

1980
01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:36,209
been done in the RFC and the first f70 P

1981
01:38:31,340 --> 01:38:39,540
821 back in 1982

1982
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:42,410
we build it I did with a very nice

1983
01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:46,950
system SMTP but initially without

1984
01:38:42,410 --> 01:38:50,700
security into consideration so we found

1985
01:38:46,950 --> 01:38:53,790
out a bunch of threads for instance two

1986
01:38:50,700 --> 01:38:56,220
least one monthly middle attacks then we

1987
01:38:53,790 --> 01:38:58,560
started designing systems that you have

1988
01:38:56,220 --> 01:39:01,560
that ahead like client-server decryption

1989
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:05,190
like start TLS and you had all these

1990
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:08,760
nice analytics of Gmail showing is to

1991
01:39:05,190 --> 01:39:11,250
our browser like all your flight is at

1992
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:13,580
that time you should consider going

1993
01:39:11,250 --> 01:39:16,830
because there is a traffic or not

1994
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:18,420
surprisingly in 2013 we got the spring

1995
01:39:16,830 --> 01:39:20,190
project which is not the revelation that

1996
01:39:18,420 --> 01:39:22,440
they showed us oh by the way this

1997
01:39:20,190 --> 01:39:26,240
information is not going only to you but

1998
01:39:22,440 --> 01:39:30,719
is going to some Secret Service

1999
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:33,660
analytics systems so we shouldn't

2000
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:35,700
consider trusted the servers of email

2001
01:39:33,660 --> 01:39:38,820
servers and be some basic servers that

2002
01:39:35,700 --> 01:39:41,580
they only keep the information only to

2003
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:44,099
ourselves so we start building

2004
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:46,850
end-to-end encryption as mine we thought

2005
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:49,710
that centralized systems they might even

2006
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:51,740
not be that robust and privacy security

2007
01:39:49,710 --> 01:39:55,800
privacy preserving because they might

2008
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:58,530
send different public keys we have open

2009
01:39:55,800 --> 01:40:04,050
PGP and this summer we had this proofing

2010
01:39:58,530 --> 01:40:05,700
of certificate poisoning which I'm not

2011
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:07,950
going to go into technical details but

2012
01:40:05,700 --> 01:40:10,139
essentially they break up open GP

2013
01:40:07,950 --> 01:40:13,910
because they made it very buggy and

2014
01:40:10,140 --> 01:40:17,190
large start shining sorry signing

2015
01:40:13,910 --> 01:40:20,280
certificates they make very large and

2016
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:21,629
buggy certificate certificate and then

2017
01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:27,900
when you download it sexually was

2018
01:40:21,630 --> 01:40:30,000
breaking of new GP ok we found out ways

2019
01:40:27,900 --> 01:40:34,049
to have internal encryption with great

2020
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:36,450
security protocols but then now what

2021
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:40,830
there is a harder problem with metadata

2022
01:40:36,450 --> 01:40:43,410
and this great person the general for

2023
01:40:40,830 --> 01:40:45,900
NSA director said that well by the way

2024
01:40:43,410 --> 01:40:47,340
we might don't know to what you are

2025
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:50,000
saying but we kill people based on

2026
01:40:47,340 --> 01:40:52,950
metadata and even there are like

2027
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,480
academic work very good academic work or

2028
01:40:52,950 --> 01:41:02,300
like projects successful but still there

2029
01:40:57,480 --> 01:41:04,799
is no application so where are we now

2030
01:41:02,300 --> 01:41:07,620
there is a lot of academic work but

2031
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:11,090
usually the approach is like we think

2032
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:13,590
that these threats are really relevant

2033
01:41:11,090 --> 01:41:16,350
but what we if we do it the other way

2034
01:41:13,590 --> 01:41:18,900
around we start mapping the list of

2035
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:22,500
threats and we start like instead of

2036
01:41:18,900 --> 01:41:27,589
running after the attacks we start

2037
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:31,620
designing systems by very beginning so

2038
01:41:27,590 --> 01:41:34,440
EF first started to on this direction

2039
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:38,480
try to evaluate and try to make a list

2040
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:41,160
of design security features but this

2041
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:44,490
specific is a website but this is

2042
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:48,990
limited categories is obsolete right now

2043
01:41:44,490 --> 01:41:52,200
and it evaluates only existing apps so

2044
01:41:48,990 --> 01:41:55,830
the aim of this internet document is

2045
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:58,889
about to assess to have a security and

2046
01:41:55,830 --> 01:42:02,070
privacy threat modeling requirements are

2047
01:41:58,890 --> 01:42:05,270
a holistic systematic approach and for

2048
01:42:02,070 --> 01:42:07,830
assessing existing systems or this when

2049
01:42:05,270 --> 01:42:12,570
designing a new system systems you can

2050
01:42:07,830 --> 01:42:14,720
use it for as a guideline and this takes

2051
01:42:12,570 --> 01:42:17,160
into consideration technical threats

2052
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:23,000
security and privacy but also the user

2053
01:42:17,160 --> 01:42:25,760
threads there is keep on discussion on

2054
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,530
intelligent service about backdoors and

2055
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:34,680
this is not a technical vulnerability

2056
01:42:28,530 --> 01:42:36,389
this is an issue of opening a backdoor

2057
01:42:34,680 --> 01:42:42,830
in their system and this is a user

2058
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:46,110
threat so we think that as a basis for

2059
01:42:42,830 --> 01:42:51,420
private messaging maybe it's a good fit

2060
01:42:46,110 --> 01:42:54,170
for later and for ITF and ERG PR to

2061
01:42:51,420 --> 01:42:59,250
consider adopting is as a working item

2062
01:42:54,170 --> 01:43:01,770
okay what is in the internet draft what

2063
01:42:59,250 --> 01:43:03,810
we have what is our contribution until

2064
01:43:01,770 --> 01:43:05,790
now so as we will

2065
01:43:03,810 --> 01:43:08,310
we'll show you a little bit later on we

2066
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:12,150
have a system model we define the system

2067
01:43:08,310 --> 01:43:14,280
model meaning what exactly the entities

2068
01:43:12,150 --> 01:43:17,599
and the functionalities which are the

2069
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:20,429
adversaries what the adversaries can do

2070
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:22,710
the class of threads the class of

2071
01:43:20,430 --> 01:43:27,030
requirements and later on in a later

2072
01:43:22,710 --> 01:43:30,390
phase in this document or in a later on

2073
01:43:27,030 --> 01:43:33,090
we will have the risk approach because

2074
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:34,950
now we consider the threads uniformly

2075
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:38,990
but maybe you want to evaluate the

2076
01:43:34,950 --> 01:43:40,950
threads and then which are the crypto

2077
01:43:38,990 --> 01:43:49,889
protocols we have all the crypto

2078
01:43:40,950 --> 01:43:53,730
primitives for instance OTR so if I am

2079
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:56,490
to say the system model in a halt it

2080
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:59,219
could be the Italian Bob wants to

2081
01:43:56,490 --> 01:44:02,760
communicates and want to exchange

2082
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:05,100
messages or it wants to exchange emails

2083
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:09,690
or instant messaging using instant

2084
01:44:05,100 --> 01:44:12,660
messaging systems and here we have the

2085
01:44:09,690 --> 01:44:14,910
networking nodes and we have splitted

2086
01:44:12,660 --> 01:44:19,349
the trust establishment which is

2087
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:21,750
essentially to have identity key and

2088
01:44:19,350 --> 01:44:23,730
contact management and third parties and

2089
01:44:21,750 --> 01:44:27,870
what we can do is we can start playing

2090
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:30,120
with the threads with adversarial models

2091
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:31,680
and when we say adversary model we are

2092
01:44:30,120 --> 01:44:35,340
talking about whether advisor is a

2093
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:37,560
passive we say owners but curious it

2094
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:39,300
tries to not break the system but it

2095
01:44:37,560 --> 01:44:42,390
tries to extract as much information as

2096
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:45,870
possible it can be active adversary and

2097
01:44:42,390 --> 01:44:48,630
can be internal or external and here is

2098
01:44:45,870 --> 01:44:52,010
the list that we start have started

2099
01:44:48,630 --> 01:44:55,530
compiling and this first list the first

2100
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:59,190
two columns is about security threats

2101
01:44:55,530 --> 01:45:01,320
and and security requirements and this

2102
01:44:59,190 --> 01:45:04,759
is extracting this is a methodologies

2103
01:45:01,320 --> 01:45:07,889
being used by Microsoft with a straight

2104
01:45:04,760 --> 01:45:10,230
framework so essentially we try to find

2105
01:45:07,890 --> 01:45:12,900
out all the possible threats in these

2106
01:45:10,230 --> 01:45:16,889
classes of attacks classes of threat and

2107
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:17,710
the corresponding requirements so the

2108
01:45:16,890 --> 01:45:19,810
same

2109
01:45:17,710 --> 01:45:22,990
seeing as a methodology we did it with

2110
01:45:19,810 --> 01:45:25,630
privacy but I ever see uses we used an

2111
01:45:22,990 --> 01:45:29,830
academic were called Linton which we

2112
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:35,920
adopted it for our needs and I want to

2113
01:45:29,830 --> 01:45:37,890
highlight three specific points so for

2114
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:40,750
confidentiality information disclosure

2115
01:45:37,890 --> 01:45:47,370
there is this is a threat to security

2116
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:52,230
and privacy however for non-repudiation

2117
01:45:47,370 --> 01:45:57,490
it might be a requirement as a security

2118
01:45:52,230 --> 01:45:59,860
but an issue to privacy in the for a

2119
01:45:57,490 --> 01:46:01,590
privacy can be an issue and it's

2120
01:45:59,860 --> 01:46:07,120
actually how are the arts been built

2121
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:09,400
that has plausible deniability so having

2122
01:46:07,120 --> 01:46:12,030
a map of threats and requirements we can

2123
01:46:09,400 --> 01:46:17,589
very beginning at the very early States

2124
01:46:12,030 --> 01:46:21,130
point what we need to do another thing

2125
01:46:17,590 --> 01:46:24,010
is the privacy interdependence think

2126
01:46:21,130 --> 01:46:28,570
about the case where you're installing

2127
01:46:24,010 --> 01:46:32,650
an what's up or a signal and all your

2128
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:36,099
contacts go into the clouds and that is

2129
01:46:32,650 --> 01:46:39,370
a matching who has this application so

2130
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:43,480
essentially what you do you send your

2131
01:46:39,370 --> 01:46:46,000
whole social network to the cloud

2132
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,419
provider of what's up to do the matching

2133
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:51,370
and notify your home has the same

2134
01:46:48,420 --> 01:46:53,740
contact who has the same person stole

2135
01:46:51,370 --> 01:46:55,180
the same application so in signal there

2136
01:46:53,740 --> 01:46:57,820
was a lot of discussion how you can do

2137
01:46:55,180 --> 01:47:00,130
it privacy preserving word so we might

2138
01:46:57,820 --> 01:47:02,790
have had recall the previous slide it's

2139
01:47:00,130 --> 01:47:05,350
not only metadata about who

2140
01:47:02,790 --> 01:47:09,040
communicating but also like with whom we

2141
01:47:05,350 --> 01:47:13,690
have exchanged information we have our

2142
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:16,420
contacts shared so just a case study

2143
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:19,089
just to show you what we can do with

2144
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:21,910
that what we can do with this internet

2145
01:47:19,090 --> 01:47:25,630
document and what we have done if we

2146
01:47:21,910 --> 01:47:28,210
start discussing about okay if you start

2147
01:47:25,630 --> 01:47:31,210
placing at the other siren model that

2148
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:35,350
could be for instance the mail servers

2149
01:47:31,210 --> 01:47:37,420
we can have protocols as start TLS which

2150
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:41,410
can preserve confidentiality NDT and

2151
01:47:37,420 --> 01:47:43,150
data fornication but we consider what

2152
01:47:41,410 --> 01:47:46,750
about if we start consider in mail

2153
01:47:43,150 --> 01:47:48,580
service as passive adversaries or as

2154
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:51,610
materials that will constantly try to

2155
01:47:48,580 --> 01:47:54,880
read our information to read our email

2156
01:47:51,610 --> 01:47:57,490
and instant messages then we start

2157
01:47:54,880 --> 01:48:00,460
playing with for instance s/mime we

2158
01:47:57,490 --> 01:48:03,070
thought that okay what about I don't

2159
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:08,050
know okay here's great

2160
01:48:03,070 --> 01:48:12,549
so what about if public keys that are my

2161
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:14,320
shirt are spoofed for instance I'm using

2162
01:48:12,550 --> 01:48:18,060
a public key that's supposed to be for

2163
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:18,059
my friend Bob but this actually is not

2164
01:48:18,570 --> 01:48:23,980
we have this issue of certificate

2165
01:48:21,220 --> 01:48:27,130
flooding as I said which in specific a

2166
01:48:23,980 --> 01:48:29,860
third party we can frame it after party

2167
01:48:27,130 --> 01:48:32,490
and external adversary is aiming to

2168
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:41,889
break to do a denial of service attack

2169
01:48:32,490 --> 01:48:47,139
and in this particular case Bob is

2170
01:48:41,890 --> 01:48:49,720
considered as adversary an OTR has been

2171
01:48:47,140 --> 01:48:52,840
designed considering this this very much

2172
01:48:49,720 --> 01:48:55,210
this very principles of confidentiality

2173
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:59,160
entity and data education forward

2174
01:48:55,210 --> 01:49:02,890
secrecy and deniability so we can start

2175
01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:06,190
called peeking threats that we need to

2176
01:49:02,890 --> 01:49:09,430
design a system for and we have specific

2177
01:49:06,190 --> 01:49:13,030
countermeasures and having the whole map

2178
01:49:09,430 --> 01:49:15,940
of adversarial models we can say exactly

2179
01:49:13,030 --> 01:49:16,809
what we need to do instead of going the

2180
01:49:15,940 --> 01:49:20,230
other way around

2181
01:49:16,810 --> 01:49:22,480
saying I believe which can be as an

2182
01:49:20,230 --> 01:49:26,740
expert you can have a very good overview

2183
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:30,490
of what is needed but we think that as a

2184
01:49:26,740 --> 01:49:33,429
systematic systematically it's even more

2185
01:49:30,490 --> 01:49:37,530
important to do it as we can see the

2186
01:49:33,430 --> 01:49:41,050
whole map of threats future directions

2187
01:49:37,530 --> 01:49:44,559
well there's a lot of work that needs to

2188
01:49:41,050 --> 01:49:45,080
be done so usability issues on top of

2189
01:49:44,560 --> 01:49:47,150
EDP

2190
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,890
and bgp has been discussed in the

2191
01:49:47,150 --> 01:49:56,629
previously and there are three Kaka

2192
01:49:48,890 --> 01:49:59,570
demic papers from 99 16 and 0 6 so we

2193
01:49:56,630 --> 01:50:02,660
have a key management issues and still

2194
01:49:59,570 --> 01:50:04,820
the problem remains about how we can use

2195
01:50:02,660 --> 01:50:07,309
it how we can make it more usable so

2196
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:08,900
that can be another issue and the

2197
01:50:07,310 --> 01:50:10,790
requirement that we need to design our

2198
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:14,030
system but we need to consider our

2199
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:15,590
system design so that not only designed

2200
01:50:14,030 --> 01:50:19,190
in an engineering way but also like to

2201
01:50:15,590 --> 01:50:22,220
make it practical so there is a lot of

2202
01:50:19,190 --> 01:50:25,580
push from intelligent services with

2203
01:50:22,220 --> 01:50:27,620
different arguments about back during

2204
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:31,880
and this is like very recent news about

2205
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:36,260
us and UK and a stress in Australia to

2206
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:37,850
just start back during and we think

2207
01:50:36,260 --> 01:50:39,230
Australia already passed a low but I

2208
01:50:37,850 --> 01:50:44,990
think that it's not active they say

2209
01:50:39,230 --> 01:50:49,280
they'd have inactivated and us there is

2210
01:50:44,990 --> 01:50:52,429
a human rights and law of the private

2211
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:54,679
privacy of correspondents of females

2212
01:50:52,430 --> 01:50:59,450
you cannot offer males we cannot open

2213
01:50:54,680 --> 01:51:01,880
the mail in a non war times the same

2214
01:50:59,450 --> 01:51:04,070
should apply as a reasoning the same

2215
01:51:01,880 --> 01:51:10,370
should apply in the deed in the digital

2216
01:51:04,070 --> 01:51:15,670
world and finally there is a lot of

2217
01:51:10,370 --> 01:51:18,260
discussion about post quantum crypto and

2218
01:51:15,670 --> 01:51:20,900
there is a call by professors and

2219
01:51:18,260 --> 01:51:22,610
academics and experts in the field that

2220
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:27,080
we need to start considering moving

2221
01:51:22,610 --> 01:51:30,290
towards that because the time that will

2222
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:32,240
pass so companies to adapt for new plot

2223
01:51:30,290 --> 01:51:34,580
to design new protocols it takes time

2224
01:51:32,240 --> 01:51:36,860
information that we are storing in our

2225
01:51:34,580 --> 01:51:39,260
system needs to keep it for 10 to 50

2226
01:51:36,860 --> 01:51:41,210
years so we already need to start

2227
01:51:39,260 --> 01:51:44,750
designing new systems that would

2228
01:51:41,210 --> 01:51:48,050
consider post quantum security instead

2229
01:51:44,750 --> 01:51:51,770
of running afterwards we need to be

2230
01:51:48,050 --> 01:51:52,760
proactive so that's all for my site if

2231
01:51:51,770 --> 01:51:57,220
you have any questions

2232
01:51:52,760 --> 01:51:57,220
it's very welcome thank you

2233
01:52:01,039 --> 01:52:08,579
then Schwartz thank you for forgiving

2234
01:52:06,329 --> 01:52:13,710
the deep thought to the important topic

2235
01:52:08,579 --> 01:52:16,768
I I definitely support this work in this

2236
01:52:13,710 --> 01:52:18,960
area and and this draft seems very well

2237
01:52:16,769 --> 01:52:20,579
written but I had a few comments about

2238
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:24,690
this I think that this is a fairly

2239
01:52:20,579 --> 01:52:28,170
opinionated draft it doesn't seem like a

2240
01:52:24,690 --> 01:52:31,558
neutral summary of the field it seems

2241
01:52:28,170 --> 01:52:33,900
more like a coherent framework that

2242
01:52:31,559 --> 01:52:34,380
you're presenting I was just giving it a

2243
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:38,058
name

2244
01:52:34,380 --> 01:52:41,849
essentially presenting it as a new named

2245
01:52:38,059 --> 01:52:43,469
framework I would also suggest thinking

2246
01:52:41,849 --> 01:52:46,010
about it as a framework instead of

2247
01:52:43,469 --> 01:52:48,809
describing it as an analysis or

2248
01:52:46,010 --> 01:52:51,449
especially using the word requirements

2249
01:52:48,809 --> 01:52:53,190
which occurs a few times in the draft

2250
01:52:51,449 --> 01:52:55,199
certainly if the IETF requirements

2251
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:57,150
refers pretty specifically to setting

2252
01:52:55,199 --> 01:52:58,860
yourself up to do specific protocol

2253
01:52:57,150 --> 01:53:01,170
based work at it doesn't seem like

2254
01:52:58,860 --> 01:53:03,570
that's the real purpose here

2255
01:53:01,170 --> 01:53:04,979
I would clarify the scope some some of

2256
01:53:03,570 --> 01:53:07,139
the research I've seen here suggests

2257
01:53:04,979 --> 01:53:09,239
that at least for ordinary users if you

2258
01:53:07,139 --> 01:53:11,190
ask them what kinds of security threats

2259
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:13,138
they're worried about in in private

2260
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:14,789
messaging context the things that you

2261
01:53:13,139 --> 01:53:16,619
listed here are not at the top of their

2262
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:18,690
list the things you listed the things

2263
01:53:16,619 --> 01:53:20,820
that they tend to list our insider

2264
01:53:18,690 --> 01:53:22,949
threats things like people peering over

2265
01:53:20,820 --> 01:53:25,289
their shoulders or their boss checking

2266
01:53:22,949 --> 01:53:27,928
their phone while they have it in a in a

2267
01:53:25,289 --> 01:53:29,999
locker those are really important

2268
01:53:27,929 --> 01:53:32,190
security threats and it's fine to say to

2269
01:53:29,999 --> 01:53:35,280
make them out of scope but we should

2270
01:53:32,190 --> 01:53:36,509
clarify scope and I would suggest

2271
01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:39,929
thinking about this in terms of

2272
01:53:36,510 --> 01:53:42,780
communication not just messaging both

2273
01:53:39,929 --> 01:53:46,679
because I think the the technology

2274
01:53:42,780 --> 01:53:48,960
itself doesn't matter and because video

2275
01:53:46,679 --> 01:53:50,099
because that what we're really thinking

2276
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,219
about here is communication between

2277
01:53:50,099 --> 01:53:55,889
people whatever form that takes in

2278
01:53:53,219 --> 01:53:57,510
particular video chat and related stuff

2279
01:53:55,889 --> 01:53:58,979
I think it has important privacy

2280
01:53:57,510 --> 01:54:01,349
concerns that we should be thinking

2281
01:53:58,979 --> 01:54:03,650
about thank you very much I would

2282
01:54:01,349 --> 01:54:08,610
suggest to take you to a flying and go

2283
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:10,259
point by point later on you tell me

2284
01:54:08,610 --> 01:54:15,449
exactly and

2285
01:54:10,260 --> 01:54:17,190
very much up in exchange I just want to

2286
01:54:15,449 --> 01:54:18,750
be sure that I understand what's the

2287
01:54:17,190 --> 01:54:21,960
objective of the work you're opposing

2288
01:54:18,750 --> 01:54:24,420
because I mean are you trying to write a

2289
01:54:21,960 --> 01:54:26,070
set of requirements to then design yet

2290
01:54:24,420 --> 01:54:27,750
another instant messaging protocol that

2291
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:32,429
this time will be private and secure and

2292
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:35,130
so because I think that it was already

2293
01:54:32,429 --> 01:54:36,929
pointed out first of all in the scenario

2294
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:38,400
an email and instant messaging is pretty

2295
01:54:36,929 --> 01:54:40,289
different because an instant messaging

2296
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:41,489
you only have walled gardens and when

2297
01:54:40,289 --> 01:54:43,320
you have walled gardens there's no way

2298
01:54:41,489 --> 01:54:45,209
you can exclude it whoever lost the

2299
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:47,039
server of the service you're using so

2300
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:49,050
that's already I mean a basic problem

2301
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:51,869
from any care for any kind of privacy

2302
01:54:49,050 --> 01:54:53,039
security you want to to grant with email

2303
01:54:51,869 --> 01:54:54,808
it's different because you could choose

2304
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:57,840
your server but still you you have lot

2305
01:54:54,809 --> 01:55:02,880
lots of other things to address but also

2306
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:04,710
I mean having spent some time time to me

2307
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,510
in the real world convinced some big

2308
01:55:04,710 --> 01:55:08,309
email operators to just adopt existing

2309
01:55:06,510 --> 01:55:10,320
technologies like Dane and DNS SEC for

2310
01:55:08,309 --> 01:55:12,869
example to make it efficient more secure

2311
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:16,949
I agree that that the problem is this

2312
01:55:12,869 --> 01:55:18,780
problem is not very high in request of

2313
01:55:16,949 --> 01:55:21,150
their users or of the people that runs

2314
01:55:18,780 --> 01:55:22,820
the service so some if you really want

2315
01:55:21,150 --> 01:55:24,570
to advance the discussion maybe there's

2316
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:27,058
non-technical things that we should

2317
01:55:24,570 --> 01:55:28,710
discuss if you want to put this only at

2318
01:55:27,059 --> 01:55:30,659
the technical level then I would like to

2319
01:55:28,710 --> 01:55:34,789
understand what the objectives are what

2320
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:38,449
what you want to achieve in practice so

2321
01:55:34,789 --> 01:55:44,099
the objective of this internet document

2322
01:55:38,449 --> 01:55:45,839
is to do it in a way of mapping the

2323
01:55:44,099 --> 01:55:49,260
threads in the technical aspect from a

2324
01:55:45,840 --> 01:55:51,570
very beginning instead of pointing later

2325
01:55:49,260 --> 01:55:54,269
on we have this thread let's try to

2326
01:55:51,570 --> 01:55:57,210
patch it let's try to figure figure how

2327
01:55:54,269 --> 01:55:59,820
we're gonna design a system so this is

2328
01:55:57,210 --> 01:56:01,739
like for evaluating existing systems and

2329
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:04,829
protocols and all you want to design a

2330
01:56:01,739 --> 01:56:07,199
new and I've you are a security engineer

2331
01:56:04,829 --> 01:56:09,840
or a privacy engineer that you will be

2332
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:11,699
able to see which are the threats what

2333
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:15,389
you need to do what what are the

2334
01:56:11,699 --> 01:56:18,570
existing systems crypto primitives

2335
01:56:15,389 --> 01:56:21,719
protocols one point that you said I

2336
01:56:18,570 --> 01:56:25,259
don't know if I've covered your with my

2337
01:56:21,719 --> 01:56:27,180
answer we can also take it offline

2338
01:56:25,260 --> 01:56:30,420
one thing that you said is system

2339
01:56:27,180 --> 01:56:36,480
messaging and emailing is different yes

2340
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:42,120
but one is low latency the other is high

2341
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:46,530
latency well nowadays both systems and

2342
01:56:42,120 --> 01:56:50,940
in the in the messaging aspect they both

2343
01:56:46,530 --> 01:56:53,160
have common points with both if we just

2344
01:56:50,940 --> 01:56:55,950
remove the XMPP if we just remove the

2345
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:59,790
SMTP like the transport how we transport

2346
01:56:55,950 --> 01:57:03,360
on the format if we see it like us what

2347
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:05,970
we need to safeguard so we send text who

2348
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:12,389
set attachments and we have our

2349
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:13,530
archiving or searching we have I agree

2350
01:57:12,390 --> 01:57:15,930
that technically I mean we are working

2351
01:57:13,530 --> 01:57:18,300
on chat or IMAP so I mean that's not

2352
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:20,760
what I was pointing out is that they are

2353
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:22,290
very different in that architecture of

2354
01:57:20,760 --> 01:57:24,540
the market and the service that people

2355
01:57:22,290 --> 01:57:29,180
actually use so it's a non-technical

2356
01:57:24,540 --> 01:57:29,180
difference okay okay thank you very much

2357
01:57:29,210 --> 01:57:34,260
Paris koala I mean this is an

2358
01:57:31,350 --> 01:57:35,610
interesting space I guess I'm a little

2359
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:40,170
less sanguine about this document

2360
01:57:35,610 --> 01:57:42,120
particular document that Ben is the as

2361
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:45,000
Victoria was saying like trying to like

2362
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:46,880
span email and instant messaging in

2363
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:49,740
video straight me just really difficult

2364
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,060
you know like the MLS work here house

2365
01:57:49,740 --> 01:57:52,349
like a fairly well-defined threat model

2366
01:57:51,060 --> 01:57:54,540
in the organizer document that rise like

2367
01:57:52,350 --> 01:57:55,740
map output the threat model is but a lot

2368
01:57:54,540 --> 01:58:02,160
of it's actually fairly specific like

2369
01:57:55,740 --> 01:58:03,300
the MLS setting and so and and the if we

2370
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,470
try to like expand that to email I think

2371
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:06,750
it wouldn't work very well and I think

2372
01:58:04,470 --> 01:58:08,400
actually part of like like as an example

2373
01:58:06,750 --> 01:58:10,830
of that on the slides you have about

2374
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:12,240
like how awful PGP is interface is like

2375
01:58:10,830 --> 01:58:13,290
basically don't apply any instant

2376
01:58:12,240 --> 01:58:16,590
messaging systems it actually have

2377
01:58:13,290 --> 01:58:18,300
extremely streamlined um you know you

2378
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:19,470
know key discovery and set up if I call

2379
01:58:18,300 --> 01:58:20,460
just other problems but they don't but

2380
01:58:19,470 --> 01:58:21,600
they don't have these problems about

2381
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:24,900
like key discovery they're complicated

2382
01:58:21,600 --> 01:58:26,940
um so I think trying to like you know

2383
01:58:24,900 --> 01:58:28,620
have some document that like is a master

2384
01:58:26,940 --> 01:58:30,089
document like for all message like model

2385
01:58:28,620 --> 01:58:31,620
for all messaging like ends up with you

2386
01:58:30,090 --> 01:58:34,230
like rating like a quarter feet export

2387
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:36,090
and like you know and describing dole of

2388
01:58:34,230 --> 01:58:38,040
yeah which is like not super helpful

2389
01:58:36,090 --> 01:58:39,720
so um so I like

2390
01:58:38,040 --> 01:58:41,850
I would encourage you I'm given that

2391
01:58:39,720 --> 01:58:43,440
like that we have existing work um in

2392
01:58:41,850 --> 01:58:45,000
the IETF on in

2393
01:58:43,440 --> 01:58:47,610
it is like designing secured your first

2394
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:48,510
measuring right now to like um if you

2395
01:58:47,610 --> 01:58:50,099
want to work in there's a meshing

2396
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:52,230
problem to engage there and if you want

2397
01:58:50,100 --> 01:58:53,790
to write like an email for analysis like

2398
01:58:52,230 --> 01:58:55,139
this might be an okay place for this but

2399
01:58:53,790 --> 01:58:58,860
then this document needs some provision

2400
01:58:55,140 --> 01:59:02,190
to like actually be that understood

2401
01:58:58,860 --> 01:59:04,410
correctly the question I don't know I

2402
01:59:02,190 --> 01:59:07,320
don't want to say open PGP or PGP is

2403
01:59:04,410 --> 01:59:09,750
awful okay no I know that's not my point

2404
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:12,360
what I said is we have some facts and

2405
01:59:09,750 --> 01:59:15,300
some analysis of whether it's working

2406
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:17,759
until to which extent or which issues we

2407
01:59:15,300 --> 01:59:23,490
have to be considered like based on the

2408
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:27,030
academic world that exists so time check

2409
01:59:23,490 --> 01:59:30,570
one minute yes be mine so this is more

2410
01:59:27,030 --> 01:59:32,550
like here in this room and in ITF as

2411
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:35,490
Badar there is a lot of expertise and

2412
01:59:32,550 --> 01:59:38,040
that has be done a lot of work so it's

2413
01:59:35,490 --> 01:59:40,380
more like a call for discussion instead

2414
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:44,390
of doing things like I do believe or

2415
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:49,320
like with us maybe you were set up

2416
01:59:44,390 --> 01:59:53,100
like we start doing as a systematic way

2417
01:59:49,320 --> 01:59:55,590
of threads and identify the whole

2418
01:59:53,100 --> 01:59:59,910
spectrum by bringing the expertise

2419
01:59:55,590 --> 02:00:02,550
everyone has and then have an internet

2420
01:59:59,910 --> 02:00:05,340
document that will help and guide others

2421
02:00:02,550 --> 02:00:07,320
that will like to design engineers that

2422
02:00:05,340 --> 02:00:09,840
would like to design right is it like

2423
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:12,240
did I answer why again what's the

2424
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:13,860
question I guess what I'm saying is that

2425
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:16,019
like this document would not be helpful

2426
02:00:13,860 --> 02:00:17,940
for designing MLS it would not advance

2427
02:00:16,020 --> 02:00:19,950
the state of the art it might be useful

2428
02:00:17,940 --> 02:00:22,169
um some other versions dog in the beasts

2429
02:00:19,950 --> 02:00:24,389
for analyzing email but if you want to

2430
02:00:22,170 --> 02:00:26,490
contribute to the design of the

2431
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:27,930
protocols we're actually doing here then

2432
02:00:26,490 --> 02:00:32,400
I don't think a document census tract is

2433
02:00:27,930 --> 02:00:35,850
gonna be very helpful very quickly

2434
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:37,710
Richard Richard Barnes yeah similar page

2435
02:00:35,850 --> 02:00:39,240
to echo at all I think you know I I

2436
02:00:37,710 --> 02:00:40,920
agree that this is an important problem

2437
02:00:39,240 --> 02:00:43,050
with the state of messaging security

2438
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,120
especially for email is really terrible

2439
02:00:43,050 --> 02:00:47,460
but I don't think it's because we don't

2440
02:00:45,120 --> 02:00:49,650
understand the problem sufficiently in

2441
02:00:47,460 --> 02:00:52,320
contrast to dr. Woods document about a

2442
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:53,879
fingerprinting where there is like

2443
02:00:52,320 --> 02:00:55,980
open uncertainty you know active

2444
02:00:53,880 --> 02:00:57,600
research about what the threats are I

2445
02:00:55,980 --> 02:00:59,339
think we actually understand the problem

2446
02:00:57,600 --> 02:01:02,010
pretty well and even in the MLS case

2447
02:00:59,340 --> 02:01:02,880
we're writing a document to document the

2448
02:01:02,010 --> 02:01:04,080
threats were addressing in the

2449
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,990
architecture for addressing those

2450
02:01:04,080 --> 02:01:08,640
threats that's more about kind of

2451
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:10,110
consolidating on a view and making sure

2452
02:01:08,640 --> 02:01:11,550
that everyone's in the same page because

2453
02:01:10,110 --> 02:01:13,620
everyone already had fairly detailed

2454
02:01:11,550 --> 02:01:15,930
internal models all of the vendors who

2455
02:01:13,620 --> 02:01:17,400
are coming to the table for MLS and so

2456
02:01:15,930 --> 02:01:19,680
that was more of a consolidation effort

2457
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:22,080
than research really so I think this is

2458
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:28,850
probably not appropriate work for a

2459
02:01:22,080 --> 02:01:32,640
research group here this is dkg so I

2460
02:01:28,850 --> 02:01:36,300
think I agree with Eckert and Richard

2461
02:01:32,640 --> 02:01:38,670
that this document might be too broad to

2462
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,230
be particularly useful in contrast to

2463
02:01:38,670 --> 02:01:41,910
what Ben was saying Ben I'm suggesting

2464
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:44,459
maybe we could abstract it even further

2465
02:01:41,910 --> 02:01:45,750
I mean the way you had split up your

2466
02:01:44,460 --> 02:01:49,620
architecture it looks a lot like you

2467
02:01:45,750 --> 02:01:52,290
could use it to discuss IPSec in that

2468
02:01:49,620 --> 02:01:53,880
you have trust you know Association

2469
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:55,769
context and then you have the actual

2470
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:57,390
messaging security and you have to

2471
02:01:55,770 --> 02:01:58,950
transport all of these things right you

2472
02:01:57,390 --> 02:02:00,960
could actually evaluate IPSec with the

2473
02:01:58,950 --> 02:02:02,309
same framework that you have but at some

2474
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:07,310
point it becomes vague enough that it's

2475
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:09,420
hard to know what's actionable where

2476
02:02:07,310 --> 02:02:12,450
with regards to whether this is actually

2477
02:02:09,420 --> 02:02:16,830
useful for research Richard I think that

2478
02:02:12,450 --> 02:02:20,250
the that the work on a fail in the last

2479
02:02:16,830 --> 02:02:22,350
year shows that we actually still don't

2480
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:24,540
understand scope of attacks against

2481
02:02:22,350 --> 02:02:27,630
email against and and protected email

2482
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:29,340
and and I actually do think that it

2483
02:02:27,630 --> 02:02:32,250
would be useful to try to document this

2484
02:02:29,340 --> 02:02:33,840
for a specific application domain like

2485
02:02:32,250 --> 02:02:36,300
email because I I believe that there

2486
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:37,830
actually is more I mean we've done such

2487
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:39,570
a bad job of defending against the

2488
02:02:37,830 --> 02:02:41,040
attacks that we do know about for email

2489
02:02:39,570 --> 02:02:42,570
that no one feels like it's worth

2490
02:02:41,040 --> 02:02:45,060
showing that it's even more broken than

2491
02:02:42,570 --> 02:02:47,070
it is but that doesn't mean that it

2492
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:48,300
isn't actually also more broken and so I

2493
02:02:47,070 --> 02:02:49,980
do think that there's actually room

2494
02:02:48,300 --> 02:02:51,720
given the evidence for like the

2495
02:02:49,980 --> 02:02:53,759
low-hanging fruit that we saw from a

2496
02:02:51,720 --> 02:02:55,650
fail there's room to identify more

2497
02:02:53,760 --> 02:02:57,540
problems there and so I don't I don't

2498
02:02:55,650 --> 02:03:01,080
think this is going to be fallow ground

2499
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:03,269
for for research even but but I do think

2500
02:03:01,080 --> 02:03:07,750
that it needs to be more scopes to be

2501
02:03:03,270 --> 02:03:10,820
useful or entitle more tightly scopes to

2502
02:03:07,750 --> 02:03:12,800
hi I'm Mallory noddle from our 19 it was

2503
02:03:10,820 --> 02:03:14,750
a question I'm I didn't understand what

2504
02:03:12,800 --> 02:03:17,540
you were trying to document was it that

2505
02:03:14,750 --> 02:03:20,179
how the actual threat is compromised or

2506
02:03:17,540 --> 02:03:22,010
is it the threats themselves because I

2507
02:03:20,179 --> 02:03:25,100
think what you're trying to do is look

2508
02:03:22,010 --> 02:03:26,929
at threats from a like bring user level

2509
02:03:25,100 --> 02:03:29,150
threats into the conversation which

2510
02:03:26,929 --> 02:03:30,290
would be very useful but now after do

2511
02:03:29,150 --> 02:03:32,660
these comments I'm not so sure that's

2512
02:03:30,290 --> 02:03:35,300
what you're doing user threads it's

2513
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:38,120
mainly these documents about technical

2514
02:03:35,300 --> 02:03:40,310
threats which threats can be the classes

2515
02:03:38,120 --> 02:03:42,500
of threats and what actually does it

2516
02:03:40,310 --> 02:03:44,600
mean and private communication private

2517
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:47,199
messaging system in a future

2518
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:49,940
consideration we need to think about

2519
02:03:47,199 --> 02:03:53,449
just we with we think that we should

2520
02:03:49,940 --> 02:03:56,799
also consider other user threats in

2521
02:03:53,449 --> 02:03:59,330
terms of but this is can be in another

2522
02:03:56,800 --> 02:04:01,699
document not in this one it does this

2523
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:05,150
one I try to capture all the directions

2524
02:04:01,699 --> 02:04:09,169
that we think of that should be but it's

2525
02:04:05,150 --> 02:04:11,989
not in this document so for I'm sorry um

2526
02:04:09,170 --> 02:04:17,020
we're way over time can you take this

2527
02:04:11,989 --> 02:04:17,019
offline thank you thank you everyone

2528
02:04:31,850 --> 02:04:34,850
you
