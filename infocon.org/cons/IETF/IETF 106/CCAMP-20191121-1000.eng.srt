okay right now I it's ten o'clock I

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,480

00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:24,119

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,930
okay good morning everyone

6
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,520
so welcome to our see cam session so I

7
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,340
think this time it's a little bit

8
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:35,500
different from the previous ones I mean

9
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:38,560
long here sitting by their you know just

10
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,870
asked but you know because you know then

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:43,960
nearly I cannot make the chip that the

12
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:51,489
keys deal with us is online so we can

13
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:53,860
have the meeting at huger so this the

14
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:55,960
load a very information I think everyone

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:59,110
should you know be familiar with this

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,320
kind of policy and stuff but I've looked

17
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:04,930
like to demand you know one sentence it

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,009
says that if you are aware that I give

19
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,439
the Confucians

20
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:10,110
it's little bit it's covered by end

21
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:14,529
patterns that you must you know are

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:17,710
disclosed the idea or the fact so if you

23
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:19,450
aren't you are new to the 90th and I

24
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:21,970
think you should take a look at these

25
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:28,270
information documents and you can get

26

57
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:12,000
you know becomes a working group

58
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:14,220
document or a book include document goes

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,620
to last call the church we are sent out

60
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,780
to a car pulling on the list and it

61
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,640
requires all the authors and

62
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,500
contributors of the job to Toulouse

63
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,230
pounder you know I kept holding as soon

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:32,459
as possible otherwise it will delay on

65
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:35,310
your draft to move forward so and also

66
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,459
our edu do we are always you know I

67
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:41,250
encourage people I say can people are to

68
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,769
you know to use the list as much as

69
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:46,350
possible so on the list a we could

70
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,900
discuss any technical stuff for example

71
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:51,329
we could discuss some open issues on

72
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:53,880
some jobs and also we can introduce some

73
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:58,470
new jobs and some potential our new work

74
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,269
include topics on say camp and not the

75
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,970
important mandates that you know

76
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:04,980
actually working group consensus it's

77
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:07,230
determined on the list rather than you

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,480
know on the face-to-face meeting so even

79
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,298
though here on the face-to-face meeting

80
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,369
we get some consensus here we still need

81
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,330
to print on the list because you know

82
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,239
some people may be

83
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,130
cannot make the chip to hear so but they

84
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,219
can see something on the list so it's

85
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:27,620
better to we must you know are brewing

86
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,620
the consensus determination on the list

87
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,670
so for this I think for the working

88
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,150
group as Thetas I think my culture and

89
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:42,390
and nearly he would introduce the left

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:42,960
part of the presentation then yeah it's

91
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:47,310

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:37,050
according to the frequent change of

133

135
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:45,770

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:21,340
what's working group La Scala the baton

168
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:23,650
and permit verification import info no

169
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:26,530
technical changes probably it's another

170
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:30,610
draft that is ready for La Scala so lot

171
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:33,870
of work to do to prepare to prepare

172
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:39,730
these documents for for La Scala in the

173
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:45,190
upcoming weeks or so double internal

174
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:49,990
model this was updated accordingly to

175
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:52,510
the layer 0 type sir so 0 types is a pre

176
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,680
requirement but it seems so that the DS

177
00:10:52,510 --> 00:11:00,580
dependency isn't as now being cleared we

178
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:04,390
just need some further alignment to the

179
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,280
base model which is obviously the one

180
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:10,510
that it augments the idft

181
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:13,089
from TS front ISA which seems to be now

182
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:16,960
in a pretty good shape but I don't think

183
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,170
it's in in the editor cue yet next

184
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,170
please

185
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:31,900
ok we have the classical periodically

186
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:35,290
Asian coming from study group 15 we we

187
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:39,520
are working on on a reply Scott Scott

188
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:43,540
Mansfield is is working on this there is

189
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,090
also another liaison coming from from at

190
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:53,050
C or better a communication coming from

191
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:55,870
at C it was presented on Tuesday on in

192
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:58,089
this is I would say a little bit more

193
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:02,079
relevant to tease than see camper but it

194
00:11:58,089 --> 00:12:05,379
was sent to to both it's basically

195
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:11,699
talking about a new work that he is

196
00:12:05,379 --> 00:12:14,920
doing we on the wim the one

197
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:21,819
infrastructure manager they are looking

198
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:25,569
at a CTN as a possible reference for

199
00:12:21,819 --> 00:12:29,349
their worker and that's why this is

200
00:12:25,569 --> 00:12:32,439
probably the the main receiver for T's

201
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,750
for this rafter but all technology

202
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:38,290
specific extensions to atrocity and are

203
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,620
done in sick episode and that's why C

204
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:46,509
CAP is irrelevant as well so this was

205
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:48,339
said I forgot remember sound like three

206
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:51,699
four weeks ago so if you have the chance

207
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:58,180
to look at it that will be helpful next

208
00:12:51,699 --> 00:13:00,420
please thank you I can enjoy have a good

209
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,420
session

210
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:09,000
yeah let's move to the next humor

211
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,000
presentation yeah

212
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,330
get to presentation about him yes all

213
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:27,450
right

214
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:29,820
good morning yeah I have to get good

215
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:33,330
morning everyone my name is dieter

216
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:36,260
Beller I'm one of the editors and

217
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:40,790
co-authors of the draft that is

218
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:43,939
providing augmentations for the topology

219
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:49,140
in order to support optically

220
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,450
impairments for WDM networks I'm going

221
00:13:49,140 --> 00:14:03,300
to provide an update what we did since

222
00:13:51,450 --> 00:14:11,910
the last meeting and doesn't work

223
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:14,939
properly not a previous one please yeah

224
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:18,209
this one yeah the major activities since

225
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:20,850
i ET f 105 we are actually meeting every

226
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:24,000
week so we have an official C camp call

227
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:24,900
a WebEx meeting every Thursday from 4 to

228
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,300
5 p.m.

229
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:32,850
European time where we try to progress

230
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:35,250
the draft and the major topics that we

231
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,680
addressed since the Montreal meeting

232
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:43,110
were we actually discussed the road

233
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:47,040
model so yeah we had some discussions

234
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:48,780
about rodeo architectures and I have a

235
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,910
couple of slides I'm presenting those

236
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:52,949
the outcome of the discussion was that

237
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:56,850
we added a section in the draft that

238
00:14:52,950 --> 00:15:01,380
describes these architectures and we

239
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:04,470
also discussed how to model the optical

240
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:07,730
impairments imposed by Odom's so we

241
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:09,780
agreed to start with a simple approach I

242
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,450
addressing homogeneous Rotem

243
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,790
architectures first and then move to

244
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,700
more complex architectures in the future

245
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,969
might be and we during that discussion

246
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:23,490
we actually identified three paths that

247
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:26,640
have optical impairments associated with

248
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:29,130
them so there is an Express path or path

249
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:32,990
passed through path a net path and a

250
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:35,550
drop part that will be used in order to

251
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:37,950
describe the optical impairments imposed

252
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:39,630
by the Rotom we also had some

253
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,420
discussions regarding through our

254
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:44,970
regenerators those discussions have just

255
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:47,339
started we were focusing on the road

256
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:51,120
modeling first and I have a couple of

257
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:53,040
slides that describe the two options for

258
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,570
implementing a three-hour regenerator

259
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,670
and just move on the ticker is not

260
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,420
working the remote control get to the

261
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:03,689
next slide

262
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:13,010
yes thank you so this slide is actually

263
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:17,370
showing a Rotom and it shows on the two

264
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:20,459
WDM lines the line West line is we have

265
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:22,890
the ingress and egress amplifier when a

266
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:25,800
optical or photonic signal passes from

267
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:29,519
line west to line East we already agreed

268
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,399
that we are going to model the ingress

269
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,399
and egress amplifier as part of the TE

270
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:37,740
Ling so that's something that's not part

271
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,600
of the Rhoden then the Rotom has some

272
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,579
optical channel cross connect

273
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,890
functionality and of course it also has

274
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:46,229
some optical transponders where signals

275
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:48,000
are added to the line or what the

276
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:50,100
signals are dropped from the line to the

277
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,160
optical transponder so the blue box

278
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,769
actually is the physical device and as I

279
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,630
have illustrated here in dotted line and

280
00:16:55,769 --> 00:16:59,910
the transparent the amplifiers that are

281
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:03,810
there are actually modeled as part of

282
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:06,470
the TE link and the red part is the

283
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,899
expressed path or the through path and

284
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:12,360
the the signal coming from the optical

285
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:15,179
transponder here on the on the right

286
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:17,458
it's been an ad path where the green

287
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:19,709
signal is added to line East and the

288
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,380
purple signal coming from line West and

289
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:24,059
that's dropped to do T on the left-hand

290
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,220
side is done at the Trop path so we've

291
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,549
actually identified these three types of

292
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:31,260
paths and we are going to associate the

293
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:32,820
optical impairments imposed by the road

294
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,250
to these three paths

295
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,370
there's still discussion ongoing whether

296
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:40,200
the optical impairments will be

297
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:42,449
associated with the path or whether we

298
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:45,299
are going to split those optical

299
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:47,489
impairments up and add those to the

300
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,499
ports at the end of the path so a part

301
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:52,499
has to ends and this is an ongoing

302
00:17:49,499 --> 00:17:55,259
discussion we are going to use the

303
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:57,179
upcoming meetings to hopefully conclude

304
00:17:55,259 --> 00:18:01,340
the discussion and reach agreement how

305
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:01,340
to model that next slide please

306
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,099
okay I think I explained pretty much

307
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,429
already that the amplifiers are part of

308
00:18:08,099 --> 00:18:14,009
the TE link model and I already talked

309
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,989
about the three part we identified and

310
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:18,149
we also agreed on at least the three

311
00:18:15,989 --> 00:18:19,259
parameters that are going to be modeled

312
00:18:18,149 --> 00:18:21,059
so this is chromatic dispersion

313
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:22,799
polarization mode dispersion and

314
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:26,369
polarization dependent loss those

315
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,139
matters are going to be a optical

316
00:18:26,369 --> 00:18:29,759
impairment permits also for the Rotom

317
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:32,428
there are still discussions on going how

318
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:37,139
to model crosstalk due to the imperfect

319
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:40,710
isolation of the Rotom components and we

320
00:18:37,139 --> 00:18:42,689
are also going to study how to model

321
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:44,159
filtering impacts so when the signal

322
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:46,379
passes from a source node to a

323
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:48,509
destination node it crosses multiple

324
00:18:46,379 --> 00:18:53,059
rotom's and each node roadmap applies

325
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:56,339
some some filters and as an effect of

326
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:58,349
passing through the through the rotom's

327
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:01,109
the the filter actually the filter

328
00:18:58,349 --> 00:19:03,330
envelope narrows and we are going to

329
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:07,559
discuss how to model those there there's

330
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:09,149
no solution available yet but this is

331
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,129
something that we have to study there

332
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:13,049
are some papers available and we're

333
00:19:11,129 --> 00:19:15,738
studying those out how that could be

334
00:19:13,049 --> 00:19:18,450
modeled next slide please

335
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:20,009
and when we looked at the different

336
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:22,169
Rotom architectures that are out in the

337
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:24,179
field today and there's also some

338
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:26,489
evolution towards distributed Rotom

339
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,109
architectures so this is an example of

340
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:31,379
an integrated Rotom architecture so

341
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:34,559
everything is inside the box the OTS are

342
00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:38,488
an integral part of the box and from the

343
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,039
T topology perspective the tunnel

344
00:19:38,489 --> 00:19:44,099
termination points are actually located

345
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,940
on the only optical transponders then

346
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,939
next like these

347
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:54,100
rotom's today also provide ports input

348
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,990
boards output boards for remote optical

349
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,270
transponders they can be co-located or

350
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,980
they can even be a you know remote

351
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,010
device so this is shown by this

352
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:05,350
architecture so the optical transponders

353
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:06,879
on the left are integrated optical

354
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:10,389
transponders and on the right side you

355
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,970
see that external optical transponders

356
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:16,420
and in that case there is a single

357
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:18,940
channel coloured optical interface to

358
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:21,030
interconnect these external optical

359
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,300
transponders with the rhodium device

360
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:24,300
next please

361
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:32,560
now the two architecture shown before

362
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:34,540
our integrated thermal architectures

363
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,540
where only the optical transponder could

364
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,790
be remote now there's a tendency on a

365
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,590
market to disaggregate the roadman to

366
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,930
subdivide or odom and integrate it run

367
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,610
them into multiple subsystems this is

368
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:48,940
shown here on this slide so you see on

369
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:51,250
at the top the degrees of the Rotom and

370
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:54,220
you see at the bottom the add/drop

371
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:57,310
blocks of the Rotom and the O T so these

372
00:20:54,220 --> 00:21:01,710
can be separate entities which are

373
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:04,330
interconnected using optical fibers and

374
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:07,530
the assumption here is when you have a

375
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:10,540
disaggregated Rotem that the optical

376
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:13,450
domain controller is actually when it

377
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:17,649
provides the te topology to a client it

378
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:22,540
aggregates already the this aggregated

379
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:26,410
Rotem into a an abstracted Rotem and

380
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:28,750
that and for that Rotom the optical

381
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:31,060
impairments are actually provided so we

382
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:32,530
assume that that's a certain abstraction

383
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,179
is taking place in the optical domain

384
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,040
controller so that we don't have to

385
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:38,680
actually model all the individual

386
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,180
subsystems of a disaggregated Rotem next

387
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,560
slide please

388
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,510
so anteater I would like to have one

389
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,730
could come and so on look at in this

390
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:48,340
picture and this is more like kind of

391
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:50,620
architecture so load em right so where

392
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,409
is this kind of picture from its from

393
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:56,739
iqt documentation or from some other

394
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:59,200
place like open northern we had the open

395
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,530
road of architecture looks exactly the

396
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,230
same

397
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:04,930
[Music]

398
00:22:01,230 --> 00:22:06,610
but anyway I think you know from the

399
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:08,830
data plan perspective we should you know

400
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:13,689
follow itu-t recommendation rather than

401
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:18,879
you know foreign open load and all but

402
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:22,210
in general this can be an architect an

403
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,330
example of architecture when you don't

404
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:29,890
have a centralized fiber or a lambda

405
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:34,649
switching inside and this is one of the

406
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:38,740
most used in the industry today and so

407
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:41,650
this is applied that whenever we want to

408
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,740
let's say identify if you're not

409
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:49,000
composed by different come by different

410
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:53,740
modules and then the the goal is to

411
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:57,520
understand here also whether this model

412
00:22:53,740 --> 00:23:02,559
can be in some way described using the

413
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:05,710
Ahmadis or not know the debate is still

414
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,660
open as a determination for example

415
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,630
whether to assign the optical

416
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:15,250
impairments to ports or to paths or

417
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:20,760
internal part of the node and so we

418
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:24,040
think by by nest ITF we clarify exactly

419
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:27,070
the way we want to to motive internally

420
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:30,010
and as a black box

421
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:31,419
they wrote a function and the reason why

422
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,250
we're actually looking at this kind of

423
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,690
architecture is we have to make sure

424
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:36,850
that the model that we are defining

425
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,470
covers all different architectures so

426
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,629
that's that's the reason why we did this

427
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:42,490
study and while we also well and why we

428
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,200
also looked at this aggregated Rotem

429
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,640
architecture so the model that we're

430
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,230
going to define should actually cover

431
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,790
all the different architectures of

432
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:51,580
Rodin's which are out there in the field

433
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:55,330
or which are currently evolving exactly

434
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:59,379
yeah I agree with that otherwise we risk

435
00:23:55,330 --> 00:24:02,199
to have something that covers just 10 20

436
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,090
% of what's in field exactly we wanted

437
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:07,600
to make something that is useful we

438
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:12,310
should try to cover at least a good

439
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:14,629
portion of the installed base so yeah I

440
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:16,730
mean it's it's a pity you

441
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:21,830
this is not a fully standard

442
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:25,520
architecture mandated by ITU but I mean

443
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:28,250
I I have the same feeling this is widely

444
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:36,650
deployed so it's it's worth having a

445
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:40,610
look at it okay thank you hello it's

446
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:43,010
Debra this is really evolved it looks

447
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,649
very good the documents really a bomb

448
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:48,770
and there's a lot of information I would

449
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:51,049
just warn you to be careful and it this

450
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:53,480
is this came up already now I'm make

451
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:56,780
sure you're referencing standards were

452
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,960
you can reference them because this came

453
00:24:56,780 --> 00:25:03,139
up on the yang along module remember I'm

454
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,720
with that one I think it was when doing

455
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:08,299
them review for the last calling it

456
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,980
folks all said where did you get this

457
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:12,918
from and put something in the

458
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,799
descriptors to say references to what

459
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,860
standards you are going through out so

460
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:20,389
keep track of it now before it gets at

461
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,699
the very end right that you have to go

462
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:25,280
back and add all this and even on these

463
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,679
models you can simply you can say

464
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,309
something reference I to you one and

465
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:33,440
then just simply say that this is a

466
00:25:31,309 --> 00:25:36,220
deployed model or something like that

467
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:39,110
but yeah you know just be say exactly

468
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:41,659
well you know what what this is so that

469
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,439
people know that it's not and it's not I

470
00:25:41,659 --> 00:25:48,350
to you and if that way folks can look at

471
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,450
it and say well you know this this is

472
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:51,408
not complying or something but it's

473
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:54,020
something different if it's just

474
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:56,960
functionally an abstraction that helps

475
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,940
you to to define the parameters but it

476
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,340
doesn't actually bb-8 but make sure

477
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:03,770
you're referencing I to standards I

478
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:05,570
didn't see any references to the ITU

479
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:07,520
standards like as you go through it you

480
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:09,649
enjoy at the end with the informative

481
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,200
references but not so much as you go

482
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:14,780
through it and then just while we're

483
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,820
talking about it and make sure I think

484
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:19,340
as this is getting very developed now

485
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:21,379
you should layers on to ITU it's time to

486
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,090
lay its on and they have the meeting

487
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:26,720
it's like the third or fourth week of

488
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:28,280
January so you know try to get it a kind

489
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,480
of clean version and just get it

490
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,820
they're like the first week of January

491
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,680
or something like that save time to

492
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,780
review and they had sent us back

493
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,600
something on the OTS I so I assume you

494
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:42,320
guys now updated online with that right

495
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,959
that lays on I mean we discussed that

496
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:47,240
the previous meeting also that this

497
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,940
document is also related to the newer

498
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,630
ITT recommendation G 807 and we we

499
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:56,300
submitted ap last call comments which

500
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:58,130
are currently on the resolution we

501
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,440
discuss that briefly also yesterday

502
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:02,540
during that meeting that we had among

503
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,340
the contributors and co-authors of the

504
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:09,470
draft and we'll have to see how that ap

505
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:11,000
last call comments will be resolved or

506
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,580
what do we need to I think have some

507
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,920
further liaisons or interaction with the

508
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:17,870
iqt I think it's important now before

509
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,610
you leis on add those references to

510
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:22,939
where you turn for the standards and

511
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:26,479
clearly say why you chose you know you

512
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:27,740
enhance models to like for example for

513
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,060
this and why you did it

514
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,260
it's that they can read it and

515
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,940
understand otherwise they're just going

516
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:34,550
to send it back to us and say exactly

517
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,150
it's white I said this is you know not

518
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,149
compliant

519
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:42,740
honey honey and a little bit cat we need

520
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:45,649
to be a little bit careful when we turn

521
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:47,840
to the itu-t because 807 is different to

522
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:50,470
with the data plane it it also means a

523
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:53,570
general architecture and this is

524
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,420
architecture in compliance so we cite UT

525
00:27:53,570 --> 00:28:00,800
data planning so we may need to have two

526
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,810
groups off you actually have to like to

527
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:04,730
the mandala so adding the calendar you

528
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:07,970
know loading architecture this job that

529
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:12,650
should not only reference to Jesus 807

530
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:14,900
but also you know R 0 6 7 2 3 6 7 2 this

531
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:17,360
this documentation really talks about

532
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:19,490
architecture for the Rhoden but actually

533
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,399
this job didn't the reference to this

534
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:24,320
documentation so absolute up check you

535
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:26,630
know I think I agree I think we have to

536
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,460
agree we have to add some more

537
00:28:26,630 --> 00:28:30,080
references to the IQ to your

538
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:34,910
recommendations and that's that's a good

539
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,310
point here or take that slightly okay

540
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:39,440
we also looked at three are read

541
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:42,030
generators and we actually discussed

542
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,770
through realizations of three or agender

543
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,690
original Raiders one is shown on this

544
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:50,940
slide this is the what is called the

545
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:52,650
back-to-back configuration of 2 OTS

546
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,260
that means that the client parts of the

547
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:57,030
OTS are used to interconnect 2 OTS that

548
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:59,000
forum that we are a generator next slide

549
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,940
please and there is another

550
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,880
implementation possible where you

551
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:09,770
actually use

552
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:12,690
sorry little question yeah did the tree

553
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:14,220
regenerator is considered just within

554
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,480
the context of a Rotom

555
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,510
yes they could they could I mean as far

556
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,680
as they remember we could we can have

557
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:27,840
regenerators or so without a rhythm

558
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:30,210
right okay in the photon country yes

559
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,010
that's that's true but again I said

560
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:33,900
initially I think we just started

561
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:36,810
looking at three our generators and

562
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:38,580
these are just two possibilities of

563
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:40,139
where the optical transponders in a

564
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,490
rhodium are actually used as a three

565
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:46,020
origin right or there are other

566
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:51,420
architectures or my question is whether

567
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:54,389
the road they regenerate or is tightly

568
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:59,270
coupled with the presence of a Rotom in

569
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:02,010
the network I don't think so

570
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,770
this is probably something that we have

571
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:08,940
to discuss our assumption so far input

572
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:11,370
Bethenny but yeah really speaking in

573
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,220
general if you have a regenerator based

574
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:16,639
on lambda you need a Rotom because you

575
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,170
are usually under spectral and damage

576
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:25,920
select element want to the region to

577
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:29,250
regenerate in general so that that's why

578
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,860
we combine that a regenerator to the

579
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:35,970
road market as but in any case is either

580
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:39,179
is a plasma so I don't you know I mean I

581
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:42,300
I would like not to live out the

582
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:49,230
possibility to cover a lot of legacy

583
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:53,490
stuff where regenerators are used in in

584
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:55,620
the nor Odum notes there should be still

585
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,779
some some of them in field right

586
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:00,799
in this case you don't have editor to

587
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:04,340
the M lines or you just every generator

588
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:08,908
every hour generator that is working on

589
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:10,649
a single channel that's it one micron I

590
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:13,379
bet one channel margin

591
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:16,500
yes exactly exactly okay we can call it

592
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:18,178
Oh sooty stuff I don't know I don't have

593
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,649
the feeling other what's the percentage

594
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:26,759
of those type of nodes in the network

595
00:31:22,649 --> 00:31:29,309
clips if it's maybe I think it's very

596
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:32,519
very low probably it's not worth trying

597
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:34,049
to cover it if there are phasma it's

598
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,230
probably trying to model them

599
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:40,379
I think this rigid this kind of

600
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:46,620
regenerator were very used in SONET SDH

601
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:49,769
networks yes now we TWM usually you have

602
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:54,360
multiple lambdas in a single file can it

603
00:31:49,769 --> 00:31:56,600
but really it's not worth it you can

604
00:31:54,360 --> 00:32:01,289
leave it out okay thank you thank you

605
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,199
thanks like this okay what are the major

606
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:06,179
changes on the draft on the draft with

607
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,070
respect to the previous version so we

608
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,019
actually edit some text and figures

609
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,629
describing these rolling architectures

610
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:14,820
which I just presented and the yang

611
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:16,889
model in the draft is still unchanged

612
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:18,269
because what we need to do first is we

613
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:20,189
need to agreement about the optical

614
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:23,549
interim parameters which we're still

615
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:27,120
discussing and once that is there is

616
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:28,679
agreement among the or about the optical

617
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,418
impairment parameters we will then look

618
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,340
at the yang model and we will try to

619
00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:34,889
figure out where the augmentation should

620
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:40,649
occur and should be done next slide

621
00:32:34,889 --> 00:32:43,439
please we're using a github currently we

622
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:46,350
are using an individual account and

623
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,000
github and we had some discussions

624
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,689
between the previous meeting and this

625
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,429
meeting whether we should create a SECAM

626
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,559
working group organization github

627
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:59,129
account this is the proposal there is

628
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:02,129
some internet draft available that

629
00:32:59,129 --> 00:33:03,689
describes that how to set up such an

630
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:05,309
account I think it makes sense to put

631
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:07,830
all the related

632
00:33:05,309 --> 00:33:08,850
yang models on it on that on that github

633
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,820
so that's the

634
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:13,530
teehee topology young model with the

635
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,929
optical impairments then there's that

636
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:18,090
that's using layer 0 types there's layer

637
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:20,100
1 types which is a working group which

638
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,929
has a working group status so the

639
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,929
proposal or the suggestion here is that

640
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,480
we should actually create such an see

641
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:28,830
can perk you group account and github

642
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,160
where we put all the all the material

643
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:35,780
together and that helps us also to keep

644
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:40,200
the material pretty much aligned yeah

645
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:41,910
Toki talking about this we we discussed

646
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,470
about to the possibility to ever see

647
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:48,750
camp

648
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:52,950
github we we are happy to do that to do

649
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:55,530
that to put it in place actually I read

650
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:58,350
the draft

651
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:00,960
talking about organization get upset it

652
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:03,120
seems so that sooner or later we will

653
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,570
have in data tracker the possibility to

654
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,168
create to create one I've not yet seen

655
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:13,639
it so I don't know what's the timing for

656
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:18,359
the implementation of such such tool

657
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:25,409
from from data tracker if if you believe

658
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:27,720
that that we should have it sooner

659
00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:30,270
probably what we can do is to create it

660
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:34,799
and then I've seen that there is also

661
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:40,050
procedure to move the an existing

662
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:43,760
organization Geeta but - I let me say

663
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:46,050
ITF controller so we we can create it as

664
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,190
independently and move it later that's

665
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,929
something that you can and that's

666
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:52,200
exactly what we're suggesting so we can

667
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:55,139
take that offline and ok create it yeah

668
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,120
next slide please we have a number of

669
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,740
open issues which are also listed on

670
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:03,900
github this is just a screenshot from

671
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:08,129
our open issues list on on github like

672
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:11,670
slide please next steps so what what are

673
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:14,340
the next steps we want to conclude now

674
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,950
the discussions that are still ongoing

675
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:19,380
regarding the modeling of cross talk in

676
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:21,359
rodents that lead to an degradation of

677
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,650
the optical signal due to and that's

678
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,770
gonna be modeled as an

679
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:28,890
always an hour degradation as I said we

680
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:30,900
need to identify the te nodes node

681
00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:33,060
entities the containers in the tea

682
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:35,340
topology yang model that are suitable

683
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:37,100
for the optical impairment augmentations

684
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:40,070
so there we have to take care about

685
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:43,589
scalability because we looked at the

686
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:45,330
connectivity matrix initially but the

687
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:47,430
current status of the discussion is that

688
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,799
probably that's not suitable and we will

689
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:51,990
probably have to find another place or a

690
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,370
definition of how to model the optical

691
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:56,910
impairments we had some discussion

692
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:59,700
yesterday during this the the meeting on

693
00:35:56,910 --> 00:36:02,040
this specific topic and then we also

694
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,140
have to study what the filtering impacts

695
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,660
are on signal quality on how to model

696
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,850
those we will also have to address then

697
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:11,670
the three our generators which we just

698
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,710
briefly discussed in one of our calls

699
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:15,600
and of course we have to address the

700
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:15,960
other open issues listed on github next

701
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,270
slide please

702
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:25,380
and that was it further discuss comments

703
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:28,050
questions so I think you already spend

704
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:33,450
the twenty five twenty five minutes

705
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:33,450
[Laughter]

706
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:46,440
[Music]

707
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,260
good morning

708
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:54,240
I'm sorry ability speaking good Bonnie

709
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:59,040
everybody chowder nearly I'm going to

710
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:08,910
make an update about the layer one types

711
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:13,190
and route en topology young model so

712
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:16,980
they this is the main content of fire

713
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:21,840
IDF layer one types they the basic point

714
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:26,280
is that the intention is that to use the

715
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:31,200
definition of different structure audio

716
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:35,370
type and client signal for all the

717
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:36,480
related document that is OTN topology

718
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:44,180
and Tunnel

719
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:44,180
and ITF layer 1 GSM module

720
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:59,240
so the basic changes of in the layer 1

721
00:37:51,349 --> 00:38:05,820
types its that ok we check they are FCAT

722
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:10,399
4:07 yung gud line and and basically the

723
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:14,220
important point is that we added a

724
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:18,599
section in which we describe the usage

725
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:23,118
of the different grouping in

726
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:28,170
particularly we also better define the

727
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:34,369
relationship between TPN and the root

728
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:34,369
the tributary port number and timeslot

729
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:45,089
that and so defining what is the OT n

730
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:48,390
label that is defined in the drafts that

731
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:53,310
usually represent how the tributary port

732
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:55,828
is assign how the relationship between

733
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:58,170
the tributary port number and what is

734
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:01,560
the tributaries lot on the server that

735
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:06,329
is assigned to carry that this is well

736
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:09,859
described in Ursus at 71 31 and we

737
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:14,880
reference a data in the document and

738
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:18,509
basically we rename a few of the

739
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:24,450
groupings name to fit better with the OT

740
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:28,140
n term so basically they will define the

741
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:32,819
TN label restriction and without Yin

742
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:36,029
level ranging and TN link label at the

743
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:40,099
end pot labeled both with the OT n label

744
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:43,859
start and OT n label hope and we try to

745
00:39:40,099 --> 00:39:45,569
define how to use that unfortunately at

746
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:47,940
the moment in the test there is some

747
00:39:45,569 --> 00:39:50,490
miss miss aligning with a with the name

748
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:58,560
so we need to adjust that

749
00:39:50,490 --> 00:40:03,390
the basic explanation is there okay then

750
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:07,730
we added the leaf list for audio list

751
00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:11,069
type to define which audio type can be

752
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:13,440
supported or not in the label range if

753
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:19,380
it is empty del the range means that

754
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:24,090
everyone every audio type is supported

755
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:27,180
we are also removed in the signal

756
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:32,460
do you see n because is not a switching

757
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:36,980
type and okay we we have we changed the

758
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:41,670
range of TPN and tributaries lot from

759
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:47,940
one to four hundred four thousand ninety

760
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:52,140
five and we add back the coding function

761
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:57,920
that is defining an EF assist III for

762
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,920
the usage that is used in layer one GSM

763
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:07,859
so the next step of the draft is okay

764
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:12,150
it's done the alignment with the I TFT

765
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:16,200
types and topology and the tunnel and

766
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,450
the layer one GSM but is still open the

767
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,319
alignment with layer zero type in

768
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:26,460
particularly the grouping names that is

769
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:29,160
the funny ITF layer zero is still the

770
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:34,109
reporting the term restoration we would

771
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:39,060
like to align both the types with the

772
00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:42,210
correct name our intention is to request

773
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:53,160
the working group last cold and young

774
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:57,930
daughter review okay so this is instead

775
00:41:53,160 --> 00:42:02,220
a update for ot anthropology there is a

776
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:03,299
I just we just put as a reference the

777
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,970
content busy

778
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:15,360
content of the young tree but there is

779
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:18,299
no real modification of that so there is

780
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,330
no changing test but the model has been

781
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,640
changed reformatting the tree to satisfy

782
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:28,470
the problem of line line restriction and

783
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:33,020
has been armed own eyes with layer one

784
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:38,689
types and in particular have been added

785
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:45,830
duty any label step and set default at

786
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:50,700
140 M for next step about the topology

787
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:54,990
we request for working group last tool

788
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:59,689
and dr. review together with layer 1

789
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:04,830
types and Daniele already mentioned that

790
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:13,860
and ok the this is the reference for the

791
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:21,960
to model to check that's before any

792
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:24,060
comment reported Cisco is it the layer 1

793
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,430
x in layer 0 it touches if you review

794
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,070
together of those two models the yang

795
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:34,620
dr. review sorry which model do you are

796
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:36,600
superior together for yang dr. v Valeo 1

797
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:42,380
we are the chest already send the time

798
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:46,920
to the young dr. love you layer 1 types

799
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:48,830
so we so which one you saying together

800
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,870
with layer 1 types what's that refer to

801
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:56,520
that refer to the OTN topology module or

802
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:59,540
layer 0 times no let me explain this for

803
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:02,880
me Holly the layer 1 types is

804
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:06,710
fundamental identity in Ocean Technology

805
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,880
and as well the next one in topology is

806
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:13,890
highly dependent now that they are 1

807
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:16,770
types ok so that's why we're good now

808
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:20,910
because there is that the relationship

809
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:24,300
so layer one types is a is common is

810
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:26,370
used by the the trim year the progress

811
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:28,020
so far is the chairs has sent the two

812
00:44:26,370 --> 00:44:30,779
documents layer one types and to the

813
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:33,140
other layer zero types together for your

814
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,310
young daughter review because of their

815
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,270
correspondence at different switching

816
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:41,520
layer so so there would be also a layer

817
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:51,990
zero topology like w.zahn topology

818
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:54,810
singing to you as well okay next so

819
00:44:51,990 --> 00:45:10,799
thanks for you that you help us to have

820
00:44:54,810 --> 00:45:17,070
a few minutes back okay don't good

821
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:19,500
morning okay this huh men speaking and

822
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:21,210
I'm going to present the two documents a

823
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,550
actually this is the layer they were

824
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:25,800
correspondence to the previous

825
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:27,840
presentation one is on layers there were

826
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,640
types and the other is on with this song

827
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,770
young which is the double anthropology

828
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:36,330
oh it works great so we have the similar

829
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:38,820
content as the previous presentation so

830
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:42,690
firstly we focus on what is motor

831
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:44,940
relationship and the first document we

832
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:48,830
are present in presenting includes the

833
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:50,820
Moldy ITF layer 0 types which is the

834
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,650
fundamental identities to be

835
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:56,850
incorporated in post poverty and

836
00:45:52,650 --> 00:46:00,090
Hinault's so here and from this table we

837
00:45:56,850 --> 00:46:03,569
also indicate what kind of types we have

838
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:06,540
been included for layer 0 because there

839
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:09,710
are multiple modules would rely on the

840
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:14,610
layer 0 types so currently we have

841
00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:18,840
included as a basic identity is used

842
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:22,770
would be useful for DWDM CWDM and the

843
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,960
flask great so what we have not included

844
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:27,780
so far would be somehow like the

845
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:33,300
impairment present and also the in

846
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:36,300
face another draft so okay so here we

847
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:41,100
gives a detailed list of what kind of

848
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:43,680
types we include include know that were

849
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:46,830
cleanser allocation combination

850
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,129
bandwidth channel spacing in fact so the

851
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:55,700
details are listed here and also in the

852
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:59,070
module of course so the changes from

853
00:46:55,700 --> 00:47:01,169
last version okay this is actually the

854
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:03,990
young doctor has already provide one

855
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:06,000
iteration of review and we have some

856
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:12,660
editorial change like that will already

857
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:15,450
change and we also change our central

858
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:18,149
frequency as a type type def into the

859
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:21,779
new type with together the description

860
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:26,130
and the one issue marked as read here

861
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:30,000
has not been changed so far this is how

862
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:33,500
many digits after fraction we should cap

863
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:41,790
keep for both gigahertz and the

864
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:44,400
terahertz so basically we a proposal

865
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:48,060
would be we keep one digit 4 Giga and

866
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,300
the 40 DS for key Hertz and the example

867
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:56,670
would be here like we consider the thing

868
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:00,420
for s 119 3.1 terahertz and this would

869
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:02,550
be easier to understand and the read so

870
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,320
the one here is has some kind of

871
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:08,130
ambiguity and would like to be changed

872
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:09,960
and we would like to raise this point to

873
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:11,910
the working group to make agreement and

874
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,160
then we feed back to young doctors and

875
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:21,390
we're lucky the young doctor is here

876
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:23,730
today so yeah the next we'll step

877
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:27,680
including a few steps the first group of

878
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:33,420
issue okay let me finish very severely

879
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:36,450
so the group name change from the OTN

880
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:38,760
modos also impact the corresponding

881
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:41,038
groupings here so we are proposing three

882
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:46,049
different the cooking name changed

883
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:49,289
as follow and that's how the open issue

884
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:52,469
we have notified and we believe after

885
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:54,809
today's discussion we can provide one

886
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:59,429
more update and then proceeds those

887
00:48:54,809 --> 00:49:00,929
portions to you have to reveal a dot

888
00:48:59,429 --> 00:49:04,019
okay sorry

889
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:18,539
Greg mercy CT if you can row previous

890
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:22,229
slide because and so we're you plan to

891
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:26,869
have fractions because here you have in

892
00:49:22,229 --> 00:49:37,890
16 and within 16 you cannot have

893
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:40,079
fractions you need to have the other in

894
00:49:37,890 --> 00:49:46,019
16 would not allow you to have fractions

895
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:52,019
right here is the type that is under

896
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:54,629
it's 16 which is DW t + - n and we are

897
00:49:52,019 --> 00:49:56,868
using the kind of I cannot remember the

898
00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:00,299
detail name but which stands for the

899
00:49:56,869 --> 00:50:06,809
nominal frequency and on the frequency

900
00:50:00,299 --> 00:50:08,549
is the numerical value of the numerical

901
00:50:06,809 --> 00:50:12,749
value of the frequency on the spectrum

902
00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:16,949
and this is can be the central band

903
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:20,279
would be one ninety three point one

904
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:24,839
terahertz with channel spacing you early

905
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:29,519
twelve point five right but you

906
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:33,239
basically you can have a union of two

907
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:38,098
decimals and then four gigahertz you

908
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:40,709
have a digit one and four terahertz you

909
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:52,189
can have digit 4 and then union of these

910
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:53,489
two types em and then integers certainly

911
00:50:52,189 --> 00:50:54,720
right

912
00:50:53,489 --> 00:50:56,400
Amira's thought we

913
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:02,879
and you early married the by gigahertz

914
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:05,579
and the other the other is a nominal

915
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:12,089
central frequency which is you early by

916
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:15,329
terahertz okay I don't think that

917
00:51:12,089 --> 00:51:24,119
because integer is that an integer it's

918
00:51:15,329 --> 00:51:25,849
not a float just to clarify here not on

919
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:28,470
the the

920
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:34,410
frequency is one ninety three point one

921
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:37,649
period and second either you use N and M

922
00:51:34,410 --> 00:51:40,319
values at this pointer integer or you

923
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:43,410
decide to use frequency and in this case

924
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:47,550
should have five digits after the comma

925
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:50,368
so the fraction is five you prefer five

926
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:52,560
between forever five digit because you

927
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:55,079
want to enter the six nine value of two

928
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:57,390
here we are talking about frequency the

929
00:51:55,079 --> 00:52:00,810
frequency is six point twenty five

930
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:04,200
gigahertz okay 600 and 25 okay you cheat

931
00:52:00,810 --> 00:52:07,380
Plus 3 is 5 then can we say okay to

932
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:13,020
offered bigger and the five for Tara now

933
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:15,829
five for Tara into 44 Giga so six what

934
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:17,369
is false come on this now it depends no

935
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:21,270
you're talking about

936
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:23,220
egads is five point six point twenty

937
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:25,950
five gigahertz so you have to teach

938
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:30,109
ouvea - Shaniqua translating Tara is

939
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,109
five digits right okay twenty-five

940
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:35,460
either was it just to try to Greg we

941
00:52:33,780 --> 00:52:37,680
have to type on these are two types one

942
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,930
type is when you want to represent the

943
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,210
center frequencies not width of the

944
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:45,029
filter is an integer if you want to

945
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:46,829
represent something like the senior or

946
00:52:45,030 --> 00:52:48,900
the acai Center frequency then it's the

947
00:52:46,829 --> 00:52:56,160
Terra a surrogate so are two different

948
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:58,470
types of so some I also have uncommon so

949
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,890
it seems there are two types of units so

950
00:52:58,470 --> 00:53:05,520
can we just use one one unit for example

951
00:53:01,890 --> 00:53:07,890
or we just use only a dick Hertz

952
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,580
rather than use G cards sometimes we use

953
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:18,120
two coats

954
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:19,740
we used our tech hots 10 hots yeah it

955
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:21,779
depends sometimes is more readable to

956
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:25,589
have terror sometimes worried about 12 G

957
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:28,440
guards so I don't know we can look at

958
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:31,530
you only if you only want to have one we

959
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:33,480
would slightly prefer to gigahertz yes

960
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:35,460
yeah but you used to have a very big

961
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,020
number in front of the right the comment

962
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:42,240
that's and as difficult to read when you

963
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:44,100
look at JSON yeah yeah Teterboro

964
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:46,049
speaking I mean this actually concerns

965
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:47,819
me a little bit because we also had some

966
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:51,540
discussions when we discussed the

967
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:54,330
carrier frequencies for the TE topology

968
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,550
model for the optical impairments and

969
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,740
there we agreed that we are going to use

970
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,810
a certain number of digits I don't

971
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:03,870
remember whether it was six or something

972
00:54:00,810 --> 00:54:06,480
like that but you can look it up and so

973
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:10,859
the question is really how do we get

974
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:13,320
alignment for the layer zero types

975
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:16,890
across different yang modes that are

976
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:18,660
using this this type definitions so the

977
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:24,779
gentleman stand behind you should feel

978
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:27,149
good also the robot is going back to

979
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:28,980
York what you made about it sometimes

980
00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,960
more readable to choose different units

981
00:54:28,980 --> 00:54:32,970
effectively I think generally and yang

982
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,950
be better to choose one and then do that

983
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:36,839
conversion on your client side I

984
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:38,160
appreciate the raw Jason coming through

985
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:40,380
and the protocols you have a longer

986
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,580
number any GUI or something similar off

987
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:46,170
see correct it - too easy units yes but

988
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:48,060
then it's less work we want to compare

989
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:50,190
those values between different places so

990
00:54:48,060 --> 00:54:51,720
mostly if you use different units

991
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,700
different places you putting extra work

992
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,279
in convert them more like that or is it

993
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,720
that case so I probably suggest unless

994
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,020
it doesn't make sense to try and keep in

995
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:03,810
one in terms of trying to get

996
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:05,430
commonality I think it's just reviewing

997
00:55:03,810 --> 00:55:06,900
those modules together the title address

998
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:08,220
and making sure they're consistent which

999
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:10,500
I'll try and do so I'll review them the

1000
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:11,730
same time but but you're writing the

1001
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,050
same different sentence writing much

1002
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:18,360
what's opportune you say I don't know

1003
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:21,930
exactly how it's being used so it's hard

1004
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,940
to judge so if you your models naturally

1005
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:25,919
have different ones that it might make

1006
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:28,500
sense but if it's a value that you might

1007
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:30,360
be using in multiple places I would try

1008
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:32,730
and keep it in the same units and I'd

1009
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:33,870
probably go I don't know where the

1010
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:36,360
gigahertz with terahertz makes more

1011
00:55:33,870 --> 00:55:38,700
sense the only other comment I'd make is

1012
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,400
it seems like the size of these channels

1013
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:44,310
getting swore over time so you might a

1014
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,050
factor that any that's the case I had so

1015
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:50,330
the number of digits you might need will

1016
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:50,330
increase over time so it's fact that in

1017
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:58,760
Greg muskie as a prime Mr Hammond look

1018
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:02,760
so yes if you want to have a digits

1019
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:06,690
decimal digits you use decimal type and

1020
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:09,690
then you say fraction digits if I

1021
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:11,610
understood the comment is saying don't

1022
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:14,910
differentiate the gigahertz and

1023
00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:18,480
terahertz just make convert to one and

1024
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:21,420
express it with a number it's so so much

1025
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:24,210
simpler so we have upgrade all using

1026
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:28,340
only kilohertz I believe yes and then

1027
00:56:24,210 --> 00:56:34,220
you can specify you can have for example

1028
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:38,760
decimal 64 decimal 32 and then five

1029
00:56:34,220 --> 00:56:42,450
fraction digits for Kika we don't need

1030
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:45,510
as much as five digits okay then to make

1031
00:56:42,450 --> 00:56:52,740
because because if you if you put here

1032
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:54,570
one you probably need to okay good yes

1033
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:58,020
but please make sure to be

1034
00:56:54,570 --> 00:57:02,040
proof a bit because after 6.25 there is

1035
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:04,620
a three point of 123 and that's why I

1036
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:08,730
mention something three digits is the

1037
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:10,529
next of it and determine again there's

1038
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:12,720
one more comment from my side we

1039
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:15,960
discussed yesterday briefly in the in

1040
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:18,930
the Innosight meeting if this is going

1041
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,750
to move to working group group last call

1042
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:24,270
that's going to be frozen so and other

1043
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:26,940
work is still work in progress and we

1044
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:29,400
may actually have to define additional

1045
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:31,410
types for example for the tea topologies

1046
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:34,320
the question is do we have then to

1047
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:37,049
create a new revision of tea layer zero

1048
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:39,780
types for example so this is something

1049
00:57:37,050 --> 00:57:40,710
that we we should better understand how

1050
00:57:39,780 --> 00:58:02,010
the process works

1051
00:57:40,710 --> 00:58:05,460
yes great yeah great so I sorry for my

1052
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:08,100
voice etcetera from my way discussing

1053
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:11,940
some couple of motivated to the transfer

1054
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,589
class in yet so one is about the history

1055
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:21,330
working group document on the client

1056
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:23,130
signal model okay so the status of the

1057
00:58:21,330 --> 00:58:25,890
worker after it was not presented in the

1058
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:27,330
last meeting I was presenting him 104 so

1059
00:58:25,890 --> 00:58:29,609
the document has been adopted as a

1060
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,650
working group document in May we didn't

1061
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:33,780
do major changes we don't do any change

1062
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:36,240
to the text after the adoption but we

1063
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,830
did some changes to the madala

1064
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,490
we have added for example the new

1065
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:43,380
service types which they are intended to

1066
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,419
provide all these all the types that can

1067
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:48,060
be used for describing the client

1068
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:50,850
seniors any particular respect a lot of

1069
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:53,880
new types coming up from the new work

1070
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:57,120
they will result later on performance

1071
00:58:53,880 --> 00:59:00,240
monitoring the door am the next one and

1072
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:02,490
we have added in the trance for a

1073
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:04,680
transport service we have added a new

1074
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:06,959
container to configure the protection or

1075
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:08,308
restoration in case you want to do

1076
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,510
detection resolution in decline layer

1077
00:59:08,309 --> 00:59:11,190
rather than in the server layer

1078
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:14,490
especially if you want to do a looming

1079
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:17,010
and we have added a span a little bit

1080
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:19,169
the way you can configure the underlying

1081
00:59:17,010 --> 00:59:20,790
tunnel that carries the senior the

1082
00:59:19,170 --> 00:59:22,290
distinguishing between the case where

1083
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:24,329
that kinda line telling is an Internet

1084
00:59:22,290 --> 00:59:27,058
tunnel where or is nutrient and arose an

1085
00:59:24,329 --> 00:59:28,650
NP STP tunnel reason is that it mainly

1086
00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:31,410
because MP has to be for example as to

1087
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:34,170
cover take care of also absolute wire

1088
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:38,009
and absolute while switching that's one

1089
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:40,650
and we have a data so transparent client

1090
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:42,089
basically adding a direction attribute

1091
00:59:40,650 --> 00:59:44,099
that allows the configuring

1092
00:59:42,089 --> 00:59:49,799
unidirectional and bi-directional a

1093
00:59:44,099 --> 00:59:51,690
services next one so would we have a set

1094
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,990
of open issues all of them are tracking

1095
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:57,720
into an individual github area and we

1096
00:59:54,990 --> 01:00:00,299
the intention the next steps are to

1097
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,290
harmonize particularly mothers with

1098
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:03,720
other model eyes

1099
01:00:01,290 --> 01:00:05,308
performers only to negatory Emma and we

1100
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,020
are thinking to a standard issue on

1101
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:08,760
information we got some feedbacks about

1102
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,710
people wants to know whether the assess

1103
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:13,380
link is an electrical or an optical

1104
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:15,299
interface or what is the performance

1105
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:17,640
that you want to monitor on this type of

1106
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:19,950
signal so we think the document is still

1107
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,598
open and requires more work before going

1108
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:23,640
to working group Luscombe so you get a

1109
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:24,869
lot of comments and not only have

1110
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:27,118
already a lot of open sure we are

1111
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:29,240
getting busy me feedback from the from

1112
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:33,000
the operators who are starting to use it

1113
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:35,549
that's one the next topic is a vision

1114
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:38,130
individual draft is about the ethernet

1115
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:41,130
that he topology we presented is

1116
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:43,349
drafting the last meeting and this draft

1117
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:45,930
is basically taking care to off two

1118
01:00:43,349 --> 01:00:47,819
items one item is to discover the assess

1119
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:50,009
links in case of Ethernet services and

1120
01:00:47,819 --> 01:00:51,930
the second item is to provide it a

1121
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:54,809
topology in case you want to set up

1122
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:57,540
eaten at LSP that's one so we didn't

1123
01:00:54,809 --> 01:01:00,000
make any major changes after that 105 we

1124
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:01,740
just follow aligned with the guyline

1125
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,410
model guidance in RFC eight four zero

1126
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:07,140
seven and we have a harmonized with the

1127
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:09,808
other er modules but no other changes

1128
01:01:07,140 --> 01:01:12,150
the only point this document has been

1129
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:15,420
used by the transporter VI design team

1130
01:01:12,150 --> 01:01:16,980
to mainly for discovery access links we

1131
01:01:15,420 --> 01:01:19,890
discourage them to discover some

1132
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,740
back-end which has been fixed yesterday

1133
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:24,250
or the day before

1134
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:26,200
today and we next one basically within

1135
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:28,440
this document is really for being

1136
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:33,850
adopted as a working group Documenta

1137
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:37,230
yeah thank you any comment feedback

1138
01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:37,230
especially under any comments

1139
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:46,390
no comments so so if then there are no

1140
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:49,660
comments I would like to test at the

1141
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:51,790
temperature so um you know for the next

1142
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:54,759
step you are asking for the WLAN right

1143
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:57,910
so uh I think actually this job had been

1144
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:59,619
presented for many times so at the first

1145
01:01:57,910 --> 01:02:06,368
question and how many people have

1146
01:01:59,619 --> 01:02:09,640
Rarity's jobs a very many people okay so

1147
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:14,080
how many people think that this draft is

1148
01:02:09,640 --> 01:02:17,500
ready for on top the adoption a pretty

1149
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:22,090
good number so how many people don't

1150
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:25,000
support tab the adoption okay none

1151
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:45,910
so our let's take to the list okay thank

1152
01:02:25,000 --> 01:03:02,080
you thank you okay good morning to

1153
01:02:45,910 --> 01:03:05,560
discovery Francisco okay so here we have

1154
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:11,670
to to drive to draft two percent one

1155
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:17,529
regarding the LMP that extended the lmp2

1156
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:20,170
dated a podium interfaces and then this

1157
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:24,670
is use to determine and exchange

1158
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:31,420
information between the DWDM transponder

1159
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:38,100
and the network rodman so

1160
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:43,510
this is extending the RFC 4209 and then

1161
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:45,100
supporting most or the the optical name

1162
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:46,810
in the optical impairment and the

1163
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:49,480
characteristic of the W interface

1164
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:53,890
defined by activity in the past has been

1165
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:56,950
done a liaison with that UT and then we

1166
01:03:53,890 --> 01:04:00,180
got some recommendation so we extend

1167
01:03:56,950 --> 01:04:03,009
what is the application identifier

1168
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:10,200
adding the output power current current

1169
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:13,660
input power and the input power range is

1170
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:17,080
this document is a working document

1171
01:04:13,660 --> 01:04:23,730
since March we didn't do any

1172
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:27,430
presentation at ATF 105 and there is a

1173
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:30,190
this presentation today the modification

1174
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:32,680
to the document actually are some

1175
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,840
cosmetics but the most part of the

1176
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:42,720
modification is related to the use cases

1177
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:42,720
that I really have to encourage to read

1178
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:53,190
this this draft color just DWDM and

1179
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:58,270
legacy interfaces so two point five 10

1180
01:04:53,190 --> 01:05:00,670
40 and 100 Iike does not support all the

1181
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:04,810
information related to the Flex patron

1182
01:05:00,670 --> 01:05:08,170
for example where those information are

1183
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:11,920
reporting in a individual contributor

1184
01:05:08,170 --> 01:05:16,300
draft that is a second flex interfacial

1185
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:21,720
MP now also considering the discussion

1186
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:25,990
is going is is in processing iqt about

1187
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:30,640
those new parameters we we might decide

1188
01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:33,029
that either - let's say close this draft

1189
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:36,940
and egg and then go in the rascal or

1190
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:40,330
keep this draft open include the

1191
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:43,150
information related to the sson and drop

1192
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:45,279
the individual contribution contributor

1193
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:48,940
draft that

1194
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:54,150
is I think is a decision that I would

1195
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:54,150
like to ask to their am working group

1196
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:05,200
I'm glad to see the slides here saying

1197
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:08,230
and our RMP is not for configuration we

1198
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:11,410
agree on that but what you added as a

1199
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:13,540
use case two new sections three points

1200
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:17,020
three for configuration and a straight

1201
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:20,740
point for for some kind of operation or

1202
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:26,470
maintenance so why we need to describe

1203
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:29,009
this use KCI RMP document let's say did

1204
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:33,160
they fought for the maintenance is

1205
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:37,450
actually helpful to share information

1206
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:39,819
between the roadman network and in case

1207
01:06:37,450 --> 01:06:41,230
the client network when the client

1208
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:43,720
network is reportedly debris or

1209
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,180
interfaces because those two may have

1210
01:06:43,720 --> 01:06:49,029
different controllers so share

1211
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:52,509
information may help the controller's to

1212
01:06:49,030 --> 01:07:00,730
understand what's going on between

1213
01:06:52,510 --> 01:07:04,599
neighbors is configuration again three

1214
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:08,530
point three the configuration is is not

1215
01:07:04,599 --> 01:07:11,109
to configure is LMP doesn't configure

1216
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:15,630
anything just a share information

1217
01:07:11,109 --> 01:07:22,390
between the two and this is a let's say

1218
01:07:15,630 --> 01:07:25,030
statement for the LNT definition okay

1219
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:26,970
then the other draft

1220
01:07:25,030 --> 01:07:31,000
[Music]

1221
01:07:26,970 --> 01:07:35,470
the error that we have represent today

1222
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:40,740
is again related today interface DWM

1223
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:40,740
interface parameters this draft is

1224
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:46,599
supporting the definition of the

1225
01:07:44,170 --> 01:07:50,920
determinant arrest parameters extending

1226
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:54,430
or following the other two draft which

1227
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:56,950
is w strong in impermeable addition info

1228
01:07:54,430 --> 01:08:02,910
and w son parent

1229
01:07:56,950 --> 01:08:07,500
validation and code plus RFC 6566 this

1230
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:12,460
model the Yamada's extended a ITF

1231
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:16,630
interface model and then is a parallel

1232
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:21,490
document to the optical implement

1233
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:26,050
topology and we're in this in this case

1234
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:28,779
in this draft we describe explicitly the

1235
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:35,110
interface parameters another question

1236
01:08:28,779 --> 01:08:37,450
here is whether to let's say match the

1237
01:08:35,109 --> 01:08:38,229
two documents they are they are working

1238
01:08:37,450 --> 01:08:40,660
in parallel

1239
01:08:38,229 --> 01:08:44,049
no and that they are complementary we

1240
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:48,189
decided to keep them as a parallel

1241
01:08:44,050 --> 01:08:55,029
project in the meeting we got in I think

1242
01:08:48,189 --> 01:09:01,019
in Prague but again the team is a leader

1243
01:08:55,029 --> 01:09:06,990
too to keep let's say any decision from

1244
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:06,990
the topology on Modest team into this

1245
01:09:07,620 --> 01:09:17,200
again no let's say no modification has

1246
01:09:12,370 --> 01:09:20,950
been done since last version just he

1247
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:32,559
cosmetics and let's say editorial

1248
01:09:20,950 --> 01:09:34,149
improvement today as I said we are

1249
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,490
working for the last call in sense that

1250
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:40,870
we are not asking the last call today

1251
01:09:36,490 --> 01:09:45,550
but we'll follow the impairment apology

1252
01:09:40,870 --> 01:09:51,279
young progress so when that will be the

1253
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:56,140
time we last telesco that's it again

1254
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:59,800
last but not least we need to keep in

1255
01:09:56,140 --> 01:10:03,510
line any modification than in I duty

1256
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:06,510
because this is a quite a hot topic

1257
01:10:03,510 --> 01:10:06,510
Thanks

1258
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:16,690
so any comments just my comment dealer

1259
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:19,420
speaking this this yang mod will also

1260
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:23,200
use layer 0 types or this doesn't it use

1261
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:25,540
it yeah that's a good question later so

1262
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:31,269
we need to understand whether the l0

1263
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:36,700
type will be referenced to from this

1264
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:40,240
document or we augment the ITF interface

1265
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:43,900
models I need to understand together how

1266
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:47,500
to to deal with this because either we

1267
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:52,509
referenced the l0 type but in this case

1268
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:56,740
we have to add some types related to the

1269
01:10:52,510 --> 01:11:00,040
today interface over there or and I

1270
01:10:56,740 --> 01:11:07,570
don't know we extend that we ought meant

1271
01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:10,450
the ITF interface type plus the DW we

1272
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:13,090
need to understand I think we should

1273
01:11:10,450 --> 01:11:15,220
discuss offline on this deter I believe

1274
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:18,030
I believe that you should also use layer

1275
01:11:15,220 --> 01:11:21,910
types for the interface yeah model

1276
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:25,030
preferably but that's a 0 type of

1277
01:11:21,910 --> 01:11:27,430
standard a ikf interface model it'll be

1278
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:29,590
K I don't think you need to know you can

1279
01:11:27,430 --> 01:11:32,320
extend the ATF interface model in your

1280
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:35,320
draft but you can you use Li as your

1281
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,660
type to reuse the same attributes and

1282
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:39,849
groupings between optical impairments

1283
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:41,380
and so you can have a grouping in the

1284
01:11:39,850 --> 01:11:43,360
layers you know types and then you can

1285
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:45,340
the optical power we can say we can use

1286
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:47,320
this grouping problem and a topology and

1287
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:50,350
your draft you can use the same group it

1288
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:52,960
augmented the interface ok as soon as we

1289
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:57,700
avoid any duplication so that's that

1290
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,680
yeah thank you there you can get a much

1291
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:01,809
better alignment among different

1292
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:04,780
yeah model so I mean this is this all

1293
01:12:01,810 --> 01:12:06,700
the the previous of the having the type

1294
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:09,880
definitions and groupings defined in the

1295
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:12,610
in a separate yang no no that's ok

1296
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,230
that's ok do you know on Kimberly I have

1297
01:12:12,610 --> 01:12:17,410
one question fatty to speak and so I

1298
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:17,888
regarding the LMP on draft I saw the

1299
01:12:17,410 --> 01:12:20,230
news

1300
01:12:17,889 --> 01:12:23,409
on the use case were taken from the

1301
01:12:20,230 --> 01:12:25,030
framework document right so so I assumed

1302
01:12:23,409 --> 01:12:27,909
that the use case in the framework

1303
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:31,000
document will be deleted deleted

1304
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:34,290
despite later to be honest I don't know

1305
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:38,500
what will be the fate of the framework

1306
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:42,760
so we got some comments or suggestions

1307
01:12:38,500 --> 01:12:45,850
no document yes I think I think that the

1308
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:51,850
frame would now is stuck a little for

1309
01:12:45,850 --> 01:12:53,590
the last call and the the author we

1310
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:56,170
discuss a little bit among the others

1311
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:58,150
and we don't know what what do what to

1312
01:12:56,170 --> 01:13:01,119
do and what it what would be the next

1313
01:12:58,150 --> 01:13:03,040
step ok maybe one approach either just

1314
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:04,839
leave the frame lock adds idiots and

1315
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:08,170
then we we can move over that we can

1316
01:13:04,840 --> 01:13:10,540
just focus on the solution channel the

1317
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:11,350
the very worst case could be that frame

1318
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:18,420
would be dropped

1319
01:13:11,350 --> 01:13:18,420
okay okay thank you okay next

1320
01:13:35,969 --> 01:13:40,440
monie monie

1321
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:43,179
yeah this is fun young from Hawaii and

1322
01:13:40,440 --> 01:13:45,428
Before we jump to the problems that much

1323
01:13:43,179 --> 01:13:48,639
of the flexi interface management I

1324
01:13:45,429 --> 01:13:51,100
would like to call you back to work that

1325
01:13:48,639 --> 01:13:56,760
have been done from last two years since

1326
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:56,760
I ETF 1998 please next step

1327
01:14:07,469 --> 01:14:16,269
okay and what is flexi and flexi provide

1328
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:20,440
variety of the Makah metrics that could

1329
01:14:16,269 --> 01:14:22,809
be more flexible than the existing is

1330
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:24,909
not fire rate and why we have this

1331
01:14:22,809 --> 01:14:29,400
suplex introduced to besides the

1332
01:14:24,909 --> 01:14:32,079
traditional is that three reasons first

1333
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:35,018
from the perspective of the after

1334
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:37,599
operators new services requires the

1335
01:14:35,019 --> 01:14:40,719
flexible bandwidth granularity not

1336
01:14:37,599 --> 01:14:44,380
element to the fixed by weight like 10 g

1337
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:47,679
or 40 or 100 etc and second there is a

1338
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:50,079
mismatch of the rate development between

1339
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:53,260
the is not and also the transport and

1340
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:57,340
transport network they say should be

1341
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:59,050
decoupled and maybe find a better way

1342
01:14:57,340 --> 01:15:01,989
for the it's not for the transport

1343
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:06,070
network to fully utilize the huge

1344
01:15:01,989 --> 01:15:08,768
bandwidth of the is not pot and last but

1345
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:11,980
not least on one hand they are decoupled

1346
01:15:08,769 --> 01:15:14,679
so the only I had on the other hand they

1347
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:22,329
must be a simple and efficient mapping

1348
01:15:14,679 --> 01:15:25,059
madam provided okay here are two figures

1349
01:15:22,329 --> 01:15:28,179
and I assume that everyone is familiar

1350
01:15:25,059 --> 01:15:31,360
with the first one above and the second

1351
01:15:28,179 --> 01:15:34,780
figure is the management architecture of

1352
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:36,848
the flexi interface we have two nodes

1353
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:39,909
here and the nose could be the routers

1354
01:15:36,849 --> 01:15:42,070
or the audio equipment and inside of the

1355
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:44,320
rule of the node there is a element

1356
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:47,590
management function and also the data

1357
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:49,360
plane and there are not conf not come

1358
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:53,530
for rest comfort sessions between the

1359
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:55,659
SDN controller and the EMF for the data

1360
01:15:53,530 --> 01:16:00,429
plane that we are so mated it should be

1361
01:15:55,659 --> 01:16:03,879
the flexi shame here the the llamado

1362
01:16:00,429 --> 01:16:07,300
i we talked about i want to clarify that

1363
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:11,170
it is the southbound yamamoto from the

1364
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:13,239
from the view of the controller here i'm

1365
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:15,639
not going to give you the every detail

1366
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:18,339
of the flexi because that is not a scope

1367
01:16:15,639 --> 01:16:19,030
of this presentation and i just i just

1368
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,010
want to give

1369
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:23,469
the names that there is a flexi fie and

1370
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:26,680
flexi group and also the flexi client

1371
01:16:23,470 --> 01:16:29,830
and also the more information defined in

1372
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:32,110
the flexi over had frame that is the

1373
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:34,750
calendar configuration a and B and also

1374
01:16:32,110 --> 01:16:36,280
the calendar configuration others and

1375
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:40,360
the requests and the club

1376
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:48,219
acknowledgement acknowledge of the

1377
01:16:40,360 --> 01:16:53,099
calendar switch okay and regarding to

1378
01:16:48,220 --> 01:16:56,620
regarding the problem statement the

1379
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:59,470
draft is aiming to provide to illustrate

1380
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:01,740
the fact that should be considered when

1381
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:05,020
you work on the more young modeling and

1382
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:07,780
also the the last line of each problem

1383
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:10,960
statement and for information the last

1384
01:17:07,780 --> 01:17:14,019
line of each of each problem statement

1385
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,840
in the blue font are the reference

1386
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:19,900
reference options that you may check in

1387
01:17:16,840 --> 01:17:22,180
advance because my colleague later will

1388
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:24,519
give you more and information in the

1389
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:27,160
following presentation so the first

1390
01:17:24,520 --> 01:17:29,170
problem statement is to provide a

1391
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:32,320
service function of the various metrics

1392
01:17:29,170 --> 01:17:35,380
that's the basic function of the Flex II

1393
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:37,509
and the second one is to meet the

1394
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:41,820
requirements of the of the transport

1395
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:44,710
network mapping scenarios the oh I have

1396
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:48,849
taxi implementation agreement defines

1397
01:17:44,710 --> 01:17:51,970
the three scenarios including the flexi

1398
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:55,060
am I unaware and flexi in termination of

1399
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:57,790
flexi aware scenarios the difference of

1400
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:02,020
these scenarios are the how to utilize

1401
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:05,200
the calendar slots so similar similarity

1402
01:18:02,020 --> 01:18:07,870
that similarly that how to manage anind

1403
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:14,530
in the young model should be the ones

1404
01:18:07,870 --> 01:18:18,309
should be the key question for us third

1405
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:21,570
one is how to config the flexi and the

1406
01:18:18,310 --> 01:18:25,030
of'em mentions the there is a static

1407
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:27,639
master slave and ostian ways to

1408
01:18:25,030 --> 01:18:30,940
configure the flex ii but there's no

1409
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:32,800
accurate definitions of them and also it

1410
01:18:30,940 --> 01:18:35,710
is it is sad there

1411
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,079
it is not limited to this rate as in to

1412
01:18:35,710 --> 01:18:47,440
these three configurations configuration

1413
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:54,219
ways so so I that it is so how to

1414
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:56,589
provide a generic llamado could be how

1415
01:18:54,219 --> 01:19:02,230
to provide a young generic young model

1416
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:05,199
easier to be extended to provide more to

1417
01:19:02,230 --> 01:19:08,829
provide further configuration way that

1418
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:12,820
is the the important or the key question

1419
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:16,869
that first here and the fourth problem

1420
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:21,070
statement is to as we introduced

1421
01:19:16,869 --> 01:19:23,348
previously that there is planter

1422
01:19:21,070 --> 01:19:26,018
calendar configuration a and B are also

1423
01:19:23,349 --> 01:19:30,760
the signaling of signal information

1424
01:19:26,019 --> 01:19:33,670
including the CCC RCA we think that we

1425
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,559
should ask that if they are the they are

1426
01:19:33,670 --> 01:19:38,499
built it should they belong to the work

1427
01:19:35,559 --> 01:19:42,519
of the date plan or are they necessarily

1428
01:19:38,499 --> 01:19:48,940
that should be exploded to the to the

1429
01:19:42,519 --> 01:19:52,539
controller said that's the question next

1430
01:19:48,940 --> 01:19:55,719
one is after we finishing the the

1431
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:58,900
management of of one flexi client it is

1432
01:19:55,719 --> 01:20:01,570
it it just intuitive way to think about

1433
01:19:58,900 --> 01:20:05,289
the second step to manage the multiple

1434
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:08,799
flexi client from the perspective of the

1435
01:20:05,289 --> 01:20:12,280
perspective view of the of the operators

1436
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:16,059
and the last way to support the

1437
01:20:12,280 --> 01:20:18,999
bi-directional traffic or not so far out

1438
01:20:16,059 --> 01:20:21,730
the of the flexi links are bad reaction

1439
01:20:18,999 --> 01:20:25,449
nodes and symmetric links that with the

1440
01:20:21,730 --> 01:20:29,199
same configuration on both end it seems

1441
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:33,759
that the unidirectional unidirectional

1442
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:37,509
parameters tx/rx is not so necessary and

1443
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:39,940
somehow is duplicated there so I think

1444
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:43,320
that's that's another important

1445
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:46,530
important aspect that we should consider

1446
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:51,030
and that's it that's all thank you

1447
01:20:46,530 --> 01:20:54,509
and I want and all the views and

1448
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:57,150
comments are welcome but I am I'd

1449
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:59,340
appreciate if you can propose we can

1450
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:02,610
hold this comments a little bit after

1451
01:20:59,340 --> 01:21:04,110
the following presentation because you

1452
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:06,870
may have a lot of questions to this

1453
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:09,059
discuss the details of the tracks II but

1454
01:21:06,870 --> 01:21:10,980
actually the following presentation does

1455
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:17,400
give you more details may you may find

1456
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:19,679
the answers to their so yeah so Chile

1457
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:22,610
are you okay to have more discussion

1458
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:27,600
after this Ray Upton yeah it's no

1459
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:30,440
problem they are and to discuss that

1460
01:21:27,600 --> 01:21:34,580
relate to the details of the Plaxico

1461
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:34,580
please go back to the previous slide

1462
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:41,670
okay this is about a negotiation

1463
01:21:37,830 --> 01:21:44,280
protocol for my understanding I think I

1464
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:47,520
wish to be careful not to event any new

1465
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:49,679
technology huh Francie it's because I

1466
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:52,620
think for this protocol I can't find any

1467
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:56,970
definition if flagship it plan so then

1468
01:21:52,620 --> 01:22:01,200
so then the soul for - turning if we

1469
01:21:56,970 --> 01:22:04,520
define faithful and protocol here it's

1470
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:08,190
about not mechanics yes I'm sorry okay

1471
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:10,640
yeah I think that yeah we have the we

1472
01:22:08,190 --> 01:22:13,469
have the the same set that date playing

1473
01:22:10,640 --> 01:22:17,220
the the elements from the date plan

1474
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:22,500
should not be included here so I'm sorry

1475
01:22:17,220 --> 01:22:24,900
I don't see the difference John from how

1476
01:22:22,500 --> 01:22:27,780
we actually are we don't introduce any

1477
01:22:24,900 --> 01:22:30,929
new particle here it's just really using

1478
01:22:27,780 --> 01:22:35,880
that data plan protocol defined by the

1479
01:22:30,930 --> 01:22:38,600
Oh F yeah I I think you make yeah maybe

1480
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:40,710
you misunderstood the the I I say it

1481
01:22:38,600 --> 01:22:42,780
negotiation portico there's an actually

1482
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:44,790
no protocol there yeah you can find the

1483
01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:55,190
details in the draft and also maybe in

1484
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:55,190
the clear yeah I'm a project apologize

1485
01:22:55,880 --> 01:23:02,989
Brooklyn I don't call on the next slide

1486
01:22:58,070 --> 01:23:06,009
actually on these ps5 so you've got a

1487
01:23:02,989 --> 01:23:08,869
comment there about using our our pcs to

1488
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,460
control adding or removing clients but I

1489
01:23:08,869 --> 01:23:12,170
would naturally expect that to be just

1490
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:16,790
regular configuration declarative

1491
01:23:12,170 --> 01:23:19,010
configuration so I I would think using

1492
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:20,929
our PCP is probably not right because

1493
01:23:19,010 --> 01:23:23,300
you want to like Reena if you reboot the

1494
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,679
router or the device you expect to come

1495
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,869
back with the same configuration before

1496
01:23:24,679 --> 01:23:28,960
whereas an RFP see would be naturally

1497
01:23:26,869 --> 01:23:33,290
more ephemeral and you lose that state

1498
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:37,690
yeah okay actually obviously this this

1499
01:23:33,290 --> 01:23:40,699
part is not included in the draft yeah

1500
01:23:37,690 --> 01:23:44,809
yeah I think that yeah I understand the

1501
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:55,159
question please you know speak by

1502
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:57,409
sequence not just a champion no no let's

1503
01:23:55,159 --> 01:24:00,790
stay understand the pros and the tongues

1504
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:05,780
and to clarify on his question in there

1505
01:24:00,790 --> 01:24:08,869
yeah yeah and actually it's not quite

1506
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:12,380
mature to bring the the RPC here because

1507
01:24:08,869 --> 01:24:14,239
it is not included in the draft yeah I

1508
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:17,929
think that's the next step that we will

1509
01:24:14,239 --> 01:24:20,089
consider to this part maybe we can

1510
01:24:17,929 --> 01:24:22,790
discuss of lying that more about this

1511
01:24:20,090 --> 01:24:26,530
part because actually we haven't looked

1512
01:24:22,790 --> 01:24:29,179
details of this power yeah thank you

1513
01:24:26,530 --> 01:24:32,239
yeah I have a quick question I just

1514
01:24:29,179 --> 01:24:34,659
noted that the OIF implementation

1515
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:37,218
agreement for flex étude it always

1516
01:24:34,659 --> 01:24:40,960
listed as an informative reference

1517
01:24:37,219 --> 01:24:40,960
shouldn't that be a normative reference

1518
01:24:50,110 --> 01:24:55,790
I'm not quite sure okay anyway I think

1519
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:57,679
we are running time so I would like to

1520
01:24:55,790 --> 01:25:00,159
count questions and we can have what

1521
01:24:57,679 --> 01:25:02,570
discussion after you know our

1522
01:25:00,159 --> 01:25:07,210
presentations okay no later

1523
01:25:02,570 --> 01:25:07,210
yeah young black state for you

1524
01:25:18,130 --> 01:25:23,659
well good morning everyone

1525
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:27,139
sister Yong Yong Yong from Maui oh so

1526
01:25:23,659 --> 01:25:33,110
Tauranga Hawaii Kona mobile and fiber

1527
01:25:27,139 --> 01:25:38,120
home this is a an updated version the

1528
01:25:33,110 --> 01:25:41,059
opportunity were document he's a how to

1529
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:44,750
configure the fleet group as a network

1530
01:25:41,060 --> 01:25:48,320
interface how to configure the files and

1531
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:52,670
the clients in this group policy group

1532
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:56,299
and how to Maps is a slow us

1533
01:25:52,670 --> 01:25:59,449
secondly we need to support the fletc

1534
01:25:56,300 --> 01:26:05,030
estate has a retrieval includes order

1535
01:25:59,449 --> 01:26:07,699
group files and declines the surveys to

1536
01:26:05,030 --> 01:26:12,290
put up the interface monument in both a

1537
01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:14,199
skiing and an amateur we lost lee but

1538
01:26:12,290 --> 01:26:18,290
it's not a risky important leader

1539
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:24,530
supporter backwards compatible with all

1540
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:28,010
versions over for the te this from a

1541
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:33,199
user point of view the first set of

1542
01:26:28,010 --> 01:26:40,670
lengths can be depicted as shown we have

1543
01:26:33,199 --> 01:26:43,129
a sum of little clans and the own new

1544
01:26:40,670 --> 01:26:45,530
one and another tool the same setup

1545
01:26:43,130 --> 01:26:48,860
whereas philosophy clans hug should be

1546
01:26:45,530 --> 01:26:53,090
used and that between that who knows a

1547
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:56,960
flirty group which are consider multiple

1548
01:26:53,090 --> 01:27:01,310
flexi files and the physician can map

1549
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:04,760
the slow first year's loss request from

1550
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:07,310
the clients into the actual files in the

1551
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:13,790
teaser for the group so it's quite a

1552
01:27:07,310 --> 01:27:15,880
simple diagram and we can also see sim

1553
01:27:13,790 --> 01:27:19,969
Francis figure first year slot is a

1554
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:23,080
basic entire unit for both our client

1555
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:23,080
and the file

1556
01:27:23,470 --> 01:27:29,950
since the abstraction of the first-year

1557
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,950
monument

1558
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:37,490
adapted from the last figure on the

1559
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:41,349
right we have a parent of felicity group

1560
01:27:37,490 --> 01:27:46,429
as an interface and we have a multiple

1561
01:27:41,350 --> 01:27:51,800
Felicia client as a sub interface and

1562
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:55,580
also a summer philosophize under yeah so

1563
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:58,060
both 30 group and definite even clients

1564
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:03,019
can be modeled as a networking interface

1565
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:07,340
and if 50 clients can be added

1566
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:09,340
durability or configured with some years

1567
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:13,480
laws so it's a very flexible

1568
01:28:09,340 --> 01:28:18,830
architecture as a way we can you use

1569
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:27,769
idea for interface defined in the FCAT 3

1570
01:28:18,830 --> 01:28:31,550
3 this diagram shows Yong Chi as you can

1571
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:34,430
see the updates are in the red color we

1572
01:28:31,550 --> 01:28:37,070
are the supporter of a Felicity content

1573
01:28:34,430 --> 01:28:40,660
negotiation protocol it's just their

1574
01:28:37,070 --> 01:28:48,370
flag we went along then we can use

1575
01:28:40,660 --> 01:28:55,610
overheard channel to support the dynamic

1576
01:28:48,370 --> 01:28:58,730
calendars region defined in the ORF this

1577
01:28:55,610 --> 01:29:02,240
area curve of the last term meeting in

1578
01:28:58,730 --> 01:29:05,480
the second group people think that

1579
01:29:02,240 --> 01:29:09,650
Sahara is the right place to start the

1580
01:29:05,480 --> 01:29:12,950
work on Philippi young but we need to

1581
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:16,940
check definitely work done in other

1582
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:19,280
skills such as the itu-t sg-15 we also

1583
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:23,210
need to look into other idea for young

1584
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:25,790
wanted to work funding we need to give

1585
01:29:23,210 --> 01:29:32,060
more analysis on the pros and cons of

1586
01:29:25,790 --> 01:29:33,989
the existing two young modules first I'd

1587
01:29:32,060 --> 01:29:37,530
like to introduce

1588
01:29:33,989 --> 01:29:40,950
in the other sto Fattah in July Oh F

1589
01:29:37,530 --> 01:29:43,679
published the fullest year total one

1590
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:47,160
moment efficient agreement which asks

1591
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:54,150
the support of a 50 G Phi and in

1592
01:29:47,160 --> 01:29:57,809
September Durand who a 14-hour sg-15 in

1593
01:29:54,150 --> 01:30:02,299
a meeting in Italy in cousin back as a

1594
01:29:57,810 --> 01:30:05,370
agreement with regard to she taught her

1595
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:09,440
8023 about first year and management

1596
01:30:05,370 --> 01:30:13,410
information from some of our flexi

1597
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:15,360
information need not to be a visible in

1598
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:18,269
the external management control

1599
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:24,660
interface such as of the SCC a and the c

1600
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:30,560
CB c CCR and the CA fun days yeah their

1601
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:33,059
peers and experts political

1602
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:36,180
configuration should be sorted to the

1603
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:43,020
same Vario that's the agreement in the

1604
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:48,719
adhered he and as a nursery is a similar

1605
01:30:43,020 --> 01:30:53,580
work in the other industries such as a

1606
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:56,100
in the ITF and I already defends a lack

1607
01:30:53,580 --> 01:31:01,980
interface that's actually a two to three

1608
01:30:56,100 --> 01:31:04,800
ad lack in our system to 24 we also

1609
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:08,820
found three created scissors of a young

1610
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:13,760
interface with a pong did evening's so

1611
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:18,900
you know you have 25 pages show up

1612
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:21,719
information ie tier for actual year and

1613
01:31:18,900 --> 01:31:26,790
the om configure all of them have a such

1614
01:31:21,719 --> 01:31:27,840
a fun drink young modules all modeled as

1615
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:36,660
a single interface

1616
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:38,850
I will not skip some yeah this why to

1617
01:31:36,660 --> 01:31:41,010
the reason why we augment has a fleshie

1618
01:31:38,850 --> 01:31:45,480
from the interface we because we have a

1619
01:31:41,010 --> 01:31:47,239
mini advantage we will use some styles

1620
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:53,129
to some

1621
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:59,190
attributes so the same young father name

1622
01:31:53,130 --> 01:32:01,650
in style address in the second is why we

1623
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:05,820
usually not a model

1624
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:08,070
Felicity instance first era isn't a

1625
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:11,580
number can be inferred from a file

1626
01:32:08,070 --> 01:32:16,049
number and the secondary instances just

1627
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:20,940
the internal since the usage it's not

1628
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:24,330
needed in the management plan finally

1629
01:32:20,940 --> 01:32:28,040
it's a certain the backwater comparable

1630
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:34,019
away see in Google stay in the module

1631
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:37,590
this is a CCC RC a since I think or

1632
01:32:34,020 --> 01:32:39,659
other representative in the acuity agree

1633
01:32:37,590 --> 01:32:45,350
so I work another to discuss it in more

1634
01:32:39,659 --> 01:32:48,719
detail about CC a and not C CB

1635
01:32:45,350 --> 01:32:52,489
actually yeah oh I introduced CCA and

1636
01:32:48,719 --> 01:32:58,110
necessity Magnuson just for the Hilly's

1637
01:32:52,489 --> 01:33:00,209
client configuration one one the Condor

1638
01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:05,580
is used for active and another used for

1639
01:33:00,210 --> 01:33:08,730
backup if we were right into the active

1640
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:10,889
then all the series will be impacted and

1641
01:33:08,730 --> 01:33:14,610
the loss of our traffic will be appear

1642
01:33:10,889 --> 01:33:20,790
cause of all these clients so that's the

1643
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:26,239
reason we cannot use the exposure both

1644
01:33:20,790 --> 01:33:26,239
CCA and CCB to the external interfaces

1645
01:33:26,570 --> 01:33:35,190
it's a bad retinal I think we have an

1646
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:39,810
agreement there how to models as not

1647
01:33:35,190 --> 01:33:42,710
least we use them by as a container for

1648
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:46,500
the throttle East it's more compatible

1649
01:33:42,710 --> 01:33:50,010
it's easier to fund unused or available

1650
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:53,480
slots in a particular app I compared

1651
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:53,480
with the other two options

1652
01:33:54,920 --> 01:34:03,100
family we compare that with two

1653
01:33:59,150 --> 01:34:06,049
different modules the first column is a

1654
01:34:03,100 --> 01:34:08,929
job that young and that's a second

1655
01:34:06,050 --> 01:34:12,260
village of the sha'ban as you can see as

1656
01:34:08,929 --> 01:34:17,179
there are plenty our differences and we

1657
01:34:12,260 --> 01:34:22,390
believe I don't want to cover the

1658
01:34:17,179 --> 01:34:22,390
details one by one but a people can see

1659
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:29,929
there are lots of abstractions in the

1660
01:34:26,510 --> 01:34:34,670
first job but all the details are

1661
01:34:29,929 --> 01:34:37,820
supposedly in the second one but we can

1662
01:34:34,670 --> 01:34:40,370
fund them quite a few our advantage

1663
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:53,719
it was easier details are shown to the

1664
01:34:40,370 --> 01:34:59,150
manager or the operators so the next

1665
01:34:53,719 --> 01:35:02,690
page is some other differences the first

1666
01:34:59,150 --> 01:35:06,199
job is a fourth year in hierarchy

1667
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:10,190
flatten the simple the second wise 70s

1668
01:35:06,199 --> 01:35:13,639
our Chi relative in the complex the

1669
01:35:10,190 --> 01:35:16,460
first kids are only modern service laws

1670
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,890
we don't need adapt and ways to be

1671
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:21,980
provided for the second boosts are

1672
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:25,780
provided but how to provide these

1673
01:35:21,980 --> 01:35:28,610
pathways varios consistently across

1674
01:35:25,780 --> 01:35:32,840
every application that will be a

1675
01:35:28,610 --> 01:35:35,480
challenge since if we don't agree we are

1676
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:39,920
actually bandwidth first loss that's a

1677
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:43,009
problem under there that is a only local

1678
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:47,690
parameter tok included without any

1679
01:35:43,010 --> 01:35:50,960
remote have Phi's be configured for the

1680
01:35:47,690 --> 01:35:59,190
second both other things are needed so

1681
01:35:50,960 --> 01:36:03,700
it's a more complex the first support

1682
01:35:59,190 --> 01:36:07,419
status retrieval well there is no such

1683
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:10,630
support in second so I have one quick

1684
01:36:07,420 --> 01:36:11,680
comment so I think this comparison table

1685
01:36:10,630 --> 01:36:13,300
it's really very good

1686
01:36:11,680 --> 01:36:15,610
it seems that you did a very good job

1687
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:18,730
but what are you in common for this two

1688
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:20,740
jobs nothing in common or so huge the

1689
01:36:18,730 --> 01:36:24,280
difference between these two jobs right

1690
01:36:20,740 --> 01:36:28,719
what adds conclusion yeah yeah it's a

1691
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:32,380
target is money to the fatigue rules as

1692
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:37,720
its assumed but a pathology the further

1693
01:36:32,380 --> 01:36:40,900
a lot okay okay thank you yes but the

1694
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:43,660
goal is a reaching a consensus so just

1695
01:36:40,900 --> 01:36:47,309
focusing on these thing is much better

1696
01:36:43,660 --> 01:36:51,190
than the other is is not helping a tutu

1697
01:36:47,310 --> 01:36:55,360
to put to progress the work I would

1698
01:36:51,190 --> 01:36:59,200
rather focus on synergies and to move on

1699
01:36:55,360 --> 01:37:02,160
and not rather on differences and

1700
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:06,550
comment and another thing that this is

1701
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:09,519
III see enough meat in each row of the

1702
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:13,980
table to have a deeper discussion on the

1703
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:17,080
mailing list I I would suggest not to be

1704
01:37:13,980 --> 01:37:22,900
silent between one meeting and the other

1705
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:27,100
and then present 25 slides of of content

1706
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:29,349
and minutes but rather take the three

1707
01:37:27,100 --> 01:37:32,560
months between one meeting and the other

1708
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:35,800
attitude to better discuss on the mini

1709
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:38,440
list each each topic here that could

1710
01:37:35,800 --> 01:37:42,850
help a lot at the next meeting it

1711
01:37:38,440 --> 01:37:46,210
whether to work on on commonalities

1712
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:50,110
rather than differences Thank You Tanya

1713
01:37:46,210 --> 01:37:55,120
yeah moment I I see it very very

1714
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:57,639
difficult to to adopt one one draft or

1715
01:37:55,120 --> 01:38:02,099
the other just saying that is his work

1716
01:37:57,640 --> 01:38:03,489
is better this work is is worse okay

1717
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:07,150
thank you

1718
01:38:03,489 --> 01:38:11,559
actually we do sit together to have a

1719
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:14,110
conversation with with other authors but

1720
01:38:11,560 --> 01:38:16,840
ever since we have very different

1721
01:38:14,110 --> 01:38:18,820
opinions on how to progresses this work

1722
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:22,420
that's the reason we brought all that

1723
01:38:18,820 --> 01:38:27,040
different opinions on the table so that

1724
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:28,780
our every day we can have a yeah I'm

1725
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,000
saying it's the wrong table the right

1726
01:38:28,780 --> 01:38:35,440
table is the mailing list is not the ten

1727
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,960
mean it's at at the at the meeting yeah

1728
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:41,259
that's a good listener we will discuss

1729
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:45,760
more on the details on the Middle East

1730
01:38:41,260 --> 01:38:50,230
thank you okay okay if if you wanted to

1731
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:52,570
arrange periodical periodical meetings

1732
01:38:50,230 --> 01:38:54,400
like we are doing for microwave like we

1733
01:38:52,570 --> 01:38:56,769
are doing it for optical impairments

1734
01:38:54,400 --> 01:39:02,320
just ask us and we will be happy to

1735
01:38:56,770 --> 01:39:05,969
arrange them for you thanks okay Gregory

1736
01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:09,989
city you mentioned that there are some

1737
01:39:05,969 --> 01:39:19,570
mechanisms in your model that support

1738
01:39:09,989 --> 01:39:22,299
dynamic SWAT switching Oh F mmm we just

1739
01:39:19,570 --> 01:39:24,690
are in the world and what what's the

1740
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:28,320
scope of this switching is a switching

1741
01:39:24,690 --> 01:39:30,400
end-to-end or switching within an link

1742
01:39:28,320 --> 01:39:35,679
because I don't understand what's the

1743
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:38,620
solution within the link from one node

1744
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:42,520
to another it's a link but it's also a

1745
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:44,710
shinto shin it's the same no no okay

1746
01:39:42,520 --> 01:39:48,040
switching you mean the switching as an

1747
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:51,060
update or switching that you're do

1748
01:39:48,040 --> 01:39:57,780
switching from one thing to another

1749
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:57,780
no it's hardly a switching from one

1750
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:03,160
current a computation to another kind of

1751
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:09,370
communication I think but it's not

1752
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:12,849
switching its its reconfiguration maybe

1753
01:40:09,370 --> 01:40:14,460
a someone new concept but okay measure

1754
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:15,930
the new concept there is a

1755
01:40:14,460 --> 01:40:18,000
configuration and there is a switching

1756
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:20,000
and we understand certain things with

1757
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:23,489
that switching you do

1758
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:25,500
switching quake in TDM on the box right

1759
01:40:23,489 --> 01:40:27,589
and that's the switching you do

1760
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:31,469
switching between different links and

1761
01:40:27,590 --> 01:40:34,620
itu told us in their liaison not to do

1762
01:40:31,469 --> 01:40:36,710
switching ok so if you mean it by

1763
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:40,260
configuration then code configuration

1764
01:40:36,710 --> 01:40:45,360
dynamic configuration so but you say

1765
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:48,030
that you want to use some channel to

1766
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:51,950
communicate switching to me it sounds

1767
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:51,950
like you do switching between links

1768
01:40:51,980 --> 01:41:06,450
switching is a concept in there oh I F

1769
01:40:57,020 --> 01:41:11,730
no we thing no Candace recently no no of

1770
01:41:06,450 --> 01:41:14,340
line no problem we can better console so

1771
01:41:11,730 --> 01:41:17,669
you're aware of ITU lays and not to do

1772
01:41:14,340 --> 01:41:22,260
switching yeah so I know what I mean

1773
01:41:17,670 --> 01:41:25,110
I Tod they told everybody don't do

1774
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:26,550
switching between links okay correct I

1775
01:41:25,110 --> 01:41:28,830
think thank thank you very much I think

1776
01:41:26,550 --> 01:41:33,560
we got your points we can discussion on

1777
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:33,559
the list okay for the nectar and chili

1778
01:41:46,460 --> 01:41:53,610
hi everyone this is chilly okay

1779
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:58,009
I also same topic about the flesh ye

1780
01:41:53,610 --> 01:42:02,009
yeah and some analysis okay I'm sorry

1781
01:41:58,010 --> 01:42:03,870
okay okay some updates okay and the

1782
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:04,409
comments received I will try to make

1783
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:08,010
this brief

1784
01:42:04,409 --> 01:42:10,559
so still time and updates currently I

1785
01:42:08,010 --> 01:42:13,260
sink away there's some update that's

1786
01:42:10,560 --> 01:42:15,719
what people are using at the fight so we

1787
01:42:13,260 --> 01:42:18,960
just at this this is the operating

1788
01:42:15,719 --> 01:42:21,690
current a draft and there's an follow

1789
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:24,090
the company in traffic analysis draft

1790
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:27,599
laser was updated according the way to

1791
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:30,810
happiness landing the modeling job it's

1792
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:34,380
just to help understand it and the next

1793
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:36,239
we also received some comments the food

1794
01:42:34,380 --> 01:42:39,290
that is a battle weather for us in

1795
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:42,000
instance and should be modeled or not

1796
01:42:39,290 --> 01:42:46,080
what you think we did think about this

1797
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:48,239
and which I will give you some case in

1798
01:42:46,080 --> 01:42:50,940
point it's just for discussing the first

1799
01:42:48,239 --> 01:42:54,239
one I said okay look at the flashy

1800
01:42:50,940 --> 01:42:56,190
overhaul its replace the fine number

1801
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:58,379
with the instance number right now so

1802
01:42:56,190 --> 01:42:59,309
this is the first time it is another

1803
01:42:58,380 --> 01:43:02,340
second one okay

1804
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:04,920
in a duty document it's about a

1805
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:07,199
comparison for exactly the value and I

1806
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:10,050
expected very okay that's a look at has

1807
01:43:07,199 --> 01:43:12,030
a writer finger it's another comparison

1808
01:43:10,050 --> 01:43:14,489
it's a bass sound for a see incidents

1809
01:43:12,030 --> 01:43:19,019
level so we think we should I learn with

1810
01:43:14,489 --> 01:43:21,360
them this is the case under the next we

1811
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:24,300
gave some analysis that maybe sometime

1812
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:29,070
you don't consider for that incident may

1813
01:43:24,300 --> 01:43:30,960
pour in some trouble okay okay for

1814
01:43:29,070 --> 01:43:33,540
example in static a configuration mode

1815
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:38,820
if one of the flooding is okay there may

1816
01:43:33,540 --> 01:43:40,800
be multiple lying in one device if one

1817
01:43:38,820 --> 01:43:43,320
of the flashy instance of fails to be in

1818
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,900
to be interviewed correctly it will be

1819
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:47,969
replaced with represented signal is

1820
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:51,269
there were no more signal if the

1821
01:43:47,969 --> 01:43:54,330
equipment is configured to only verify

1822
01:43:51,270 --> 01:43:55,219
at a fair level sometime they cannot be

1823
01:43:54,330 --> 01:43:58,559
typed

1824
01:43:55,219 --> 01:44:01,110
fought over that instant it's not about

1825
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:03,480
the extension twirl the appliance it's

1826
01:44:01,110 --> 01:44:05,309
also try to verify whether it's correct

1827
01:44:03,480 --> 01:44:08,209
or whether the configuration is a

1828
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:13,469
correct from the sauce to a setting and

1829
01:44:08,210 --> 01:44:15,420
the next another case in point a server

1830
01:44:13,469 --> 01:44:19,170
that I have available to us it's a used

1831
01:44:15,420 --> 01:44:22,350
especially for SEO where trans transport

1832
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:25,260
mode here we gave one example for

1833
01:44:22,350 --> 01:44:27,869
example 150 Giga commanded the follow is

1834
01:44:25,260 --> 01:44:33,480
it transmitted over one or two upon the

1835
01:44:27,869 --> 01:44:35,969
ethernet 205 with six available five

1836
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:38,459
gigs loss in the first of all se

1837
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:40,230
incidence and the fall in the sector

1838
01:44:38,460 --> 01:44:45,290
philosophy incidence on purpose

1839
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:48,030
so I think just based on this use case

1840
01:44:45,290 --> 01:44:50,100
for the model is to be able to such a

1841
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:54,690
distribute available slots over

1842
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:57,060
different e instance and this is okay

1843
01:44:54,690 --> 01:44:59,428
the next one is another comment we

1844
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:03,800
received whether the tab calendar

1845
01:44:59,429 --> 01:45:07,619
configuration A or B is needed an answer

1846
01:45:03,800 --> 01:45:10,739
from mater with a better to write it

1847
01:45:07,619 --> 01:45:12,929
because that way can't per call the

1848
01:45:10,739 --> 01:45:15,690
possibility with the house of device can

1849
01:45:12,929 --> 01:45:18,000
be implemented sometimes you just use

1850
01:45:15,690 --> 01:45:21,839
some before configuration sometimes

1851
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:23,940
there may be some flexibility so that's

1852
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:27,540
the also give an example that is a

1853
01:45:23,940 --> 01:45:30,839
static a configuration in this case okay

1854
01:45:27,540 --> 01:45:33,690
in for the Southside you use a but you

1855
01:45:30,840 --> 01:45:38,489
for the same side okay it's also

1856
01:45:33,690 --> 01:45:43,290
configure okay it a bit then there's

1857
01:45:38,489 --> 01:45:45,959
some inconsistency exist so it's better

1858
01:45:43,290 --> 01:45:47,340
just based on this the Conqueror it's a

1859
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:50,880
bite to config

1860
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:52,880
the type of calendar at both ends so

1861
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:56,300
just we kind of percolate any

1862
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:58,889
possibility about how the device can be

1863
01:45:56,300 --> 01:46:01,350
implemented we should avoid having the

1864
01:45:58,889 --> 01:46:03,270
specific model is for the model a single

1865
01:46:01,350 --> 01:46:06,900
we should a cover and must say the

1866
01:46:03,270 --> 01:46:08,369
possible case and the next okay that's

1867
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:10,688
all

1868
01:46:08,369 --> 01:46:12,608
I'm speaking I would like to clarify

1869
01:46:10,689 --> 01:46:14,679
that the 8023 defines the interface

1870
01:46:12,609 --> 01:46:17,499
between the atomic function and the EMF

1871
01:46:14,679 --> 01:46:20,439
yeah yeah modal is the interface on top

1872
01:46:17,499 --> 01:46:22,209
of the EMF and also in the attitude list

1873
01:46:20,439 --> 01:46:23,889
of 40 we have clarified that though if

1874
01:46:22,209 --> 01:46:26,079
something is available as an MI doesn't

1875
01:46:23,889 --> 01:46:28,869
need to be exposed in the young model

1876
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:31,509
okay we are also working question 14 to

1877
01:46:28,869 --> 01:46:33,339
try to avoid to expose every bits on the

1878
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:35,469
wire as an attribute in a young model

1879
01:46:33,339 --> 01:46:38,979
but we suppose only what needs to be

1880
01:46:35,469 --> 01:46:41,619
configured managed and and reported okay

1881
01:46:38,979 --> 01:46:43,510
so my answer about this I said we should

1882
01:46:41,619 --> 01:46:56,978
give someone elseís about a use case to

1883
01:46:43,510 --> 01:47:02,979
say I have a problem with this logic you

1884
01:46:56,979 --> 01:47:07,419
are you couldn't wrong Oh F CC that the

1885
01:47:02,979 --> 01:47:12,989
a is always active a Conda P it's never

1886
01:47:07,419 --> 01:47:16,419
used how to probability that B is the

1887
01:47:12,989 --> 01:47:18,909
anything with they are not used at all

1888
01:47:16,419 --> 01:47:21,669
okay why we need to configure the

1889
01:47:18,909 --> 01:47:22,688
transmitter this our communication to

1890
01:47:21,669 --> 01:47:25,510
the other side

1891
01:47:22,689 --> 01:47:28,089
I also theory in the proteins are

1892
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:31,539
radical explanation we should not

1893
01:47:28,089 --> 01:47:35,829
approach any kind of a possibility some

1894
01:47:31,539 --> 01:47:38,018
time when winner is true to implement to

1895
01:47:35,829 --> 01:47:40,478
the device in this way in that if for

1896
01:47:38,019 --> 01:47:42,760
the way sometimes okay another vendor is

1897
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:47,109
true to the implementation another way

1898
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:50,619
we should avoid so you're not restricted

1899
01:47:47,109 --> 01:47:53,289
to one specific case we should not right

1900
01:47:50,619 --> 01:47:57,188
okay so you are implying some

1901
01:47:53,289 --> 01:48:02,079
proprietary implementation not a RF

1902
01:47:57,189 --> 01:48:05,889
dependent behavior right you're quoting

1903
01:48:02,079 --> 01:48:09,039
something so in the aware what about

1904
01:48:05,889 --> 01:48:12,249
some other use cases maybe you can bring

1905
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:18,818
it out that's we can we can see whether

1906
01:48:12,249 --> 01:48:20,499
a solution or any problems here right we

1907
01:48:18,819 --> 01:48:22,360
are talking about the Oh absence here

1908
01:48:20,499 --> 01:48:33,820
I already give like it's pregnancy twice

1909
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:36,820
sorry this from Hawaii I have a

1910
01:48:33,820 --> 01:48:39,130
different sort here also regard to the

1911
01:48:36,820 --> 01:48:41,228
calendar configuration a and B if you

1912
01:48:39,130 --> 01:48:43,920
are going to define this attribute and

1913
01:48:41,229 --> 01:48:46,719
then when you when you assign the

1914
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:50,530
parameters of this attribute to the to

1915
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:54,190
the to the device and so the so the the

1916
01:48:50,530 --> 01:48:58,030
running calendar of the Flexi on the

1917
01:48:54,190 --> 01:49:02,289
device should be disrupt because you are

1918
01:48:58,030 --> 01:49:06,280
reading the new parameters there so I

1919
01:49:02,289 --> 01:49:08,018
think that that is how to do there is

1920
01:49:06,280 --> 01:49:10,090
the interrupter of the service of the

1921
01:49:08,019 --> 01:49:11,969
Flexi service so have you I will

1922
01:49:10,090 --> 01:49:15,340
consider it there is any other way that

1923
01:49:11,969 --> 01:49:17,320
you make because the calendar a and B a

1924
01:49:15,340 --> 01:49:20,650
current configuration and be defined in

1925
01:49:17,320 --> 01:49:23,469
the Oh F that is the main the main

1926
01:49:20,650 --> 01:49:25,299
target of this two because there are two

1927
01:49:23,469 --> 01:49:28,479
calendars why there are two calendars

1928
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:30,699
because one is always only one is active

1929
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,949
another one is the backup sitting it's

1930
01:49:30,699 --> 01:49:35,280
like a backup then you have two

1931
01:49:32,949 --> 01:49:39,159
calendars that if you are going to

1932
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:41,829
resize or add the slots of the any

1933
01:49:39,159 --> 01:49:44,289
modification of the client that you can

1934
01:49:41,829 --> 01:49:47,320
use the different calendar to switch

1935
01:49:44,289 --> 01:49:50,469
over between them and to have us richly

1936
01:49:47,320 --> 01:49:53,558
richly switch over but you are going to

1937
01:49:50,469 --> 01:49:55,889
use the use the parameters there that

1938
01:49:53,559 --> 01:50:00,340
you always there is a disrupt this

1939
01:49:55,889 --> 01:50:04,510
disrupt of the service that so I think

1940
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:07,860
it's not the main the initial go to

1941
01:50:04,510 --> 01:50:11,530
define this too because you always

1942
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:13,960
disrupted the service so I mean do you

1943
01:50:11,530 --> 01:50:18,340
have any consider that if there is any

1944
01:50:13,960 --> 01:50:22,599
better way or the other way like to to

1945
01:50:18,340 --> 01:50:24,090
to us yeah tomorrow this yeah okay for

1946
01:50:22,599 --> 01:50:26,499
this side is to talk about is a

1947
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:28,780
consistency between the source and I

1948
01:50:26,499 --> 01:50:30,610
think I did not talk about that okay

1949
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:34,380
listen to you doesn't mention this is

1950
01:50:30,610 --> 01:50:36,460
okay for the unset wheel prize

1951
01:50:34,380 --> 01:50:39,610
I'll sing with I've already considered

1952
01:50:36,460 --> 01:50:41,800
about them maybe we could communicate a

1953
01:50:39,610 --> 01:50:43,630
lot about this yeah there could be

1954
01:50:41,800 --> 01:50:46,950
something that you think about it I

1955
01:50:43,630 --> 01:50:46,950
think because we don't have enough

1956
01:50:53,670 --> 01:50:59,260
questions just Rob Francisco so my

1957
01:50:57,910 --> 01:51:01,300
understanding is there's two competing

1958
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:04,600
flexi models here there's discussions to

1959
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:06,370
which to go with now I would suggest and

1960
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:14,190
bear in mind I'd see the Cisco or from

1961
01:51:06,370 --> 01:51:16,599
one of those drivers yeah yes formats so

1962
01:51:14,190 --> 01:51:18,370
but what I would say is I think rather

1963
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:20,020
than concentrate on these details and

1964
01:51:18,370 --> 01:51:21,730
you can put if you there's some things

1965
01:51:20,020 --> 01:51:23,470
that are going to be optional or could

1966
01:51:21,730 --> 01:51:25,299
be implemented you can use yang's

1967
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:27,400
features to allow those things to be

1968
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:29,320
optionally configured a separate

1969
01:51:27,400 --> 01:51:30,849
question as to whether or not these

1970
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:32,410
things should be exposed or not imagine

1971
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:33,760
model that's a different question but

1972
01:51:32,410 --> 01:51:34,330
yeah if some people want them and some

1973
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,420
people don't

1974
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:39,309
I think user features my suggestion from

1975
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:40,630
a young doctor's perspective is to try

1976
01:51:39,310 --> 01:51:42,700
and get commonalities to look at the

1977
01:51:40,630 --> 01:51:44,260
shape of the models and try and get

1978
01:51:42,700 --> 01:51:46,330
alignment on the fundamental shapes

1979
01:51:44,260 --> 01:51:48,040
because really about what things you

1980
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:50,050
represent as interfaces or what

1981
01:51:48,040 --> 01:51:52,390
configuration you take out and not put

1982
01:51:50,050 --> 01:51:54,670
into config into interfaces and my

1983
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:57,190
understanding is that actually with

1984
01:51:54,670 --> 01:51:58,330
flexi the the issues about when you

1985
01:51:57,190 --> 01:52:01,120
create those interface and whether they

1986
01:51:58,330 --> 01:52:02,830
get set up that maybe if you put one of

1987
01:52:01,120 --> 01:52:06,070
the interfaces you get like a catch-22

1988
01:52:02,830 --> 01:52:07,870
of of that sort of issue so it may be

1989
01:52:06,070 --> 01:52:10,900
that in some cases that having it

1990
01:52:07,870 --> 01:52:12,580
outside will fit better possibly but I

1991
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:15,639
think that I would try and look at shape

1992
01:52:12,580 --> 01:52:18,010
and get agreement those yeah okay it's

1993
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:22,060
not just a young daughter suggestion is

1994
01:52:18,010 --> 01:52:25,120
a common sensor please start building

1995
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:27,430
something together guys not keep on

1996
01:52:25,120 --> 01:52:29,470
saying this thing is my is bad mine is

1997
01:52:27,430 --> 01:52:31,000
better yours is worse because otherwise

1998
01:52:29,470 --> 01:52:34,780
we're not getting anywhere

1999
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:38,410
and start away that the major issues

2000
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:40,150
because to me the calendar a calendar B

2001
01:52:38,410 --> 01:52:42,910
yes it's an issue that is not the

2002
01:52:40,150 --> 01:52:44,889
biggest one I would say that the

2003
01:52:42,910 --> 01:52:47,200
switching part of the configuration

2004
01:52:44,890 --> 01:52:49,740
that's that's that that's the starting

2005
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,740
point in my

2006
01:52:50,170 --> 01:52:53,480
dammit

2007
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:54,679
so what then Nellie what do you say at a

2008
01:52:53,480 --> 01:53:00,099
shaker you know David to hell more

2009
01:52:54,679 --> 01:53:00,100
questions no no okay

2010
01:53:01,130 --> 01:53:05,140
go ahead I'm sorry I interrupted

2011
01:53:05,469 --> 01:53:09,290
he's awake though which was more than

2012
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:11,469
and what could be said about 10 minutes

2013
01:53:09,290 --> 01:53:11,469
ago

2014
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:16,250
know what I was gonna suggest regarding

2015
01:53:14,150 --> 01:53:17,750
what should be shouldn't be exposed have

2016
01:53:16,250 --> 01:53:19,449
we reached out to the OIF at all I'm

2017
01:53:17,750 --> 01:53:23,330
sure they would have an opinion on this

2018
01:53:19,449 --> 01:53:26,178
right so like why not put something down

2019
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:27,860
on paper as a proposal and go send it

2020
01:53:26,179 --> 01:53:30,140
over to them and find out what they

2021
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:32,210
think about this yeah this is a possible

2022
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:34,790
approach and also anyway I think

2023
01:53:32,210 --> 01:53:37,370
actually on if the author's all of you

2024
01:53:34,790 --> 01:53:40,340
would like to progress this work you

2025
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:42,170
have to sit together to look together to

2026
01:53:40,340 --> 01:53:44,870
have better understanding on each

2027
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:47,390
other's you know our solutions and you

2028
01:53:44,870 --> 01:53:49,849
have to converge anyway right if you

2029
01:53:47,390 --> 01:53:51,739
cannot convince to also see each other

2030
01:53:49,850 --> 01:53:53,840
how you can convince the working group

2031
01:53:51,739 --> 01:54:10,699
right so anyway you should work together

2032
01:53:53,840 --> 01:54:14,179
first yeah okay thank you hello everyone

2033
01:54:10,699 --> 01:54:17,120
this is a homie okay and okay this this

2034
01:54:14,179 --> 01:54:22,219
presentation has 5 pages I think you

2035
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:26,929
have only three minutes ok ok next so ok

2036
01:54:22,219 --> 01:54:28,580
this is a new data moto proposed to do

2037
01:54:26,929 --> 01:54:35,239
the client signal performance monitoring

2038
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:39,650
and this is a based on based on the

2039
01:54:35,239 --> 01:54:42,500
service model we have been we have been

2040
01:54:39,650 --> 01:54:44,480
promoted in this working group and we

2041
01:54:42,500 --> 01:54:47,260
have specified two different kind of

2042
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:50,559
service one is Ethernet and the other is

2043
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:55,030
transparent client signal over the

2044
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:55,030
Assyrian Paris tunnels so

2045
01:54:56,780 --> 01:55:02,719
drafter is gone here to indicate where

2046
01:55:00,530 --> 01:55:04,579
the performance monitoring is set and

2047
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:06,619
where the performance monitoring need to

2048
01:55:04,579 --> 01:55:11,119
be interacted with each other so

2049
01:55:06,619 --> 01:55:13,429
basically this is kind of for operation

2050
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:16,039
need and the operator need to understand

2051
01:55:13,429 --> 01:55:19,699
the what is what has been after what has

2052
01:55:16,039 --> 01:55:22,610
been configured to the network what is

2053
01:55:19,699 --> 01:55:27,710
the performance and to decide the future

2054
01:55:22,610 --> 01:55:30,530
actions so the model would be related

2055
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:33,320
with a few other models because besides

2056
01:55:30,530 --> 01:55:35,809
the performance monitoring the OEM alarm

2057
01:55:33,320 --> 01:55:38,869
and their related concept and we will

2058
01:55:35,809 --> 01:55:42,110
reference to these documents this are

2059
01:55:38,869 --> 01:55:44,299
RFC's and regarding the client service

2060
01:55:42,110 --> 01:55:47,960
we are generating dedicated performance

2061
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:50,300
monitoring models for both Ethernet

2062
01:55:47,960 --> 01:55:53,329
service and the transparent clients

2063
01:55:50,300 --> 01:55:56,570
tourism we have been also aware of other

2064
01:55:53,329 --> 01:55:59,000
performance monitoring models in this

2065
01:55:56,570 --> 01:56:03,259
working group focus on being and the

2066
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:05,869
tunnel but not on service and the other

2067
01:56:03,260 --> 01:56:08,599
model is from on bass which are service

2068
01:56:05,869 --> 01:56:10,429
but for VPN service so we had we again

2069
01:56:08,599 --> 01:56:15,219
though we focus on the performance for

2070
01:56:10,429 --> 01:56:19,070
these two kind of services specified and

2071
01:56:15,219 --> 01:56:21,079
we currently only have one parameters

2072
01:56:19,070 --> 01:56:23,719
for performance monitoring that is

2073
01:56:21,079 --> 01:56:26,719
latency and we use that as an example to

2074
01:56:23,719 --> 01:56:29,090
kick off the work and what has been our

2075
01:56:26,719 --> 01:56:31,429
plan included a bit error rate packet

2076
01:56:29,090 --> 01:56:34,639
loss jitter and so on so first every

2077
01:56:31,429 --> 01:56:38,270
scene has a specific definition and has

2078
01:56:34,639 --> 01:56:40,789
a data plane reference to look into we

2079
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:43,610
would look into our future follow-up so

2080
01:56:40,789 --> 01:56:48,170
we don't have to have the plan to define

2081
01:56:43,610 --> 01:56:49,808
any new parameters so far so to move

2082
01:56:48,170 --> 01:56:52,099
forward I think we need to do a few

2083
01:56:49,809 --> 01:56:54,050
actions including we confirm the

2084
01:56:52,099 --> 01:56:56,750
usefulness of the work in the working

2085
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:59,059
group and we agree on the scope

2086
01:56:56,750 --> 01:57:01,190
especially we need to think about

2087
01:56:59,059 --> 01:57:03,710
whether it's a technology space vehicle

2088
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:05,539
or generic we have already received some

2089
01:57:03,710 --> 01:57:07,250
feedback from the t's working group and

2090
01:57:05,539 --> 01:57:08,469
we will talk with other related

2091
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:10,290
documents

2092
01:57:08,470 --> 01:57:13,060
the authors of other related documents

2093
01:57:10,290 --> 01:57:15,550
so that that means we also need to agree

2094
01:57:13,060 --> 01:57:17,380
on the model relationship so and then

2095
01:57:15,550 --> 01:57:19,660
the next step is to integrate more

2096
01:57:17,380 --> 01:57:23,950
parameters listed the in previous table

2097
01:57:19,660 --> 01:57:26,019
that's all for presentation and I would

2098
01:57:23,950 --> 01:57:30,820
like to ask people to read this and

2099
01:57:26,020 --> 01:57:32,800
provide us feedback thank you so I think

2100
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:35,500
this the Nuge after whisky have more

2101
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:48,670
chance to learn to discuss on the list

2102
01:57:35,500 --> 01:57:52,060
okay so next the morning so this is

2103
01:57:48,670 --> 01:57:54,490
eeling from our speaking this job day is

2104
01:57:52,060 --> 01:57:56,830
about the a severe extension in support

2105
01:57:54,490 --> 01:58:00,040
of protect proactive profession actually

2106
01:57:56,830 --> 01:58:03,100
it was presented in this working group

2107
01:58:00,040 --> 01:58:06,250
it is Tuesday and it was agreed to move

2108
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:09,130
to the Tisch working group and but still

2109
01:58:06,250 --> 01:58:13,210
want OSHA indeed in second working group

2110
01:58:09,130 --> 01:58:16,780
because I think the use cases of the the

2111
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:21,280
typical use cases of this job is a very

2112
01:58:16,780 --> 01:58:25,690
related to transport network so so your

2113
01:58:21,280 --> 01:58:27,940
comments will be very welcome and I'll

2114
01:58:25,690 --> 01:58:29,679
go through it very quickly because I

2115
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:34,509
know Daniel yes there have been a

2116
01:58:29,680 --> 01:58:37,690
difficult time so yeah okay the

2117
01:58:34,510 --> 01:58:41,440
background is that the listen public

2118
01:58:37,690 --> 01:58:45,580
technology so step and that could be

2119
01:58:41,440 --> 01:58:47,830
some indications before failure physical

2120
01:58:45,580 --> 01:58:52,030
failure happens so it's possible to

2121
01:58:47,830 --> 01:58:55,230
toast the failure prediction before the

2122
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:59,559
real failure happens so in the

2123
01:58:55,230 --> 01:59:04,200
profession Minister we if we can catch

2124
01:58:59,560 --> 01:59:07,660
up with predicting failure then we can

2125
01:59:04,200 --> 01:59:10,240
create a protection protection past

2126
01:59:07,660 --> 01:59:13,690
before the really real failure happens

2127
01:59:10,240 --> 01:59:16,059
so that is the proactive protection so

2128
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:20,740
we make protocol centers to support

2129
01:59:16,060 --> 01:59:23,700
these kind of functions so so okay sorry

2130
01:59:20,740 --> 01:59:23,700
so

2131
01:59:23,770 --> 01:59:30,110
okay thank you

2132
01:59:25,160 --> 01:59:35,719
and this is the main idea say auntie one

2133
01:59:30,110 --> 01:59:38,000
does not see finds that predicted their

2134
01:59:35,719 --> 01:59:40,520
reserve I will cut it will be a fabric

2135
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:43,460
art happens in the near future

2136
01:59:40,520 --> 01:59:48,679
then you will notify to another a and

2137
01:59:43,460 --> 01:59:51,590
then in t indented the not a in T two

2138
01:59:48,679 --> 01:59:54,830
can create a protection pass to protect

2139
01:59:51,590 --> 01:59:57,560
this connection and in T for if the real

2140
01:59:54,830 --> 01:59:59,949
failure happens then we can start to the

2141
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:03,320
one part for example one pass one

2142
01:59:59,949 --> 02:00:07,820
protection switch to protect connections

2143
02:00:03,320 --> 02:00:10,610
and if finally the failure hat has not

2144
02:00:07,820 --> 02:00:13,480
happened if and if we find the either

2145
02:00:10,610 --> 02:00:19,089
safe enough thing we can tear down your

2146
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:22,339
protection past who save the results and

2147
02:00:19,090 --> 02:00:25,820
for the protocol extensions is a quite

2148
02:00:22,340 --> 02:00:30,410
simple we actually had two bits to the

2149
02:00:25,820 --> 02:00:33,080
protection protection object to indicate

2150
02:00:30,410 --> 02:00:35,900
that this is the proactive protection

2151
02:00:33,080 --> 02:00:39,309
and these two bits are used to indicate

2152
02:00:35,900 --> 02:00:43,759
the the intermediate node to start the

2153
02:00:39,310 --> 02:00:47,810
proactive protection function as we know

2154
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:49,730
we have the 48 72 and for the 87 in

2155
02:00:47,810 --> 02:00:51,790
story about the end-to-end protection

2156
02:00:49,730 --> 02:00:54,589
and second own protection so

2157
02:00:51,790 --> 02:00:57,800
distribution for each arc for for each

2158
02:00:54,590 --> 02:01:01,040
other so for the segment prodigious

2159
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:06,530
almost the same and another extension is

2160
02:01:01,040 --> 02:01:10,630
about the say there's no D its extension

2161
02:01:06,530 --> 02:01:14,360
to the notification about the proactive

2162
02:01:10,630 --> 02:01:18,460
predicted failure notification which is

2163
02:01:14,360 --> 02:01:22,969
if ik different from the royal failure

2164
02:01:18,460 --> 02:01:25,850
notification and we also English is

2165
02:01:22,969 --> 02:01:29,719
optionally we can also include the

2166
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:32,469
tongue before which the failure will

2167
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:35,840
happen and they if no further happen

2168
02:01:32,469 --> 02:01:38,810
when on for example in case

2169
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:41,690
in this figure then the South node came

2170
02:01:38,810 --> 02:01:47,210
considering to tear down the protect

2171
02:01:41,690 --> 02:01:50,450
protection connections okay so for the

2172
02:01:47,210 --> 02:01:54,140
next step we have decided to move it to

2173
02:01:50,450 --> 02:01:57,260
the T squatting group and I see as you

2174
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:59,780
also copied to the second working group

2175
02:01:57,260 --> 02:02:01,940
and to get your heap feedback from the

2176
02:01:59,780 --> 02:02:05,750
yeah foreigner group let's see

2177
02:02:01,940 --> 02:02:11,540
thank you okay Gregg mercy City so you

2178
02:02:05,750 --> 02:02:13,910
do this and to end protection not not a

2179
02:02:11,540 --> 02:02:15,800
span protection not a link protection so

2180
02:02:13,910 --> 02:02:19,400
it's it's not local protection you do

2181
02:02:15,800 --> 02:02:22,180
end-to-end protection okay then I don't

2182
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:25,670
see that they're required any extensions

2183
02:02:22,180 --> 02:02:28,760
because if you do end-to-end monitoring

2184
02:02:25,670 --> 02:02:31,790
of performance you can have some policy

2185
02:02:28,760 --> 02:02:34,460
that defines dynamics of their service

2186
02:02:31,790 --> 02:02:36,620
the quality degradation and then you can

2187
02:02:34,460 --> 02:02:39,140
decide whether you are in a zone when

2188
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:41,269
you want to instantiate the protection

2189
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:43,460
because you're really conditions are

2190
02:02:41,270 --> 02:02:47,540
worsening to the case of close to be a

2191
02:02:43,460 --> 02:02:49,610
failure so because of that if you are

2192
02:02:47,540 --> 02:02:52,030
doing end-to-end protection so you do

2193
02:02:49,610 --> 02:02:55,580
monitoring end to end with any

2194
02:02:52,030 --> 02:02:58,280
performance measurement method and you

2195
02:02:55,580 --> 02:03:00,830
don't need to signal anything so you

2196
02:02:58,280 --> 02:03:03,740
decide on the head and thus you

2197
02:03:00,830 --> 02:03:05,690
instantiate associated Channel when you

2198
02:03:03,740 --> 02:03:08,240
notice that you're crossing the

2199
02:03:05,690 --> 02:03:11,540
threshold so I don't see that need of

2200
02:03:08,240 --> 02:03:15,170
any necessary extension all the

2201
02:03:11,540 --> 02:03:18,440
mechanics already in rsvp-te okay so let

2202
02:03:15,170 --> 02:03:21,970
me clarify at most it's informational

2203
02:03:18,440 --> 02:03:26,059
draft yeah let me let me cut classify

2204
02:03:21,970 --> 02:03:28,550
say a proactive failure is different

2205
02:03:26,060 --> 02:03:32,510
from for example the signal degree or

2206
02:03:28,550 --> 02:03:35,030
signal failure because that it from the

2207
02:03:32,510 --> 02:03:40,130
data plan you can continue to receive

2208
02:03:35,030 --> 02:03:42,200
the data as normal no data impact so you

2209
02:03:40,130 --> 02:03:44,330
don't you cannot catch up with this kind

2210
02:03:42,200 --> 02:03:47,420
of information see in the source node or

2211
02:03:44,330 --> 02:03:49,090
other end node one other example is that

2212
02:03:47,420 --> 02:03:53,000
if we

2213
02:03:49,090 --> 02:03:57,230
keep monitoring on the SOP this data of

2214
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:02,300
the state of the polarization if fiber

2215
02:03:57,230 --> 02:04:04,599
is say have a precious or sketch the SOP

2216
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:08,360
will change greatly but the data is you

2217
02:04:04,600 --> 02:04:10,489
do not have any we are in the in the

2218
02:04:08,360 --> 02:04:12,739
working path so it does not do not aware

2219
02:04:10,489 --> 02:04:15,320
of see this event

2220
02:04:12,739 --> 02:04:19,129
you still need a notification from the

2221
02:04:15,320 --> 02:04:21,199
control plane well this is interesting

2222
02:04:19,130 --> 02:04:24,170
technical discussion I think we're

2223
02:04:21,199 --> 02:04:25,820
highlighting why you don't do sort of

2224
02:04:24,170 --> 02:04:27,949
draft shopping in different working

2225
02:04:25,820 --> 02:04:29,809
groups since we said this is going to be

2226
02:04:27,949 --> 02:04:31,400
in tees if we were going to have a

2227
02:04:29,810 --> 02:04:32,840
technical conversation we now have to

2228
02:04:31,400 --> 02:04:35,420
have exactly the same conversation and

2229
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:39,350
T's better to take this to the t's list

2230
02:04:35,420 --> 02:04:41,300
and have that conversation there rather

2231
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:42,920
than trying to do take up multiple

2232
02:04:41,300 --> 02:04:45,739
working groups time talking about the

2233
02:04:42,920 --> 02:04:46,130
same thing okay so that's just my

2234
02:04:45,739 --> 02:04:49,849
opinion

2235
02:04:46,130 --> 02:04:52,880
I can't understood yeah okay

2236
02:04:49,850 --> 02:04:55,100
I think me Tina Jen

2237
02:04:52,880 --> 02:04:59,480
Danny oh really yeah thank you very much

2238
02:04:55,100 --> 02:05:04,780
I bid to all of you okay say you are

2239
02:04:59,480 --> 02:05:04,780
next time when kuat thank you back

2240
02:05:24,449 --> 02:05:26,509
you
