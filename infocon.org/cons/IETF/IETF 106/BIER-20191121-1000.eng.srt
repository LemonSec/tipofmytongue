1
00:00:26,329 --> 00:00:33,420
it's officially 10 a.m. that signed this

2
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:36,780
start is right to the walls

3
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:45,330
I'm not gang members left lompoc LA and

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:47,480
we won't see each other again I need my

5
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,480
phone

6
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:35,228
all right now

7
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:06,920
so we have minutes jabber in the upper

8
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,209
sky in the neon jammer we do have two

9
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,150
people on camera so we're gonna need

10
00:02:08,209 --> 00:02:13,150
chatter start something on somebody

11
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,079
[Music]

12
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:43,160
before they come in as well sign it to

13
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:45,470
tell anybody shows up all right everyone

14
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:51,410
read the note well you know your legal

15
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:54,500
obligation when you're here neither but

16
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:58,220
I never know well so agenda we're not

17
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:00,470
totally packed but I do want to push

18
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,030
some stuff along and make room for

19
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,230
things we want us discuss cuz some of

20
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,579
the stuff I would say contentious but

21
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:06,980
this is the open issues to talk about

22
00:03:04,579 --> 00:03:08,660
and I'd like this dynamic conversation

23
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:20,569
room where it's much better

24
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:22,549
hey dad's here I dad we have no idea we

25
00:03:20,569 --> 00:03:24,379
heard he's out there like both of the

26
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:26,230
copy but you make sure you give him a

27
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:30,099
demotion or some sort of like black

28
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,170
star for this one broken yeah so

29
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:34,450
anything missing from this agenda I know

30
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,738
I got all the slides in it was kind of

31
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,480
fun to me in the end of the week people

32
00:03:35,739 --> 00:03:39,069
had other stuff was a higher priority so

33
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,048
stuff came in like all the way down to

34
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:45,879
this morning but we're done anything

35
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:47,709
missing or solid okay anything

36
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:49,329
outstanding like business-wise other

37
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,739
than a bunch of documents in the queue

38
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,000
we've got a bunch of working group last

39
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:53,950
call we have bunch we're looking for

40
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,590
shephard summer sign shepherds and we

41
00:03:53,950 --> 00:04:00,099
still have documents that really come

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:02,739
hopefully we'll be adopting adoption

43
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:04,629
calls but the helpless get through that

44
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,129
stuff sandy has volunteered to step up

45
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:09,069
as Secretary and jump in and help us

46
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:10,840
push yourself along this is kind of

47
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:14,679
weird from here goes into holiday week

48
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:24,130
I'm sorry we're full sorry sir sir we're

49
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:25,960
full one separate is enough no if it

50
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:31,180
were multicast sure won't Shepherd to be

51
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,440
enough it's not been deployed so over

52
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,729
the holiday we're gonna cue this stuff

53
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,260
up I'm liking the dump everything and

54
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:37,210
your email address because no one's

55
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:39,130
gonna read them anyway but like we did

56
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,570
last year come January it's gonna be

57
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,060
flooded we gotta push this up through

58
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:45,250
and so many things are dependent and I

59
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,419
feel like we had such great progress and

60
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,310
we're almost the point of being

61
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,289
dysfunctional now nothing is no one

62
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,360
could worker to people we just soar not

63
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,789
you know getting these things removed

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,880
ones we need so sandy has clearly saw

65
00:04:54,789 --> 00:05:01,330
this all our fault she's going to jump

66
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,389
in and help us make this happen all

67
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,389
right

68
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:09,720
none of the pseudo adults we've had here

69
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:16,090
300

70
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:20,979
they've always been next I'm going to be

71
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:22,989
here alright Sandy's first right blue

72
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,130
sheets are out you gonna show them and

73
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:31,389
act like nothing's happened while you

74
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:33,520
were gone so your finger goes in this

75
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:35,880
button right here and when sandy says

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,880
ding

77
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:44,319
at first I'd like to thank you our

78
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,680
chairs give me the great chance to take

79
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,020
the secretary job and I'm very glad to

80
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,789
work for the working group with our

81
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:56,139
chairs thank you

82
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:59,740
and now let me start my presentation for

83
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:04,000
the beer prefix redistribution tract

84
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:10,810
we have many cold calls are include iced

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:14,470
every and many others so at first so

86
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:18,900
let's see the problem statement we know

87
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:23,199
that it's a traditional networking our

88
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,799
deployment we will deploy and banging

89
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,270
ITP

90
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:32,099
errors crossing meaning regions so in

91
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:37,120
this figure we just missed three errors

92
00:06:32,099 --> 00:06:42,759
you will see when two OSPF errors and

93
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:45,190
the one and call errors however but we

94
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,190
know some in some situations we will

95
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:51,930
deploy different routing protocol in

96
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:55,539
different regions because some

97
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,690
administration requirement so the

98
00:06:55,539 --> 00:07:04,000
mistral you will see we may deploy ice

99
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:06,990
ice in the car ever to so we know that

100
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,090
the unicast function works well because

101
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:16,090
the ABI reporter brought her well to the

102
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:21,008
redistribution work to redistribute has

103
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:26,099
the prefix across a many errors so the

104
00:07:21,009 --> 00:07:30,310
unicast works well but if we'd like to

105
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:33,849
deploy multifaceted English networks we

106
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:36,460
can use PIM protocol to do it and it

107
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:39,819
works well because it's not a depends on

108
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:44,289
the it only depends on the unicast

109
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:46,780
routing calculation result so and we

110
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:50,740
know that seeing these networks may be

111
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,830
in some areas just for example these

112
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:57,700
errors there are not too many routers in

113
00:07:53,830 --> 00:08:03,760
the error it just there's telling rotors

114
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:09,610
in the error so and the same with other

115
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:12,909
errors so if we'd like to deploy pin in

116
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:16,030
this network as no problem but if we'd

117
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:20,230
like to use a beer to replace him in

118
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:24,520
this network we will face some problems

119
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:27,669
and let me expand it because we know

120
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:33,159
that from the existed standard dropped

121
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:40,360
the beer is related to the IGP errors so

122
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:43,990
the so the every IDP ever will become

123
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:47,650
appear domain so then this figure we

124
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:53,200
will have three beard of me it's just a

125
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:58,209
part of the networks so only we see the

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:03,460
ABR the r3 and r4 will do the overlay

127
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:07,210
signaling work and the encapsulation and

128
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:11,200
decapsulation work as well so we will

129
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:13,990
know that many beard encapsulation and

130
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:23,110
decapsulation functions will lead to the

131
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:26,830
efficient forwarding so we'd like to

132
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,740
improve the efficiency of the network so

133
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:35,530
we wanted to build a large period of men

134
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:38,560
throw all these errors so we can remove

135
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:43,980
the state management taking the error

136
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,599
borders and we can eliminate the

137
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,880
encapsulation and decapsulation

138
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,220
functions of Rome's abs so we will

139
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,820
improve the peer forwarding efficiency

140
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,060
but the problem is how can we achieved

141
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,060
it

142
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:08,019
so just as my side the beer domain is

143
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:12,970
related to the specific ITP error for

144
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:16,959
now so we'd like to deploy the peer

145
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:20,380
across many errors so we know that's the

146
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,500
one the ABR to the prefix distribution

147
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:28,060
work we can also redistribute as a peer

148
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:31,839
info information such as BFF prefix and

149
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:35,500
the PFA ID and the other associated

150
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,290
information so the beer know the

151
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:41,610
information can spread in the whole peer

152
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:47,519
domain and across multiple regions

153
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:51,190
errors so at first we can use the

154
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,660
advertisement aligned with existed a GP

155
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:56,019
and the BP definition

156
00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,779
so once the prefix at word highest

157
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:05,310
across IDP error one by one we can also

158
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:08,560
carries the peer information with it and

159
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,989
so as well as the employers

160
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,500
encapsulation you can also advertise it

161
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:18,010
because though the parent absolution has

162
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:22,390
local significance but we may use it

163
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:24,670
across different errors so I really know

164
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:28,779
the hing the domain can build as a peer

165
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:31,719
forwarding plane and the several IDP

166
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:43,120
errors errors will be merged into one

167
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:45,940
beer domain so you know the one the ABR

168
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:50,250
to the unique host prefix with

169
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:53,860
distribution work some summarized or

170
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:58,029
default route or aggregate function can

171
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,529
be used so even when the default route

172
00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:01,779
for example

173
00:11:59,529 --> 00:12:04,089
vanity for the filter is used only one

174
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:08,800
prefix will be at word highest into

175
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:09,980
another error so in this situation this

176
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:14,930
will high

177
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:17,870
menu we have a prefix so if we like to

178
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:21,829
Edward has the Associated bf IDs with

179
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:24,440
the default route we must need our new

180
00:12:21,829 --> 00:12:29,899
extension poet the new extension is that

181
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:33,829
we can carry the associated bf IDs and

182
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:38,120
all set and Edward has set into the

183
00:12:33,829 --> 00:12:42,680
other error so we can achieve the goal

184
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,019
that Edward highest VFR prefix and the

185
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:54,920
other pair information associated with

186
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:59,649
any type of prefix so that's all I want

187
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:05,420
to hear and this job has been present

188
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:07,490
three times if I'm a member right so

189
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,969
we'd like to call for working group at

190
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,970
option

191
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:18,949
cheerio from Hawaii just one comment I

192
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:26,390
think the scenarios and requirements

193
00:13:18,949 --> 00:13:31,359
reached by this document it useful the

194
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,360
document under the slides just just

195
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:40,910
before this said that the p r-- p FR t

196
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:47,000
imported from outside the area its

197
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:50,269
advertised with summer youth i think it

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:57,910
this should be a host perfect because

199
00:13:50,269 --> 00:14:02,899
not only the FC 8401 requires that the

200
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:07,360
PA information is advertised with host

201
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:10,399
prefix but also the architecture FC

202
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:14,660
looking to clear that the bill

203
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:17,009
information should advertise by IP

204
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:20,309
address let's

205
00:14:17,009 --> 00:14:24,059
it's a hosta pigs let's have silly mini

206
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:29,399
host picks so I think so my comments is

207
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:32,969
that information post by this document

208
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:43,949
should be advertised with your host

209
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:46,619
perfect so that's my comment once the

210
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:49,889
host perfect just mention a by genome

211
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:54,239
can be accurate highest across different

212
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:57,360
errors one by one of course the host

213
00:14:54,239 --> 00:15:00,869
prefix and is associated at BFI this can

214
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,569
be Edward house in the same time so it's

215
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:06,239
the first the solution for it if you do

216
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:10,889
the prefix advertisement one by one

217
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:13,799
across a GPRS you can do it but if we

218
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:17,220
want to use default or summarized route

219
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:20,369
route to across the meaning errors we

220
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:23,699
must use some other method to do it so

221
00:15:20,369 --> 00:15:26,579
we impose there's a new extension for it

222
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:31,378
these two solution is can be used

223
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:34,920
together you know so you can if you only

224
00:15:31,379 --> 00:15:38,339
advertise prefix one by one you can only

225
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,949
use existing advertisement for it but if

226
00:15:38,339 --> 00:15:43,920
you like to use the summarized or

227
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:46,589
default route for it you should use the

228
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:56,279
other method otherwise you can't carry

229
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:59,069
the BFI this right who may be called in

230
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,869
nokia yeah this is definitely an

231
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:06,179
interesting problem one thing I can get

232
00:16:03,869 --> 00:16:08,399
my head around is that when it comes to

233
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:11,279
the summarize route or even the default

234
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:16,139
route are you proposing that the ABR

235
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:19,829
gonna track all the BFRs

236
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,739
or PF ir for that matter on one area and

237
00:16:19,829 --> 00:16:25,169
we're going to create this TLB with all

238
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:27,299
those BF r IDs and shoot it to the

239
00:16:25,169 --> 00:16:28,470
second area like I'm not sure if I

240
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:30,680
understand

241
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:35,370
how you are proposing a summary route

242
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:40,319
will advertise all the VFR ids in your

243
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,540
core area into area one or into area 2

244
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,570
because you need to advertise an entire

245
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:49,980
list of pfr IDs if it's a summary route

246
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:52,740
right let me explain it because we like

247
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:56,460
to merge all the errors in one peer

248
00:16:52,740 --> 00:17:01,470
domain right so only in this figure just

249
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:05,910
in this figure r1 and r2 and I am an

250
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:12,540
axon ry will pisa PFI are and the BFE

251
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:15,089
are so the r3 and r4 needn't tupiza BFI

252
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:19,159
are also bf yeah they just appear finds

253
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:21,720
a forwarding plane so we use

254
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,040
advertisement for prefix redistribute

255
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,689
it's just work work on this a BIA and

256
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:31,680
redistribute the prefix seeing this

257
00:17:27,689 --> 00:17:37,500
error into the core error right so one

258
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:41,280
the as I am and the RSV after we have

259
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:47,310
our prefix is well Edward has by the US

260
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:51,389
we wrote water it can just advertise the

261
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:55,320
summarized route into the core network

262
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:57,060
so it's just the control plane eunuch

263
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:00,929
has the work in the word husband it's

264
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:04,169
just an extension to IDP yeah so as long

265
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:09,870
as the the summary and and the PFR ideas

266
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:13,380
in these access areas are flat but so if

267
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:16,679
your OSPF let's call the the bottom left

268
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:20,220
side or area one so if you have BF our

269
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:22,950
ideas that are very sequential and flat

270
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,470
on that area then it will work because

271
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:32,010
you have the VFR ID range but if your

272
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:34,920
PFR IDs are not flat and not sequential

273
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,650
in that case you need to go one by one

274
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:41,520
yes Yogi's right that's that would be a

275
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:45,270
large going back and forth it's

276
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:48,570
and so so I think it's a challenger for

277
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:51,030
the it's not actually challenges sorry

278
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,669
it's just our computational and

279
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:57,450
administration requirement so you may

280
00:18:53,670 --> 00:19:03,360
configure the BFI this in my area and

281
00:18:57,450 --> 00:19:06,660
with not continuous range for it but the

282
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,870
it may be the advertisement to

283
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:14,970
complicate in the a3 but it can do right

284
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:19,500
so so if you can configure this with

285
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:23,520
same range or just a little ranging and

286
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:27,240
it can be edward has only a few minutes

287
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,450
we only feel sub-ranges so it may works

288
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,650
well in the network so it depends on

289
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,650
your configuration on the BFI ID so we

290
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:42,030
suggest that you can configure the

291
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:45,690
containers dfid in one error it's it's

292
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:48,300
the most efficient way to it but if you

293
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:51,720
don't it's a thought man as doesn't

294
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:57,059
matter the a3 how also invert I said

295
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:01,830
into the other errors so and so it

296
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:07,320
depends on your deployment children from

297
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:12,090
how a continued master question assuming

298
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:15,720
that the body water that are suitable

299
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:20,399
are for in this future it should support

300
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:26,309
appeared already right yes and there are

301
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:29,790
three should advertise its own beer for

302
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:34,678
ID and the its own fear encapsulation

303
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:38,770
letter is there be a label together with

304
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:45,490
the import will appear for IDs you

305
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:48,660
through the area let me clarify it we

306
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:51,670
know that if we build as a home

307
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:55,390
networking into one beer domain there's

308
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:58,810
no need to assign dfid for r3 and r4 so

309
00:20:55,390 --> 00:21:01,600
r3 and r4 just phone flooded the IDP

310
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:05,470
extension in the network but right yeah

311
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:08,290
I'd get cut to your mini I'm sorry and I

312
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:11,410
don't need to configure and ready to be

313
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:14,950
after I pee but it has to advertise the

314
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:18,640
beer encapsulation is a sabot to me

315
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:22,990
I'm the service of actually it's under

316
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,840
the PL information sabot your way the PL

317
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,960
information suffered govt has the tfiid

318
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:33,909
I thought very that the authority or you

319
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:36,970
ready the PF idea of r3 itself doctor

320
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:39,880
information including the sanitary and

321
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:48,460
the servicer TOB it's completely there

322
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:51,490
since its FC 8401 a3 I'm not sure I

323
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,940
catch you totally

324
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:59,950
but r3 and r4 will play the same role in

325
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:04,330
the area flooding so it's the same

326
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:07,780
function defining you I've seen eight

327
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:11,800
four zero one and eight four four four

328
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:15,490
okay just come back to my comment it's

329
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:19,540
that the same sub theory I'm same

330
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:27,420
service a govt should use the host

331
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:32,639
prefix Nesmith further comment si side

332
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:37,210
if you have the ABR to the traffic's

333
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:41,500
redistribution one by one so the a3 will

334
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:44,560
Edward has one prefix of one node it can

335
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:48,370
do the same thing with existing IP

336
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:50,090
extension but air for r3 would like to

337
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:53,639
advertise motive

338
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:56,399
prefix in one advertisement such as

339
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,250
summaries summarize the prefix you

340
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,030
should carry the Associated VF ideas of

341
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:06,510
Ag rotors so

342
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:08,220
I Cisco make it about clarify so the

343
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,960
summarization is it is only an

344
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,580
optimization right so you can just plug

345
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,560
those things right through then they're

346
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:16,500
one-to-one and at the end of day it's

347
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:19,530
not tuning more than 256 updates anyway

348
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,930
right so but if you do summarize then

349
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:23,610
that that ABR will put its own a

350
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:25,890
loopback address as to be a Friday

351
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:28,709
mm-hmm right so it's not that

352
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:32,180
complicated I think yes it's not a

353
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:37,440
complicated it's just a smart extension

354
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:40,950
analysis thing synchronous so you're now

355
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,010
sub-sub theories here with the existing

356
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:48,020
beer sub sub TVs also be you know

357
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:50,370
possible to use with this as an example

358
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,070
it's the first half comes to my mind is

359
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:55,409
like empty year for instance you know if

360
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:58,379
you do like this empty u sub sub T a

361
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:00,120
week before a beer prefix they've been

362
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,950
useful to do that here as well because

363
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:06,090
you can say this is same to you for the

364
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:07,830
entire domain I'm just wondering the

365
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:09,959
existing documents that define a beer

366
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,639
sub sub chillies are they strict is

367
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,010
saying that it cannot they can only be

368
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:16,010
used with that beer the existing

369
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:25,800
extension anyway though I feel like it

370
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,930
might be useful to allow certain sub sub

371
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:31,500
theories that we have for the current

372
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:33,360
ears subtly to be used with this uh no

373
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,750
matter that requires some kind of

374
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,629
updates to some documents yes we can do

375
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:41,970
it in a future version

376
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:45,150
thank you one more we get more I'm a

377
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:49,050
comment you know I just following my

378
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:53,390
comments before I think yes the Samuel

379
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:57,200
water may work in some cases but

380
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,870
it should be noted that utility to

381
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,890
update their be architecture of c2

382
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:09,379
because that is required in the peoc

383
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:15,830
temperature to use IP address sorry in

384
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:25,940
IDP ah let me select new aside the IDP

385
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:29,120
you already use summarized prefix I can

386
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,610
point that out so it's um let's move

387
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,479
this one the worst was over already

388
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,709
I don't think it's as complicated

389
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,390
forgetting it but I think we're moving

390
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:37,280
towards you know some commonality let me

391
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,600
just address the important part of

392
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,240
program progress here who's read the

393
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,760
draft alright who thinks this should be

394
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,070
adopted right okay so we're in that same

395
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,650
queue so we'll load that out in fact

396
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:52,450
I'll address our secretary and see if we

397
00:25:48,650 --> 00:26:00,070
can get this thing moving thank you

398
00:25:52,450 --> 00:26:00,070
Thank You sandy apartment sued again oh

399
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:09,980
yeah majority of the room I mean I saw

400
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:13,940
it probably a good forty percent of the

401
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:15,260
room with the hands up of and I don't

402
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:19,549
see anyone whose hands that led to it

403
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:21,049
again who read it keep your hands up who

404
00:26:19,549 --> 00:26:21,970
thinks it should be adopted keep your

405
00:26:21,049 --> 00:26:24,200
hands up

406
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:26,120
alright all the readers think it should

407
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,980
be adopted there's a good dozen at least

408
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:36,219
that's pretty good for a doc all right

409
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:41,419
excellent thanks Mike Thank You sandy

410
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:47,630
all right back to legenda pin signaling

411
00:26:41,419 --> 00:26:49,160
and yeah that's all you're doing both

412
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,590
these you doing pin an ml DP signaling

413
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:53,600
both right okay no I put the name on top

414
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:58,449
packet mister on so pin should be first

415
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,449
Tim signaling powered by a v8

416
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:12,939
so who made call in nokia we uploaded

417
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:14,740
the version 8 or the VA and there were

418
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,880
some good comments on the working group

419
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:25,240
with regard to this draft we added three

420
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:26,940
new sections or three new clarifications

421
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,740
one is on ecmp

422
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:32,289
basically what we are saying is that on

423
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,770
the IBB are when you try to find the

424
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:40,570
ebbr order there are multiple EVP RS you

425
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:43,539
can actually look at the CSG and try to

426
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:45,960
load balanced Europe in signaling over

427
00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:48,760
multiple egress PVR's

428
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,809
so the next one was there was a comment

429
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:55,570
on the join attribute address family we

430
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:58,928
clarified that that address family is

431
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:02,678
actually the team packet address family

432
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:04,779
that is arriving on the ingress bber

433
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:06,190
router and that's the one that we are

434
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:11,140
actually actually passing through the

435
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:17,590
pin signaling next is like this and last

436
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:19,419
but not least we clarified the PM SM we

437
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:22,678
put a comment in there that it's gonna

438
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:26,350
work nicely with the static RP or

439
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:30,640
embedded RP for ipv6 but when it comes

440
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:33,850
to them more complicated SM aureus and

441
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,770
functionality like PSR or auto-discovery

442
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:40,510
and all these other type of SM mechanism

443
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,980
disrupt will not work nicely and we

444
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:45,070
probably need another graph in the

445
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:49,000
future to address these concerns and

446
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:51,570
these challenges so this is the latest

447
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,320
version and next slide please

448
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:57,549
so where we are standing now with these

449
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,770
comments

450
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:02,408
we're wondering whether there's any

451
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:05,889
other cavities in the draft and if there

452
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:08,320
are no comments questions I think we

453
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:10,500
done last call on this graph twice so

454
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,120
we're wondering what's the next step

455
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,540
whose readiness

456
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,919
form all right keep your hands up if you

457
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,280
think it's ready for last call keep them

458
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,800
up

459
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:22,710
drop them otherwise yeah we've addressed

460
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,850
those actually so no one doesn't go back

461
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,380
the list is well I think they're too

462
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:26,820
weak may have come up with you bribed

463
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,920
again just for clarity we may be

464
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,210
accelerated so we'll go and drop by drop

465
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:32,460
based on history if you've gone through

466
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,020
two or three like this we're a band guys

467
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,560
sell a consensus on good to start over

468
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:39,570
again but which way this is Pizza going

469
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,540
yep we should probably at least clear

470
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:43,590
with the pin working group as well do

471
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:52,530
you think there's anything issues in

472
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:55,949
there pin group chair as far as far as I

473
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:57,629
mean I mean I did Estevan also deeply

474
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,150
the draft pretty carefully not this

475
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:01,650
person but the previous one and I think

476
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,840
it should be pretty good from pin

477
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:05,280
perspective but it's great to get of

478
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,879
course we're doing a team working group

479
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:10,800
so so I would say we can I can send

480
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,230
emails with but we'll just say there's

481
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:15,060
the last call and in beer and please go

482
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:20,390
and have a look at the draft synchronize

483
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:22,830
our last call together yeah thanks to

484
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:24,900
Montgomery San Francisco so Jessica

485
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:27,990
stone will it be third full last call or

486
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,730
do this out last Cup so this would be

487
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,820
third time last call so will it be full

488
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,800
full fledge two weeks last caller

489
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,600
celebrate celebrate this cut it down I

490
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:38,580
mean if we give more in the Templar but

491
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,469
this is one that has been discussed

492
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:44,010
extensively we've edited along the way I

493
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,210
think we've got this to a roll all the

494
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,710
players have been reading and following

495
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:48,540
so it's not likely to wake people like

496
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,790
except maybe those in pin who haven't

497
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:53,280
seen it so I think accelerated would be

498
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:56,550
fine thanks

499
00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,450
you're the next one all right we should

500
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:04,590
do is watch this see that see that it

501
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:07,140
was a pressure part just not to come

502
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:10,129
along Karthi I says what's magical oh

503
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:15,060
yeah it's incredible

504
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:17,520
all right yeah so this is a I want to

505
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:20,850
use my words very carefully I was gonna

506
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,980
say extending in signaling for EM LDPE

507
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:25,110
but I know there there's a

508
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:28,890
I'm gonna get a slap on the wrist for

509
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:31,169
that so this is ml DP signaling over a

510
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,200
beer core basically it's the same idea

511
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:37,470
again what we are trying to do here is

512
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,350
we are trying to extend any legacy

513
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:44,630
multicast protocol over a beer core

514
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:47,429
without actually affecting the access

515
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:51,180
legacy multicast protocols

516
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:52,890
it should be a very smooth upgrade when

517
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,660
you grab a segment of the network and

518
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:58,530
you decide to go to beer

519
00:31:54,660 --> 00:32:00,630
we shouldn't affect any of the software

520
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,300
upgrades or any of the functionality on

521
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:06,780
the legacy multicast protocol in this

522
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:09,389
case it's the NL DP so basically what we

523
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:12,060
are doing is that we are using RFC 70 60

524
00:32:09,390 --> 00:32:15,330
which is TL DP and upstream assign

525
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:18,179
labels to assign a label in the beer

526
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:21,270
core and we stitch that label the

527
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,370
upstream assign label which is assigned

528
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:27,570
by the ebbr actually to the ml DP

529
00:32:25,370 --> 00:32:30,620
downstream label and that's how we

530
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:34,500
actually complete the solution of

531
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:37,770
signaling MPLS in this case MLB pitcher

532
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,260
of beer core so there has not been many

533
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:44,010
changes in version one there were some

534
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:46,879
comments which were you know asking us

535
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:48,710
clarify some aspects of it in the draft

536
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,020
next slide please

537
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:56,670
so one thing I added was that I added

538
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:59,520
ecmp case for for this also so the same

539
00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,190
thing on the IBB are you can look at the

540
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:05,040
route and and the opaque like the effect

541
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,680
that is arriving from downstream and

542
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:09,800
based on based on that fake you can

543
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:12,090
actually load balance your

544
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,990
point-to-multipoint tunnels over

545
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:19,590
multiple egress TBR's

546
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:21,900
next slide so on the ebbr procedure

547
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:25,409
again it's the same as it was on the

548
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:27,930
previous draft I'm not gonna go over it

549
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,750
again for the sake of time next slide

550
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:33,000
please and on the data part we did not

551
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:35,100
do any changes compared to the last time

552
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,880
that we presented so again for the sake

553
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,539
of time

554
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,650
I'm gonna skip over it so where we stand

555
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:46,650
with this is that I think we have

556
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:49,380
multiple players on this draft and we

557
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:51,630
are asking for working group adaptation

558
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:55,410
to make this draft part of it working

559
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:55,970
with you who's read the draft keep your

560
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:59,940
hands up

561
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:02,400
the things should be adopted all right

562
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:15,740
you got a solid support I'd say eight

563
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:15,740
and eight thank you number four mr. Stig

564
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:35,279
yeah hi so this is about the beer

565
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:37,080
extension to our champion ml d so as you

566
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,260
know we've been discussing about an item

567
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:42,299
pure ml d overlay for beer so kind of

568
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:46,590
similar to that pin signaling we just

569
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:50,460
spoke or discussed if you want to use I

570
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:52,770
jump your ml d as an overlay and as to

571
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,168
figure out with with PIM is that it's

572
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:57,149
good to have a way of identifying

573
00:34:54,168 --> 00:35:01,200
exactly who the receivers are like who

574
00:34:57,149 --> 00:35:05,368
are the Debbie egress routers what I

575
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,069
should say basically when you receive a

576
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:10,200
pin joint how do you know exactly the be

577
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:13,170
Friday and so know who the joint came

578
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,990
from and also forum p.m. of the overlays

579
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:18,420
we want a way of identifying who who

580
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:24,600
sent that idea P remedy report and who

581
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:29,670
who wants to receive yeah human exactly

582
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:32,009
who is that beer receiver anyway so in

583
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:34,740
order to do this for a GMP remedy we

584
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:38,220
need to extend onion p.m. LD messages

585
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:39,959
and we don't really want to make any

586
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:42,118
changes to those protocols on a three

587
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:46,490
habitude but i think there's an easy way

588
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:50,300
of doing this so this draft it does just

589
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:50,930
try to do this in a generic way and by

590
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:54,080
having like a

591
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:56,149
IGMP remedy type extension because it's

592
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,490
generic and it's kind of a new thing to

593
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,110
extend our EMP remedy messages I think

594
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,450
this needs to go to that pin working

595
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:06,650
group that is responsible for those

596
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:08,299
protocols let me just address that I

597
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:10,940
think their conclusions need to happen

598
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:13,280
there but in the same way and this is an

599
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:15,890
arrow addressed to you directly the same

600
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,690
way with ISS and OSPF those changes need

601
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:18,859
to be made in those groups but the

602
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:20,720
change requests and the information

603
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:23,450
about what needs to go in it came here

604
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,310
so we did the work here and then we

605
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:27,189
we've brought in the working group to

606
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:31,009
conclude the work you know we basically

607
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,119
take it on so I think I mean stay you're

608
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,010
the chair over there I mean do you think

609
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:35,390
there's enough information there to

610
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,810
complete it should we adopt to here

611
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,430
first

612
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:39,770
progresses and then move it over all

613
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,330
right this right now I'm presenting this

614
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:44,000
in both working groups and they'll see

615
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,650
what people think but but I would say

616
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,200
when it comes to OSPF for instance

617
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:49,880
there's all you know there already was a

618
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,220
well-defined way of extending or

619
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,220
defining right right and there but in

620
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:58,310
this case there no no other extensions

621
00:36:55,220 --> 00:37:01,220
done for Imperium LD and we also create

622
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:03,590
a new registry and stuff so I feel like

623
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,930
it's more radical okay it's an

624
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,930
architecture ship and some were called

625
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:12,710
shop all right all right let's go to the

626
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:14,960
next slide so the nice thing is looking

627
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:17,869
at our comparison to your MLD where

628
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,970
since you are FCS is that they they all

629
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:22,940
discuss how you can have additional data

630
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:25,720
in in IGMP and all the reports and

631
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:29,330
queries and what they say is basically

632
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,700
if an existing implementation receives a

633
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,049
message with some additional data they

634
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,779
should compute the checksum Oh

635
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:38,900
everything but they must ignore whatever

636
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:43,670
data comes whatever additional data

637
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:45,650
there is so that means that if we

638
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:47,869
somehow put some extension their

639
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:51,200
existing m2 implementations should

640
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:53,180
completely ignore that it was extending

641
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:56,910
the bytes so whatever that might be at

642
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:01,529
the end so if

643
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:03,910
during this of course we don't expect

644
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:05,859
also like Arjun piano the

645
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,980
implementations to be updated overall

646
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:10,509
the key thing though is like in this

647
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:13,210
case you only want this for beer

648
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:16,089
encapsulation so the only devices that

649
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:18,369
would need to be upgraded to support

650
00:38:16,089 --> 00:38:22,740
this thing would be beer ingress or

651
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:25,089
egress routers but if somehow those

652
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,848
reports are carries would leak

653
00:38:25,089 --> 00:38:34,240
you know existing implementation should

654
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:37,119
be more yet extra data but yeah I think

655
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:39,549
the main question and primer tree

656
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,240
probably will be is it safe to modify or

657
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:45,849
Jim PRM LD and is this a slippery slope

658
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,189
what people want extent are you p.m.

659
00:38:45,849 --> 00:38:50,710
only for other purposes as well but

660
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:54,730
we'll see what happens with that okay

661
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:57,700
next slide so this is what it might look

662
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:59,859
like so you have the existing RMP query

663
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,950
format but then at the end there you

664
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:05,080
have an additional data and what I'm

665
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:10,450
trying to define is an extension type

666
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:12,339
and then the actual value so the idea

667
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,009
with a type I guess that's on the next

668
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:18,279
slide let's go to that the idea with the

669
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:20,020
type is that if this for some reason and

670
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:21,790
up adding extensions for some other

671
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:26,500
purpose as well we can tell them apart

672
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:29,259
so what I want to say is if an

673
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:31,720
implementation supports extension and

674
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,900
they supported the specific extension

675
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,480
type then they process that according to

676
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:40,390
the specification like like this draft

677
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,480
if if an implementation doesn't support

678
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:46,000
the specific type or or extension at all

679
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,119
they would just ignore that extension

680
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,450
and process the the EMP must Emily

681
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,280
message just looked at you today but if

682
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:56,919
it didn't have this extension type and

683
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,140
someone also did some extension for

684
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:03,099
another purpose and implementations

685
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:06,129
might accidentally try to parse parse it

686
00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:08,520
and you know treat the data in the wrong

687
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,520
way okay

688
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:17,799
yeah and apart from this draft I've

689
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:20,890
updated the the

690
00:40:17,799 --> 00:40:25,599
MLD overlay draft and basically saying

691
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:30,910
that any any iymp MLD messages sent be

692
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,919
encapsulated must have this extension we

693
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:35,949
mostly need this for reports so that you

694
00:40:32,919 --> 00:40:38,439
know exactly what settle what the beer

695
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:41,499
said should be when you when you forward

696
00:40:38,439 --> 00:40:44,649
multicast data but I think it could be

697
00:40:41,499 --> 00:40:46,868
useful for like logging or other

698
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:48,400
purposes to that an implementation can

699
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:51,759
know for instance where a query came

700
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:54,069
from and just as an implementation thing

701
00:40:51,759 --> 00:40:55,839
is probably easier to just always do

702
00:40:54,069 --> 00:40:59,429
this for all messages rather than

703
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,229
treating queries and reports differently

704
00:40:59,429 --> 00:41:06,119
that's something that we can discuss

705
00:41:02,229 --> 00:41:09,218
here so so what I'm trying to do here is

706
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:12,209
one document maybe in the pin working

707
00:41:09,219 --> 00:41:15,369
group that focuses on why do we need to

708
00:41:12,209 --> 00:41:18,308
extend a G&P remedy and what's a generic

709
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:21,489
way of doing it well the actual use of

710
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:25,809
this would be in this working group and

711
00:41:21,489 --> 00:41:28,749
for for this overlay draft one thing we

712
00:41:25,809 --> 00:41:32,079
could consider for instance two is right

713
00:41:28,749 --> 00:41:36,519
now the dicks the exact extension type

714
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:39,429
with a value the TLV canal isn't this

715
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:41,468
draft but they could potentially you

716
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:43,119
know remove this this tell me to the

717
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:45,459
overlay draft and just have the

718
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,150
extension with a registry in token

719
00:41:45,459 --> 00:41:54,669
working group but this but I will figure

720
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:56,049
this out I think I hope some of you will

721
00:41:54,669 --> 00:41:59,679
be in the pin the pin working group

722
00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:01,059
later today it's actually all here

723
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:06,609
today's we're gonna lock the doors and

724
00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:12,880
spend the rest evening all right that's

725
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:16,150
it I think okay yeah so this is this is

726
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,609
the actual extension that we are using

727
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,890
for beer and maybe could be defined in

728
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:25,430
this working group of sorted out

729
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:26,900
yeah okay gotcha so the bfr appreciate

730
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:29,180
is actually IP address the orange in the

731
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,160
message yeah so it's basically the B

732
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:33,020
originates right what's the same info

733
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:34,790
that they put in the pin John attributes

734
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:45,290
for the I'm signalling right right or

735
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:49,880
the sub M EPN PTA okay I think that's it

736
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:51,650
it is it what's the status of this we

737
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,349
actually mentioned two drops here you

738
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,420
get percent yes so the IgM p.m. of the

739
00:42:54,349 --> 00:42:59,240
overlay drops I would say that's that's

740
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,930
basically dumb but we need to conclude

741
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:04,339
them on this though yeah he's got a

742
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,960
point of registration at a point to the

743
00:43:04,339 --> 00:43:09,440
extension right yeah and also letter

744
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,210
maybe this specific new TL Anika no but

745
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,640
it's called which document that should

746
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,839
be in actually this encouraging because

747
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:16,819
for what's one of our documents is

748
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:18,650
actually being held up by another

749
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:19,819
working group the way around all right

750
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:37,190
excellent

751
00:43:19,819 --> 00:43:42,740
yeah are you in the next one too yeah to

752
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:44,750
ask questions yeah yeah so the word pin

753
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:48,859
should you remove kind of from the title

754
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:52,010
right because that's the only if it's a

755
00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:56,569
pin working group draftin oh that's why

756
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:58,970
it's okay yeah so I was just wondering

757
00:43:56,569 --> 00:44:01,730
from the deployment thing right so it is

758
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:03,649
it kind of we we still have this with

759
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,930
fear because we started with IGMP

760
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:08,109
because if I'm now trying to explain to

761
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:11,960
somebody why he would want to do the

762
00:44:08,109 --> 00:44:14,058
IGMP overlay as opposed to using pin you

763
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,280
know when when when would this be

764
00:44:14,059 --> 00:44:18,950
preferable now that we have the the pin

765
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:20,869
document as well because every every

766
00:44:18,950 --> 00:44:25,759
edge router that is doing pin obviously

767
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:27,950
also supports IGMP so hmm I addressed

768
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,260
that it seems to me if you've got hosts

769
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:32,058
connected networks not jumpy message is

770
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:33,559
basically that message now originated is

771
00:44:32,059 --> 00:44:35,059
copied up the state it's an easy

772
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,429
mechanism

773
00:44:35,059 --> 00:44:39,619
why would you depend if you had

774
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:41,299
connecting pin damage him message just

775
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,429
coming through her propagates that's not

776
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:45,079
easy to apology answer other than that

777
00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:46,099
just religion you know cuz if you're

778
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:48,769
gonna use that just as membership

779
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:50,150
signaling independent of what your edges

780
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,799
are yeah

781
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,269
I'm not certain why do you pick one over

782
00:44:51,799 --> 00:44:55,219
the other yeah and and well I think it's

783
00:44:53,269 --> 00:44:57,799
a lot more natural in pin to have

784
00:44:55,219 --> 00:45:00,049
basically this concept of the RP for ASM

785
00:44:57,799 --> 00:45:02,179
or so I mean this one to me would only

786
00:45:00,049 --> 00:45:04,489
be good if I really want to try to kill

787
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:06,019
off pin and just simply five just for

788
00:45:04,489 --> 00:45:08,089
SSM right so I mean that would be my

789
00:45:06,019 --> 00:45:08,709
first thought of what is what makes

790
00:45:08,089 --> 00:45:11,449
sense

791
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:14,928
all I'm saying right if there is any

792
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:16,429
chance to give you know guidance you

793
00:45:14,929 --> 00:45:19,929
know if people look into we can only

794
00:45:16,429 --> 00:45:22,669
implement one of it in or IGMP right so

795
00:45:19,929 --> 00:45:25,160
first right so like all I'm saying is

796
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:26,449
we're giving so many alternatives and we

797
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:28,819
want to make the you know beer

798
00:45:26,449 --> 00:45:30,499
successful so how do we kind of what

799
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:31,489
would be our guidance if people come

800
00:45:30,499 --> 00:45:32,598
back and say we can't implement

801
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:39,739
everything at once

802
00:45:32,599 --> 00:45:42,229
use BGP yeah so yeah okay two things I

803
00:45:39,739 --> 00:45:44,299
would say it this one is yeah if you are

804
00:45:42,229 --> 00:45:46,640
running beer like end to end like all

805
00:45:44,299 --> 00:45:48,769
the way to the edges you don't need even

806
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:54,469
neither PIM implementation on on the

807
00:45:48,769 --> 00:45:56,538
routers but also it's I've done it

808
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:58,219
myself it's quite easy to modify an

809
00:45:56,539 --> 00:45:59,779
existing are jumpy I didn't mean like

810
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:02,779
you need to enter it now all I'm saying

811
00:45:59,779 --> 00:46:05,059
is I think ok sure yeah no pointing to

812
00:46:02,779 --> 00:46:07,099
the other document and giving go I agree

813
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:12,079
it's good to have some guidance for

814
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:16,909
people sure yep alright so this other

815
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,799
draft so we have a RFC in PIM for this

816
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:22,009
way of flooding source information

817
00:46:18,799 --> 00:46:25,309
throughout the PIM domain and the idea

818
00:46:22,009 --> 00:46:28,279
is yeah it's described here the idea is

819
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:30,109
it's a little bit like PSR but it's like

820
00:46:28,279 --> 00:46:34,249
source information instead of our pian

821
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:36,469
or grid mappings so the idea is when I

822
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:38,779
first a browser learns to a new source

823
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:42,619
instead of sending a pin register to an

824
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:45,169
RP it would originate this PF MSD

825
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:46,999
message and that message is kind of

826
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:47,710
similar to be as far as like forwarded

827
00:46:46,999 --> 00:46:50,770
hop-by-hop

828
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:52,390
throughout the ping domain the idea is

829
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:55,089
you don't need any art piece or anything

830
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:57,339
so Allah stop router router with some it

831
00:46:55,089 --> 00:47:01,000
receiver interest can just join desk

832
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:02,619
emoji immediately so we have this four

833
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,599
pin today and it would be great if we

834
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:06,730
could work with beer as well basically

835
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,950
if you have a beer in the middle of a

836
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:11,290
ping domain like for the pim signaling

837
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,080
it would be nice if these messages can

838
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:16,990
make it through the domain and that

839
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:18,460
means that if you have let me go to the

840
00:47:16,990 --> 00:47:21,549
next slide

841
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:25,089
yeah so like in this case this this

842
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:27,130
cloud in the middle here is Weller's the

843
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:29,740
clouds the middle cloud this is a beer

844
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:31,900
domain and then you have pim domains on

845
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:33,609
each side and locked with a pin

846
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,180
signaling we would like to some pin

847
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:39,279
joints for the beer domain but if you

848
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:42,640
have but the if you are deployed PF MSD

849
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:46,240
with pim done basically you need somehow

850
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,670
to get that source active information to

851
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,200
make it through the pin domain through

852
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,970
the beer domain through the other side

853
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,500
so that you know that you should

854
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:58,868
actually send them a mask emoji join so

855
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:01,300
main purpose of this draft or one of the

856
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:03,760
main purposes is to just make sure that

857
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,380
PF MSD messages can make it through the

858
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:10,030
beer domain so you basically are flooded

859
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:11,680
not within just a ping domain on the

860
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,359
left here but they make it through to

861
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:17,700
their pin the main across the beer

862
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:17,700
domain next slide please

863
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:29,109
but this this draft has an additional

864
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:32,530
extension it's not required necessarily

865
00:48:29,109 --> 00:48:35,799
just for the bass pfm functionality but

866
00:48:32,530 --> 00:48:38,109
one of the issues with a pin overlay is

867
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:40,839
how do we determine where to send a pin

868
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:42,940
joint I know the the pin mobile a draft

869
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:46,630
supreme signaling draft has like four

870
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:48,910
different ways of doing this but I feel

871
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:51,490
like this is in some ways an easier way

872
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:55,359
of doing it but this the proposal here

873
00:48:51,490 --> 00:48:57,040
is when the beer border router between

874
00:48:55,359 --> 00:49:00,848
the pin domain and the beer domain

875
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:01,779
passes this TLB into the beer domain it

876
00:49:00,849 --> 00:49:03,940
takes the Esk

877
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:07,210
Maji haul time information that is

878
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:09,970
already in pfm but it adds a metric to

879
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:12,790
that so the idea is that these border

880
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:16,540
routers can signal how close am I to the

881
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:19,300
source and then when these messages

882
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:24,040
reaches to the right side they're to the

883
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:25,990
BF ER that can use this information if

884
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:28,950
it if it wants to join and determine

885
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:32,560
which which router should I join towards

886
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:36,819
so so I think this could be quite useful

887
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:38,799
for the Pima Valley as well by the way

888
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:41,230
in this case there's no art piece or

889
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:44,800
anything as the part of the use reason

890
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:47,950
to use pfm so to be all Eskimo he joins

891
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,820
and the rest here is just defining these

892
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:55,060
new TL amis is basically when a beer

893
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:58,810
router is forwarding pfm message into

894
00:49:55,060 --> 00:50:01,210
beer it adds it identifies itself with a

895
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:05,680
subdomain be Freddy and that stuff and

896
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:07,810
then on the next slide there is this

897
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,029
other thing where basically you can

898
00:50:07,810 --> 00:50:13,990
associate a metric with sourcing group

899
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:17,350
information think that's it maybe

900
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:20,850
there's one more slide at the end a lot

901
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:20,850
it's really really hard to read this

902
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:31,150
main thing is that you associate a

903
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:33,810
metric whether source information yeah

904
00:50:31,150 --> 00:50:36,430
presented this here once before and

905
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:43,990
didn't get much feedback last time we're

906
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:45,220
hoping to get some comments I have to

907
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:48,180
admit I'm afraid to comment because I'm

908
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:50,740
I'm still trying to get my head around

909
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:51,879
what the intent is I mean you said to

910
00:50:50,740 --> 00:50:53,709
make sure that the message got through

911
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,820
the domain well that's part of it it's

912
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:56,770
not just by getting it out the other

913
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:58,390
side yeah so it's just something they

914
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:03,130
might do it means doing with it because

915
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:05,259
so to two things one is if you have beer

916
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:08,710
in the middle between two pin domains

917
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:11,350
and you want to make use soapy FM with

918
00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,770
PIM then you need make use of it where

919
00:51:11,350 --> 00:51:15,520
you're right okay let's let's say that

920
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:18,670
someone has deployed

921
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:19,030
pfm sure and then they decide

922
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:20,770
later

923
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:24,520
oh let's upgrade part of our network to

924
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:26,320
use beer done for pfm to still work you

925
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,630
need a messages to pass through the

926
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:30,490
building and through yeah there any

927
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:32,020
additional information within the beer

928
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:34,930
domain just be extracted from that

929
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:38,650
information in the packet right so for

930
00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:41,700
so I would say the minimum I would like

931
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:45,670
the minimum functionality is for those

932
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:48,160
messages to just be encapsulated tunnel

933
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:51,220
free beers yeah that that's sufficient

934
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:53,710
for the base functionality but the other

935
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:58,839
part I'm proposing is adding these new

936
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:01,000
TVs could be useful for for you know e

937
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,190
routers the inside right where to send

938
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,650
the pin joints basically who is closest

939
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:10,930
to the source and and yeah we could come

940
00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:13,150
up also with some kind of hashing or

941
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:19,210
whatever if the metrics start the same

942
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:22,420
or something oh Jenny Saeed Abedini it's

943
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:26,110
works for peer overlay right it's used

944
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:29,620
to connect to the SG information across

945
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:32,950
the beer no man right yes I would say

946
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:35,380
it's basically if you are if you have

947
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:39,580
PIM and you have a beer in the middle

948
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:47,470
and you're deploying PIM signaling the

949
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:50,080
beer then this is this extension can be

950
00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:57,629
used for the ping signaling to decide

951
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:57,630
where to send the joints but also it

952
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:06,610
okay so they put it this way yeah if you

953
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:09,520
have deployed pfm in in PIM to begin

954
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:11,770
with and you decide I want to have beer

955
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:15,070
in the middle don't mean leave this for

956
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:20,259
pfm to function but the second part is

957
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:23,170
if you deploy him signaling overlay then

958
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:25,480
this can help help you with determining

959
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:28,280
where to send the joints what the beer

960
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:31,610
ingress router should be

961
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:36,290
and the second question is about the

962
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:38,450
word Heisman because I think if my

963
00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:41,210
understanding is right you should send

964
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:44,689
this message from the BFI I are the

965
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:50,620
egress router which is near to the sauce

966
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:57,380
so yeah so people using egress in

967
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:59,480
different ways but you see on the left

968
00:53:57,380 --> 00:54:02,900
side here these two routers are closest

969
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,900
to the source yes so we want this router

970
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:07,670
on the receiver side not to determine

971
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:08,900
which so these shouldn't send the pinyon

972
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:12,830
- yes

973
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:15,740
my question is one's the BFI are the

974
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:18,410
egress router and what has message which

975
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:21,350
what destination will it be filled at

976
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:25,359
you know it's it's it's sent to all one

977
00:54:21,350 --> 00:54:25,360
as father that sent to all be routers

978
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,700
similar to IGMP ml the overlay you just

979
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:35,080
set all the bits okay I just come from

980
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,080
it okay thank you

981
00:54:39,050 --> 00:54:44,270
a Loredana feature a technologies

982
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,859
speaking as an individual so I may be

983
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:48,770
completely lost here

984
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:52,760
you getting the metric from the AGP in

985
00:54:48,770 --> 00:54:54,710
the beer domain true so this guy will

986
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:57,020
use the metric in this domain on the

987
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:59,410
left side here whatever our GP metric it

988
00:54:57,020 --> 00:55:01,190
has to the source yeah right but as a

989
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:03,080
information goes through the beer domain

990
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,570
on the other side the metric is the

991
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:07,910
metric through the beer Duane so the

992
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:11,180
question I really okay so when you

993
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:13,549
receive so the TV's are not modified as

994
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:15,560
they passed through the beer domain so

995
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:17,600
when this guy on the right receives the

996
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:21,049
message it will contain a metric that

997
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,910
was seen by this guy over here so I

998
00:55:21,050 --> 00:55:25,250
guess what you want to do is small s

999
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:27,379
maybe look at what is your what is your

1000
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:30,940
magic to this guy across the beer domain

1001
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:34,510
and add that to the perhaps telemetric

1002
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:34,510
if you see what I mean

1003
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,020
what it says currently I think it's just

1004
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:42,419
useful join whatever is closest to the

1005
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,310
source here but yeah it makes sense to

1006
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:45,510
consider the metric inside the be okay

1007
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,430
so the real question that I have is

1008
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:49,800
before when sandy talked about her

1009
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,600
multiple the main things you asked if

1010
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,250
you could pass through their British you

1011
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:56,430
should point other tlbs

1012
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:57,630
maybe like this one right of course as

1013
00:55:56,430 --> 00:56:01,169
you pass through the British period when

1014
00:55:57,630 --> 00:56:03,960
you're going through multiple areas that

1015
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:08,850
have different metrics potentially even

1016
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,710
different routing protocols right so it

1017
00:56:08,850 --> 00:56:13,259
sounds that if you were to pass that

1018
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:14,730
through that point and you used the

1019
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:16,350
metric inside of your domain that it

1020
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:18,930
would be kinda weird right because maybe

1021
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:20,839
you have OSPF here where the 28 is is

1022
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:23,790
was a metrical mm and the other side and

1023
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:26,580
then your actual opinion cloud there is

1024
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:33,210
I don't know something else so what do

1025
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:38,040
you do and I know that Sandy's draft is

1026
00:56:33,210 --> 00:56:46,260
not yeah but from the support earlier it

1027
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:50,509
sounds like yeah so there say but

1028
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:56,040
they're saying a functionality in BGP

1029
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:58,050
called I think a GP correct which tries

1030
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,350
to do the same thing and tries to carry

1031
00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:03,330
a metric across multiple a SS and so

1032
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,779
it's called the accumulated geometric or

1033
00:57:03,330 --> 00:57:05,850
something like that

1034
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,800
so maybe look at that because that I

1035
00:57:05,850 --> 00:57:09,180
think they they did it on purpose so

1036
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:11,010
that you can have multiplies you peace

1037
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:12,569
and calm places and then sort of

1038
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:14,370
accumulate the metric because if you

1039
00:57:12,570 --> 00:57:16,560
want the closest right the closest is

1040
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:18,120
not always gonna be whoever gave me the

1041
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:20,549
route right

1042
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:22,440
it may be yes well said it may be that

1043
00:57:20,550 --> 00:57:25,260
one goes across never in a criss cross

1044
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,740
or something so take a look at that okay

1045
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:30,540
yeah sure

1046
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:33,000
okay thanks just or semi-solid he just

1047
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:36,509
four hours question and we think that we

1048
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:40,080
will get the metric from many ways as

1049
00:57:36,510 --> 00:57:43,500
such as ITP opt P or something else

1050
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:46,560
and maybe we can configure with the and

1051
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:48,890
by the administrator to concur with the

1052
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:52,999
metric across I yes

1053
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:57,098
so maybe we have a dissection to explain

1054
00:57:52,999 --> 00:57:59,959
it in the draft right yeah thank you

1055
00:57:57,099 --> 00:58:02,509
yeah I would also say one thing to

1056
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,210
consider is I mean haven't thought much

1057
00:58:02,509 --> 00:58:07,489
about this but could potentially you

1058
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:10,190
know just have a simple draft that just

1059
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:13,369
defines two simp the basic bf mo a beer

1060
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:16,130
which is sufficient for just a pimp

1061
00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:18,279
functionality this stuff for the metrics

1062
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:20,660
and stuff that would be you know

1063
00:58:18,279 --> 00:58:23,239
potentially something additional if we

1064
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:25,670
feel feel is useful but need to think

1065
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:33,140
more about whether yeah you need to do

1066
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:37,160
that or not yeah yeah questions or wish

1067
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:42,519
dad we're dead there all right yeah

1068
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:45,200
right alright so I guess I'm just happy

1069
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,598
you guys want to read the draft and give

1070
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:49,759
me feedback get some discussion on the

1071
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:53,809
list and I'll think more about the

1072
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:56,509
metrics and yeah as you made you maybe

1073
00:58:53,809 --> 00:58:58,640
split them right if you need if you need

1074
00:58:56,509 --> 00:59:00,559
the just the compliance to get the

1075
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,118
message through the domain I have a film

1076
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:10,430
which probably separate those except

1077
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:26,900
yeah yeah excellent mixtape we got flex

1078
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:28,609
I'll go you say good morning montgome

1079
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:31,700
know from Cisco Systems I will be

1080
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:33,739
talking about flex L go for beer and in

1081
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,419
the current 0th person of the draft Rick

1082
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:37,720
is more of problem statement that what

1083
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:41,089
we are trying to solve so we have seen

1084
00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:44,269
many requirement where network has been

1085
00:59:41,089 --> 00:59:46,549
sliced using IG v flex L go and each of

1086
00:59:44,269 --> 00:59:48,379
the slice is has different kind of

1087
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:50,420
capability it could be maybe

1088
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:54,890
high-bandwidth low-latency or anything

1089
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:57,259
else and how are we going to use beer or

1090
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:59,058
how are we going to use flex l go in the

1091
00:59:57,259 --> 01:00:02,760
beer domain that is what this document

1092
00:59:59,059 --> 01:00:08,220
is intended to talk about and right now

1093
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:10,440
one of the mechanism I think we can one

1094
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:13,439
of the mechanism which we are thinking

1095
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:17,460
about is having sub-domain per slice our

1096
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,900
/ I GP algorithm and we will we'll be

1097
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:23,030
using are extending the procedure

1098
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:30,599
defined in the beer bar IPA draft and

1099
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:31,920
which will handle this mechanism and it

1100
01:00:30,599 --> 01:00:34,619
is just for example it's showing that

1101
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:38,010
each in case of MPLS data plane you get

1102
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:41,520
label for sub domain or per slice and it

1103
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:49,670
can be used so IGP extension will be

1104
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:53,369
used to distribute these information so

1105
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:55,859
that's all and the more detail will be

1106
01:00:53,369 --> 01:01:00,420
added for the next IETF with all the

1107
01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:02,759
really related extensions going ochio

1108
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:04,470
yet this is definitely interesting right

1109
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:06,900
something that we need to definitely

1110
01:01:04,470 --> 01:01:08,759
work on in the field working group and

1111
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:11,099
you know as we had conversation

1112
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:13,260
previously I can see the sub domain

1113
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:16,710
feeling very nicely because it's just

1114
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:19,740
the way that you know beer is design the

1115
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:21,690
label I I wasn't sure if I could get my

1116
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:26,549
head around it like to mean like a label

1117
01:01:21,690 --> 01:01:28,589
is a sub domain concept anyway so with

1118
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,300
that one I think we need to do a bit

1119
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:33,960
more thinking but they are definitely

1120
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:37,950
something interesting here yeah Tony

1121
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:40,589
King yeah so this is just right coupling

1122
01:01:37,950 --> 01:01:42,419
the way it's supposed to be used is how

1123
01:01:40,589 --> 01:01:44,009
the algorithm done and manage is you

1124
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:46,230
know not that important you have this

1125
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:48,000
bar and you know the IPA concept to like

1126
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:51,630
pick up all over long run a completely

1127
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,420
different computation yes i cisco made a

1128
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:56,730
clarification so the label just

1129
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:59,099
describes the best idea right so yes

1130
01:01:56,730 --> 01:02:02,339
this combination of you know subdomain

1131
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:04,109
set missing length right that you sign

1132
01:02:02,339 --> 01:02:11,310
label to that combination that's what it

1133
01:02:04,109 --> 01:02:13,759
is maybe my question has be over the

1134
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:17,509
producer a president Eyring because

1135
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:20,680
I because we use we know that a beer use

1136
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:23,990
ITC as under a protocol so we know that

1137
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:26,810
blacks echo has been implemented during

1138
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:31,129
the IDP expansion so the secret we just

1139
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:34,910
you can I use this ITP extension the

1140
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:39,140
underlay to achieve the ago for the

1141
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:42,589
leaders changing that include the

1142
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:45,740
panelists or something else right so I'm

1143
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:49,340
not know I don't understand much more

1144
01:02:45,740 --> 01:02:53,509
should be doing in beer itself right we

1145
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:56,510
just follow the IDP of college as peer

1146
01:02:53,510 --> 01:02:59,150
for calculation for the Flex echo

1147
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:02,870
so we just give the result under me if

1148
01:02:59,150 --> 01:03:06,500
we if you really need some extension in

1149
01:03:02,870 --> 01:03:08,359
beer itself to support edge so I GP your

1150
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:10,730
flexible extension is going to give you

1151
01:03:08,360 --> 01:03:12,920
the slice but how are you going to

1152
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:16,160
inject from the ingress at which part it

1153
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:19,400
has to go you know there will be are

1154
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:26,500
making from the subdomain or something

1155
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:26,500
else is talking about okay thank you

1156
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:37,670
thank you any other questions

1157
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:39,200
so who's read this rap we had one called

1158
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:40,700
mics and this is work should be done who

1159
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:45,319
thinks he should be adopted and picked

1160
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:49,629
up in the group same hands another six

1161
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,680
or eight excellent

1162
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:58,450
alright we're bouncing a little quick

1163
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:58,450
which is nice and we are on a VPN

1164
01:04:05,390 --> 01:04:08,469
[Music]

1165
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,550
right there oh yeah I think it's my

1166
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,370
mistake

1167
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:21,090
yeah the trough name is no longer that

1168
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:26,549
oh yeah anyway it's I just pulled my

1169
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:28,670
navigator anyway good morning Carolyn

1170
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:31,530
presenting this on behalf of my authors

1171
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:35,490
Jeffrey has presented this a couple of

1172
01:04:31,530 --> 01:04:37,410
times already and the idea is to to have

1173
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:42,509
beer for evpn services

1174
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:44,279
so after RFC 85 56 it feels so many

1175
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:48,750
natural to bring together the beauty of

1176
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,570
Vivi PNM beer so this is about having

1177
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:55,590
beer as a provider tunnel for a VPN

1178
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:58,250
traffic European not only IP multicast

1179
01:04:55,590 --> 01:05:01,830
on a VPN but in general bump traffic

1180
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:04,440
it's very similar to a beer for um VPN

1181
01:05:01,830 --> 01:05:08,240
and actually some of the the text is

1182
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:12,060
taken from RFC 85 56 there are some

1183
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:13,859
European specific aspects that are

1184
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:17,790
described here things like a leaf

1185
01:05:13,860 --> 01:05:19,110
tracking some you know stuff related to

1186
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:24,090
data planes and how you handle

1187
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:27,080
multihoming and segmentation stuff so we

1188
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:27,080
go to the next slide please

1189
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:34,080
yeah the way we encode the beer

1190
01:05:31,470 --> 01:05:38,459
information there are no surprises here

1191
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:40,440
it's pretty similar to end VPN we we put

1192
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,120
everything on the on the PTA in the

1193
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:46,500
premise I attend a lot to get that we

1194
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:49,020
advertise along with I met route and SP

1195
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:54,200
MC 80 routes which are they equivalent

1196
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:58,259
routes to MVP an IPM CNS pmcid routes so

1197
01:05:54,200 --> 01:06:01,680
same kind of information from an EVP in

1198
01:05:58,260 --> 01:06:04,020
perspective PR tunnel is just like you

1199
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:06,299
know an aggregate tunnel so we need an

1200
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:08,340
extra piece of information for the

1201
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:11,190
multiplexing the traffic at the egress

1202
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:14,970
that's a that goes India in the label

1203
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:16,760
that's an upswing assign label by the

1204
01:06:14,970 --> 01:06:19,490
via fire

1205
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,640
and it's identifying what to do a day a

1206
01:06:19,490 --> 01:06:24,649
day is pretty much the bridge table if

1207
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:29,089
you have any VPN service or if you have

1208
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:31,550
an ABR a a SBR the dip into the MC you

1209
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:36,100
also have some facts that we use for

1210
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:40,580
leaf tracking if we go to the next slide

1211
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:44,509
so yeah lifter about leaf tracking we

1212
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:47,330
use if you have pure lair to bump

1213
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:49,670
traffic we you know the I met routes are

1214
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:52,940
enough to do the tractor the Leafs

1215
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:55,700
where you need to send an information if

1216
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:58,130
you have IP multicast if you are

1217
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,580
snooping and using proxy and the VPN

1218
01:06:58,130 --> 01:07:05,780
services you use the esmad routes the

1219
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:08,540
EVP and routes type 6 in some cases you

1220
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:10,430
do you may want to do some optimizations

1221
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:13,279
if you don't want to send Asma crowds

1222
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:15,379
you know for every single flow and in

1223
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,440
such a case we also have in Indian as

1224
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:21,410
BMC routes and leaf routes so that you

1225
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:24,440
can do some tracking so you can have

1226
01:07:21,410 --> 01:07:27,589
some kind of mix between you know an

1227
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:31,310
estimate per flow or then you can track

1228
01:07:27,590 --> 01:07:34,390
you know depending on how much flooding

1229
01:07:31,310 --> 01:07:36,009
versus control plane routes you want

1230
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:38,839
next slide please

1231
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:41,900
the other aspect that we are looking at

1232
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:45,470
in this trough is because II VPN works

1233
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:49,400
for IP overlay talents or MPLS tunnels

1234
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:52,609
we also defining how to you know how the

1235
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,740
data plane works with beer so in the

1236
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:56,840
first case if you're using IP overlay

1237
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:00,200
tunnels like the expand and V GRE or

1238
01:07:56,840 --> 01:08:02,810
genève basically you will have the beer

1239
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,660
header and immediately after you will

1240
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:07,370
have to the exam or NV grea genève

1241
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:09,589
header and then you will have the

1242
01:08:07,370 --> 01:08:14,569
payload which is always an Ethernet

1243
01:08:09,590 --> 01:08:17,380
frame there is no IP UDP header before

1244
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:19,580
the for instance the VX and header and

1245
01:08:17,380 --> 01:08:21,650
the reason why is because you already

1246
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:23,540
have a maybe or Heather you know the

1247
01:08:21,649 --> 01:08:28,149
information about what the next header

1248
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:32,170
is so we we save some overhead with this

1249
01:08:28,149 --> 01:08:33,910
and when we use this along with all

1250
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:35,470
active multihoming there is something

1251
01:08:33,910 --> 01:08:37,210
called esprit Corizon that you need in

1252
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:42,130
elective multikill meaning in order to

1253
01:08:37,210 --> 01:08:44,350
avoid loops for bump traffic and here

1254
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:48,130
because in the beer header you have the

1255
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:50,140
V F IR ID so you know what the source of

1256
01:08:48,130 --> 01:08:54,460
the traffic is you so you can apply a

1257
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:58,270
splitter aizen just in the same case you

1258
01:08:54,460 --> 01:09:01,950
would do with other tunnels in in the

1259
01:08:58,270 --> 01:09:05,530
case of MPLS we have the beer header and

1260
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:08,679
immediately below that you have an MPLS

1261
01:09:05,529 --> 01:09:11,080
label to identify the bridge table and

1262
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:14,320
you may have a know yet another label to

1263
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:17,740
identify the source ESI of the of the

1264
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:21,160
packet that is also used for a splitter

1265
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:24,219
isin with all active multihoming next

1266
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:26,950
slide please so the drop also talks

1267
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:28,990
about segmentation which may be used in

1268
01:09:26,950 --> 01:09:32,349
certain situations for instance when you

1269
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:35,380
you want to use different tunnel types

1270
01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:38,890
in different areas or autonomous systems

1271
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:41,620
but you can also use this in a larger

1272
01:09:38,890 --> 01:09:43,690
peer domain to divide it into you know

1273
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:47,290
multiples mail and smaller subdomains

1274
01:09:43,689 --> 01:09:50,889
and when you do this segmentation on the

1275
01:09:47,290 --> 01:09:54,220
ABR ASPRS as usual you need to change or

1276
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:59,220
to update the PTA on the I met or or

1277
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:59,220
this beam surrounds so next slide please

1278
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:06,670
whoops sorry about that in the air

1279
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:09,099
slides it was looking okay anyway so

1280
01:10:06,670 --> 01:10:13,690
what the the title of this slide says is

1281
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:17,080
what is new in the revision 0-2 so what

1282
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:21,309
we added there was a discussion on the

1283
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:24,700
mailing list and basically when you are

1284
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:29,800
using this along with IP overlay tunnels

1285
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:32,860
and and you want to use PHP a couple of

1286
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:34,960
slides ago I was saying that for for

1287
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:39,639
instance for VX LAN we don't use an IP

1288
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:41,709
UDP header after the beer header however

1289
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:44,979
if you do PHP

1290
01:10:41,709 --> 01:10:47,619
basically you remove the beer Heather as

1291
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:50,949
well so you may end up with you know

1292
01:10:47,619 --> 01:10:53,949
packets without beer header or IP UDP

1293
01:10:50,949 --> 01:10:55,598
and just with the VX LAN header and

1294
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:58,388
getting to the egress note so there is

1295
01:10:55,599 --> 01:11:00,909
no wouldn't understand what that is so

1296
01:10:58,389 --> 01:11:04,599
what we are saying this revision of the

1297
01:11:00,909 --> 01:11:08,259
draft is if you are gonna use PHP you

1298
01:11:04,599 --> 01:11:13,300
must add an IP UDP header before the VX

1299
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:17,409
on header now once you do that you need

1300
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:18,939
an IP DA in that IP header so which one

1301
01:11:17,409 --> 01:11:21,728
to use is something that you can

1302
01:11:18,939 --> 01:11:25,329
statically configured at a ingress P so

1303
01:11:21,729 --> 01:11:27,880
that you you know what to expect or we

1304
01:11:25,329 --> 01:11:30,459
added this auxilary information on the

1305
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:35,320
PTA where you can actually add a tunnel

1306
01:11:30,459 --> 01:11:38,979
encapsulation TLV defining what their IP

1307
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:42,999
das as an IP multicast address so you

1308
01:11:38,979 --> 01:11:45,179
have both just pretty much next slide

1309
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:45,179
please

1310
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:53,469
so next steps is to request request for

1311
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,510
feedback about this version and after

1312
01:11:53,469 --> 01:11:59,409
that we really believe the document is

1313
01:11:55,510 --> 01:12:02,670
ready to progress working the classical

1314
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:05,499
who's read the dawkins current form

1315
01:12:02,670 --> 01:12:08,800
we've got keep your hands up not too

1316
01:12:05,499 --> 01:12:11,170
many all right who thinks just ready for

1317
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:14,949
last call based on those who read it you

1318
01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:17,650
got a comment all right good I'm calm

1319
01:12:14,949 --> 01:12:20,138
now from Cisco Systems so I'm not sure I

1320
01:12:17,650 --> 01:12:23,888
followed it in best so by any chance we

1321
01:12:20,139 --> 01:12:25,539
have presented it our took this document

1322
01:12:23,889 --> 01:12:26,860
to best as well because it's more of any

1323
01:12:25,539 --> 01:12:29,170
pin construct so when we are doing

1324
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:34,268
logical it might be good to involve this

1325
01:12:29,170 --> 01:12:38,610
as some script make sense Thanks prepare

1326
01:12:34,269 --> 01:12:38,610
slides please enjoy your soil and by Pia

1327
01:12:38,939 --> 01:12:45,459
ICU fashion is the the eternal

1328
01:12:42,039 --> 01:12:47,800
encapsulation start here right so what

1329
01:12:45,459 --> 01:12:50,289
we will do we will inherit all the

1330
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:52,800
encapsulation tabs from this structure

1331
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:56,460
or we will define the

1332
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:58,409
type 4 for this tunnel because I only

1333
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:00,230
see three tunnels are mentioning

1334
01:12:58,409 --> 01:13:03,659
attractor right now

1335
01:13:00,230 --> 01:13:06,598
such as the Geneva and the explained and

1336
01:13:03,659 --> 01:13:08,820
a median but so we know that the as many

1337
01:13:06,599 --> 01:13:12,150
internal taps are defined you know the

1338
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:16,170
tunnel encapsulation charge so if we

1339
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:19,289
really expanded this job to include all

1340
01:13:16,170 --> 01:13:22,619
the tunnels here or just only mentioned

1341
01:13:19,289 --> 01:13:26,400
we just only use the string types is to

1342
01:13:22,619 --> 01:13:28,920
heat interaction so the new piece of

1343
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,539
information we are interested in as it's

1344
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:32,929
really the IP destination address

1345
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:35,820
because normally in any VPN you already

1346
01:13:32,929 --> 01:13:38,670
send the I met routes or the MC routes

1347
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:40,920
with PGP encapsulation as extended

1348
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:43,679
community that is telling you whether

1349
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:47,849
they you know the tunnel is the exam or

1350
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:53,250
I'm pls or whatever so I do not think

1351
01:13:47,849 --> 01:13:55,650
that is necessary so but yeah I mean in

1352
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:58,889
theory with any IP overlay tunnel you

1353
01:13:55,650 --> 01:14:07,110
couldn't include the the code point and

1354
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:09,840
the IP destination address because you

1355
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:13,289
know that the idea of encapsulation

1356
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:15,119
dropped we will expand all the tunnels

1357
01:14:13,289 --> 01:14:17,219
information through the community

1358
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:20,219
extension right and it will be stagnant

1359
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:23,099
by PDP protocol and it can also be used

1360
01:14:20,219 --> 01:14:26,369
in unity on right now then because of

1361
01:14:23,099 --> 01:14:29,130
our maybe some we only used some the

1362
01:14:26,369 --> 01:14:31,589
listed three types for the Edward

1363
01:14:29,130 --> 01:14:35,010
husband and the use it for the

1364
01:14:31,590 --> 01:14:38,880
encapsulation that because the the main

1365
01:14:35,010 --> 01:14:41,099
idea of of you is to use the tunnel

1366
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,280
encapsulations of all the data packet

1367
01:14:41,099 --> 01:14:46,619
and right now right you want to use the

1368
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:48,389
tunnel encapsulation folder data packet

1369
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:50,308
and there's many

1370
01:14:48,389 --> 01:14:52,559
tunnel encapsulation function can be

1371
01:14:50,309 --> 01:14:58,110
used to encapsulate adopt a capacitor

1372
01:14:52,559 --> 01:15:03,150
right so so so my question is if we only

1373
01:14:58,110 --> 01:15:05,839
define three kind types panel here so if

1374
01:15:03,150 --> 01:15:09,110
we only support three types

1375
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,540
and after is a beer Heather because it's

1376
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:15,019
a community just sitting there next to

1377
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:17,420
protocol right this is mainly based on

1378
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:22,670
the air they work we've done on best

1379
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:26,480
basa we've defined evpn documents for IP

1380
01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:28,820
overlay channels and MPLS towns before

1381
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:32,959
IP overlay tenants it's mainly RFC 80

1382
01:15:28,820 --> 01:15:37,400
365 and defines VX LAN and the GRE

1383
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:40,250
there is also document for Geneva and

1384
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,089
now we also have a document for us our

1385
01:15:40,250 --> 01:15:46,760
v6 so those are pretty much the IP

1386
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:50,360
encapsulations so that's why this draft

1387
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:54,710
is focusing on on those right ok so if

1388
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:56,960
you're missing something you're because

1389
01:15:54,710 --> 01:16:01,040
the other encapsulation can be inherited

1390
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:03,800
from the IP or UDP header every how you

1391
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:06,320
get the information from the IP UDP

1392
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:09,770
header yeah yeah and this this is only

1393
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,410
optional you can always yeah of course

1394
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:13,490
you need the IP UDP header and then you

1395
01:16:12,410 --> 01:16:16,180
can always for the IP destination

1396
01:16:13,490 --> 01:16:24,920
address you can always configure it

1397
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:27,410
thank you Thank You Laura Thunder Oh

1398
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:30,170
Andy gonna ask after Sandy's question

1399
01:16:27,410 --> 01:16:32,809
live away so I think what she means is

1400
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:35,450
that the TLV has a bunch of other stuff

1401
01:16:32,810 --> 01:16:37,520
that you don't care about so even if

1402
01:16:35,450 --> 01:16:43,040
it's optional what happens if the tunnel

1403
01:16:37,520 --> 01:16:46,490
type is something else so eventually

1404
01:16:43,040 --> 01:16:48,110
when you specify this please write in

1405
01:16:46,490 --> 01:16:50,630
the draft what should happen when you if

1406
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:52,490
you receive that TLB with some tongs I

1407
01:16:50,630 --> 01:16:54,770
does not support it mm-hmm what should

1408
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:56,450
you do yeah that's unfair

1409
01:16:54,770 --> 01:17:03,880
we can we can add more text how about

1410
01:16:56,450 --> 01:17:03,880
that yeah thank you you're the questions

1411
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:10,679
whose will went through the count

1412
01:17:07,330 --> 01:17:13,480
already right did account a new

1413
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:17,710
read/write sim guys all right all right

1414
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:28,240
thank you very much thank you it was

1415
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:33,520
like four and four yeah blue shoes

1416
01:17:28,240 --> 01:17:37,480
are there any blue shoes in the room no

1417
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:40,620
blue shoes look at that sandals and

1418
01:17:37,480 --> 01:17:40,620
socks the German Way

1419
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:55,060
thank you to Arles I know you comply

1420
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:58,810
okay so we have a working group last

1421
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:01,330
called since 104 still looking for you

1422
01:17:58,810 --> 01:18:04,300
know additional reviews please check at

1423
01:18:01,330 --> 01:18:07,330
it last time we were at 103 oh sorry

1424
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:09,340
zero three now we're there are five with

1425
01:18:07,330 --> 01:18:11,650
the review feedback a little bit more

1426
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:15,280
from a dirt but already done or three

1427
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:17,429
and a great review from Jeffrey so right

1428
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,440
now I think we're standing at five

1429
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:22,450
approvals to move on Jeffrey hadn't come

1430
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:24,429
back after all five so probably been too

1431
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:26,530
busy and missing here in action

1432
01:18:24,430 --> 01:18:28,330
unfortunately just as chair that land

1433
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:30,759
that that thread was just like this week

1434
01:18:28,330 --> 01:18:33,130
or last week too right was it well not

1435
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:34,930
obviously more than two weeks ago before

1436
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:43,030
they for us yeah before

1437
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:45,430
okay okay next slide okay so so

1438
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:47,230
basically in the introduction we so all

1439
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:49,690
the changes are non-functional they're

1440
01:18:47,230 --> 01:18:51,790
all you know trying to improve the

1441
01:18:49,690 --> 01:18:54,309
readability and the explanations given

1442
01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:57,070
on some of the more complex topics so

1443
01:18:54,310 --> 01:18:59,050
one of the things we actually been brain

1444
01:18:57,070 --> 01:19:01,570
some a little bit in role was also using

1445
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:04,330
a bloom filter so there is a reference

1446
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:06,790
there just to related work that had been

1447
01:19:04,330 --> 01:19:09,130
starting with bloom filters and you know

1448
01:19:06,790 --> 01:19:14,380
why we're not using bloom filters here

1449
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:16,600
in Beauty then people didn't like the

1450
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:19,240
the word layers for you know the picture

1451
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:22,120
showing so this is not called components

1452
01:19:19,240 --> 01:19:25,210
you know beauty controller and the

1453
01:19:22,120 --> 01:19:27,220
routing overlay sorry routing underlay

1454
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:31,690
and so on so just you know using term

1455
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:35,140
components likewise a reference to this

1456
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:37,690
beer multicast HTTP response draft that

1457
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:39,940
we have describing you know HTTP and

1458
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:42,309
beer te as a use case for the flow

1459
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:45,759
overlay signaling mechanisms because

1460
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:49,090
that's what we're using there there was

1461
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:51,430
a section 3.4 with with the initial big

1462
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:54,640
purity forwarding example you know two

1463
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:57,460
people said that there there was a need

1464
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:01,300
earlier in the document to do something

1465
01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:05,200
so in all three we had added a bigger to

1466
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:08,320
new examples and so this old staff stuff

1467
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,970
is meant to be removed by RFC editor

1468
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,769
unless you know any other reviewer

1469
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:17,410
chimes in and says no I also want to

1470
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:18,490
keep this old example next ok so then

1471
01:20:17,410 --> 01:20:21,340
leave paprs

1472
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:24,010
so oh no now I'm going to kill the

1473
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:26,110
remote audience by going here

1474
01:20:24,010 --> 01:20:28,170
so basically edit this picture here to

1475
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:31,900
explain better the difference between a

1476
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:34,720
normal B fer that can be a transit

1477
01:20:31,900 --> 01:20:37,440
device so this is basically you're

1478
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:43,740
saying I should try to stay in the cage

1479
01:20:37,440 --> 01:20:43,740
and okay alright okay

1480
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:49,150
so right so so you see this is what you

1481
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:51,580
know in service provider terms we call a

1482
01:20:49,150 --> 01:20:54,309
u-turn attachment where you have the two

1483
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:56,410
PE nodes attaching to two P notes to

1484
01:20:54,310 --> 01:20:58,780
reduce the total number of Link's we

1485
01:20:56,410 --> 01:21:01,210
need this is the more traditional more

1486
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:05,200
expensive PE attachment in this case

1487
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:07,230
this PE can be transit for traffic from

1488
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:10,120
that P node all the way to this P node

1489
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:12,280
and so that basically means we need to

1490
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:15,340
allocate individual bits for these two

1491
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:17,980
peas whereas these being leaf nodes we

1492
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:23,650
only need to attach Beauty bits for the

1493
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:25,120
four links therefore saving bits and so

1494
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:27,460
this is now hopefully a lot clearer

1495
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:29,410
through the picture and obviously for

1496
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:31,360
these nodes never to become transit

1497
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:33,639
nodes the routing protocol of course

1498
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:35,860
also has to be configured accordingly

1499
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,630
in case of link failure there can be no

1500
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:40,570
transit traffic through the PE also

1501
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:42,310
standard way on how in such a network

1502
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:43,900
you would do it because obviously these

1503
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:50,380
links are not meant to have enough

1504
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:54,339
capacity for transit traffic next so

1505
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:57,310
then also the the somewhat compressed

1506
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:58,150
form of representing B IFT entries for

1507
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:00,460
ecmp

1508
01:21:58,150 --> 01:22:02,440
what this stuff meant seemed to haven't

1509
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:04,510
been clear enough so through the

1510
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:06,370
document where many of these where

1511
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:08,680
they've been expanded into saying we're

1512
01:22:06,370 --> 01:22:10,960
doing an EC and P over you know multiple

1513
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,940
different direct neighbor ships forward

1514
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:15,520
connected layer to adjacency and

1515
01:22:12,940 --> 01:22:18,460
basically the EC MP is picking based on

1516
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:22,120
the seat one of those so hopefully this

1517
01:22:18,460 --> 01:22:24,630
is a lot better readable now oh yeah and

1518
01:22:22,120 --> 01:22:27,010
they have been spoke at an explanation

1519
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:28,840
how basically there happens book is kind

1520
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:30,640
of you know a flood optimization because

1521
01:22:28,840 --> 01:22:33,640
we've seen a lot of you know deployments

1522
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:35,680
with multicast you know for TV services

1523
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:37,570
where you knew all this program stuff

1524
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,370
needs to be flooded to all the next a

1525
01:22:37,570 --> 01:22:41,650
layer in the network let's say the the

1526
01:22:39,370 --> 01:22:44,349
next aggregation stuff so you can really

1527
01:22:41,650 --> 01:22:45,910
assign a single bit to all the spoke

1528
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:51,400
links because everything needs to be

1529
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:52,990
flooded next slide so then the EC and P

1530
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:54,730
stuff obviously you know the whole

1531
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:58,950
polarization stuff is always the most

1532
01:22:54,730 --> 01:23:02,169
complicated thing to to work through so

1533
01:22:58,950 --> 01:23:04,090
the text is refined in O five now saying

1534
01:23:02,170 --> 01:23:06,310
that we don't need to standardize the

1535
01:23:04,090 --> 01:23:09,550
ecmp algorithm but obviously it needs to

1536
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:11,170
be documented so that the the

1537
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:15,580
proprietary mechanism needs to be

1538
01:23:11,170 --> 01:23:18,250
documented so that the controller can

1539
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:21,010
calculate the e CMP decision and there

1540
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:23,200
is an example of an algorithm given so

1541
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:24,880
basically when you have a packet and you

1542
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:27,700
have an EC and P for a bunch of

1543
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:30,070
adjacencies with a particular seat the

1544
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,080
most classical algorithms being used in

1545
01:23:30,070 --> 01:23:35,559
the industry is that you take the

1546
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:37,540
entropy from the beer header your XOR

1547
01:23:35,560 --> 01:23:39,850
that with the seat and then you do a

1548
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:42,130
modulo by the number of adjacent seats

1549
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:45,700
you have and then you forward it to the

1550
01:23:42,130 --> 01:23:47,320
resulting adjacency from 0 to n minus 1

1551
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:53,949
right so that's basically this

1552
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:56,170
predictable form of you know modulo ecmp

1553
01:23:53,949 --> 01:23:58,900
that's done very often also classical in

1554
01:23:56,170 --> 01:24:01,389
IP multicast and the whole point here

1555
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:03,879
was to have the seed so that in

1556
01:24:01,389 --> 01:24:06,460
different stages of this forwarding you

1557
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:09,179
can configure the ecmp to use a

1558
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:12,400
different seat and therefore avoid this

1559
01:24:09,179 --> 01:24:14,199
typical multistage ecmp polarization

1560
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:16,388
problem that for example because

1561
01:24:14,199 --> 01:24:17,980
everything goes left here in the next

1562
01:24:16,389 --> 01:24:19,719
stage that also goes left here so

1563
01:24:17,980 --> 01:24:25,570
nothing ever goes on this link for

1564
01:24:19,719 --> 01:24:27,460
example okay next one then that was also

1565
01:24:25,570 --> 01:24:28,840
routed adjacency so in the introduction

1566
01:24:27,460 --> 01:24:30,730
in the beginning there was an

1567
01:24:28,840 --> 01:24:34,329
explanation that routed adjacencies are

1568
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:37,089
kind of like this you know I'm not using

1569
01:24:34,329 --> 01:24:38,889
the terminology segments from SR but

1570
01:24:37,090 --> 01:24:40,420
kind of the the line of thought is the

1571
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:42,310
same that you're kind of jumping over

1572
01:24:40,420 --> 01:24:44,550
points where you don't need to do

1573
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:47,170
routing and you're only interested to

1574
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:49,690
specify on which kind of note or

1575
01:24:47,170 --> 01:24:51,429
interface on the next point where you

1576
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:53,169
want to continue your traffic steering

1577
01:24:51,429 --> 01:24:55,710
you want to come out and this whole

1578
01:24:53,170 --> 01:24:58,060
picture seemed in the review from

1579
01:24:55,710 --> 01:25:00,130
Jeffery to be too confusing so I

1580
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:01,389
simplified it just having one stage here

1581
01:25:00,130 --> 01:25:03,520
right you're on one of these ingress

1582
01:25:01,389 --> 01:25:05,409
routers you want to get across this and

1583
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:07,750
you have these two different cases like

1584
01:25:05,409 --> 01:25:09,670
I want to get into this next hop across

1585
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:11,440
one of these two interfaces so those are

1586
01:25:09,670 --> 01:25:14,770
two bits or I just want to get into this

1587
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:16,360
node so basically my bit is assigned to

1588
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:18,460
the node logically and loopback

1589
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:20,920
interface so pretty much the same what

1590
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:24,639
we're doing in SR so hopefully this is

1591
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:29,469
now clearer by being simplified next

1592
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:31,810
slide so then at the end of the whole

1593
01:25:29,469 --> 01:25:35,170
section for which is all these

1594
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:40,030
optimizations for the PC controller and

1595
01:25:35,170 --> 01:25:43,090
br-2 e to minimize the number of bit

1596
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:45,519
positions is this stuff that I was

1597
01:25:43,090 --> 01:25:47,409
trying to avoid in before because it's

1598
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:50,320
kind of the most complicated one in

1599
01:25:47,409 --> 01:25:53,650
that's kind of how can I reuse bps in a

1600
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:55,360
peer to e environment in a general

1601
01:25:53,650 --> 01:25:57,549
fashion and the general fashion of

1602
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:59,230
course is I cannot reuse a bit position

1603
01:25:57,550 --> 01:26:00,400
multiple times along the same path

1604
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:02,199
because it

1605
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:04,210
have been cleared the first time you use

1606
01:26:02,199 --> 01:26:05,830
it but you can of course reuse bit

1607
01:26:04,210 --> 01:26:07,840
positions when you can calculate that

1608
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:10,030
they'll always only happen in parallel

1609
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:11,890
across different branches of a tree

1610
01:26:10,030 --> 01:26:13,360
right so you're basically saying here

1611
01:26:11,890 --> 01:26:15,070
I'm setting bit five and then

1612
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:15,610
replication happens and somewhere down

1613
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,590
here

1614
01:26:15,610 --> 01:26:19,210
you're always reusing the same five so

1615
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:21,610
in structured networks for example at

1616
01:26:19,210 --> 01:26:24,370
the edge of interfaces toward different

1617
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:26,920
areas those are kind of replications

1618
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:28,690
where you can save a lot of bits when

1619
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,730
you when you have it very structured and

1620
01:26:28,690 --> 01:26:32,799
you're replicating first and then the

1621
01:26:30,730 --> 01:26:34,509
same bit will achieve the same kind of

1622
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:37,870
traffic engineering further down in each

1623
01:26:34,510 --> 01:26:40,420
area so that was kind of added because

1624
01:26:37,870 --> 01:26:44,409
that that seemed to have been a point of

1625
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:47,679
confusion before from the review from

1626
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:49,809
Jeffrey so and then at 4:10 there is a

1627
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,699
summary of restating all these nine

1628
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:53,920
types of optimization of the bit

1629
01:26:51,699 --> 01:26:58,389
positions with a simple paragraph each

1630
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:59,949
too so kind of to close that section so

1631
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:01,960
I overhauled the explanation of the

1632
01:26:59,949 --> 01:27:03,639
forwarding pseudocode no change in the

1633
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:06,909
forwarding pseudocode but the idea was

1634
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:09,280
to explain the distinction between beer

1635
01:27:06,909 --> 01:27:13,239
and beer te with respect to the fact

1636
01:27:09,280 --> 01:27:15,159
that beer by you know having these few

1637
01:27:13,239 --> 01:27:17,799
these the most optimized number of bits

1638
01:27:15,159 --> 01:27:20,170
just for the destination will basically

1639
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:22,060
have the dependencies between the

1640
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:24,100
different replication that if you're

1641
01:27:22,060 --> 01:27:26,440
sending out a packet to the first you

1642
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,630
know interface for the first bit that

1643
01:27:26,440 --> 01:27:30,759
you are routing across that interface

1644
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:32,080
you'll be clearing out logically all the

1645
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:33,969
other bits that would you would also

1646
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:36,400
send to the same outgoing interface

1647
01:27:33,969 --> 01:27:38,530
right and that creates a dependency

1648
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,500
between the replication you are doing

1649
01:27:38,530 --> 01:27:43,570
whereas in beer te well we need to have

1650
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:45,159
a bit for the outgoing interface and

1651
01:27:43,570 --> 01:27:47,170
that triggers to the replication there

1652
01:27:45,159 --> 01:27:49,120
and the note doesn't really care whether

1653
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:52,210
it's replicated further down to multiple

1654
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:54,849
receivers so more bits needed but for

1655
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:57,370
that matter the operation of determining

1656
01:27:54,850 --> 01:27:59,140
a replication to every individual bit is

1657
01:27:57,370 --> 01:28:01,750
independent of any other bits so you

1658
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:04,300
could for example allocate a single CPU

1659
01:28:01,750 --> 01:28:06,280
core for every bloody bit and perform

1660
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:10,000
the execution the replication in

1661
01:28:06,280 --> 01:28:12,250
parallel so that was basically hopefully

1662
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:15,300
the the newer text is better expressing

1663
01:28:12,250 --> 01:28:15,300
that next slide

1664
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:23,620
right so then I had something like

1665
01:28:20,920 --> 01:28:26,410
trying in this section 7 which was more

1666
01:28:23,620 --> 01:28:30,099
operational stuff to say that the total

1667
01:28:26,410 --> 01:28:33,670
number of bits we need for the transit

1668
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:36,580
hops to specify the path maybe between

1669
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:38,380
20 and 80 percent so then dirt

1670
01:28:36,580 --> 01:28:40,059
challenged me okay where are the hundred

1671
01:28:38,380 --> 01:28:43,720
pages of research paper with good

1672
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:45,100
combinations so I basically had to admit

1673
01:28:43,720 --> 01:28:46,810
that we've done some you know on

1674
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:48,820
whiteboards as some example but we

1675
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:51,160
haven't really published any good you

1676
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:52,960
know quantitative analyses so basically

1677
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:54,639
now the text is more weak in here and

1678
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:56,950
saying that you know the number of bits

1679
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:59,020
we need can vary widely based on the

1680
01:28:56,950 --> 01:29:00,790
topology right I think 20 to 80 percent

1681
01:28:59,020 --> 01:29:02,050
is good but you know you don't want to

1682
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:08,860
write it down if you don't have a good

1683
01:29:02,050 --> 01:29:10,240
reference beauty and segment routing so

1684
01:29:08,860 --> 01:29:12,160
there was an edit explanation how

1685
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:15,460
senders can determine receivers to pen

1686
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:17,590
send packets to in a way that relates to

1687
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:21,390
the use case from the HTTP side right so

1688
01:29:17,590 --> 01:29:24,010
in beer the sender just needs to know

1689
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:26,290
here my destinations that I know with a

1690
01:29:24,010 --> 01:29:28,120
name or IP address and I know a bit for

1691
01:29:26,290 --> 01:29:30,490
each of them so I just or these bits

1692
01:29:28,120 --> 01:29:33,040
together in Ebola I got my beer packet

1693
01:29:30,490 --> 01:29:34,570
and the case of beer te we pretty much

1694
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:36,460
have the same thing but instead of

1695
01:29:34,570 --> 01:29:38,139
having just a single bit for every

1696
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:40,030
receiver you have a bit string of the

1697
01:29:38,140 --> 01:29:41,470
path to the receiver and then you're

1698
01:29:40,030 --> 01:29:44,200
ordering these together and that gives

1699
01:29:41,470 --> 01:29:47,710
you the beer tea tree so for the sender

1700
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:50,440
the same type of simple operation and in

1701
01:29:47,710 --> 01:29:52,720
before I had included these type of you

1702
01:29:50,440 --> 01:29:54,490
know independent branches type of

1703
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:56,020
calculations from the controller if you

1704
01:29:54,490 --> 01:29:58,300
have something like Steiner trees which

1705
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:59,920
are more optimized you know the sender

1706
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:02,170
has more work to do when he adds or

1707
01:29:59,920 --> 01:30:04,030
remove the receiver because the whole

1708
01:30:02,170 --> 01:30:07,660
tree changes but in the normal shortest

1709
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:10,300
path type of routing we have this makes

1710
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:13,330
it as easy so there was the the missing

1711
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:20,209
explanation here next light I think we

1712
01:30:13,330 --> 01:30:23,669
might be yep and that is the end right

1713
01:30:20,209 --> 01:30:27,419
so yeah so Jeffrey hadn't come back but

1714
01:30:23,669 --> 01:30:29,999
hopefully would be up to six volts in

1715
01:30:27,419 --> 01:30:34,589
that so any more reviews highly welcome

1716
01:30:29,999 --> 01:30:36,839
so that we can finish the us call yeah

1717
01:30:34,589 --> 01:30:38,189
please do I mean we've this has been you

1718
01:30:36,839 --> 01:30:40,229
know this is a part of process I got a

1719
01:30:38,189 --> 01:30:41,849
bit Jeff read some good feedback great

1720
01:30:40,229 --> 01:30:43,289
amendments to it I want to make sure

1721
01:30:41,849 --> 01:30:46,499
that we go from here beyond just the two

1722
01:30:43,289 --> 01:30:48,119
of you talking right so after he's got

1723
01:30:46,499 --> 01:30:49,139
this edited from the last comments that

1724
01:30:48,119 --> 01:30:50,879
were on the list primarily from

1725
01:30:49,139 --> 01:30:52,769
Jeffrey's so to get the conversation

1726
01:30:50,879 --> 01:30:55,559
going again will restart the last call

1727
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:56,939
that rolling all right anyway else

1728
01:30:55,559 --> 01:31:00,239
having issues about that dock any

1729
01:30:56,939 --> 01:31:12,869
questions about that dock alright

1730
01:31:00,239 --> 01:31:30,928
excellent thanks to Arles okay these six

1731
01:31:12,869 --> 01:31:34,409
requirements if you need to point to the

1732
01:31:30,929 --> 01:31:36,889
slide you do but you do that I got to do

1733
01:31:34,409 --> 01:31:40,739
this okay

1734
01:31:36,889 --> 01:31:42,539
alright so just a quick recap of the

1735
01:31:40,739 --> 01:31:47,398
purpose of this draft there were a

1736
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:51,898
variety of v6 replication using beer

1737
01:31:47,399 --> 01:31:54,239
solutions that have been proposed and we

1738
01:31:51,899 --> 01:31:55,769
decided that it might be best to come up

1739
01:31:54,239 --> 01:31:57,928
with a problem statement draft which we

1740
01:31:55,769 --> 01:31:59,820
did and then the chairs suggested as the

1741
01:31:57,929 --> 01:32:02,459
working group disagreed upon is to have

1742
01:31:59,820 --> 01:32:05,219
a requirements draft first in this

1743
01:32:02,459 --> 01:32:07,739
requirements draft we do summarize the

1744
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:09,510
different solutions but it's not a

1745
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:11,909
solutions draft petition we will be

1746
01:32:09,510 --> 01:32:13,709
moving that to the appendix and there

1747
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:17,369
are variety of solutions there's you

1748
01:32:13,709 --> 01:32:18,809
know we used to provide that be six

1749
01:32:17,369 --> 01:32:20,820
replication using beer there's beer

1750
01:32:18,809 --> 01:32:23,639
Ethernet there's usually that's not

1751
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:25,709
destination options you can put the bit

1752
01:32:23,639 --> 01:32:27,449
string in the destination address

1753
01:32:25,709 --> 01:32:29,540
there's encapsulation there's a

1754
01:32:27,449 --> 01:32:31,669
capsulation encoding

1755
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:32,960
there's a variety of solutions and again

1756
01:32:31,670 --> 01:32:34,880
we put that in there but we just need to

1757
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,610
focus right now on the requirements and

1758
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:41,600
that's the the purpose of the draft one

1759
01:32:37,610 --> 01:32:42,739
thing that we could well one thing that

1760
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,820
we do have in the draft at the very

1761
01:32:42,739 --> 01:32:46,070
beginning and this something that we

1762
01:32:43,820 --> 01:32:48,860
talked about last time and that is using

1763
01:32:46,070 --> 01:32:52,219
the term native v6 and that was a little

1764
01:32:48,860 --> 01:32:54,170
bit of a discussion last IETF and we

1765
01:32:52,219 --> 01:32:57,020
still have it in there that term is also

1766
01:32:54,170 --> 01:32:58,130
used in the n° bori workgroup charter so

1767
01:32:57,020 --> 01:32:59,810
maybe we as a working group need to

1768
01:32:58,130 --> 01:33:01,040
decide what exactly that means in this

1769
01:32:59,810 --> 01:33:03,890
draft it just means it's not

1770
01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:06,890
encapsulated in Ethernet or MPLS if that

1771
01:33:03,890 --> 01:33:09,590
needs to change then let us know since

1772
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:12,380
last IETF we've continued to develop the

1773
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:16,130
requirements section we've created a

1774
01:33:12,380 --> 01:33:19,370
github repository for updates to this

1775
01:33:16,130 --> 01:33:20,810
draft because of the weirdness going on

1776
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:22,340
between the US and China right now the

1777
01:33:20,810 --> 01:33:24,620
governments aren't too good of friends

1778
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:25,760
so if we put things in the github just

1779
01:33:24,620 --> 01:33:30,590
to make sure everything's in the clear

1780
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:33,350
and to cover a basis we have removed

1781
01:33:30,590 --> 01:33:36,020
some solutions with regards to pros and

1782
01:33:33,350 --> 01:33:38,449
cons wording we've kind of gone back and

1783
01:33:36,020 --> 01:33:39,679
forth on this as well we first were

1784
01:33:38,449 --> 01:33:41,480
trying to stay as neutral as possible

1785
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:43,250
then it was recommended that we do

1786
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,468
provide some pros and cons and then in

1787
01:33:43,250 --> 01:33:47,360
this latest draft we've kind of softened

1788
01:33:45,469 --> 01:33:50,020
that approach and just let the solutions

1789
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,699
dress do their own justification and

1790
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:54,620
just focus on the requirements we

1791
01:33:52,699 --> 01:33:57,320
provide a little bit of commentary under

1792
01:33:54,620 --> 01:33:59,960
the requirements and that may still need

1793
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:02,929
to be debated debated a bit because the

1794
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:06,230
authors are proposed do you have their

1795
01:34:02,929 --> 01:34:07,790
names on one of the solutions dress my

1796
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:10,519
name is on two of the solutions dress

1797
01:34:07,790 --> 01:34:12,110
and and Canada to fast forward a year

1798
01:34:10,520 --> 01:34:14,510
from now really right now we have two

1799
01:34:12,110 --> 01:34:16,250
drafts that are being actively worked on

1800
01:34:14,510 --> 01:34:18,350
there's other surprises as well there

1801
01:34:16,250 --> 01:34:21,110
right now there's two correct me if I'm

1802
01:34:18,350 --> 01:34:24,469
wrong so for the next Rev and thank you

1803
01:34:21,110 --> 01:34:26,570
Tony for your comments we will remove

1804
01:34:24,469 --> 01:34:28,340
all references to SRB six in the

1805
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:31,280
document we've agreed to that because it

1806
01:34:28,340 --> 01:34:35,090
was not helpful it just complicates the

1807
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:36,860
things Rajeev has been telling me any

1808
01:34:35,090 --> 01:34:38,239
other authors to move this loose and

1809
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:40,309
summary to the appendix for some time

1810
01:34:38,239 --> 01:34:41,739
and I haven't listened to them and tell

1811
01:34:40,310 --> 01:34:45,070
me how but now I feel

1812
01:34:41,739 --> 01:34:48,009
em'ly a believer and we will move those

1813
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:50,049
solutions to an appendix they you have

1814
01:34:48,010 --> 01:34:51,400
told us that those are helpful and so

1815
01:34:50,050 --> 01:34:53,019
we'll keep them in there just to give us

1816
01:34:51,400 --> 01:34:55,780
summary an overview of the different

1817
01:34:53,019 --> 01:34:59,409
solutions but so for those of you that

1818
01:34:55,780 --> 01:35:01,749
have solutions documents please review

1819
01:34:59,409 --> 01:35:05,289
those sections we would welcome you to

1820
01:35:01,749 --> 01:35:07,630
be authors on this draft it would help

1821
01:35:05,289 --> 01:35:09,429
make this trap progress better as a few

1822
01:35:07,630 --> 01:35:11,110
authors wrong that we're authoring this

1823
01:35:09,429 --> 01:35:15,849
draft as well so that we're all in

1824
01:35:11,110 --> 01:35:18,119
agreement on the requirements and we

1825
01:35:15,849 --> 01:35:20,820
will further modify the requirements

1826
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:23,440
next slide

1827
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:28,030
so I've already mentioned the the draft

1828
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:30,070
purpose really again our goal is to help

1829
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:32,139
the working group come to conclusion as

1830
01:35:30,070 --> 01:35:34,030
outside of this draft on which of these

1831
01:35:32,139 --> 01:35:37,329
solutions to rally behind and adopt and

1832
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:39,550
again my own bias and conclusion is that

1833
01:35:37,329 --> 01:35:41,949
right now there's two solutions and I

1834
01:35:39,550 --> 01:35:44,079
you know I I think eventually you may

1835
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:46,719
not want to just we may just want to

1836
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:48,579
work on those those two solutions and

1837
01:35:46,719 --> 01:35:52,079
tell somebody else's solutions they have

1838
01:35:48,579 --> 01:35:54,759
interest in working on them next slide

1839
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:59,259
so these are the requirements we have 12

1840
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:01,780
today and we will need to further

1841
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:03,369
discuss these on the list that's what's

1842
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:03,849
been most helpful so again thank you

1843
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:07,409
Tony

1844
01:36:03,849 --> 01:36:12,010
and kind of providing some feedback

1845
01:36:07,409 --> 01:36:13,089
maybe for the once we can just go

1846
01:36:12,010 --> 01:36:15,550
through them we can just go through a

1847
01:36:13,090 --> 01:36:18,099
real quick stand up if or speak up yeah

1848
01:36:15,550 --> 01:36:21,280
if there's a if you have an issue with

1849
01:36:18,099 --> 01:36:23,980
one of these requirements one thing that

1850
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:25,420
again that we need to be aware of is

1851
01:36:23,980 --> 01:36:27,009
that we have these requirements but we

1852
01:36:25,420 --> 01:36:28,360
also have some commentary behind the

1853
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:30,579
requirements and the commentary may

1854
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:31,749
sometimes be a little biased as I've

1855
01:36:30,579 --> 01:36:33,280
looked at it so that's where we have to

1856
01:36:31,749 --> 01:36:36,429
be careful and that's where having other

1857
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:38,980
authors would be helpful so as an

1858
01:36:36,429 --> 01:36:40,690
example the first requirement it would

1859
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:43,239
be helpful to have a solution that's

1860
01:36:40,690 --> 01:36:46,150
agnostic to the underlying layer to data

1861
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:48,489
link type that doesn't seem to be too

1862
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:49,329
controversial and just as an example and

1863
01:36:48,489 --> 01:36:50,949
I won't do this with all the

1864
01:36:49,329 --> 01:36:53,949
requirements but like the beer Ethernet

1865
01:36:50,949 --> 01:36:57,428
solution is a very clean solution but it

1866
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:59,500
it is not agnostic to the underlying

1867
01:36:57,429 --> 01:37:01,060
layer to Deerling type so when you're

1868
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:02,410
evaluating that particular solution you

1869
01:37:01,060 --> 01:37:05,489
can look at all the other requirements

1870
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:07,750
and you can say okay it maybe provides a

1871
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:09,849
meets all the other requirements maybe

1872
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:11,860
just not once that's something that they

1873
01:37:09,850 --> 01:37:13,570
work group will need to evaluate so the

1874
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:15,280
other ones and this is the ones some of

1875
01:37:13,570 --> 01:37:17,230
the ones that Tony had a comment on and

1876
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:19,210
support out to may need to be rewarded

1877
01:37:17,230 --> 01:37:21,160
and may need to be expanded into two

1878
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:23,230
requirements and that is that it should

1879
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:26,290
not require hop-by-hop modification of

1880
01:37:23,230 --> 01:37:28,299
the source address field and should use

1881
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:32,440
an ipv6 unicast address in the

1882
01:37:28,300 --> 01:37:37,239
destination address do you are you

1883
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:41,259
shaking because you don't agree that so

1884
01:37:37,239 --> 01:37:49,059
I send you out comments why the 4 2 4 3

1885
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:51,610
& 4 11 so thank you for decoupling

1886
01:37:49,060 --> 01:37:54,429
there's our v6 I mean we may write know

1887
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:57,699
the hope I hope loophole that you can

1888
01:37:54,429 --> 01:38:00,000
change it right on v6 and we may not but

1889
01:37:57,699 --> 01:38:04,750
it does nothing to do with v6 right

1890
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:06,550
therefore 2 3 and 11 dead leads to a

1891
01:38:04,750 --> 01:38:09,400
very profound discussion on in beer is a

1892
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:10,690
2.5 technology okay it doesn't go

1893
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:13,179
multiple hops it doesn't do

1894
01:38:10,690 --> 01:38:15,070
fragmentation this is like MPLS so if we

1895
01:38:13,179 --> 01:38:17,170
want to change it in architectural level

1896
01:38:15,070 --> 01:38:19,769
and all of a sudden go like multiple

1897
01:38:17,170 --> 01:38:22,420
hops right and preserve source addresses

1898
01:38:19,770 --> 01:38:23,830
that is a fairly substantial discussion

1899
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:25,270
with working group because that's what

1900
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:27,640
what is being sneaked with those

1901
01:38:25,270 --> 01:38:29,440
requirements where I should use words I

1902
01:38:27,640 --> 01:38:31,810
mean date those requirements kind of

1903
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:34,480
imply a multi-home architecture which we

1904
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:36,280
don't have so even the beer in six kind

1905
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:38,349
of allows jumping multiple hops which is

1906
01:38:36,280 --> 01:38:40,949
like a hack you should not use but may

1907
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:43,420
be helpful if we go along those

1908
01:38:40,949 --> 01:38:45,009
requirements basically all of a sudden

1909
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:46,540
overview six beer becomes a completely

1910
01:38:45,010 --> 01:38:49,300
different technology becomes a tunneling

1911
01:38:46,540 --> 01:38:51,820
technology jumping multiple hops so

1912
01:38:49,300 --> 01:38:55,090
that's why but I mean I I spelled it out

1913
01:38:51,820 --> 01:38:57,670
pretty clearly yeah yeah so I it as a

1914
01:38:55,090 --> 01:38:59,980
reminder the way that we've ordered the

1915
01:38:57,670 --> 01:39:01,810
requirement says this should be

1916
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:05,440
something that as you can see here

1917
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:07,180
should be implemented but maybe we need

1918
01:39:05,440 --> 01:39:11,169
to rethink those that

1919
01:39:07,180 --> 01:39:13,770
wording and maybe maybe there's some

1920
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:17,770
other options we can do yeah king rama

1921
01:39:13,770 --> 01:39:22,620
general from highway yes

1922
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:26,770
yeah it's generally a layered 2.50

1923
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:31,930
solution that is it has been medically

1924
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:36,730
in there I've said eighty to ninety six

1925
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:40,120
it is allowed to transport be a in layer

1926
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:44,349
three or Lea file or therefore or was so

1927
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:47,280
arm and it information that that I just

1928
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:51,910
rated the texture from this I've said

1929
01:39:47,280 --> 01:39:54,250
the action can be welcome fragment type

1930
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:57,820
here in the packet then the procedures

1931
01:39:54,250 --> 01:40:00,910
of the sixteen are applied in sequence

1932
01:39:57,820 --> 01:40:04,750
through each a fragment fragment this

1933
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:08,220
assay allows the fragmentation has

1934
01:40:04,750 --> 01:40:12,220
considered the fragmentation as

1935
01:40:08,220 --> 01:40:19,570
additional function to be a true is it

1936
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:22,260
from there I've seen also I think I want

1937
01:40:19,570 --> 01:40:26,920
to share some background why we think

1938
01:40:22,260 --> 01:40:29,670
else resolution is required you know in

1939
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:32,800
Heller the activate it's a basic service

1940
01:40:29,670 --> 01:40:37,840
for hundreds of millions of subscribers

1941
01:40:32,800 --> 01:40:41,130
and are running our IP networks using

1942
01:40:37,840 --> 01:40:45,370
pin they are not intended to use early

1943
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:49,060
layer two point five solutions neck

1944
01:40:45,370 --> 01:40:52,660
amperes and are likely not to use it in

1945
01:40:49,060 --> 01:40:56,590
the future and the network is already at

1946
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:58,720
he basics ready so the required they

1947
01:40:56,590 --> 01:41:02,080
required the solution for all the

1948
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:06,010
benefits of beer so so that's my comment

1949
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:09,330
well the layers three is the fast on you

1950
01:41:06,010 --> 01:41:12,240
from the video of service providers

1951
01:41:09,330 --> 01:41:13,860
repayments

1952
01:41:12,240 --> 01:41:17,369
yeah

1953
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:21,119
- synced earlier for a mere BFF may also

1954
01:41:17,369 --> 01:41:27,000
be useful and may have some advantages

1955
01:41:21,119 --> 01:41:28,980
in some cases for example may force of

1956
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:33,360
the world inflammation using their so

1957
01:41:28,980 --> 01:41:36,718
socket API but also we realized that it

1958
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:40,320
had some limitations as as the least

1959
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:43,560
hitter in this requirement draft that it

1960
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:45,750
may be difficult to support the

1961
01:41:43,560 --> 01:41:51,570
fabrication and IPSec

1962
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:55,320
that's not very strong requirement allow

1963
01:41:51,570 --> 01:41:58,590
maybe but maybe someday they come to

1964
01:41:55,320 --> 01:42:03,469
repair that kind of support exact kayu

1965
01:41:58,590 --> 01:42:08,040
support fragmentation then since blocked

1966
01:42:03,469 --> 01:42:12,320
so that is my comment why we think we

1967
01:42:08,040 --> 01:42:19,260
need to build the solutions on layer 3

1968
01:42:12,320 --> 01:42:20,280
thank you bigoted okay so we probably

1969
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:24,409
don't need to run through these

1970
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:26,340
requirements but there's still much

1971
01:42:24,409 --> 01:42:28,219
discussion to be had about these

1972
01:42:26,340 --> 01:42:33,630
requirements we should do so on the list

1973
01:42:28,219 --> 01:42:35,880
and I continue to request that others

1974
01:42:33,630 --> 01:42:37,080
join us as authors on this draft so we

1975
01:42:35,880 --> 01:42:42,170
can make sure our pieces are covered

1976
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:45,900
last slide which is the next leg

1977
01:42:42,170 --> 01:42:48,960
so we originally thought we'd be done by

1978
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:50,820
this ITF but it's apparent to us that

1979
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:52,110
there still need to be some work done on

1980
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:53,540
these requirements to make everybody

1981
01:42:52,110 --> 01:42:55,769
happy

1982
01:42:53,540 --> 01:42:57,630
it is important to realize that our

1983
01:42:55,770 --> 01:42:59,369
solutions that we rally behind are

1984
01:42:57,630 --> 01:43:02,510
likely not to satisfy all the

1985
01:42:59,369 --> 01:43:05,040
requirements but I think that's ok

1986
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:05,850
long as we feel like they're meeting the

1987
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:07,560
majority of them

1988
01:43:05,850 --> 01:43:09,030
please continue commenting on the draft

1989
01:43:07,560 --> 01:43:16,260
are there any other questions or

1990
01:43:09,030 --> 01:43:19,050
comments thanks for taking the work

1991
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:21,270
forward and taking the brunt the

1992
01:43:19,050 --> 01:43:23,310
conflict no the coffee has to be at yeah

1993
01:43:21,270 --> 01:43:25,619
because there's huge implications on it

1994
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:28,429
actually right especially on the

1995
01:43:25,619 --> 01:43:28,429
security models

1996
01:43:32,590 --> 01:43:47,390
so we have time

1997
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:50,720
sliggoo evening cap solution craft learn

1998
01:43:47,390 --> 01:43:52,220
from Shannon mobile and yeah I'm going

1999
01:43:50,720 --> 01:43:54,070
to talk about of this draft that this

2000
01:43:52,220 --> 01:43:58,490
hadn't a lot of discussion on the list

2001
01:43:54,070 --> 01:44:01,549
so basically what we're proposing and is

2002
01:43:58,490 --> 01:44:04,670
a heuristics encapsulation solution for

2003
01:44:01,550 --> 01:44:06,680
beer if you go to the next slide so I'll

2004
01:44:04,670 --> 01:44:12,050
spend a little bit more time on this one

2005
01:44:06,680 --> 01:44:14,570
so the basic idea in this draft I'm just

2006
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:16,670
in case that someone not reading the

2007
01:44:14,570 --> 01:44:19,730
draft so I spent some time on this

2008
01:44:16,670 --> 01:44:22,790
so basically we're using a n change the

2009
01:44:19,730 --> 01:44:26,870
source address for the entire flow and

2010
01:44:22,790 --> 01:44:31,460
and also to change the destination

2011
01:44:26,870 --> 01:44:35,720
address by using the neighbor beer

2012
01:44:31,460 --> 01:44:37,670
router so basically the principle

2013
01:44:35,720 --> 01:44:40,160
complying with the requirements in

2014
01:44:37,670 --> 01:44:42,800
Mike's draft and we're using the

2015
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:45,590
standard beer header so that's a basic

2016
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:47,390
encoding thing and we're using unicast

2017
01:44:45,590 --> 01:44:49,340
address in sense of multicast solution

2018
01:44:47,390 --> 01:44:54,800
so that you can basically go through

2019
01:44:49,340 --> 01:44:56,540
those and end multicast aware note so

2020
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:58,670
I'd like to go through this process with

2021
01:44:56,540 --> 01:45:01,400
the package so if you have a packet

2022
01:44:58,670 --> 01:45:03,470
sending from a so you use them you can

2023
01:45:01,400 --> 01:45:06,980
use the look-back source and then you

2024
01:45:03,470 --> 01:45:10,300
use the destination address of B and and

2025
01:45:06,980 --> 01:45:13,459
and then for the node between a and B

2026
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:15,290
non-beer Walter says oh this is a pack

2027
01:45:13,460 --> 01:45:18,770
of four B's unicast and then we fold it

2028
01:45:15,290 --> 01:45:20,420
to B and then B um catch the pack head

2029
01:45:18,770 --> 01:45:22,160
and say oh that this is a packet for me

2030
01:45:20,420 --> 01:45:24,530
and that's actually beer address beer

2031
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:27,590
destination address puppy so this is a

2032
01:45:24,530 --> 01:45:29,780
this is my beer so I kind of open the

2033
01:45:27,590 --> 01:45:31,880
can and drink the beer and when I drink

2034
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:35,240
the beer extra phone oh I need to share

2035
01:45:31,880 --> 01:45:37,670
with two other guys named 2 C and D so I

2036
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:40,130
basically receive the can and put the

2037
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:44,510
bit string

2038
01:45:40,130 --> 01:45:46,550
a 450 is three so beat three make one

2039
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:48,800
and then I actually in calculate the

2040
01:45:46,550 --> 01:45:51,350
source or destination address of B on

2041
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:55,460
the packet as well and then sent to D

2042
01:45:51,350 --> 01:45:57,469
and then he can drink the payload so

2043
01:45:55,460 --> 01:46:02,210
that's basically idea so you will use

2044
01:45:57,469 --> 01:46:05,989
the extension a header do h4 for beer

2045
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:08,090
header or native encoding so it's

2046
01:46:05,989 --> 01:46:11,959
combined with the architecture

2047
01:46:08,090 --> 01:46:13,310
asari requirements yes so next slide

2048
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:17,290
please

2049
01:46:13,310 --> 01:46:19,909
so the few upcoming slides is really the

2050
01:46:17,290 --> 01:46:21,800
you know list of the requirements that

2051
01:46:19,909 --> 01:46:23,719
we think we're complying with the

2052
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:26,000
current requirement Draft so I'm not

2053
01:46:23,719 --> 01:46:30,370
going through in details just this one

2054
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:33,050
you know basic architecture doing the

2055
01:46:30,370 --> 01:46:36,460
not changing the be your header things

2056
01:46:33,050 --> 01:46:36,460
like that next one please

2057
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:44,900
and so this one there was the discussion

2058
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:48,170
of recommendations security so since the

2059
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:53,320
requirements are there in the draft so

2060
01:46:48,170 --> 01:46:57,199
these native native layer three

2061
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:59,540
encapsulation of beer header yes it it

2062
01:46:57,199 --> 01:47:01,940
gave you flexibility or give the support

2063
01:46:59,540 --> 01:47:03,650
of recommendation and IPSec security

2064
01:47:01,940 --> 01:47:07,190
because you have the header you have the

2065
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:11,480
beer header in in in extension of v6 and

2066
01:47:07,190 --> 01:47:13,940
stuff in the payload but I mean if it is

2067
01:47:11,480 --> 01:47:15,559
not compulsory then this is if it is

2068
01:47:13,940 --> 01:47:17,870
optional then it's optional and I'm not

2069
01:47:15,560 --> 01:47:19,670
saying that you we have to do this in

2070
01:47:17,870 --> 01:47:21,830
some ways just really depend on the

2071
01:47:19,670 --> 01:47:24,230
requirement how it goes at the end and

2072
01:47:21,830 --> 01:47:26,690
just to for information this is

2073
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:28,780
supported by their solution next one

2074
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,780
please

2075
01:47:30,429 --> 01:47:36,469
so yeah

2076
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:38,239
so the the the we're actually changing

2077
01:47:36,469 --> 01:47:40,719
the destination address have go through

2078
01:47:38,239 --> 01:47:43,669
the packet flow in the previous slides

2079
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:46,550
and the source address is not changed by

2080
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:48,110
hop a hop and that's that's let's give

2081
01:47:46,550 --> 01:47:51,469
you flexibility of also receiving the

2082
01:47:48,110 --> 01:47:54,380
notice on pain of trades or MTU notice

2083
01:47:51,469 --> 01:47:56,750
and it makes things a little bit easier

2084
01:47:54,380 --> 01:47:58,760
if you want to filter the packet using

2085
01:47:56,750 --> 01:48:02,630
source address because it's it's

2086
01:47:58,760 --> 01:48:04,070
basically the source the real source yes

2087
01:48:02,630 --> 01:48:06,260
so neck next slide please

2088
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:09,759
I think that's actually oh there's

2089
01:48:06,260 --> 01:48:13,579
another one well yeah it's basically

2090
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:15,800
comply with the listed requirements in

2091
01:48:13,579 --> 01:48:18,400
the draft not going to going through

2092
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:18,400
this next one please

2093
01:48:18,699 --> 01:48:27,009
so to conclude this has been in

2094
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:29,780
discussion for for for quite a long time

2095
01:48:27,010 --> 01:48:33,800
so there are lots of which received a

2096
01:48:29,780 --> 01:48:35,360
lot of comments and suggestions on the

2097
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:38,289
mailing list and offline discussion and

2098
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:43,489
we improve the draft quite a lot since

2099
01:48:38,289 --> 01:48:47,980
the one before last meeting it was not

2100
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:49,159
presented in in last meeting I think so

2101
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:51,589
yes

2102
01:48:49,159 --> 01:48:53,659
I think in the current draft the forum

2103
01:48:51,590 --> 01:48:56,989
in terms of a solution I think while

2104
01:48:53,659 --> 01:48:59,539
there will be some defect well not be

2105
01:48:56,989 --> 01:49:02,239
that but the room to be polished but I

2106
01:48:59,539 --> 01:49:04,369
think there's no heart defect for the

2107
01:49:02,239 --> 01:49:08,150
solution so we think in a form of a

2108
01:49:04,369 --> 01:49:12,769
solution based type of undrafted squat

2109
01:49:08,150 --> 01:49:14,750
mature we'd like to you know ask for

2110
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:20,199
opinion of calling for a working group

2111
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:25,190
adoption thank you I made called Nokia

2112
01:49:20,199 --> 01:49:29,289
yeah well I think ipv6 is is a hot topic

2113
01:49:25,190 --> 01:49:34,969
right this it's the hot potato and I

2114
01:49:29,289 --> 01:49:38,840
think I think everybody trying to peel

2115
01:49:34,969 --> 01:49:40,969
it with a different tool whether it's a

2116
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:44,989
fork and knife it doesn't make it

2117
01:49:40,969 --> 01:49:45,800
different I guess my comment here is

2118
01:49:44,989 --> 01:49:48,059
that

2119
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:51,060
sooner or later as a working group we

2120
01:49:48,060 --> 01:49:53,940
need to come up with a with one solution

2121
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:57,510
we do not want to make unicast mistakes

2122
01:49:53,940 --> 01:50:02,489
if I will so what what I'm seeing here

2123
01:49:57,510 --> 01:50:05,400
is it's very close to beer in six draft

2124
01:50:02,489 --> 01:50:08,030
that is that is going on also right so I

2125
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:12,179
wonder whatever we can kind of combine

2126
01:50:08,030 --> 01:50:12,630
these drafts or work to combine them

2127
01:50:12,179 --> 01:50:14,940
together

2128
01:50:12,630 --> 01:50:17,010
so that's the first climate and the

2129
01:50:14,940 --> 01:50:20,910
second part is what what you brought up

2130
01:50:17,010 --> 01:50:23,160
here the security aspect IPSec etc

2131
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:25,139
that's very interesting

2132
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:28,860
so we mean I think we need to understand

2133
01:50:25,140 --> 01:50:32,969
whether for beer we want to entertain

2134
01:50:28,860 --> 01:50:37,139
all these letter ipv6 courts into the

2135
01:50:32,969 --> 01:50:40,170
beer including security IPSec because I

2136
01:50:37,140 --> 01:50:42,420
can't remember free IP v6 if IPSec is a

2137
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:44,580
tunnel mode or transport mode so all

2138
01:50:42,420 --> 01:50:49,560
this stuff will come into play from

2139
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:52,110
encryption point of view like the bright

2140
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:56,400
future ways so we as a working group

2141
01:50:52,110 --> 01:50:58,259
need to decide if we want to start

2142
01:50:56,400 --> 01:51:01,160
entertaining adopting these solutions

2143
01:50:58,260 --> 01:51:03,179
drafts in correlation with the

2144
01:51:01,160 --> 01:51:04,559
requirements draft or do we need to wait

2145
01:51:03,179 --> 01:51:06,540
for the requirements draft to become

2146
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:08,160
more mature before we start entertaining

2147
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:10,440
solutions drafts that's the first point

2148
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:11,910
second point is as I mentioned there

2149
01:51:10,440 --> 01:51:13,530
really are two drafts that are being

2150
01:51:11,910 --> 01:51:15,719
mostly worked on there's a variety of

2151
01:51:13,530 --> 01:51:18,210
solutions but they're just two and it

2152
01:51:15,719 --> 01:51:20,310
wouldn't be in my opinion harmful to

2153
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:22,469
eventually adopt both of them and then

2154
01:51:20,310 --> 01:51:25,130
eventually have one draft that we submit

2155
01:51:22,469 --> 01:51:25,130
to the iesg

2156
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:34,890
I Cisco so drunk encapsulating the beer

2157
01:51:31,199 --> 01:51:36,750
either as is right so I don't think that

2158
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:39,900
doing that in an extension of our adds

2159
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:41,429
any value I can agree with Helmand

2160
01:51:39,900 --> 01:51:43,469
release at right so if the beer in six

2161
01:51:41,429 --> 01:51:47,969
but just sort of removes the extension

2162
01:51:43,469 --> 01:51:50,310
header so that I don't see the benefit

2163
01:51:47,969 --> 01:51:51,750
of that I had the other thing I think if

2164
01:51:50,310 --> 01:51:53,250
you ask for adoption because ideally

2165
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:55,290
when you want to have one solution going

2166
01:51:53,250 --> 01:51:57,780
forward so yeah I'm not sure if they

2167
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:59,230
wanted up both and then select one they

2168
01:51:57,780 --> 01:52:03,700
may be very good actually

2169
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:05,980
before adopting I think I think Shep

2170
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:07,269
just cherrim the examining process it

2171
01:52:05,980 --> 01:52:08,980
stops us from doing that we've done it

2172
01:52:07,270 --> 01:52:10,630
before and things emerge and go but if

2173
01:52:08,980 --> 01:53:51,849
we have some foresight of where we want

2174
01:52:10,630 --> 01:53:53,440
things to go so yeah I mean yeah we can

2175
01:53:51,850 --> 01:53:55,390
discuss that offline in more detail and

2176
01:53:53,440 --> 01:54:00,099
just an emphasis that the destination

2177
01:53:55,390 --> 01:54:02,500
address playing or a feud it's actually

2178
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:05,290
for beer so you have your unique has

2179
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:08,550
normal packet destination for each of

2180
01:54:05,290 --> 01:54:10,290
the beer wilder anyway so that's a

2181
01:54:08,550 --> 01:54:13,290
that's a

2182
01:54:10,290 --> 01:54:15,720
a standalone playing address pool for

2183
01:54:13,290 --> 01:54:18,420
four for beer packet so yes we could

2184
01:54:15,720 --> 01:54:22,740
discuss that offline for OEM so let me

2185
01:54:18,420 --> 01:54:25,140
stop in we are dry I don't see it

2186
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:27,330
address that this is being dragged in a

2187
01:54:25,140 --> 01:54:29,430
completely different or he'll check are

2188
01:54:27,330 --> 01:54:31,320
in textual corner of the world okay

2189
01:54:29,430 --> 01:54:34,140
you're taking a two point five

2190
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:36,299
technology and try to extend it to be a

2191
01:54:34,140 --> 01:54:39,090
tunneling technology and inventing stuff

2192
01:54:36,300 --> 01:54:42,210
on the fly if you run beer beer has a

2193
01:54:39,090 --> 01:54:45,210
full o a.m. layer okay and you carry a

2194
01:54:42,210 --> 01:54:48,330
PFR ID in the beer frame and you have om

2195
01:54:45,210 --> 01:54:51,780
beats and we have everything and now you

2196
01:54:48,330 --> 01:54:54,269
try to replace it with ipv6 OAM right

2197
01:54:51,780 --> 01:54:56,639
and track a food security modeling

2198
01:54:54,270 --> 01:54:58,950
because if you run a two point five the

2199
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:00,540
new FDI GP you talk to the people and

2200
01:54:58,950 --> 01:55:03,210
you know you can trust the next guy he's

2201
01:55:00,540 --> 01:55:05,430
expected to send you a packet now over

2202
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:07,410
losartan you have the whole v6

2203
01:55:05,430 --> 01:55:09,720
addressing that starts to come in so

2204
01:55:07,410 --> 01:55:11,630
anybody can basically shoot the beer

2205
01:55:09,720 --> 01:55:14,550
back and in the middle of everything and

2206
01:55:11,630 --> 01:55:16,770
then a random stuff can start to happen

2207
01:55:14,550 --> 01:55:18,300
because this guy can shoot it 17 hop

2208
01:55:16,770 --> 01:55:22,710
away with a completely different thing

2209
01:55:18,300 --> 01:55:25,020
again this please needs an architectural

2210
01:55:22,710 --> 01:55:27,390
document with all the secure

2211
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:28,740
implications or EMP implications and so

2212
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:30,090
on right

2213
01:55:28,740 --> 01:55:31,889
you're taking that to a completely

2214
01:55:30,090 --> 01:55:34,050
different plane though they're the

2215
01:55:31,890 --> 01:55:35,850
little details of what this note that if

2216
01:55:34,050 --> 01:55:37,140
modified source address or not are not

2217
01:55:35,850 --> 01:55:41,610
that relevant

2218
01:55:37,140 --> 01:55:46,430
this is shifting it from a 2.5 layer to

2219
01:55:41,610 --> 01:55:46,429
complete layer 3 tunneling technology

2220
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:56,820
hello from Hawaii I think I help gray

2221
01:55:53,310 --> 01:56:01,920
with the ramen and its main concern

2222
01:55:56,820 --> 01:56:04,590
maybe like that how is the difference of

2223
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:07,860
two solutions and if this two solutions

2224
01:56:04,590 --> 01:56:12,270
can't combine or comma G same case it's

2225
01:56:07,860 --> 01:56:15,870
possible there is only some differences

2226
01:56:12,270 --> 01:56:20,679
between the two solutions under some in

2227
01:56:15,870 --> 01:56:23,800
common also that about the

2228
01:56:20,679 --> 01:56:28,530
security concerns it is also valid and

2229
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:34,030
there are zip eighty to ninety six have

2230
01:56:28,530 --> 01:56:36,159
been very wise to allow that a over be

2231
01:56:34,030 --> 01:56:39,250
such such solutions and the mention to

2232
01:56:36,159 --> 01:56:44,049
that it is desirable to verify the

2233
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:46,239
package things from a legal source for

2234
01:56:44,050 --> 01:56:47,860
layer two layer two point five miss

2235
01:56:46,239 --> 01:56:52,509
Maine law could be the problem and mayor

2236
01:56:47,860 --> 01:56:57,280
three or up its have this problem and we

2237
01:56:52,510 --> 01:57:01,330
have the space using this best special

2238
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:04,290
at at he destination address for peer

2239
01:57:01,330 --> 01:57:08,320
for the only and the don't open their

2240
01:57:04,290 --> 01:57:11,260
TCP or UDP probing for this for this

2241
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:14,400
address this may be helpful for the

2242
01:57:11,260 --> 01:57:17,590
security and allowed a lot of why's that

2243
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:20,469
from the activity always supports their

2244
01:57:17,590 --> 01:57:24,340
artistic meanness may also happen that

2245
01:57:20,469 --> 01:57:26,850
secretly close on time will take this to

2246
01:57:24,340 --> 01:57:29,440
threat but I want to encourage

2247
01:57:26,850 --> 01:57:30,850
constructive comments like when you have

2248
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:32,980
an architecture decision you made right

2249
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:35,140
there and you said may be helpful may be

2250
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:37,750
helpful is not a part of a contributing

2251
01:57:35,140 --> 01:57:39,400
argument show us how it's helpful and

2252
01:57:37,750 --> 01:57:41,290
then we can have a conversation from

2253
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:42,460
there right so just kind of look I'm

2254
01:57:41,290 --> 01:57:45,790
going to sort of focus our conversation

2255
01:57:42,460 --> 01:57:53,080
around an editorial just because I'm

2256
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:57,460
here this first slide this first moment

2257
01:57:53,080 --> 01:57:59,409
yeah I know what you're showing here was

2258
01:57:57,460 --> 01:58:01,750
helpful this is not encapsulation this

2259
01:57:59,409 --> 01:58:03,219
is the basic 40 model impossible so it'd

2260
01:58:01,750 --> 01:58:05,530
be nice to start with a cap so we can

2261
01:58:03,219 --> 01:58:07,840
discuss the in cap so we're doing in

2262
01:58:05,530 --> 01:58:10,059
affecting a document that's describing

2263
01:58:07,840 --> 01:58:11,050
encapsulation okay and and then we can

2264
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:12,040
understand what we're trying to do those

2265
01:58:11,050 --> 01:58:13,620
pins or vice versa

2266
01:58:12,040 --> 01:58:16,449
so just editorial in the future

2267
01:58:13,620 --> 01:58:19,570
streamline the conversation just kind

2268
01:58:16,449 --> 01:58:21,730
who's got the blue sheets well I do a

2269
01:58:19,570 --> 01:58:23,380
dilution so one clarification I mean you

2270
01:58:21,730 --> 01:58:24,610
cannot do it on in this nation here that

2271
