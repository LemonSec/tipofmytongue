1
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:27,350
good afternoon welcome to spring working

2
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:30,200
up so we have a full edge on us so we're

3
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:37,630
about to to start if someone could

4
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:41,569
throws the dough so good afternoon

5
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:48,229
Rob could not make it so I'm the only

6
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:52,539
one this is the agenda for today as

7
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:55,069
always we have a full another so please

8
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:57,979
stick if your present

9
00:01:55,069 --> 00:02:00,170
keep your allocated time and if you have

10
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:02,299
comments please an extra comments on do

11
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:08,090
not repeat so points that have already

12
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:10,340
been a them we don't have a share slice

13
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:13,549
so not well we'll assume you have

14
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,579
already read them we need we do need to

15
00:02:13,549 --> 00:02:20,930
scriber

16
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:22,340
any volunteer for scribing especially

17
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,299
that some people will did not make it to

18
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,299
to Singapore

19
00:02:26,049 --> 00:02:33,190
any volunteer follow scribe Brillon

20
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,190
please

21
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:58,079
maybe short the volunteer verbena could

22
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:01,540
you speak could you could you help with

23
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:04,060
being described a please just to realize

24
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:09,010
describe our or do you you don't have a

25
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:13,150
laptop so okay so we'll do without the

26
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:21,220
squadron jabus climber so this is the

27
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:24,090
Jean are again food agenda any any

28
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:24,090
comments on the agenda

29
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:30,069
thank you

30
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:34,750
secure Deena okay so so we'll proceed

31
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:45,418
them so the first is the speaker is

32
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:49,329
shredder ah ha ha ha

33
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:51,629
ok so we'll keep to share applications

34
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:51,629
of our

35
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:15,560
hello my name is a four I am going to

36
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:18,410
present this replication segment draft

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:24,770
on behalf of the authors unfortunately

38
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:27,080
Dan and Rishabh and and Jeffrey cannot

39
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:31,820
make it so I'm just helping with the

40
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:34,940
presentation in terms of brief history

41
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:39,200
of this draft so work actually started

42
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:43,370
back in 2018 and it was named a drug why

43
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:49,810
a SRT 20 policy it was presented by then

44
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:54,140
voice in Prague ITF and it did receive

45
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:56,720
comments from chair as well as from

46
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,659
working group and based on those

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,940
comments the way those comments are

48
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:06,260
address is by splitting this document

49
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:08,390
into two one document talks about

50
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,110
replication segment so the scope and

51
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:15,860
discussion today is on the application

52
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:19,490
segments where spring itself has the

53
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:23,419
expertise and then how these replication

54
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:27,140
segments are used are the expertise are

55
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:31,039
will be políticas working groups so that

56
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:34,849
document is in the pin there has been

57
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:37,460
lately quite a few comments on the

58
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:40,760
mailing list many many thanks for those

59
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:44,109
comments authors have addressed those

60
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:49,820
comments that have done a revision

61
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:54,110
during this week and have also calls

62
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,490
with the people that have comments

63
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,080
specially Shasha

64
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,500
many things are sure if you are

65
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:05,510
attending for your comments

66
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:08,000
and we have made tremendous progress in

67
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,460
terms of achieving a common ground and

68
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,990
addressing comments and if there the

69
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,479
need there could be another revision

70
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:17,659
really quickly

71
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:22,229
let's talk about the scope of the draft

72
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:26,419
this draft is specially targeting in a

73
00:06:22,229 --> 00:06:31,680
spring charter item and I read verbatim

74
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:34,169
it's pretty shorter to define new type

75
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,139
of segments netting to forwarding

76
00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:41,090
behavior and then one of the definition

77
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:44,580
of those is local English replication

78
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:48,568
the draft is no more than local English

79
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:52,859
replication replication segments deliver

80
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:55,639
packets to multiple nodes in the SR

81
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:59,300
domain but it's a direct application

82
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:03,449
from ingress to the set of downstream

83
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:06,680
egress knows the a copy of the packet is

84
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:11,669
unique a stood to each of the downstream

85
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,830
node in where you can think of it is a

86
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:17,279
little is a simple application segment

87
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:20,310
with low propagation over N as are

88
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:23,729
policies but the point to note is that

89
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,699
in this case there is no multicast

90
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:28,789
groups in the context of document or

91
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,539
scale with document there are no

92
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:34,020
multicast flow that we talked about

93
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:36,270
there is no receiver join there is no

94
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,620
three building all of these things are

95
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:43,139
outside the scope of this draft and

96
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:48,210
topic for discussion with the working

97
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:52,889
group where multicast expertise exists

98
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:55,109
here we are working specifically to fill

99
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,900
and address a chartered item for a

100
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:02,030
spring what is

101
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:06,289
the applications sit which is what has

102
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:09,559
been defined here this is a forwarding

103
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,620
construct in it identify segments in the

104
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:17,450
data plane by an imperious label or asar

105
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:21,830
we succeed this is more like binding cid

106
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:24,800
and when a packet comes with that sit

107
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:28,760
then it get replicated to each of the e

108
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:33,010
grosses using the unique Ostrom so then

109
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:36,439
it perfectly max 284 or 2 in terms of

110
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:39,159
when the packets are replicated via

111
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:43,940
local policy is is a push operation as

112
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:46,910
Marie de SR re-texture 80 402 when

113
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,520
active segment is the application ID is

114
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,250
a simple continue operation and in the

115
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:57,230
downstream node is a simple next

116
00:08:52,250 --> 00:09:00,950
operation in terms of replication

117
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:03,200
segment as we discuss is is a local

118
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,390
segment in satiated on a single node in

119
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:08,570
the network which is you can think of it

120
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,660
ahead and then it performed application

121
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:14,270
over set of SR policies the SR policies

122
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:16,780
could be just desta for route which

123
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:20,060
means there it basically is a

124
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:22,010
best-effort unique ass using the prefix

125
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,369
seed of the downstream node that are

126
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:29,150
part of the set replication set or it

127
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,830
could be the SR policy which steer the

128
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:33,370
traffic through some traffic renewing

129
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:38,000
path to that set of downstream Lord

130
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,890
unicast fashion and is identified by

131
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:43,250
application ID and the node ID where

132
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:47,710
node ID is the idea of the node where

133
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,710
application segment is in sin she ate it

134
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:55,700
there are multiple implementation of

135
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,040
this graph that are available and at

136
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:01,580
least one deployment is known and

137
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,099
planned and that for that implementation

138
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:09,310
the code is in Bell Canada laugh for

139
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:13,029
trial or for deployment we will like

140
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:16,569
to get this simple document adopted as

141
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:19,480
per the charter item and I would like to

142
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:28,150
solicit any feedback comments my

143
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:31,720
colleague is also online rishabh any

144
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:35,189
comment so the color of the draft is to

145
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:37,960
have we find a local replication scheme

146
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:40,000
called segment replication we've

147
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:43,420
discussed with the chair of beam working

148
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,940
or and that some presentation related to

149
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,110
doing some multicast in spring networks

150
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,870
so if you're interested in that you can

151
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:57,150
also go to Beamer and they are likely to

152
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:57,150
start some discussion of the reduction

153
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:04,000
ok I I think this is a good idea so we

154
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:06,279
should I support this work because I

155
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,680
think it's very useful and a very easy

156
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:10,050
way to support multicast with second

157
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,890
round

158
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:17,979
thank you mean so you like to get a path

159
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:19,870
for the room into the support will as

160
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:23,530
concern is we started an adoption

161
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:27,010
carranza this time next week ok but but

162
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:30,579
in reality like pins work is different

163
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:32,200
in is would be proceed image work is

164
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,190
differences well just worse for

165
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,339
information we have discuss research oh

166
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:42,810
yeah Comanche from Siena I also want to

167
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:46,260
support this draft this is a really good

168
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:50,319
replication ingress replication stuff so

169
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:56,550
pretty straightforward okay thank you

170
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:59,550
thank you do you want to to present your

171
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:59,550
draft

172
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:31,490
good afternoon everyone so this is a

173
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:37,360
draft on how to use BGP LS EPE for entry

174
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:39,320
a s purposes so on behalf of co-authors

175
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,870
presenting this job this draft was

176
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,399
presented in IDR in Prague and we got a

177
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:46,510
feedback that we should present it in

178
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,510
spring as well

179
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,870
so this draft is regarding bgp LS

180
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:15,900
extensions for BGP EP and using that

181
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:20,580
advertisements for inter areas traffic

182
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:23,550
engineering purposes for SR networks so

183
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:27,960
there are some gaps in being able to use

184
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:29,579
BGP LS EPE for inter areas traffic

185
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,690
engineering purposes so let's see what

186
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:36,839
are the problem so so this is for

187
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:38,640
deployment use case where - it's a

188
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:43,980
single administrative domain but

189
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:46,470
deployed in two different aliases so we

190
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,450
have this protection mechanism for EPE

191
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,910
said so you could you if you have an

192
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,279
adjacency peer adjacency said you could

193
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:56,250
define another adjacency see it as a

194
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,350
backup for this so that when this link

195
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,910
goes down you can use that other

196
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,580
adjacency see it as a your traffic will

197
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:06,140
flow on the other adjacency set so

198
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,520
imagine a controller which is doing

199
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,770
traffic engineering and coming up with

200
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:13,260
which Sid should be used for which kind

201
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:16,050
of traffic it really doesn't know which

202
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:18,300
if the when it fails where the traffic

203
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:21,209
is going to go and whether that has

204
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:22,949
enough bandwidth or not so to be able to

205
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:27,150
do that this controller is going to

206
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:29,610
learn the EPE seeds from the ESB ours so

207
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:31,530
it can also learn which Sid is a backup

208
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:36,890
for is being used as backup for which

209
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:42,930
other Sid so we define this F bit in the

210
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:44,640
existing flags and this this fr Sid will

211
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,040
be included as part of the peer

212
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,439
adjacency sit advertisement just how you

213
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,930
would include appear succeed but for

214
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:58,440
tier set said the F flag would not be

215
00:14:54,930 --> 00:15:00,959
set whereas for in for a Sid which is in

216
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,180
getting included as part to to indicate

217
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,609
that it's a it's you being used as

218
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,239
backup the F bit will be set that that's

219
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:08,240
what the idea is

220
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:21,699
so second problem so this is regarding

221
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:28,990
it's an up so that in this context the F

222
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:32,620
bit stands for FRR is that right yes so

223
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,360
second problem is peer node set so this

224
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:37,540
is a case where there is an e BGP

225
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,880
multi-hop session between the two a SS

226
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,630
between r1 and r2 which are the s peers

227
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:48,130
and we have a peer node set

228
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:49,960
advertisement for this ebgp multi-hop

229
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:51,970
peering session and traffic is expected

230
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,530
to load balance between these two links

231
00:15:51,970 --> 00:16:00,760
shown here so as part of peer nodes it

232
00:15:56,530 --> 00:16:03,910
advertisement what we get is the BGP

233
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:07,180
multi-hop session local addresses which

234
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:09,189
is r1 and r2 loopback addresses so the

235
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:13,750
controller doesn't really know which are

236
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:16,630
the actual links that are being used for

237
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:18,790
this node set so a controller that is

238
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,470
doing traffic engineering and doing

239
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:22,480
bandwidth management it can't really

240
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:26,200
know what are the links and what has

241
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:32,140
associated bandwidth with respect to

242
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:34,120
those links so the proposal is so when

243
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,890
you advertise appear nodes it and when

244
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,230
you want to do traffic engineering and

245
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,449
bandwidth management over these peer

246
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:43,600
adjacency said it is a must for each of

247
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:45,370
those links so peer nodes that can be

248
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,900
used for load balancing like you have

249
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,090
one set and you can load balance your

250
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,740
traffic across the true links but you

251
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:52,780
should separately also advertise peer

252
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,280
adjacency said and associate all the

253
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:57,880
traffic engineering attributes to that

254
00:16:54,280 --> 00:17:00,100
adjacency set so this draft mandates the

255
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,770
peer at Jason sees advertisement of peer

256
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:07,089
at Jason's he said even though you

257
00:17:02,770 --> 00:17:10,270
advertise peer nodes it and one more

258
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:13,869
property is you cannot you should also

259
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:19,449
advertise as an attribute in peer node

260
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:22,179
said the link addresses so there's a new

261
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:25,420
TL we defined which is the link address

262
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,610
TL v it carries

263
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,470
the interface addresses of the links

264
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:33,610
which are corresponding to the peer node

265
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:36,580
state so the TLB looks like this it has

266
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:38,879
type length and number of ipv4 interface

267
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:42,010
address pairs and number of ipv6

268
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:47,710
interface addresses and the actual pair

269
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:49,570
of interface addresses so when both so

270
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:52,150
this is a case where some interfaces are

271
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:54,460
ipv4 and some underlying interfaces are

272
00:17:52,150 --> 00:18:01,240
ipv4 and some underlying interfaces are

273
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:05,500
ipv6 in that case the the ipv4 addresses

274
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:08,020
are encoded first followed by the ipv6

275
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:10,240
addresses so the controller is

276
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,139
responsible for looking at clear notes

277
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,760
it and these attributes and correlate

278
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:21,580
which peer adjacency sits these pianos

279
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,620
it corresponds to and get the traffic

280
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:26,439
engineering attributes such as bandwidth

281
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:30,570
and other color link color or other

282
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:33,250
traffic engineering attributes from this

283
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:34,720
this advertisement so this this

284
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:41,200
advertisement is mainly used for

285
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:43,030
correlation by the controller that's the

286
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,000
summary it strengthens the interests

287
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:48,340
srte in in this particular mentioned

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:19:01,840
scenario we request to review and

289
00:18:48,340 --> 00:19:04,870
comments from agama you know for the

290
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,490
increase authority in order and they

291
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:12,280
also follow either the arc here here I

292
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:17,110
charge the one to ask the yoga if you

293
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:22,149
based on the EPA to build the interest

294
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:27,490
about you so if we have several partners

295
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:32,140
or SBR between given s so doesn't need

296
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:36,330
to be needed every SPR to run the PCBs

297
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:41,789
or protocol yeah that's right yes

298
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:45,000
maybe maybe some deployment the Shiksha

299
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:50,908
you know because you know in our network

300
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:57,120
there are almost every edge rotor or

301
00:19:50,909 --> 00:20:00,600
connector is our main network so so in a

302
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,719
way based on the EPS Rosen the in the

303
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:07,100
area as you not her must run the PCBs

304
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:13,200
proto I think the he's a maybe some

305
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:16,529
accessibility issue yeah so but for EPE

306
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,779
purposes you anyway have to run BGP LS

307
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:22,350
PPE and this mechanism is just you

308
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:28,889
reusing that to build interest paths

309
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:37,139
across the two cooperating domains thank

310
00:20:28,889 --> 00:20:43,729
you thank you any more comments so next

311
00:20:37,139 --> 00:20:43,729
button is a rakish from 41

312
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:08,439
good afternoon everyone my name is

313
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:12,668
Lucky's candy and presenting this SRP

314
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:18,399
and drops using T one plight on behalf

315
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:25,259
of the authors and contributors sorry I

316
00:21:18,399 --> 00:21:28,239
do have a cold so is it better thank you

317
00:21:25,259 --> 00:21:36,070
so there were two other drafts as well

318
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:38,500
the 163 74 MPLS sr and pls io am so both

319
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:40,509
drafts are now moved to the MPLS working

320
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:43,360
group so they were on agenda but we

321
00:21:40,509 --> 00:21:46,509
won't be presenting them they were

322
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:51,250
presented Monday in the MPLS working

323
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:54,399
group so the agenda is requirements and

324
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:58,690
scope the history of this draft the

325
00:21:54,399 --> 00:22:00,850
updates we have made since ITF in Prague

326
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,399
based on many review comments and

327
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:08,590
suggestions the summary and the next

328
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:11,439
steps so the requirements is a delay and

329
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:15,580
lost measurement for links as well as

330
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,360
end-to-end SR policies both SR MPLS as

331
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:21,639
well as sr v six data planes no need to

332
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,620
bootstrap the PMC essence I think this

333
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:26,529
means no negotiation no signaling

334
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,268
that's the spirit of SR it is stateless

335
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:34,120
on egress node again goes with the SR

336
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:37,779
simplicity we need to handle the ICI

337
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:41,590
mp4s our policies a support direct mode

338
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:44,759
loss measurement as well so the scope is

339
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:49,539
using the RFC 53 57

340
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:53,470
1212 light probe messages we have now

341
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:55,539
also included the stamp step is was

342
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:59,259
approved by IES D so it should become an

343
00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:02,500
RFC soon it's a fixed length version of

344
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:08,259
prompt light and basically using the

345
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:10,509
user configure UDP ports so the history

346
00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:13,870
of this draft he was first published in

347
00:23:10,509 --> 00:23:18,160
February this year but it is based on

348
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:21,250
the UDP PM draft that we had published

349
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:25,840
the year before so uses that is just an

350
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:28,420
evaluation after the UDP PM draft so

351
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,250
it's been around for some time now this

352
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,560
was presented in Prague in spring

353
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,380
working group and then it was also

354
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:39,730
presented in AI ppm working group in

355
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,670
Montreal so based on the review comments

356
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,940
suggestions many many thanks to everyone

357
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:48,880
who contributed we have updated the

358
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,670
drafts we welcome back as well as Bart

359
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,400
as co-authors we have added the

360
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,700
provisioning model that useful for this

361
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,550
solution now also include the Stamp

362
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:04,000
message formats also define the

363
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:08,050
look-back measurement modes we have

364
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:10,150
added a TLB for to a measurement mode we

365
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:12,520
have clarified and added the message

366
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:16,810
processing rules for TTL a router alert

367
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:20,050
option and UDP checksum also elaborated

368
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:22,179
procedure for p2 MPs our policy there is

369
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:25,270
some format alignments between loss and

370
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:29,140
delay measurement as well and some

371
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:30,910
editorial changes so just to give a

372
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:34,510
summary of the changes that we have made

373
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:37,140
since this was presented last time so

374
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:40,210
this is a provisioning model basically

375
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,890
both the sender and responder provision

376
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:45,130
for the delay or loss and the

377
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:51,400
corresponding UDP port times them format

378
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:53,260
V TP or NTP along with protocols it

379
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:59,860
could be to imply it or stamp and

380
00:24:53,260 --> 00:25:02,560
whatnot authentication key and mode so

381
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:07,000
the it now defines the measurement modes

382
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:10,389
so one way is that replies sent out of

383
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:13,690
been an IP UDP pass to a measurement

384
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:16,210
mode reply sent using the return path

385
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:18,940
TLV that's received in the query message

386
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:21,730
and in the loopback measurement mode the

387
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,530
probe query message contained the return

388
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:26,260
path in the header of the packet

389
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:28,379
so basically packets are not pointed on

390
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,580
the responder side

391
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:37,049
so this is the return party L we define

392
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:41,199
this is carried in the Trump or Stamp

393
00:25:37,049 --> 00:25:43,809
query messages it defines various types

394
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,360
for SR MPLS as well as SR basics

395
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:52,720
including the bind corresponding binding

396
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:54,909
seats as well so this is the the message

397
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,870
format defined for direct mode loss

398
00:25:54,910 --> 00:26:00,880
measurement so they have fixed the main

399
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,678
characteristic is that it's a fixed

400
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,679
length and they have fixed a location

401
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:08,679
for their counters so it's it makes it

402
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,330
Hardware friendly and it's aligned with

403
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:11,799
the DM message format as well so if

404
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:13,240
Hardware knows where to come timestamp

405
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,480
hardware will also know where to put the

406
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:19,390
counter we have also defined them for

407
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,340
authenticated mode and this is basically

408
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:24,490
using a different UDP port desk user

409
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:28,030
configure for loss and the one in purple

410
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:32,380
is is basically for stamp is a fixed

411
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:34,629
format so the padding is not required so

412
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,059
our next steps we welcome your comments

413
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:40,390
and suggestions this has been

414
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:43,030
implemented and deployed we presented

415
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,559
this talk in a ppm and they asked us to

416
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,320
keep them in the loop about the

417
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,270
milestones we do believe that the

418
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,740
draftee is ready for working or

419
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:55,770
production in spring Thanks any comments

420
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,770
questions

421
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:08,620
so was write the draft but 10:15 p.m.

422
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:09,870
among the person was waiter to have to

423
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,479
believe it's ready for adoption

424
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:17,049
[Music]

425
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,100
what's the same on any person believe

426
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:20,100
it's not ready for adoption

427
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:28,900
okay nobody so discuss with a with rod

428
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,400
we have as you have noticed we have a

429
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:37,500
few back roads who drove the back of a

430
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:40,130
truck to our doctrine we are working to

431
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:44,360
advertise that on a public

432
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:47,660
webpage that it's more or it's clarified

433
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,490
with everyone but we'll consider that

434
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:51,530
definitely there is a support in in the

435
00:27:49,490 --> 00:28:00,710
room and we need to confirm Alonso on

436
00:27:51,530 --> 00:28:19,760
the list okay thank you thank you so

437
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:24,830
next is afar thank you thank you know so

438
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,990
this is a document that we presented

439
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:28,639
last time in spring working group and at

440
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:30,890
this ITF as following spring working

441
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,720
sorry last time in MPLS working group

442
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:36,970
and this time as well as in MPLS working

443
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,530
group is certainly something that we're

444
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:44,240
looking at the chairs in terms of the

445
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:48,500
home for this work the document talks

446
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,650
about generic FAC TVs for less beeping

447
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:56,450
and I am presenting on behalf of my

448
00:28:51,650 --> 00:29:01,789
quarters so problem statement goes as

449
00:28:56,450 --> 00:29:05,360
follows in MPLS for O&M purposes for

450
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:11,780
ping and traceroute we define effect

451
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:15,979
stack sub Calvi and to date every time

452
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:21,129
we define a new set type we have to go

453
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:25,659
and define a new stack tell me and

454
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:28,429
define procedure associated with it it

455
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:29,990
the way that do i name because i define

456
00:29:28,429 --> 00:29:32,960
that it then it requires a software

457
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:36,530
upgrade depending on the type of the

458
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,470
segment ID that is deployed and then it

459
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:41,658
also raises scaling issues with respect

460
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:47,539
to the amount of information that are

461
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:49,990
needed to properly fill the fac sub

462
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:49,990
Calvi

463
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:58,939
this is not to pick a specific example

464
00:29:55,610 --> 00:30:04,699
but this is some of the factoids that

465
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:07,640
are in queue and and basically the point

466
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,470
to show here is this is the amount of

467
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:14,020
information that goes for when in

468
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:17,150
purposes is large part of it is because

469
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:21,080
the way that MPLS when M is designed is

470
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:26,500
to always do the airplane versus control

471
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:29,750
plane validation and to carry the entire

472
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:33,560
information for the control plane is

473
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:35,210
where the complexity and the amount of

474
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:39,560
information that is required to fill in

475
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:41,540
comes it is a complexity from the point

476
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,780
of view of ingress note being able to

477
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:49,340
gather this information and then carry

478
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:55,160
in the packet four probe for onn probe

479
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:57,050
and it's also in well has complexity for

480
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,390
the egress because the negress has to

481
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,820
validate a lot more information read the

482
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:03,320
information gather the information do

483
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:08,600
lot more processing again that

484
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:13,550
information so and then we talked about

485
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:16,280
that this becomes a case where for every

486
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:20,720
sit type you have to define a new fact

487
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:23,389
type which in reality we have defined

488
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:28,130
zip-tie for which onm factoid has not

489
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:30,610
been defined yet and and that is causing

490
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:36,020
problem with respect within deployments

491
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:40,250
so in deployments a lot of time the

492
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:43,220
basic one type of fact that always work

493
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:48,200
is new effect but it has no validation

494
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:52,850
at all for no egress validation but it

495
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:57,350
is consistent that no matter what sit

496
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:59,149
type you have the no effect work now

497
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:02,629
that is the

498
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:05,478
motivation behind and then from that as

499
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:09,529
the motivation we started to see that

500
00:32:05,479 --> 00:32:13,269
okay maybe you look at the SR CID data

501
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:16,070
model and based on the data model define

502
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:18,440
one fact that consistent with the data

503
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:20,899
model and we focus on data plane

504
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,869
validation and and leave the data plane

505
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:28,518
to controller and consistency check King

506
00:32:23,869 --> 00:32:33,439
to a local procedure at the node every

507
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:35,839
node has procedures to locally check its

508
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,239
own data plane with control plane no

509
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:40,969
remote node has to tell them oh by the

510
00:32:38,239 --> 00:32:41,559
way can you check this this is a local

511
00:32:40,969 --> 00:32:44,509
matter

512
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,979
so that also lead to simplification and

513
00:32:44,509 --> 00:32:50,089
that is the more main motivation here

514
00:32:47,979 --> 00:32:55,239
signal routing is all about simplifying

515
00:32:50,089 --> 00:32:57,859
the operation and I think when M is not

516
00:32:55,239 --> 00:33:02,869
really simplifying but it is because of

517
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:07,849
the the history of control derrickman

518
00:33:02,869 --> 00:33:10,509
validation we have complexity stay so

519
00:33:07,849 --> 00:33:14,359
from effect so once we take that as our

520
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:16,039
data model base data model and then we

521
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:20,299
define some procedures so that would

522
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:24,609
lead to procedure that would be based on

523
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:30,049
local at the ego site based on the local

524
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:33,939
implementation maintaining a CID ID to

525
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:36,649
interface mapping by any node and

526
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,809
initiator would just put in the data

527
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:41,119
field that I require like which is the

528
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:45,109
segment whose the segment initiator and

529
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:47,689
it can also in many cases if you can

530
00:33:45,109 --> 00:33:50,059
fill the endpoint address that could be

531
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,559
used directly for validation as well and

532
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:55,999
it simplifies much more and also covers

533
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:59,408
binding segment or pinging a binding

534
00:33:55,999 --> 00:34:02,749
segment so we included that as well

535
00:33:59,409 --> 00:34:06,710
so your Eric fact is label fact is

536
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:09,199
nothing but what is yes all said and who

537
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:12,210
has assigned it and optionally adding

538
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:16,350
the endpoint address

539
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:18,449
and and Syd obviously as did the label

540
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,580
the 20 bit label and the assignor is the

541
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:23,580
node ID of the designer that has signed

542
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:27,480
it and unless the endpoint may be set to

543
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:29,400
zero when the initiator doesn't know who

544
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:31,469
would be the endpoint but maybe set to

545
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,639
the end point let's say binding Syd if

546
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:38,399
the ping is for the binding said and

547
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,139
endpoint is known however if penis to a

548
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,300
pair religion see than the endpoint is

549
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,310
not known so depending on these

550
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,710
circumstances at the endpoint is

551
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:51,270
optional

552
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:53,670
so let's go over this in some cases that

553
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:59,250
do not work today and how it will work

554
00:34:53,670 --> 00:35:06,060
with with this tactic so here we say

555
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:09,420
that 16000 0 0 X is the H is the prefix

556
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:13,830
it associated with algo 0 and it and the

557
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:18,900
example here is using the same fact to

558
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:22,680
address ping or tray straight prefix it

559
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:26,070
for elbow 128 or any other elbow today

560
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,259
we don't have this procedure today we

561
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,620
don't have this coverage but the way it

562
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:36,240
will work here is that we will the

563
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:40,259
initiator 1 will carry the facts so

564
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,580
let's say take one example at time so we

565
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:47,580
want to send to paint prefix it with

566
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:51,750
algo 0 then the initiator will carry the

567
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:54,930
prefix 8 16 thousand and z8 the assignor

568
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:59,130
is our H and the LS the end point is our

569
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:02,009
8 when the packet comes to note eighth

570
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:04,110
note eighth know that it can receive

571
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,970
this packet either on link 1 or link to

572
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,190
it is the end point is very simple case

573
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:13,770
and no date can send the response

574
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:16,380
positive or negative accordingly now the

575
00:36:13,770 --> 00:36:21,050
same procedure would apply for flexible

576
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,840
based prefix set labels so that says 16

577
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:26,530
128

578
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:29,170
it with a less the end point eight and

579
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,080
the assignor are it will well exactly

580
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:35,020
same way as for excel go so we can have

581
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:37,540
coverage across the Fraxel group without

582
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,970
having to define a new set type or

583
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:45,759
extending the flex elbow ID in the

584
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:49,180
existing track so if you take thing with

585
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,220
the parallel agency said the payroll

586
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:58,180
agency said case today is not covered by

587
00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:01,660
RFC because the initiator one does not

588
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:05,529
know which interface the parisian see

589
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:08,410
will hash to so it is a local madras

590
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:10,600
seven so initiator from one would not

591
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:17,200
know to hence it put zero zero zero as

592
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:20,790
as the as the target value for the for

593
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,910
the interface where it would be

594
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:27,520
receiving the packet here is with this

595
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,770
factoid would be easy because what will

596
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:33,130
be carried in the in the fact is the

597
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:35,560
city which is the agency said and then

598
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:41,070
in this case parallel agencies in 1993

599
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:44,049
78 and the signer which is are seven and

600
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:47,710
the LSP point in this case could be are

601
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:50,080
eight but it could be zero zero zero now

602
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:55,060
regardless of where the packet will go

603
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:56,620
to when the packet comes to eight eight

604
00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,340
has a local table that basically say

605
00:37:56,620 --> 00:38:02,920
that oh this is not my local label but I

606
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:05,500
receive it from my neighbor is the

607
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,770
assignor my upstream neighbor yes

608
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:11,890
does this label belongs to the of him

609
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:14,920
neighbor agency said on the interface I

610
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:17,770
receive the packet yes so it's good

611
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:19,450
otherwise it feels it now this is

612
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:21,310
improvement from the current condition

613
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,950
because in current condition because

614
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:27,160
they put the link ID to be zero zero

615
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:29,560
zero it can receive the packet from any

616
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,160
into any other neighbor and will still

617
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,290
think that it has it has reached from

618
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,710
the right neighbor and the validation

619
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:40,839
will still pass

620
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:43,880
so this is strict compared to that and

621
00:38:40,839 --> 00:38:46,460
then the same thing will work in the

622
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,800
case when you have parallel agency to

623
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,099
different neighbor in this case

624
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:56,569
teledensity to neighbor 8 or neighbor 88

625
00:38:52,099 --> 00:39:02,540
and the agency said associated with it

626
00:38:56,569 --> 00:39:04,970
97 78 7 will do hashing based on

627
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:08,089
whatever load-balancing parameter that

628
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:11,629
it carries packet may end at 8 or 88

629
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:14,410
there is no end point specify 0 0 0 but

630
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:18,920
when the packet received either 4 8 or

631
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:22,759
88 it can locally verify that yes this

632
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,089
label assigned by r7 and yes the

633
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:28,190
interface on which I receive the packet

634
00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:33,880
cross pawn to this agency said assigned

635
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:33,880
by the r7 and it can respond accordingly

636
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:46,460
so like I said that this requires a to

637
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:50,440
carry this mapping table and then thing

638
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:56,329
just to recap is that motivation here is

639
00:39:50,440 --> 00:40:01,849
to really go and simplify Zack type for

640
00:39:56,329 --> 00:40:03,650
onm operation for segment outing with

641
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:07,339
this and then in such a way that we can

642
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:11,750
cover all different seat types that are

643
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:18,589
today or in future and we can extend

644
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:20,599
this for for we can easily support it

645
00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:22,940
once and then we don't have to do

646
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:27,829
software upgrade to define in fact I

647
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:31,849
have etcetera please some already same

648
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:35,750
two questions if the target is

649
00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:38,930
edek acid you what is the procedure like

650
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:42,760
you're going to use to validate it is a

651
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:45,489
come home attain if it is any caste if

652
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:50,829
is any caste you

653
00:40:45,489 --> 00:40:52,819
how exactly you're going to validate the

654
00:40:50,829 --> 00:40:55,880
so the any cars what is the

655
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:58,819
recommendation so any cars can grow with

656
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:07,789
the end point because you would know no

657
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:10,940
and any cars said hold on a second so

658
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:16,940
you have I think what we get the New

659
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:20,089
York on we can take it we can take it

660
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,119
off limb but I've actually have cast is

661
00:41:20,089 --> 00:41:25,249
also prefix it so it will be any cast

662
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,309
prefect the end point would be the any

663
00:41:25,249 --> 00:41:31,368
cast IP address so if I'm recovering you

664
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:33,709
have this validation yes performed for

665
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:37,459
each of the sub link or like yes so if I

666
00:41:33,709 --> 00:41:38,509
am getting the final packet and I own

667
00:41:37,459 --> 00:41:41,180
that address

668
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:43,489
it's one of my addresses it could be any

669
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:45,049
case I will respond the success so in

670
00:41:43,489 --> 00:41:47,749
this case even if the link breaks you

671
00:41:45,049 --> 00:41:50,029
cannot really detect correct yes so it

672
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:52,339
was meant to validate the any cost

673
00:41:50,029 --> 00:41:55,910
so as long as it tree has reached the

674
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:57,769
end cast node it's all good okay so that

675
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,319
means this validation really doesn't

676
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:03,948
help in the case of if the targets like

677
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:06,859
is the fact is there any cost effect so

678
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:09,650
as long as it delivered it okay yeah

679
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:12,319
Kate anthological sis purser sure the

680
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:18,559
other question is how many other types

681
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:24,769
of the sits you have defined so far that

682
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:28,299
this generic the idea here would be to

683
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:31,910
define this just one and then cover this

684
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:35,299
procedure around it that that can cover

685
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:37,848
all different types and is feature

686
00:42:35,299 --> 00:42:40,489
expendable because the element that we

687
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:44,569
are going after is the yang model of the

688
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:46,549
data yang model of sr so and then the

689
00:42:44,569 --> 00:42:49,670
target here is to really validate the

690
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:51,829
data point not carry all information to

691
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,690
carry to compare the data plane and

692
00:42:51,829 --> 00:42:55,819
consistently check with the control mean

693
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:58,760
yeah I got that order all I'm asking is

694
00:42:55,819 --> 00:43:01,100
so far how many of them were defined

695
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:04,090
and are you going to duplicate all those

696
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:09,650
which were defined so far with this new

697
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:14,660
no no I mean it's not going to do again

698
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:16,700
it is for then the types that are not

699
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:18,740
defined yet less safe as a flex I'll go

700
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,379
if not covered by name serious or

701
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:23,330
covered there are other use cases but

702
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,780
that are not covered but what is already

703
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:29,900
defined and in RFC if is a procedure

704
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:32,390
that will continue to be like this is in

705
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:34,460
your depreciation here but I mean if it

706
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:37,370
is going to solve the any new types

707
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:39,650
upcoming new types also then that means

708
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:42,350
they should solve the existing ones as

709
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,150
well correct so if that is the case then

710
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:46,279
you might as well just define this one

711
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:49,040
and say all others you don't even have

712
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,780
to have use it I think that would be

713
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,390
working of decision but I think since

714
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:57,650
there are deployments and all I don't

715
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:59,450
think that is necessary but I mean if

716
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,730
there are some corner cases then that

717
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:03,560
means those corner cases could arise in

718
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,910
the future definitions as well but

719
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:08,330
that's yeah point it is more like a

720
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:10,609
rhetorical question yeah if it is going

721
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:12,620
to solve the problem of all the things

722
00:44:10,610 --> 00:44:16,970
which are going to coming up then you

723
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:19,370
might as well keep this as the one and

724
00:44:16,970 --> 00:44:21,109
all of this yeah but I just do different

725
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,020
things here like there are additional

726
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:26,930
features that come with the existing

727
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:29,030
fact type and those features are welcome

728
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:31,879
to use for people so I think having an

729
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:35,990
option is better than depreciation I

730
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:38,360
pick more for that and and share theirs

731
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:40,819
on the mic like some discussion we share

732
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,180
there as well as going on for the new

733
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:45,320
definitions that are coming and we're

734
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,910
cooperating so that's why we're not

735
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:50,180
asking for adoption here but more

736
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:52,310
feedback and working with with with

737
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,390
other folks like shadow and and Tariq

738
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:58,490
and others yeah I totally agree with Sam

739
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:01,940
that there may be corner cases because

740
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:06,740
since Monday to Thursday I see that one

741
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:08,630
corner case was brought up in on Monday

742
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:12,080
and I'd already see one more field

743
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:12,590
getting added here so we might find more

744
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:16,130
current

745
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:18,100
yes and no i yeah yeah but I think if

746
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:21,890
you remember this was presented in

747
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:24,200
Montreal I had a type on the slide on

748
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,930
Monday so this was not favored you

749
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:28,819
you're welcome to check monitors right

750
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:31,069
100% please check and a percent check

751
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:39,320
before making his comment please check

752
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:40,790
that Tariq from juniper so far if you

753
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:47,300
can go back a couple of slides where you

754
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:50,450
will find the FAQ if one Oh No yeah yeah

755
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:53,720
yeah so so here you're able to put in

756
00:45:50,450 --> 00:45:56,930
the sit the signer and the end point so

757
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:58,850
you can validate on the end point or the

758
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:02,419
egress you can validate the city's valid

759
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:05,690
the signer is correct and we reach the

760
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:08,870
end point but you don't validate what

761
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:12,080
this sit is assigned to it's missing and

762
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:13,730
and the last statement you said you know

763
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,500
I'm just you know capturing what you

764
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:17,690
said this we're doing data plane we're

765
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:20,170
really validation of you know the label

766
00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:24,320
is correct or actually the label is

767
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:28,400
allocated correctly on the egress is

768
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:30,110
allocated correctly or not so it could

769
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,130
be an option that you want to just

770
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:35,990
validate that the label is as valid and

771
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:40,370
but I don't think you can deprecated the

772
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:42,049
other effects that are defined it could

773
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:46,100
be an option this is what my opinion is

774
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:50,800
and I agree with Derek I agree it's not

775
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,799
supposed to meant to depreciate anything

776
00:46:51,760 --> 00:47:00,530
hello we got a question from Java

777
00:46:55,810 --> 00:47:04,090
swoosh Hari asked if the link between

778
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:07,100
around 7 and router 8 become

779
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:12,380
unidirectional with the proposal be able

780
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:18,410
to fight it if the link between r7 and

781
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:25,100
r8 is you need know yes we the proposal

782
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:33,200
be able to fight it yes I don't know

783
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:37,940
I grew ignore CCT so it was very

784
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:43,569
interesting your response to tarik you

785
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:46,250
don't see that this generic FAQ will

786
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:51,760
bring us to the point where we want to

787
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:55,400
deprecated existing isolated facts

788
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:57,620
No I only had different functionality I

789
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,750
think that are able to do consistently

790
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:02,000
check between the dead opening but in

791
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:06,200
control but then why would we call it

792
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,260
generic because if we have other facts

793
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:14,120
that already being specified and we

794
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:16,190
introduced fact that I agree it's more

795
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:18,470
flexible and a future-proof

796
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,170
why wouldn't we consider at least

797
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:23,620
consider and discuss whether just make

798
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:28,520
it through the generic for a sir

799
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:30,859
yeah this is fine completely fine and

800
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:35,390
whether we fit genetic factor label fake

801
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:37,100
or find another name perfectly fine it

802
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:39,620
could we can call a label factor or s

803
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:43,759
our FAQ or s our genetic fact that's all

804
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:47,000
perfectly fine okay just let's keep it

805
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,980
the option okay yeah yeah this is for

806
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,980
sure s are for question thank you

807
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:19,440
hello my name is tarick

808
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:23,970
i'm going to introduce to you segmenting

809
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:27,809
/ forwarding adjacency links so this

810
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:32,089
work is a collaboration between myself

811
00:49:27,809 --> 00:49:32,089
my colleagues Pavan and Kobi

812
00:49:32,599 --> 00:49:37,170
I'll go over the motivation give you a

813
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,480
little bit of overview I'm sure you've

814
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:42,240
heard about these FA links in the past

815
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,670
and how we can enable segments routing

816
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:50,009
on them and how we can use them and

817
00:49:44,670 --> 00:49:53,520
we'll talk about the next steps so we

818
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:55,829
wanted to improve scalability in the SR

819
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:58,349
Network by creating subpaths as our sub

820
00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:01,609
paths and the concatenation of these sub

821
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:03,960
paths will give you the end-to-end path

822
00:50:01,609 --> 00:50:07,400
we want to reduce the size of the

823
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:11,130
topology by you know creating these

824
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:15,030
summarized or compressed links if you

825
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:16,680
can think of we want to allow seamless

826
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,809
reroute and we optimization of the sub

827
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:22,859
path that does not impact the end-to-end

828
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:25,140
SR path and we want to allow stitching

829
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:27,390
of domains that are running different

830
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:32,910
technologies signaling technologies like

831
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:37,078
RSVP and NSR and still create an

832
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:39,299
end-to-end as our path and we want to be

833
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:42,270
able to customize that apologies that we

834
00:50:39,299 --> 00:50:46,099
can we export from the domain they are

835
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:51,390
based on certain requirements based on

836
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:53,520
SLA Zoar and so on so about a little bit

837
00:50:51,390 --> 00:50:56,339
about forwarding at jccc links they were

838
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:58,470
introduced back in RFC 4206

839
00:50:56,339 --> 00:51:02,040
they are point-to-point virtual links

840
00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:06,629
they can appear in ITP LS DB or into the

841
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:08,849
ted traffic engineering database such

842
00:51:06,630 --> 00:51:13,109
links have the endpoints as the ingress

843
00:51:08,849 --> 00:51:16,230
and egress of the fa LSP the forwarding

844
00:51:13,109 --> 00:51:19,170
over the fa LSP is bound to one or more

845
00:51:16,230 --> 00:51:19,900
F sorry the forwarding over the fa link

846
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:23,260
is

847
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,000
to one or more fals be the fals visa as

848
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,250
I mentioned they can be signaled using

849
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:32,559
different technologies it can be SR or

850
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:34,180
RSVP or static LSP for that matter they

851
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:38,349
can have traffic engineering attributes

852
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:40,960
or parameters and we can obviously

853
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:46,930
assign them segment routing segments and

854
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:48,970
and enable steering over them in terms

855
00:51:46,930 --> 00:51:52,629
of creation and management of such

856
00:51:48,970 --> 00:51:54,970
logical fa links we we think they can be

857
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:58,029
configured with operator can decide they

858
00:51:54,970 --> 00:52:00,910
want to configure such an F a link or a

859
00:51:58,029 --> 00:52:03,400
controller can use any northbound

860
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:06,940
interface or of our signaling protocol

861
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:09,400
like P subnet confit RPC your favorite

862
00:52:06,940 --> 00:52:13,779
and automatically or dynamically create

863
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:15,970
such links in terms of the state if the

864
00:52:13,779 --> 00:52:20,859
underlying LSP or at least one of them

865
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:23,529
is valid and signaled then the FHFA link

866
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:26,710
is operational and ready to accept

867
00:52:23,529 --> 00:52:28,329
traffic if a link the attributes they

868
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:30,670
can be dynamically derived from the

869
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:34,619
underlying LSPs or they can be

870
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:37,900
overridden by the operator statically

871
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:41,230
now they have a link it can be numbered

872
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,990
or unnumbered for numbered obviously

873
00:52:41,230 --> 00:52:45,460
will be assigning addresses to them

874
00:52:42,990 --> 00:52:48,879
local and remote for unnumbered there

875
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:55,000
will be an identifier unique on the on

876
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:57,520
each endpoint typically depending on the

877
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:59,920
underlying signaling of the LSP you

878
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,549
might be able to gather the remote ID

879
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:06,789
for each side for example in our an RSVP

880
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:10,000
there is a way to collect it in SR

881
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:12,940
there's no such way to identify the

882
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,270
remote ID it's enough for Anna numbered

883
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:18,880
link unidirectional to have the local

884
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:21,029
and remote no descriptors as well as the

885
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,109
local identifier to pin down the link

886
00:53:21,029 --> 00:53:27,339
now there are these symmetrical FA links

887
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:31,480
basically there are links that are Co

888
00:53:27,339 --> 00:53:33,799
routed the LSP is underneath traverse

889
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:36,240
the same path in the forward and reverse

890
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:39,990
so for this you need to tie them

891
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:45,930
together and the remote ID is useful in

892
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:47,790
that matter so we want to enable segment

893
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,319
routing over the FA link so that we can

894
00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:52,560
steer traffic on it

895
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:55,320
build a segment list and allow an

896
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:58,770
ingress to push traffic over such FA

897
00:53:55,320 --> 00:54:00,900
links the the SR architecture did

898
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:08,670
lightly touch on the concept of

899
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:10,349
forwarding adjacency so and I did

900
00:54:08,670 --> 00:54:12,270
mention that the underlying else we can

901
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:15,599
be signaled by other techniques like

902
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:18,920
then SR but we can still assign the FA

903
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:22,800
link and adjacency or I said a segment

904
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:25,400
if we do this not an obvious consequence

905
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,140
is our segment list will be shorter

906
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:33,210
obviously you can compress the long

907
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:36,839
segment list with shorter segments this

908
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:39,480
is something desirable once we have the

909
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,700
FA link it's it's treated normally as

910
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,800
any other link it's unlisted almost on

911
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:48,810
this thing we show from from any

912
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:50,790
physical link in the network so what

913
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:54,750
type of segments we can assign to an FA

914
00:54:50,790 --> 00:54:57,330
link we have IG PFA links we can assign

915
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,280
any JCC segments to them or parallel

916
00:54:57,330 --> 00:55:02,310
adjacency segment where your

917
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,890
load-balancing equally or unequally for

918
00:55:02,310 --> 00:55:12,690
BGP FA links such that they're

919
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:14,640
connecting to be GB nodes speakers we

920
00:55:12,690 --> 00:55:18,320
can assign an JCC segment that takes us

921
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:22,379
to specific next hop BGP next op or a a

922
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:27,210
peer note said it load balances on

923
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:30,720
multiple possible paths to the same node

924
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:33,330
and the peer set can actually take you

925
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:35,790
to multiple different next hops in the

926
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,950
set so all these are possible they're

927
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:42,779
all defined already with just a

928
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:45,270
reiterating that they are possible there

929
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:47,520
is an application for this to enter the

930
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:50,509
main I slightly hinted to it

931
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:53,670
we can we can provide the connectivity

932
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:57,450
ingress to egress using such fa links

933
00:55:53,670 --> 00:56:00,690
once we have that the end-to-end is just

934
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:04,049
a concatenation of this fals piece to

935
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:05,880
provide you the intent path you can do a

936
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:09,150
full mesh of FAA links between the

937
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:13,350
egress and ingress border notice or you

938
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:16,710
can do a hub-and-spoke type of FA links

939
00:56:13,350 --> 00:56:20,180
and export that and in fact you can

940
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:23,970
actually decorate these links with

941
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:26,790
certain tags and we're thinking of ug or

942
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:32,029
using BTW pls Maps for that matter there

943
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:37,380
is a draft a best enhanced VPN or VPN

944
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:40,200
enhanced VB and not even that VPN so we

945
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:44,760
were thinking of using that or applying

946
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:47,339
it so in terms of next steps this

947
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:50,880
currently is an informational draft I

948
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:55,230
did mention the remote ID is useful to

949
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:58,080
identify the core outed FA link we are

950
00:56:55,230 --> 00:57:00,690
investigating this at the moment we

951
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:02,330
might push a new extension and if that

952
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:05,820
happens we will transition at the

953
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:08,009
standards track we this is zero zero

954
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:10,619
version we do for a solicit feedback

955
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:14,270
from the working group and if you have

956
00:57:10,619 --> 00:57:14,270
any question I'm I'll be happy to answer

957
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:24,419
my first question would be would you

958
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:29,430
compare this to bindings it a little bit

959
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:31,830
indeed so yes and no if a link has an

960
00:57:29,430 --> 00:57:33,810
acid associated to it it can be a

961
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:37,020
binding set of the underlying as our

962
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:38,549
policy it can be but if the underlying

963
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,009
is an RSVP

964
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:43,020
LSP it would be a binding label or it

965
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:44,340
can be multiple LS fees in fact so I

966
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:46,380
didn't mention that but in the draft

967
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:49,410
they're mentioned but binding said is

968
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:51,480
one option yes what I mean was that can

969
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:54,000
I solve the same problem just by binding

970
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:55,590
said why would I go for this approach

971
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,760
what's the benefit that you are offering

972
00:57:55,590 --> 00:58:00,049
can you

973
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:03,199
so the idea is that we need advertise

974
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:06,380
this in BGP LS as a link and import it

975
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:09,769
into the Ted and allow anything that we

976
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:14,170
can do and on any BGP LS advertisement

977
00:58:09,769 --> 00:58:17,419
like tagging on the link and Al are I

978
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:19,849
and make it appear in the Ted right now

979
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,739
the binding set by itself there is no

980
00:58:19,849 --> 00:58:22,359
standard way how you push it into the

981
00:58:21,739 --> 00:58:28,369
Ted

982
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:31,910
so anyway one more question when would

983
00:58:28,369 --> 00:58:35,569
this link go down I didn't mention well

984
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:40,640
I can go back but the idea is the let me

985
00:58:35,569 --> 00:58:43,640
go back its Peter from Cisco hi Tarek so

986
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:46,640
if you remember a few years back I do

987
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:48,920
remember we we talk about the 401 in

988
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:52,069
each agency and we have somehow

989
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:53,900
concluded so I just want to make sure

990
00:58:52,069 --> 00:58:56,779
you want to advertise this as an IG

991
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:59,539
peeling right no and it's just a link in

992
00:58:56,779 --> 00:59:02,179
Ted into traffic engineering database

993
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:04,729
I'm not injecting and injecting it I'm

994
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:08,119
not proposing to inject it in IG p for

995
00:59:04,729 --> 00:59:10,549
biasing the steering of IDP it's just a

996
00:59:08,119 --> 00:59:16,189
traffic engineering link that will

997
00:59:10,549 --> 00:59:18,349
appear in the TE the database all right

998
00:59:16,189 --> 00:59:22,129
you know what's the difference then to a

999
00:59:18,349 --> 00:59:23,599
regular that's not the policy what's the

1000
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:27,799
difference between the regular society

1001
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:30,170
another so a link enough a link can have

1002
00:59:27,799 --> 00:59:33,799
one can be supported by 1's our policy

1003
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:36,109
or a multiple of sr policies it can have

1004
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:38,449
protection or cannot have protection so

1005
00:59:36,109 --> 00:59:41,209
there are many cases i didn't talk about

1006
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:43,579
them peter but so okay so this is not

1007
00:59:41,209 --> 00:59:46,910
the traditional forwarding agency as we

1008
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:49,519
know it from the RSVP t so the RFC that

1009
00:59:46,910 --> 00:59:51,949
i mentioned here talks about fa link as

1010
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:53,988
a traffic engineering link I do

1011
00:59:51,949 --> 00:59:56,599
encourage I'm not sure if you remember

1012
00:59:53,989 --> 00:59:58,429
that it's an old one Peter but I

1013
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,650
reference it on the slide ok that's fine

1014
00:59:58,429 --> 01:00:03,079
as soon as you not advertise this as a

1015
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:05,119
as a link in the ITB topology I'm fine

1016
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:07,459
yes well as you start doing it you have

1017
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:09,819
a travel I agree and this is why I

1018
01:00:07,459 --> 01:00:09,819
answered

1019
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:17,810
sisqó so tarik to add to what drew was

1020
01:00:16,099 --> 01:00:21,440
bringing I wanted to bring to our

1021
01:00:17,810 --> 01:00:23,900
attention that we have a draft which is

1022
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:27,830
a working group document for exporting

1023
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:29,690
such links via bt pls the only

1024
01:00:27,830 --> 01:00:32,660
difference is it's not done as a link

1025
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:36,200
NLRA it's done as a tea policy and

1026
01:00:32,660 --> 01:00:39,109
indirectly but functionally it can give

1027
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:41,118
you the same thing so I I did come

1028
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:44,960
across that you are advertising the

1029
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:47,150
policy and its state and attributes of

1030
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,820
the policy candidate path preference in

1031
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:50,210
here we have a link it's it's just a

1032
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:53,720
link

1033
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:56,599
it has attributes and I can do see SPF

1034
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:59,779
on it and I can tag the link with with

1035
01:00:56,599 --> 01:01:02,330
additional you know attributes or

1036
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:04,790
decorate the link if you want yeah so

1037
01:01:02,330 --> 01:01:06,859
that that the I would I would suggest to

1038
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:09,830
if you can think about I just as a

1039
01:01:06,859 --> 01:01:14,598
feedback to see if you want to add those

1040
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:18,470
on the SR policy this way the real IGP

1041
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:20,540
topology links and these failings do not

1042
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,129
get you know mixed up or can be viewed

1043
01:01:20,540 --> 01:01:25,130
separately all right then let's talk

1044
01:01:22,130 --> 01:01:27,740
about that sure we will cross the line

1045
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:30,290
on ribbon can you be brief reason okay

1046
01:01:27,740 --> 01:01:35,359
my quick question

1047
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:38,509
Roja we use ASA apply to only as our I'm

1048
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:43,310
cars all posts is our v6 and as I'm cars

1049
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:46,339
so at the at the current I did say I

1050
01:01:43,310 --> 01:01:47,960
mentioned MPLS but there are plans I

1051
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:49,970
actually in the draft I do mention that

1052
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:56,030
it can be applicable to SR physics as

1053
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:58,129
well so would be good to discuss whether

1054
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:00,859
you really need for these are essences

1055
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:03,250
or transport pass identified by biting

1056
01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:05,810
cities absorption is good enough and

1057
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:08,030
actually publish draft years ago on

1058
01:02:05,810 --> 01:02:10,250
integration of PI P n optical stuff

1059
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:17,839
which talks about to solve a signal is

1060
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:21,320
needed all right okay so UNIX is G so we

1061
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:23,920
have three slots related to network

1062
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,920
slicing

1063
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:29,010
just to be aware that there is a work

1064
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:32,069
going on in cheese working group related

1065
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:34,920
to network slicing so I'm assuming that

1066
01:02:32,069 --> 01:02:39,690
we are going to work on the generic work

1067
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:43,279
and I've yesterdays have several

1068
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:46,220
description related to design Tina so

1069
01:02:43,279 --> 01:02:50,220
since I are moving in T's working group

1070
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:53,160
and finally with a bit out of short of

1071
01:02:50,220 --> 01:02:55,950
time so please focus on spring related

1072
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,750
stuff or the rather than arrest generic

1073
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:00,500
slides which are going to be working

1074
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,500
Jesus thank you

1075
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:19,230
okay good afternoon everyone this is

1076
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,120
Jayden from Hawaii and going to give

1077
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:23,310
some updates about the seminar

1078
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:26,359
team-based the BPM class draft on behalf

1079
01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:26,360
of the other causes

1080
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:30,750
okay the background recap and I will

1081
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,430
cook for it quickly we have the

1082
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:34,890
framework in the teas working group and

1083
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:37,290
the same route is one of the candidate

1084
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:39,390
technology for this virtual networking

1085
01:03:37,290 --> 01:03:42,690
instantiation which is part of the

1086
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:44,460
overall picture and in this document we

1087
01:03:42,690 --> 01:03:45,990
describe the same routing based the

1088
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:48,720
mechanism to people to the virtual

1089
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:51,359
networks which is required attributes to

1090
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:53,399
support a VIP in class and this document

1091
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,930
made it focusing on this segment out in

1092
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:57,420
theta playing mechanisms and the

1093
01:03:54,930 --> 01:04:00,870
possible extensions and it is applicable

1094
01:03:57,420 --> 01:04:02,970
to both SRV amperes and sr e6 for the

1095
01:04:00,870 --> 01:04:04,830
control plane extensions I think this we

1096
01:04:02,970 --> 01:04:06,750
will be discussing in relevant out

1097
01:04:04,830 --> 01:04:10,799
working groups and with other separate

1098
01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:12,960
documents okay here are some analysis

1099
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:14,790
about the current segment routing using

1100
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:17,340
similarity was designed for the South's

1101
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:19,740
regime and the see the least is used to

1102
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:23,150
specify the nodes and links should be

1103
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:25,950
the traffic rule along the path and the

1104
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:28,290
current status the services will share

1105
01:04:25,950 --> 01:04:30,660
the same group of sees and currently

1106
01:04:28,290 --> 01:04:34,020
they cannot differentiate Rafic using

1107
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,759
the seeds but the question is a second

1108
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:39,710
routing can we create as it's customized

1109
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:41,640
the virtual networks but the second

1110
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,740
question is setting the routing

1111
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,330
currently it does now to take the

1112
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:48,149
resource reservation into the

1113
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:50,100
consideration so that this is just a

1114
01:04:48,150 --> 01:04:51,350
steal of traffic along the past it's a

1115
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,930
link level

1116
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:57,029
granularity traffic steering and the

1117
01:04:53,930 --> 01:05:00,060
basically it can rely on the tips of us

1118
01:04:57,030 --> 01:05:02,160
for the traffic differentiation it may

1119
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:06,029
be good enough for some existing

1120
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,190
services but always think there are gaps

1121
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:11,460
and the challenges for them services

1122
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:13,380
like the 5g critical applications so

1123
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:15,300
that the other question is how can we

1124
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:20,190
achieve the guaranteed are more

1125
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:22,260
predictable SLA with similarity okay

1126
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:24,930
here is the proposal in this draft

1127
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,640
basically we introduced the topology and

1128
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:27,759
resource information into the same

1129
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,490
semantics

1130
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,280
we can use the seeds to identify the

1131
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:35,709
topology and the data playing so we can

1132
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,200
use differences to identify the same

1133
01:05:35,710 --> 01:05:41,080
node a link in the different network

1134
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:43,990
topologies au notation we can also use

1135
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:45,790
the C's to represent a subset of natural

1136
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:49,240
resource allocated to a particular

1137
01:05:45,790 --> 01:05:51,400
virtual network or network slice we see

1138
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,339
this is an abstraction of the different

1139
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:56,380
mechanisms in the end early to provide

1140
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:58,720
you to guarantee the resource isolation

1141
01:05:56,380 --> 01:06:00,369
and it'll guarantee the performance so

1142
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:02,859
this is a good abstraction of different

1143
01:06:00,369 --> 01:06:05,350
mechanisms in underlay and with this

1144
01:06:02,859 --> 01:06:07,299
mechanism we can use these different

1145
01:06:05,350 --> 01:06:09,310
guru prophecies to create a different

1146
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:12,970
network slices or virtual networks and

1147
01:06:09,310 --> 01:06:15,359
which lists in different virtual

1148
01:06:12,970 --> 01:06:18,480
networks the traffic will go through the

1149
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:21,279
isolated topology with isolated resource

1150
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:24,160
so that we can keep other so traffic in

1151
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:28,119
different slices separated and not

1152
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,549
interfere each other okay here is a

1153
01:06:28,119 --> 01:06:33,430
similar mechanism for SR v6 I think

1154
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:35,580
every six we need to use different two

1155
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:40,149
locators to identify the different

1156
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:42,970
network topologies and on the same node

1157
01:06:40,150 --> 01:06:45,130
or links and the C's I thought we

1158
01:06:42,970 --> 01:06:47,169
succeed basically to be inherits the

1159
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:50,290
topology identification from the locator

1160
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:52,540
and in addition we can also add this

1161
01:06:50,290 --> 01:06:55,600
resource semantics to the locator and

1162
01:06:52,540 --> 01:07:00,670
C's to represent the subset of resource

1163
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:04,150
in the an array here are the updates

1164
01:07:00,670 --> 01:07:07,030
since last presentation ITF we had new

1165
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:10,030
closers and updated affiliations of some

1166
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:13,570
authors we also add the references to

1167
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:15,420
the narrow slicing definition 3gpp and

1168
01:07:13,570 --> 01:07:18,340
also doing the beeping plus framework

1169
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:20,830
and this one we also clarify that the

1170
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:23,530
C's can identify the topology and may

1171
01:07:20,830 --> 01:07:25,569
represent the Associated resource so

1172
01:07:23,530 --> 01:07:28,270
that we provide a unified a diplomat

1173
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:31,630
nism for both soft and as hard isolation

1174
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:34,390
they also resolve the receivers review

1175
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:36,780
comments and there are some editorial

1176
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:40,410
changes to make it more readable and

1177
01:07:36,780 --> 01:07:43,619
updates to the reference

1178
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:45,629
okay for the next steps I think we

1179
01:07:43,619 --> 01:07:47,970
received some further comments which are

1180
01:07:45,630 --> 01:07:50,880
we can solve them in the next version

1181
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:53,640
and we think the framework has been

1182
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:56,339
adopted in TS and it's gets more true a

1183
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:59,609
towards the working group last call and

1184
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:03,119
so for this document we already work on

1185
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:05,640
this since early 2018 and the contents

1186
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,740
of this draft is also getting stable we

1187
01:08:05,640 --> 01:08:09,660
already see many interest from operators

1188
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:12,899
to have a signal routing based natural

1189
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:15,000
slicing solution so we have raised this

1190
01:08:12,900 --> 01:08:17,580
working group adoption request to the

1191
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,839
mini list and would like to hear the

1192
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:27,839
opinions from the wing group okay so was

1193
01:08:21,839 --> 01:08:33,059
right the draft 1520 who believe it's a

1194
01:08:27,839 --> 01:08:34,948
good start for working document notice

1195
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:38,549
aim we believe it's not a good start for

1196
01:08:34,948 --> 01:08:44,818
working with document one person to

1197
01:08:38,549 --> 01:08:50,100
person okay so we there has been a new

1198
01:08:44,819 --> 01:08:53,699
design team in India rated to network

1199
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:56,310
sizing so I think it would be good to

1200
01:08:53,698 --> 01:09:00,149
wait a bit on the outcome of the design

1201
01:08:56,310 --> 01:09:03,469
team because I expect these two engine

1202
01:09:00,149 --> 01:09:06,899
or defines the network slicing subject

1203
01:09:03,469 --> 01:09:15,779
and then we can work on what spring as

1204
01:09:06,899 --> 01:09:19,408
or does not have to oxidize things can

1205
01:09:15,779 --> 01:09:21,600
be relatively hot from the work in the

1206
01:09:19,408 --> 01:09:23,580
design team because we already have the

1207
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,949
framework of the vaping past in the

1208
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:28,229
teeth and we think this is a solution

1209
01:09:25,948 --> 01:09:31,198
for the iam class and one of the use

1210
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:34,259
case is natural slicing so this is based

1211
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:38,790
on this current current status maybe we

1212
01:09:34,259 --> 01:09:41,130
can no need to rely on this progressing

1213
01:09:38,790 --> 01:09:44,120
the design team I also am at first and

1214
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:47,580
yes also some comments on the draft

1215
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:49,890
starting with an Emma

1216
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:52,890
so crew sees a bit of marketing its

1217
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:56,760
could be useful to know what is added so

1218
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:58,650
my guess is a network partitioning VPN

1219
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,170
against is not really the scope of the

1220
01:09:58,650 --> 01:10:02,330
working group and I not sure it worked

1221
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:06,300
is about VPNs

1222
01:10:02,330 --> 01:10:08,790
so maybe the introduction on the title

1223
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:11,880
and also best fit

1224
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:14,070
so there are different terms used and

1225
01:10:11,880 --> 01:10:18,780
the shoulder means the same single notes

1226
01:10:14,070 --> 01:10:21,240
such as network slicing VPN yes will

1227
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,860
network as a consequence it's not very

1228
01:10:21,240 --> 01:10:26,840
clear for example it's not very clear if

1229
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:32,880
you're asking for VPN States in the core

1230
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:35,010
no VP stays yes but you clear yeah we

1231
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,040
can clarify this in the framework the VP

1232
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:39,960
plus is the term framework is an

1233
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:42,090
integration of their overlay VPN Daniel

1234
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:44,850
a network so we call the waiting pass

1235
01:10:42,090 --> 01:10:49,530
but it is not either overlay on and

1236
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:53,310
expose and don't do you think it could

1237
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:56,009
be a better phrase that's a way to

1238
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:58,410
partition network resources in spring or

1239
01:10:56,010 --> 01:11:05,850
signaling networks to avoid the term VPN

1240
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:08,760
on our we will consider thank you so as

1241
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:11,250
a member of design team it's not the

1242
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,210
intention to define technology as such

1243
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:16,370
the focus is northbound API and

1244
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:19,320
programmatic interface between

1245
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:21,330
higher-level business logic and

1246
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:25,049
underlying controller catherine de

1247
01:11:21,330 --> 01:11:27,090
tomate associate with it so we are not

1248
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:29,760
going to work on this specifically and

1249
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:31,350
since certainly there is do we are

1250
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,810
trying to align on meaning of

1251
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:36,960
transporter networks lives would be

1252
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:40,370
actually good to kind of Express same

1253
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,510
meaning when we use same words and

1254
01:11:40,370 --> 01:11:45,390
please think about it you're part of

1255
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:47,790
design team as well so we we work

1256
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:50,190
together right nothing right right yeah

1257
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:52,800
I would also contribute to the design

1258
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:55,110
team we think this work and also if what

1259
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,989
is outside the scope of the design team

1260
01:11:55,110 --> 01:12:03,089
we can work on date in some ways

1261
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:05,730
house phone teen farmer trainer mobile

1262
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:07,679
now fabric you my family is about to

1263
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:09,989
into the commercial yesterday tree in

1264
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:12,480
China Mobile we have ratified the many

1265
01:12:09,989 --> 01:12:15,809
other case also Network us lysine

1266
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:18,209
satirize last month great the idea with

1267
01:12:15,810 --> 01:12:20,820
your video are into the mobile no

1268
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:23,940
surgery and so on kudus record cooler

1269
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:26,849
with I was helping you achieve that they

1270
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:29,280
are many niggas always asking you for

1271
01:12:26,850 --> 01:12:31,530
network us try seeing these nice draft

1272
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:34,259
provides the eye surface the teat

1273
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:38,489
applying I think a third day the good

1274
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:50,219
idea Thank You Elka designer Adrian are

1275
01:12:38,489 --> 01:12:54,389
you part of the nine or hi I'm Afra

1276
01:12:50,219 --> 01:12:59,400
Maliki I agree with Jeff I'm a member of

1277
01:12:54,390 --> 01:13:02,420
the SLS Dillon team this is out of the

1278
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:06,210
scope of the design team and we have on

1279
01:13:02,420 --> 01:13:11,100
neurotechnology about I saw later we

1280
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:13,409
will do the prairies come here with yes

1281
01:13:11,100 --> 01:13:16,860
I have a three announced the requestors

1282
01:13:13,409 --> 01:13:21,420
the first is compared with your activity

1283
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:25,320
our jobs as soon as the air is no more

1284
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:29,340
new technology I don't know what she

1285
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:34,199
young meaning of this disrupt as a

1286
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:37,469
standard structure and it's a second

1287
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:42,449
question is for ITP extensions I think

1288
01:13:37,469 --> 01:13:48,659
this is opening questions and it is also

1289
01:13:42,449 --> 01:13:53,370
to your child has some references with

1290
01:13:48,659 --> 01:13:57,299
your in a video control a draft but I

1291
01:13:53,370 --> 01:14:01,010
think in his opening questions we should

1292
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:05,760
to further discussing and we also have

1293
01:14:01,010 --> 01:14:11,340
potential for control a shaft so I am

1294
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:14,070
now think it is the second question is

1295
01:14:11,340 --> 01:14:17,760
Celeste resources we first introduced

1296
01:14:14,070 --> 01:14:24,540
society forceless resource management

1297
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:27,300
and our solution can differ in state for

1298
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:32,310
example I'll true link and I was three

1299
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:35,099
phase you know draft how to compute

1300
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:39,230
asabi or as a cheap-ass according to

1301
01:14:35,099 --> 01:14:42,780
society comp and with count with other

1302
01:14:39,230 --> 01:14:45,980
criterias I think this is not very clear

1303
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:51,750
in your chest and the our draft we have

1304
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:57,119
described it maybe you could reply on

1305
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:59,400
the list just I want to maybe emphasize

1306
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:01,500
that this is a draft about as Sigma out

1307
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:04,320
in theta playing the controlling belongs

1308
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:06,510
to other separate documents this is we

1309
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:08,519
want to show the extension to the

1310
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:11,520
semantics of the see we got previously

1311
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:14,040
is just to identify no darlink we give

1312
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:16,469
the finer granularity of this resources

1313
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:18,960
on the link and or the virtual topology

1314
01:15:16,469 --> 01:15:24,599
on the node so this is the extension to

1315
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:25,670
the data plane bought your corporate

1316
01:15:24,599 --> 01:15:28,520
raft

1317
01:15:25,670 --> 01:15:30,869
can we move that to the list please

1318
01:15:28,520 --> 01:15:33,090
okay could you send your comment to the

1319
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:36,179
recipes but I agree we need a better

1320
01:15:33,090 --> 01:15:40,290
structure of a document in ability to

1321
01:15:36,179 --> 01:15:47,340
network slicing Robin I think has been

1322
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:49,619
captain cragen from Cisco Systems so I'm

1323
01:15:47,340 --> 01:15:53,340
also part of the network size design

1324
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:55,290
team in T's and one watching scope is

1325
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,840
the requirements as well as the

1326
01:15:55,290 --> 01:15:59,519
framework for network slicing so we need

1327
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,590
to make some progress and I think G is

1328
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,630
also part of the networks like the same

1329
01:16:01,590 --> 01:16:06,330
design team as well so G knows very well

1330
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:09,030
that we need to make progress on the

1331
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:11,489
requirements as well as the framework so

1332
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:12,960
I think we we agree agree with Bruno

1333
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:17,119
that let's wait a little bit more to

1334
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:17,119
solidify the those aspects

1335
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:25,139
well most easy T the

1336
01:16:21,900 --> 01:16:29,129
paradigm of network slicing includes

1337
01:16:25,140 --> 01:16:31,409
several models for resource sharing my

1338
01:16:29,130 --> 01:16:35,340
understanding that VPN pass concentrates

1339
01:16:31,409 --> 01:16:41,489
only on a subset of this use cases and

1340
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:45,000
includes the isolated resources so there

1341
01:16:41,489 --> 01:16:47,489
are another set of use cases where

1342
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:52,070
resources are shared so I would

1343
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:58,250
encourage to work on the model that

1344
01:16:52,070 --> 01:17:03,900
includes all use cases not just one

1345
01:16:58,250 --> 01:17:06,960
address in VPN plus yeah I think here we

1346
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:09,719
have a one clarification that this data

1347
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:11,370
plan can provide either soft or hard

1348
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:15,239
isolation which means the resource can

1349
01:17:11,370 --> 01:17:17,849
be either shared or isolated but we can

1350
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:20,250
use an unified data plane by the control

1351
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:25,710
plane information would be different for

1352
01:17:20,250 --> 01:17:29,630
different requirement well again it's

1353
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:33,199
it's not that simple and III think that

1354
01:17:29,630 --> 01:17:35,929
resources are of different flavors so

1355
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:38,519
we're not only talking about

1356
01:17:35,929 --> 01:17:41,969
connectivity resources there are other

1357
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:45,560
resources and we need a way to express

1358
01:17:41,969 --> 01:17:51,290
them especially if you want to have

1359
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:54,570
combined our hard and soft isolation

1360
01:17:51,290 --> 01:18:00,719
discussed more yeah that's right nice

1361
01:17:54,570 --> 01:18:02,370
didn't Curtis I know we're late Zafar so

1362
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:03,929
we need to discuss on the list between

1363
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:07,710
definitely need to sync with this

1364
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:10,140
working group on you need to refine the

1365
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:12,570
scope of your draft on make the title

1366
01:18:10,140 --> 01:18:15,330
abstractor introduction in line with the

1367
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:17,250
scope so if it's about the piano maybe

1368
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:17,940
it's not for spring if it's not about

1369
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:21,929
the piano

1370
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:23,759
maybe refrigerator partitioning network

1371
01:18:21,929 --> 01:18:27,890
resources I have some other commands but

1372
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,890
I'll Alice a little thank you

1373
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:43,110
Thank You Luna okay we all battle a bit

1374
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:45,200
late so if she can gain some diamonds

1375
01:18:43,110 --> 01:18:48,690
would be even better

1376
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:50,120
excellent sanction okay try to do it in

1377
01:18:48,690 --> 01:18:53,580
five minutes

1378
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:56,670
so the objective of this draft is to

1379
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:59,640
outline a start by outlining the

1380
01:18:56,670 --> 01:19:04,080
building block for slicing that already

1381
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:06,210
exists in SR Network and then see the

1382
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:11,250
gaps and how we can address those gaps

1383
01:19:06,210 --> 01:19:14,630
so it's not this elaborate what are the

1384
01:19:11,250 --> 01:19:18,260
building blocks and how we can use it

1385
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:22,830
for network slicing so here's the list

1386
01:19:18,260 --> 01:19:23,580
initial list so we have support for SR

1387
01:19:22,830 --> 01:19:26,400
policies

1388
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:28,790
vigor without flex I'll go then we have

1389
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:33,410
notion of flux I'll go now first I see

1390
01:19:28,790 --> 01:19:37,920
we also have notion of doing TLS a

1391
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:39,809
within a slice under less slice we have

1392
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:42,080
notion of carrying various sleeping

1393
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:46,040
services that is also provides

1394
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:49,230
separation among the customers and then

1395
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:51,260
support for service programming onn p.m.

1396
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:54,389
and the QoS

1397
01:19:51,260 --> 01:19:56,060
aspects and orchestration so these are

1398
01:19:54,390 --> 01:20:00,690
some of the building block up I have

1399
01:19:56,060 --> 01:20:02,910
shorten time so go fast so let's think

1400
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:06,629
of as a policy first so as our policy is

1401
01:20:02,910 --> 01:20:10,980
a way that we can take a common network

1402
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:15,570
and can steer traffic that would satisfy

1403
01:20:10,980 --> 01:20:19,620
a certain requirement for example low

1404
01:20:15,570 --> 01:20:22,469
latency or disjointness we have ability

1405
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:26,180
to do path calculation for different

1406
01:20:22,470 --> 01:20:29,790
optimization criteria and ability to

1407
01:20:26,180 --> 01:20:31,070
isolate certain type of path from the

1408
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:34,610
other

1409
01:20:31,070 --> 01:20:36,889
we have support for the ODN and support

1410
01:20:34,610 --> 01:20:40,210
for automatic steering into the SL

1411
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:43,160
policy and SR policies can spend

1412
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:45,730
multiple domains and this is something

1413
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:50,240
which has been widely deployed in

1414
01:20:45,730 --> 01:20:54,129
segment outing Network then we have

1415
01:20:50,240 --> 01:20:58,940
notion of flexible algorithms which

1416
01:20:54,130 --> 01:21:03,590
associate intent to a prefix it and it

1417
01:20:58,940 --> 01:21:07,099
allows IDP to compute path constraint

1418
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:11,150
part based on the intent so let's say

1419
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:14,840
low latency flex Algol hooligans is

1420
01:21:11,150 --> 01:21:22,610
right and then IDP is able to run csdf

1421
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:28,360
to satisfy the intent in in in and it is

1422
01:21:22,610 --> 01:21:31,630
a way to create provision networks price

1423
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:36,740
with different intent then we have

1424
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:40,360
notion of LFA and micro avoidance but

1425
01:21:36,740 --> 01:21:43,910
the beauty here is that when we do TL FA

1426
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:45,710
for flexible I'll go the backup part

1427
01:21:43,910 --> 01:21:48,710
only uses the resources that belongs

1428
01:21:45,710 --> 01:21:54,890
with there you go so primary and backup

1429
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:58,550
both uses individual slice of the

1430
01:21:54,890 --> 01:22:01,370
network then we have believed to carry

1431
01:21:58,550 --> 01:22:06,740
very different type of SR VPN services

1432
01:22:01,370 --> 01:22:10,370
like l3 VPN we PWS VPLS and even TN

1433
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:13,400
services that provide various level of

1434
01:22:10,370 --> 01:22:14,870
separation of services from a customer

1435
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:19,009
point of view or different customers can

1436
01:22:14,870 --> 01:22:21,830
can have different different type of

1437
01:22:19,010 --> 01:22:24,800
service differentiation or service

1438
01:22:21,830 --> 01:22:27,769
isolation within the within the from a

1439
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:31,070
common underlay notion of service

1440
01:22:27,770 --> 01:22:34,010
programming allows customers to do

1441
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:37,580
traffic engineering or in ten days

1442
01:22:34,010 --> 01:22:41,780
routing not only through topological

1443
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:43,949
segments but also through programmable

1444
01:22:41,780 --> 01:22:48,150
service programming like network

1445
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:51,089
appliances and support for the NF ease

1446
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:54,330
and service function chaining along with

1447
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:59,600
topological segments bound to a specific

1448
01:22:54,330 --> 01:23:02,340
slice yes actually you existed you're

1449
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,900
out but I think your first slide was

1450
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:06,179
very interesting yeah it's a good

1451
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:11,820
summary of all the tools we have in

1452
01:23:06,179 --> 01:23:14,520
spring to fulfill some requirement from

1453
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:17,549
Network slicing maybe one thing which is

1454
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:21,179
missing is what is missing actually in

1455
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:23,070
spring - what is missing what tool is

1456
01:23:21,179 --> 01:23:25,500
missing in spec or what tools are

1457
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:29,610
missing in spring to fulfill the

1458
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:31,590
requirements so again we may need to to

1459
01:23:29,610 --> 01:23:33,870
wait for all the feedback from his

1460
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:37,800
design team but I think it's a good

1461
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:40,380
start to see what we are okay thank you

1462
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:42,390
but it's already interested also

1463
01:23:40,380 --> 01:23:47,940
interesting to see what we not we don't

1464
01:23:42,390 --> 01:23:52,580
have one part could be a segregation of

1465
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:55,320
resources within the network and og just

1466
01:23:52,580 --> 01:23:58,380
very similar to previous command it's a

1467
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,630
greater variant routing can do but it's

1468
01:23:58,380 --> 01:24:03,150
neither correct nor complete definition

1469
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:05,460
of what network slice is so yes

1470
01:24:03,150 --> 01:24:07,019
terminology correctly it could be used a

1471
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:09,000
subset of what we are trying to do is

1472
01:24:07,020 --> 01:24:10,949
network slicing but this is not the

1473
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
network sizing and don't call it this

1474
01:24:10,949 --> 01:24:17,250
way it's really wrong so please send

1475

out of the next presentation to say do

1482
01:24:35,190 --> 01:24:39,389
go to the next presentation but okay so

1483
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:41,540
we'll move to the next presentation

1484
01:24:39,390 --> 01:24:47,690
please send the comment on the list

1485
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:49,990
thank you thank you so make

1486

please make it make you sneaky thought

1488
01:25:07,220 --> 01:25:11,450
we were already at two presentation and

1489
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:14,030
Network slices so please summarize that

1490
01:25:11,450 --> 01:25:16,670
on what what is a big difference of your

1491
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:21,009
proposal fully know if you can make it

1492
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:21,010
at four minutes it's it's even better I

1493
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:26,450
read about the an authority from Hanna

1494
01:25:23,930 --> 01:25:28,070
mobile now I will talk about Michael

1495
01:25:26,450 --> 01:25:32,660
Annett Walker Selassie you'll see a

1496
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:35,330
second mini routine the into Internet

1497
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:38,960
workers rights include the design the

1498
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:41,420
pious rated PG include the ranks light

1499
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,090
red cows land and cow slaughter now I

1500
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:46,760
will focus on the red powder Network

1501
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:48,230
catalyze the F I will in a major the

1502
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:52,340
cramming the first of all is that

1503
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:54,919
educator what children works the second

1504
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:58,790
one is the into engines Lyceum the third

1505
01:25:54,920 --> 01:26:02,570
one is unifying the ESI the first and

1506
01:25:58,790 --> 01:26:05,720
the time is the traffic engineering the

1507
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:08,269
last my is last relate to as well as the

1508
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:10,670
last training results of Hattie school

1509
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:13,250
they are also some Disney ID the first

1510
01:26:10,670 --> 01:26:17,090
but they could allowed to meet all of

1511
01:26:13,250 --> 01:26:20,450
the a parameter so I will reduce the new

1512
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:24,140
base to the new the new slice slice

1513
01:26:20,450 --> 01:26:26,360
paste at the first how to administer it

1514
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:31,670
her when he stains the added affirm our

1515
01:26:26,360 --> 01:26:34,190
AI for short is the appreciate the work

1516
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:37,160
your network added fiction it could be

1517
01:26:34,190 --> 01:26:40,429
used as a trade panel and workers lives

1518
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:42,590
I didn't turn it turn indicates that

1519

apology computing and the storage

decoder also identifying the Univ an in

1525
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:09,470

1526
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:13,070
trying to criteria of color template and

1527
01:27:09,470 --> 01:27:16,280
the tan color complains with a I provide

the way opa-locka teacher i so there is

1533
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:39,800
no modification for the corrodium plan

1534

01:27:56,640 --> 01:28:02,250
calculator the past according to the

1541
01:27:59,460 --> 01:28:09,020
color with the AI there the truth the

1542
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:12,180
politic read and write and also a is

1543
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:14,190
could it be a defect are for trade apart

1544
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:18,450
and networks alliance results at the

1545
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:22,049
first the this responsibles

1546
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:24,630
soft and hard and hard a solution for

01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:34,190
nevertheless raining could be kept in

1550
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:37,790
court with the AI information and

1551
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:42,030
recognize them among the addition across

to contain unless readings with the a

1554
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:52,650
are two spouts the te pass computation

1555
01:28:48,060 --> 01:28:54,810
taken account also the aircrack area for

1556
01:28:52,650 --> 01:29:00,320
the line tool in the faceless as a

1557
01:28:54,810 --> 01:29:03,660
nation yet relied to never link of

Orleans repellent police reported link

1559
01:29:03,660 --> 01:29:12,090
could be crapping word with the AI and

1560
01:29:06,980 --> 01:29:13,769
the artisans it the line to memory in

1561
01:29:12,090 --> 01:29:14,400
cook to the P of legacy of life is

1562
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:18,600
eternal

1563
01:29:14,400 --> 01:29:23,129
all his Montano and I know other such as

1564
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:23,760
other other in the face type in the

1565

curriculum

1566
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,670
the routine protocol packet following

1567
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:32,699
the last readings

1568
01:29:29,670 --> 01:29:36,000
select the line tool never link with the

1569
01:29:32,699 --> 01:29:40,160
highest superiority at the same time in

1570
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:42,989
the following in the forwarding applying

1571
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:45,750
the packet repel intruders versus

1572
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:50,780
vehicle what he'll network we're passed

1573
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:56,969
along the line tool and burning with the

1574
01:29:50,780 --> 01:30:00,900
specifically reduce the past computation

1575
01:29:56,969 --> 01:30:04,230
you know a based on the linker stated in

1576
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:07,860
the base we're inside we are in spikes

1577
01:30:04,230 --> 01:30:10,889
that detailed plan to never link also

1578
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:13,320
our last three are teasing tools sexism

1579
01:30:10,890 --> 01:30:17,130
at the park later they are linked and

1580
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:19,380
results excuse me you we won't have time

1581
01:30:17,130 --> 01:30:21,870
to go into the details but basically the

1582
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:24,600
same commands we have to start with the

1583
01:30:21,870 --> 01:30:26,730
result of the cheese working with design

1584
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:29,910
team to see what we have to do in

1585
01:30:26,730 --> 01:30:31,650
general for network slices and then we

1586
01:30:29,910 --> 01:30:49,019
need to focus on what we have on what we

1587
01:30:31,650 --> 01:30:51,179
don't have force premium we may need to

1588
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:54,900
wait for the design team to know what we

1589
01:30:51,179 --> 01:30:57,989
have to do then we can start identify

1590
01:30:54,900 --> 01:31:00,330
what we are in the spring mostly in that

1591
01:30:57,989 --> 01:31:03,290
airplane and what we don't have and then

1592
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:06,359
we can work work on what we don't have

1593
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:06,359
[Music]

1594
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:17,669
producer meeting is on really all the

1595
01:31:15,330 --> 01:31:21,600
time no no you won't be bitch we were

1596
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:23,820
the other time so again most of networks

1597
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:26,730
lies work is to be starting the design

1598
01:31:23,820 --> 01:31:28,559
team please work more and then we can

1599
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:32,690
work and what to dismiss what is missing

1600
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:37,650
in spring okay if you have comments

1601
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:41,400
please send of the list I'm very sorry I

1602
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:42,909
think we are finished I'm very sorry for

1603
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:48,969
the next slide

1604
01:31:42,909 --> 01:31:51,339
less presentation a slicer much improved

1605
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:53,050
there was an audio description in the

1606
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:57,100
new MPs about working group so it has

1607
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:59,080
been presented but the drafts that means

1608
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:01,570
now to be aligned with the slides

1609
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,610
because I don't think they are aligner

1610
01:32:01,570 --> 01:32:06,250
so maybe there is a work to be done on

1611
01:32:03,610 --> 01:32:15,670
the draft following a discussion during

1612
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:19,179
this meeting it's finished so thank you

1613
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:24,120
for your time and see you in in

1614
