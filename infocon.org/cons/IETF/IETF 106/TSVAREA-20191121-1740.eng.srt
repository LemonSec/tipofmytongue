00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,459
the respective documents if you don't

10
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:07,700
know what I'm talking about this is our

11
00:01:04,459 --> 00:01:10,249
agenda today we have a one-hour slot so

12
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:12,469
we have like the usual updates we have

13
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:14,208
already a note-taker that's Martin thank

14
00:01:12,469 --> 00:01:17,719
you I will watch the job a little bit

15
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:20,209
and I think blue sheets are also running

16
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:22,399
so that's great I go through the usual

17
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:24,170
slides what's going on in the area and

18
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:27,409
then we have like a few adjustment

19
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:30,170
points the chairs would like to the 80s

20
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:31,999
would like to talk about then we have

21
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,409
about like 20 to 25 minutes to talk

22
00:01:31,999 --> 00:01:35,389
about what's going on and quick and

23
00:01:33,409 --> 00:01:37,130
what's coming next and then we

24
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:38,420
potentially have an open mic session at

25
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:44,929
the end depending on how much you want

26
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:46,639
to talk about quick so first of all I

27
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:49,459
just realized that I missed up the slide

28
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:53,240
when you can't read half of it but we

29
00:01:49,459 --> 00:01:54,859
would like to think our review team so

30
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,259
that has been working very well for the

31
00:01:54,859 --> 00:02:00,139
last like year or two or something like

32
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:02,829
that we have like three November's that

33
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:05,238
sky-high rolls in sweat and Martin Duke

34
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:07,428

36
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:13,280
and we have one person stepping down

37
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,890
that's Allison I don't think I see her

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,970
yet but she has been on the on the area

39
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,750
Directorate

40
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:22,900
forever she's doing very good reviews

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:26,690
but she said it's time to step down and

42
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:28,610
let the new people do it so thank you

43
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,050
everybody for doing this service thank

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,700

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:36,820

46
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:36,820
good for the documents Thanks

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:43,970
this is the status of the working group

48
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:46,700
I don't think we have to go through

49
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:49,040
everything in detail one announcement is

50
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,780
that in the next months before the

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,929
Vancouver meeting the MP TCP working

52
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,770
group will actually close this time for

53
00:02:53,930 --> 00:03:00,950
real they finish their Charter they

54
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,590
published all the documents and any

55
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:05,480
additional or any future MP TCP work can

56
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,730
like go back to the TCP em working group

57
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:11,959
into maintaining state so that's very

58
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:13,880
good I also want to announce that I have

59
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,459
appointed a new working group chair it

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:23,060
for nfsv4 working group so that's

61
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:32,750
actually accomplished yeah anything else

62
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:37,670
we need to say about I don't think so

63
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:39,350
this okay yes we have a couple of new

64
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,929
documents in the editor cute this looks

65
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:44,900
like as if we didn't do any work there

66
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:46,970
was no new RFC published between now and

67
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,920
in the last meeting but like they are

68
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,780
about to be published the stuff that was

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,850
in the editor took you from last time so

70
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:57,700
there's that like as always steady

71
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:57,700
progress was a couple of of documents

72
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:08,750
okay that's the usual part quick chance

73
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:10,459
for like questions no yeah then I would

74
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,470
like just to take the opportunity to

75
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:16,220
remind everybody that like we also have

76
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:18,320
a code of conduct in the IETF and like I

77
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,530
think especially in the transport area

78
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,990
we have usually a very good atmosphere I

79
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:25,760
really enjoy working with you guys but

80
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,970
like we also have some media discussions

81
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,860
sometimes and and we all have to remind

82
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:33,560
ourselves from time to time that like we

83
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,270
reshape this community we can influence

84
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:37,700
like in this community how we want to

85
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,530
work here and we can be active about it

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,510
we can like figure out how we want to

87
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:44,270
behave ourself but we can also talk to

88
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,800
others about it and when we all can do

89
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,810
something to make this a nicer and

90
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,860
better community that we like to work in

91
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,860
and that's really important

92
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,450
Magnus and I also talked quite a bit

93
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:05,030
about sharing in the transport area area

94
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:06,260
so for the last at least two years we

95
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,320
actually didn't get any new working

96
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,180
groups the situation was very stable but

97
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,849
that also meant that we couldn't like

98
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,479
get any new people in to share positions

99
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:19,909
to get experience about sharing and this

100
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:21,440
is usually a really good opportunity to

101
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:23,870
train up new people who also might

102
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,200
become 80 at some point and but we

103
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:29,510
didn't have this opportunity so we also

104
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:32,690
sought about maybe you know rotating

105
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:34,610
chairs a little bit I was thinking was

106
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,740
actually that the cup of coops we have

107
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,990
that like two long lasting maintenance

108
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,550
work that's the groups where you can

109
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,820
actually exchange chairs from time to

110
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,099
time

111
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,530
and work in like kind of train up new

112
00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:47,810
chairs while like small very focused

113
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:51,890
groups you might want to have more

114
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:53,780
continuous tea but we also you know we

115
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,430
also to make any kind of decisions we

116
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:57,919
try to talk to the chairs of course we

117
00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,080
try to talk to the community but like

118
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,580
also if there's any feedback or any

119
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,919
conflicts or problems we should know

120
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,469
about you really need to talk to us and

121
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,969
provide input to this and of course you

122
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:10,159
can also raise your hand if you would be

123
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,770
interested in sharing and be more

124
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:15,050
involved in that so we try to like have

125
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,240
an eye on that we try to manage the

126
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,979
things as good as possible and we will

127
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,580
see if there's some movement in the in

128
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:21,580
the next month

129
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:47,500
we can't utilize it so but this light is

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:50,289
also up not only to request feedback and

131
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,970
to inform you about it but also to ask

132
00:06:50,289 --> 00:06:53,500
you about what your opinions is about

133
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:54,910
what should we do like how often should

134
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,650
we exchange chairs when should we

135
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,780
exchange or certain tribute to it at all

136
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:00,370
like if you have any thoughts you have a

137
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:09,900
chance to speak up now if you would like

138
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:09,900
to okay you're all happy

139
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:21,969
Spencer Dawkins one of the one of the

140
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:24,030
things that I wish I had done

141
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:28,479
differently is transport Area Director

142
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:31,210
was explicitly asking for key lives from

143
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,300
people in positions that are serving the

144
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,780
community because we recognize that

145
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:40,570
there are other people who could serve

146
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:44,619
but people don't don't want to let the

147
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,810
community down by saying you know I'm

148
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:48,430
not gonna do this anymore

149
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,560
but just it you know it might be it

150
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,470
might be helpful to just ask people from

151
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,479
you know periodically are you willing to

152
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:57,039
continue in this role you know are is

153
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:00,370
continuing this role the right thing for

154
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,020
you because other people could do it and

155
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:06,370
that might be that might be easier than

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:10,120
asking off all the working group chairs

157
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,740
want to be rotated yes I mean that's

158
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,360
what we're trying to do we're not like

159
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:18,070
firing anybody straight we're trying to

160
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,409
talk to the chest no we don't did it on

161
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:26,110
a very frequent basis and but maybe

162
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:28,599
that's something to change Ellen

163
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,140
Jennings xad

164
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:33,578
very very long xad with Magnus I just I

165
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,409
think this is awesome to this I think

166
00:08:33,578 --> 00:08:37,779
ITF as a whole should get more to the

167
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,909
policy of we replaced chairs because

168
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:41,799
we're growing new people who are good

169
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:45,160
not because we were getting rid of old

170
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:47,319
people who were bad and that would make

171
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,439
a much more positive thing and would

172
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,400
have to be done systematically across

173
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,100
areas and

174
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,110
I mean many areas I won't mention this

175
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,270
one in particular have had less than the

176
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:59,589
number of ADEs possibility that we want

177
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,660
at various times and we need to grow

178
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:05,320
those people and we get them from the

179
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:07,779
chairs so we should get you know yes I

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,040
mean no Ronnie how long have you chaired

181
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:11,560
some of your working groups like forever

182
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,120
and you've done an awesome job but but

183
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,500
could we have trained more new people

184
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,080
and had a better pool of people that

185
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:18,250
would be a great thing

186
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,930
thank you this hope we can actually up

187
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,660
on the is you on Sunday and it will

188
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,550
reflect it back so transport we're

189
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:28,300
actually quite small area and we don't

190
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,880
have that many positions but that's also

191
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:34,510
a good remark for the general

192
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,460
consideration yep okay and then we also

193
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:38,500
we thought we talked the opportunity to

194
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,240
tell you a little bit about the ports

195
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:43,900
registry because it's also in the

196
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,100
responsibility of the transport area or

197
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,529
the transferred area directors actually

198
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,720
so first of all we would like to take

199
00:09:47,529 --> 00:09:51,880
the opportunity as well to say a big

200
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,380
thanks to those people as well because

201
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,360
they do have a constant load we have

202
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,189
like we get requests like every week and

203
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
there and they review them and they have

204
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:00,520
to look up documents and they go for

205
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,020
some back with the requesters so there

206
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:07,029
is actually a significant load here

207
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:09,100
thank you very much to these people but

208
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:10,480
then we've been also trying to be in

209
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,220
touch with them and figuring out how to

210
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,260
make the process more smooth or like

211
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,240
figuring out where the problems are so

212
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:17,890
we've been discussing about potentially

213
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
also updating some of the guidance

214
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,490
documents we have around import

215
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,190
registries because we see for example

216
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:26,650
very often that we get requests that are

217
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:29,500
only for a closed domain and not for the

218
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,970
internet as a whole but also it's not

219
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,260
clear you know it's not defined

220
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:34,330
somewhere what's the what's the closed

221
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:36,730
domain or this is actually not spared I

222
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:38,080
was out explicitly we get a lot of

223
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,700
requests where people actually don't

224
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,740
need a fixed port they could use some

225
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:45,010
kind of discovery mechanism or some kind

226
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,270
of dynamic port range and so we would

227
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:49,060
like to provide more guidance about

228
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,980
these kind of things there potentially

229
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:54,219
might be a new document coming up so

230
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,690
just to make it work and to like get the

231
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,600
point a little bit closer to you we also

232
00:10:55,690 --> 00:11:00,459
have some numbers so that's the numbers

233
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,240
of requests we got for the last two

234
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:05,250
years and as you can see it's a total of

235
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,680
about

236
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,800
hundred I think if I don't miss the math

237
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:13,140
completely up so about hundred requests

238
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,189
and about that of them gets assigned but

239
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,280
of course all of them have to be

240
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:19,080
reviewed of course they're like they are

241
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,459
not equally spread out over the year but

242
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,350
as you can see they're actually like

243
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:32,220
whicker's kind of on a weekly basis

244
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:36,380
basically one of the things we've

245
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:40,140
observed in other registries is that

246
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:44,580
telling people no just means that they

247
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:46,260
use the code points anyway why is there

248
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,420
such a high proportion of these that are

249
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,100
rejected so actually this is another

250
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:51,719
thing I would like to thank the experts

251
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,540
for because they not only say no they do

252
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,990
a lot of like protocol Design Consultant

253
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,849
there a lot of because it's just like

254
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,290
very random protocol requests we get

255
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,150
right everybody thinks they need a port

256
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:05,849
for they did a tiny protocol they use

257
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:09,360
between their two computers one of the

258
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:11,580
lessons we've learned is that if you if

259
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,220
you put the experts in a position of

260
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:17,010
defender of the product that the the

261
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:19,290
internet architectural purity or what

262
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,470
have you you know with this situation

263
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,790
right here and that looks good because

264
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,710
it means that you're only getting the

265
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,569
protocols that you think of a legitimate

266
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,940
from what some definition of legitimate

267
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:31,890
I mean we were trusting the judgment of

268
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,570
those people on that to a large extent

269
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,270
but what we're also doing is driving

270
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:39,570
people into patterns of use that may be

271
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:46,319
destructive which is in several

272
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:49,290
instances of camping this week we have a

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,820
lot of cases where some of the mechanism

274
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,890
that has been developed in the ITF to

275
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,300
actually discover ports could easily be

276
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,550
used and people don't know about it so

277
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,990
giving them a hint about it right that's

278
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,599
like that's what the experts are very

279
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:03,630
often do it's very useful that's the

280
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,950
answer I was looking for thank you I was

281
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,660
going to say exactly what Mira says a

282
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,040
lot of this is diverting people to other

283
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:10,260
specs that means they don't actually

284
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,640
need to reports they maybe only need one

285
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,850
or maybe they don't need anything just

286
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,100
need a discovery mechanism

287
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,449
and it's a sparse space I mean it's not

288
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:21,259
like it's not like it's filling up

289
00:13:17,449 --> 00:13:26,569
tomorrow but it's a limited space it's

290
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:30,110
not like an infinite space here Magnus

291
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:34,069
you want to add something no but at the

292
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:37,100
same time I have these requests rate etc

293
00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:39,259
I think we still we have we are nowhere

294
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,269
near of filling with the current request

295
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:45,649
rate with no world near of filling the

296
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:50,660
available space in the next 50 years but

297
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:52,040
it is so limited but not that fast and I

298
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,800
think it's something that could be

299
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:57,980
discussed or saying the if we open up

300
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,479
the definition we could actually have

301
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:01,519
the discussion a community of how we

302
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:03,949
want to see certain but certain port

303
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,449
requests I think for multi if for

304
00:14:03,949 --> 00:14:12,258
example this about multi-vendor

305
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:16,130
large but how in some sense not open

306
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:20,269
Internet usages etc for example so mark

307
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:22,130
oh you can see me I'm I guess Marc Namie

308
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,329
I'm just a question clarification I may

309
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,449
have missed it if I did I apologize

310
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,399
is this requests or is this port numbers

311
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:30,800
these numbers were seeing here it's

312
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:39,920
requests requests so it may be more

313
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:42,680
important numbers thank you to reinforce

314
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,060
something in the fact that we're looking

315
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,569
at 50 years of runway is due in part to

316
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:53,660
this process imposing a reasonable bar

317
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:56,209
on request so that so that the available

318
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,219
port resources will stretch out that far

319
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:59,630
in the future and this for first-come

320
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:06,949
first-serve will be running out of ports

321
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:09,740
now Jana and go to Mark's question it's

322
00:15:06,949 --> 00:15:12,800
it's unusual but we do receive requests

323
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:16,279
that look like updates to existing ports

324
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:22,579
so that's so is it's it's not more it's

325
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:24,589
fewer put so but part of kind of maybe

326
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:26,000
updating some of the recommendations we

327
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,470
have is that this definition about

328
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
what's you know what's internet wide and

329
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:29,329
window

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,349
you need a port and we're not it's not

331
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,810
very clear so that's definitely

332
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:34,730
something that like the port team is

333
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:40,849
discussing about and we want to have

334
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:44,360
more clarity on okay I think that's it

335
00:15:40,850 --> 00:16:15,709
from like my part and we switch over to

336
00:15:44,360 --> 00:16:17,449
mark but which one no that's oh yeah

337
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:24,050
sure does it work okay

338
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:25,339
oh that's that's comforting so hi my

339
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,130
name is Mark Nottingham I'm one of the

340
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:31,930
chairs of quick are we still doing that

341
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:34,399
I thought we were over that okay

342
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,199
I'm not a transport person but I do play

343
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,240
one on TV

344
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,000
Laura's couldn't be here so I'm taking

345
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,240
his place

346
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,380
so status of the work overall we have

347
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,899
two of the documents in what we call the

348
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,430
late stage process so the working group

349
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:50,690
is agreed to effectively raise the bar

350
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:52,160
for new issues so that we can

351
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,740
concentrate our efforts on those

352
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,390
documents the other two major documents

353
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,589
recovery an HTP are about to join it

354
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,040
those documents in the light stage

355
00:16:57,589 --> 00:17:04,130
process and we're seeing the inter up

356
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,760
steadily improving over time the plan

357
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:09,230
moving forward is is that we are hoping

358
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,490
we can do a working group last call on

359
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:12,500
these documents around the end of the

360
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:15,199
year that may be a little ambitious but

361
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:17,780
that's that's a target right now and the

362
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,100
idea being that that that may not be the

363
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,959
last working group last call these

364
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:23,719
documents and I know that's problematic

365
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,020
for some but we want to send a clear

366
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,429
signal to the rest of the community that

367
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,500
we think that these documents are in

368
00:17:28,429 --> 00:17:31,669
good shape for review let's get the

369
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:33,080
review from the various folks we're

370
00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:34,700
going to use them and operate them and

371
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,620
deploy them and implement them to make

372
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,900
sure we've got it right and in the

373
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,699
meantime we went to after we say issue

374
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:43,190
that working group last call

375
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:45,530
take a period of time where we pause we

376
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:47,690
don't do a lot of active development on

377
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,940
the the issues around the the documents

378
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:51,380
but we try and edit orally improve them

379
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,360
but especially get implementation

380
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:56,090
deployment experience the working group

381
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,770
really wants to see this protocol get

382
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:59,120
some deployment experience in its

383
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,139
current form in its specified form

384
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:05,479
before we ship the RFC's and so we want

385
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,890
to take a pause and probably not send it

386
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,500
to the isg until something like the

387
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,750
middle of 2020 so this is the current

388
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:13,970
plan for the documents of course all

389
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:20,060
plans can change so we'll see how it

390
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:21,680
goes and so this brings up you know the

391
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,030
notion that the there's a lot of quick

392
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,610
related work that people have questions

393
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,350
about and we've identified a number of

394
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:30,110
different kinds of things that have come

395
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:32,510
up new versions of quick extensions to

396
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,370
quick to core quick applications that

397
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:36,890
use quick other than HTTP of course and

398
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,949
other random things that have popped up

399
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:42,590
and so Lars and I've been set up a wiki

400
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:45,440
page to track these things on our wiki

401
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,240
on github so we can have a one place

402
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,240
where you can see all the quick related

403
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,350
things that might happen one day

404
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,790
this is not an official you know

405
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:54,740
commitment to do any of these things

406
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:56,330
it's just a place to track the status

407
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:59,740
and so I want to go through these things

408
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:03,889
really quickly that was not intentional

409
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:06,160
so first of all versions one of the

410
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:08,870
interesting things about quic is is that

411
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,760
the working group sees versioning as a

412
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:12,620
core mechanism that there's an

413
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,879
expectation amongst many people that we

414
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,370
will have another version of quick

415
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,930
sometime fairly soon and that we want to

416
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:20,090
be able to exercise versioning and quick

417
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,820
so that that extension point does not

418
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:25,189
suffice and so there's a certain amount

419
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:28,580
of desire for this but we're not quite

420
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:31,220
sure what quick version to will do if

421
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:32,990
quick version to happen soon it would

422
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,640
presumably happen in the quick working

423
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,280
group but of course we'd need to reach

424
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,280
harder to do that so that that's kind of

425
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:43,610
versioning next up oh that's smaller

426
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:46,610
type sorry extensions too quick so these

427
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:48,770
are generic extensions to quick they're

428
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:50,389
not specific to any one application but

429
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,490
they're extending the capability of

430
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:54,470
quick or doing new things and there's

431
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:57,529
there's lots of in

432
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:59,120
in this as well we do have some capacity

433
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,769
opening up to discuss these things in

434
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,850
the working group because as I said

435
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:04,490
we're gonna take a pause for a little

436
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:06,080
while and so right now just in this

437
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,330
meeting we started talking about three

438
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,399
drafts a quick load balancers quick

439
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:14,120
version negotiation and quick datagrams

440
00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:16,250
and and we're probably going to put out

441
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,258
a call for adoption on at least some of

442
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,309
those very soon I think we need some

443
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,450
revised drafts and some other

444
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,428
discussions but that's the plan for

445
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,230
those there are some other things that

446
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,580
people have talked about so for example

447
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,500
the lost bits draft we discussed a

448
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,789
little bit this week and the multipath

449
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,350
which is in our Charter but we don't

450
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,509
have a we have a proposal but we haven't

451
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,309
discussed it much yet and there's zero

452
00:20:32,509 --> 00:20:36,860
RTT bdp stuff which is a little bit

453
00:20:34,309 --> 00:20:38,240
newer those are all things that we can

454
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,758
consider and other extensions that you

455
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,830
may have in mind but there are things

456
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:44,179
that we'll need to see a draft for we'll

457
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,149
need to have a discussion as a working

458
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:51,860
group so and then have a decision about

459
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:53,508
whether or not we want to adopt that if

460
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,459
you have one of these things and we

461
00:20:53,509 --> 00:20:57,830
haven't already discussed it come and

462
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:59,539
talk to Lars and I will try and assess

463
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,340
interest in the group try and schedule a

464
00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,809
time in a meeting whether it's an

465
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:04,129
interim meeting or and one of the main

466
00:21:02,809 --> 00:21:05,928
IETF meetings where you can come and

467
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:08,110
present it to the group to get feedback

468
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,399
and we'll go through a process to decide

469
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:11,840
whether the group wants to adopt it and

470
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:15,768
if so when the appropriate time to do

471
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,480
that is we are currently our Charter is

472
00:21:15,769 --> 00:21:19,700
fairly restrictive about doing

473
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:21,889
extensions to quick and so to do these

474
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,179
things we need to reach Artur we're just

475
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:24,889
about to start talking about Ray

476
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,200
chartering for these three or some

477
00:21:24,889 --> 00:21:30,350
subset of them right now and for any

478
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,269
additional extensions we'd need to do a

479
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,559
recharter as well I think talking to the

480
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,509
area director is having a little bit of

481
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,490
friction there as good just to pace the

482
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:38,480
work of the group out so we don't take

483
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:41,480
on too much at one time

484
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,830
question mark David Blackwell real quick

485
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,250
another one put your radar screen

486
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:48,889
there's a second bits draft in the in

487
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:51,919
the same said general area of exposed

488
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:53,840
some bits so to show what's going on

489
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,980
with with the with the transport

490
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,529
protocol it's only tht we did WG agenda

491
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:03,049
dates it it's in about the same areas

492
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,399
law as lost bits draft okay so the best

493
00:22:03,049 --> 00:22:05,960
thing to do is to add them to that wiki

494
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,129
now I have a link at the end but

495
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,910
anything that you think the working

496
00:22:07,129 --> 00:22:09,320
group should at least be

497
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,910
tracking the status of added to that

498
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,649
wiki and that's a good place to start

499
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,230
and come talk to us and we'll figure it

500
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:16,310
out and this is definitely not a

501
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,070
complete list I'm sure there's other

502
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:20,750
stuff out there but but the idea and

503
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:22,730
talking the area directors that is is

504
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,080
the locus of future extensions to quick

505
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,790
what will happen in the quick working

506
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,500
group a provided we successfully

507
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:29,420
recharter and and and so forth and so on

508
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,370
we need to balance that of course with

509
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,630
the core quick version one work that

510
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,610
until it ships is always going to take

511
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:39,290
priority but but this is the plan for

512
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:41,990
extensions applications that use quick

513
00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:44,000
so this is new applications or existing

514
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:46,340
applications map to use the quick

515
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,280
protocol as its transport instead of TCP

516
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,510
or in addition to TCP there's a fair

517
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,860
amount of interest here as well of

518
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:54,379
course we saw the web transport buff

519
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,360
this week now I'm working group forming

520
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,250
but we'll see how it goes

521
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,919
lots of people talking about media in

522
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:02,600
various forms over quick various forms

523
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:05,360
of proxy and tunneling over quick for

524
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,699
example mask and other things DNS over

525
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,320
quicker net comp over quick and so

526
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:11,390
talking the area directors I think we've

527
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,669
come to an agreement and and from from

528
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,340
the chair standpoint you know we don't

529
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:17,330
want to take on too much of this or

530
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,520
htv-3 was a special case because that

531
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:20,929
was our motivating use case but we don't

532
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,370
want to have some super working group

533
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:25,010
for all applications that happen to use

534
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,409
one transport and so the quick working

535
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:29,090
group won't adopt these you know I think

536
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:31,520
if you want to give people a heads up

537
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:32,780
sure send that email to the list maybe

538
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,800
we can give you some as time permits

539
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:35,180
time in a session if you want to

540
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:36,680
advertise what you're doing but the

541
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,780
locus of those discussions shouldn't

542
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,770
happen in the quick working group of

543
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:43,040
course the quick working group will

544
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,960
always be available to consults as to

545
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:47,270
the use of quick or at least well the

546
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,830
working groups live but we're not going

547
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:50,389
to actually locate those discussions

548
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,649
they're the appropriate place to take

549
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,680
those is going to be to the applications

550
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:57,320
area so dispatch or they already these

551
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:59,630
Martin yeah Mon Thompson I think the

552
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:03,139
point here that's critical is that we

553
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:07,700
need to think of quick as both TCP to

554
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,170
and UDP to and we this area probably

555
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,730
doesn't want to take on all of the work

556
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,680
for all the protocols that's doing that

557
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,240
work at at I could have any number of

558
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,660
protocols to that that list and your

559
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:19,010
other their absolute and we that's not

560
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,770
gonna that's not going to scale out

561
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:23,510
we're going and just as you know

562
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,940
we doing it we did a new version of HTTP

563
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,770
we did the applications area you know

564
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:29,000
likewise absolutely of course you

565
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:30,980
consult to make sure that's using the

566
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,060
transport well yeah and I think one of

567
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,320
the things that will happen here is that

568
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,740
the quick working group will will

569
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:38,179
probably necessarily be involved in some

570
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:40,430
of these early efforts so that we can

571
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,900
set down good practices and come and

572
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:45,560
make sure that people understand the

573
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,870
protocol but as things get rolling that

574
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,610
understanding will spread yeah and

575
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,889
there's no way that we can continue to

576
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:53,419
control everything and yes arias not

577
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:54,350
really and that's next one point

578
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:55,640
actually I think there's a lot of stuff

579
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:58,040
we haven't written down in terms of best

580
00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,140
practices that one need to work out and

581
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,220
that might mean new documents for us but

582
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:03,320
they wouldn't be specific to those

583
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,430
applications they'd be distilling the

584
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,860
knowledge that we figure out along the

585
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:08,990
way

586
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,370
finally there's other things things that

587
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:12,890
don't really fit in any of those buckets

588
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:14,449
terribly well so people you know if

589
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:17,180
talking about the quic network simulator

590
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:20,750
a key log logging format plugin dies

591
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:22,310
quick quick first comm lots of different

592
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,690
interesting things I think we just have

593
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,450
to take these in a case-by-case basis

594
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,280
some of this might belong in ops for

595
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,360
example there other places some of it

596
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:31,610
might just be for people's information

597
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:35,659
but come and talk to us talk to the era

598
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:37,310
directors we'll figure it out so yeah

599
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,260
for more information that's the wiki

600
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:41,200
page I mentioned quick working group

601
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:43,370
based drafts wiki related activities

602
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,630
it's also linked from the quick working

603
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:49,010
room homepage yeah and so for extensions

604
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:50,240
like I said write a draft bring it to

605
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,770
the quick working group that's a good

606
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,920
starting point for applications ready

607
00:25:51,770 --> 00:26:03,050
draft bring to the art 80s so Martin

608
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:04,940
Thompson bring it to IDs a lot of the

609
00:26:03,050 --> 00:26:06,409
areas in the in the ITF have dispatch

610
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,630
processes that I think would be more

611
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,400
appropriate than than IDs sure and I

612
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:12,770
wouldn't necessarily suggest that we

613
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,380
suddenly send every single application

614
00:26:12,770 --> 00:26:18,650
that ever wants to use quick to Miria

615
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:21,490
and Magnus yes I think I said that'd be

616
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:23,960
unfair yeah that's a good point to

617
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:26,300
emphasize what every what you had on

618
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:29,150
your application site is actually spread

619
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,340
over the whole ITF like an end conf is

620
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:34,500
not in the application area Venus is not

621
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:36,389
in the application there so it's

622
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,980
ATS not only the transport ATS all

623
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:43,080
ladies sure I'm so Martha sort of stole

624
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:45,560
my Thunder as brand new dispatch chair a

625
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:49,139
lot of that stuff I can help dispatch

626
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:50,520
and those questions you know bring

627
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,590
together the year sort of our dairy

628
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,150
experts who can help find a home

629
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,040
including knowing when the stuff doesn't

630
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:57,810
belong there so it's not often not a bad

631
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:03,690
step for an application-level protocol

632
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:06,030
like the ones you've enumerated so gory

633
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,950
fairs done the quick for sat-comm bit

634
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:09,810
just as one thing and that's art can you

635
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:12,180
speak up just a bit Corey oh yeah I can

636
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:16,679
speak nice and slowly and clearly if I

637
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:20,280
try and on the quick Forrest calm part

638
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:22,470
just as an example there are a number of

639
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,330
different pieces in there there's the

640
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:25,560
idea of perhaps using a proxy for

641
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,480
something there's an idea of perhaps

642
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,659
changing a transport parameter there's

643
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,890
maybe some bits that need to be changed

644
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:36,240
on maybe a chain to some mechanism are

645
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,160
we doing the right thing putting all

646
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,670
that into one bundle and sending it or

647
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,290
do you want like a a scattering of small

648
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:44,990
IDs on all these different things how

649
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:47,220
are we going to kind of handle this bit

650
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,530
intelligently because I don't think I

651
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,000
think some of it will need new work some

652
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:52,590
of it could be just looked at and said

653
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,290
together this could put in existing work

654
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:58,250
how do we do it so is your intent for us

655
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,750
to consider this in quick version one

656
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,190
some bits but I think I know what to do

657
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:04,110
it that I think I shall try filing an

658
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,600
issue for this exactly if it's if it's

659
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:07,889
for quickly in one create issues make

660
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,310
them as well described in discrete as

661
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:12,900
you can for things for the future that's

662
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:15,480
a lot more loose right now I think we'll

663
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,890
take it as it comes if you can compose

664
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,390
things into drafts that are just

665
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,000
extensions that makes a lot easier of

666
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:23,370
course or just applications or you know

667
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,540
some combination thereof if it's best

668
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,310
practices that's a different kind of

669
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:27,570
document and we have you know we have

670
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:29,669
the opposite manageability documents

671
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,560
it's not clear whether other kinds of

672
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:33,330
how do you use quick documents or in

673
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,580
scope for us but we can talk about that

674
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:37,050
right now the working group is heads

675
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,960
down and focused on shipping quick

676
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:41,490
version one and so you know as that gets

677
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,290
out of the door and as we have that

678
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,340
pause I talked about will have more time

679
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,530
to step back and think about other

680
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:48,870
things how yeah that's a good answer a

681
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:57,210
90 pages some sort of

682
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:59,219
Thank You Spencer Dawkins I noticed one

683
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:03,390
of the things that's now on the list is

684
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,590
whatever the operations operational

685
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:09,830
considerations or management

686
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:14,189
considerations or whatever that as draft

687
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:16,500
so I didn't know if you had any thoughts

688
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:19,289
about that sure

689
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:21,899
so that's two drafts and and we had a

690
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,610
quick discussion of it again in a

691
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:25,649
discussion of those the other day I

692
00:29:23,610 --> 00:29:27,899
think the agreement of the group is is

693
00:29:25,649 --> 00:29:30,360
that yes they're still important yes

694
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,379
we're still working on them but because

695
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,519
we're heads down and quick they're not

696
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:34,350
getting quite as much attention as as

697
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,490
deserve right now again that's something

698
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,230
that we look at working on in the next

699
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:38,970
phase and I think we still want to ship

700
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,000
those as we ship the court documents to

701
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:43,139
the isg I think that's still the plan

702
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,070
yeah those are working group items

703
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:48,809
already Spencer yes from the beginning

704
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:50,970
so I guess one of the questions I was

705
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:54,539
going to ask and please don't answer it

706
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,830
now but one of the issues with the

707
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,519
management and operational

708
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:04,139
considerations discussion was that there

709
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:07,649
was no place else to have it and the

710
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:10,678
media operations working group recently

711
00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:12,360
charter made it 2/3 the way through

712
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:14,360
their first meeting before they started

713
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,750
talking about troubleshooting quick

714
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:20,309
there is a place to send this work and

715
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,750
make you know and maybe that maybe

716
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:24,178
that's a good thing to do if you're

717
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:26,330
talking about rich ordering anyway you

718
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:29,220
all will do the right thing I know that

719
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:32,428
but I ordered a I just wanted to offer

720
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:35,279
there there's a possibility I think

721
00:30:32,429 --> 00:30:36,330
that's interesting I guess I like the

722
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,919
documents in the group right now

723
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,629
provided we actually put the effort in

724
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,830
because the knowledge is in the group

725
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:49,679
right now so yeah David's gonna see

726
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:53,129
quick enthusiasts actually I love quick

727
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,380
so much that I'm an author on two of

728
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:58,350
those quick extensions and on an

729
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,630
application over quick and I just shared

730
00:30:58,350 --> 00:31:01,659
a buff on something over quick this week

731
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:09,610
I really

732
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:13,470
quick thank you on a lot of these

733
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:16,240
proposals especially a previous I tf's

734
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:19,000
we brought them to things like dispatch

735
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,300
and kind of a lot of the feedback we got

736
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:26,050
was this sounds interesting this is cool

737
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:28,389
but not yet and what I'm hearing here

738
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,940
sounds like an opening of the floodgates

739
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,380
to some extent which I'm loving maybe

740
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:35,650
that's not the right term mark looks

741
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:39,610
uneasy but as in maybe the not-yet might

742
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:42,130
become a Oh how about now so I guess my

743
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,669
question might be more from early as a

744
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:53,650
policy from you know as our responsible

745
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:56,230
ad how about now so yes we can sweet

746
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:57,760
awesome just wanted to have that double

747
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:59,080
check us you know I've kind of heard

748
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:04,330
that in private but it's great that

749
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:06,720
that's the case let's do it so then I

750
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,949
don't know if I ever said not yet but

751
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,110
what we've been trying previously is

752
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:13,960
really to focus on getting version one

753
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:15,399
out the door concentrating the energy of

754
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,870
like the people in the quick working

755
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,210
group in the people in this area on

756
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,850
doing this work task and we are

757
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,350
basically there so we should also do

758
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:29,469
some work around it and we should use

759
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:31,179
the protocols we develop so yes I want

760
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,610
to say the same thing Spencer mention

761
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:39,300
about the problem you didn't discuss the

762
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:41,590
probability and management drafted that

763
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,050
are already there but I think there

764
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:46,300
should be also review the probably in

765
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:48,250
operate in ops area because they have to

766
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,530
do there the other thing is about the

767
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:54,400
applications if we're going to do them I

768
00:32:50,530 --> 00:32:56,980
mean the some of them required changes

769
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,560
in what's currently in v1 of earthquake

770
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,120
and the question is are there any

771
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,159
guidelines would there be any guidelines

772
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,919
what you can change what not how it will

773
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,870
be handled when it's going to be going

774
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,280
to other work you also or your

775
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:12,340
accounting that the same people will go

776
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,149
and be the quick police or whatever well

777
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,100
so

778
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:16,600
quick police is an interesting concept

779
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:19,629
and I want to talk about that after the

780
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,860
meeting but I I suspect a number of the

781
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,210
same people will still be involved in

782
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,280
these efforts

783
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:26,440
generally speaking you know if you're

784
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:28,149
changing quick version one it's either

785
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,100
an extension and a new version and and

786
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:33,010
the extension should be not specific to

787
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,570
an application and so it's going to be a

788
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:40,059
case-by-case thing deciding what the

789
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:42,010
right fit is I think that hurty I was

790
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:43,720
gonna say quick enthusiasts but david

791
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:49,780
has proven to me that I am merely a

792
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:51,340
tepid supporter of guerdon he says it's

793
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,350
a big tent but he's really got the

794
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,919
tallest chair in that tent at least

795
00:33:53,350 --> 00:34:01,030
today I I wanted to talk about two

796
00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,920
things one of which I I think is the

797
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:05,678
stupid idea of ferry visiting me on

798
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,620
Thursday afternoon and one of which

799
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,830
might be more sensible there was a joke

800
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:14,230
a while back that we needed a quick area

801
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:14,980
because so much different work was being

802
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:16,418
inspired by it

803
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:19,149
earlier today we heard about some work

804
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:20,699
and TLS to do some retconning of their

805
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:23,859
record layer to make it look more like

806
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,899
what happened in the split that ended up

807
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,639
being between the TLS handshake and the

808
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:29,440
quick record layer we've heard all of

809
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,770
these applications we've heard these

810
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,540
things that wants to look at how you

811
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:36,610
manage different applications on quick

812
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,290
and so I'm gonna suggest that we

813
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,899
actually consider running an experiment

814
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:44,860
for a couple of ITF s and having a quick

815
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:47,279
dispatch working session as an

816
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:49,870
additional session to the to the regular

817
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,240
sessions early in the week so the people

818
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,399
who are part of this flood can figure

819
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:56,649
out where their particular Eddy should

820
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,420
go I think some of the work would stay

821
00:34:56,649 --> 00:34:59,920
here and transport some of the stuff in

822
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,470
particular around multipath or

823
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:04,420
congestion controllers might really

824
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,669
belong here a great deal more of it

825
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,700
might end up in operations or

826
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:12,780
applications and as a short meeting that

827
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:16,870
didn't try and concentrate the expertise

828
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:20,080
a meeting that concentrated the

829
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:22,240
expertise that that is inherent in that

830
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,549
core of quick people the quick police

831
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,589
that you were just talking about in one

832
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,990
room early in the week might help

833
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:31,900
clarify a whole bunch of stuff later and

834
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,939
does a you know to session experiment it

835
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,740
might be worth trying as I said that

836
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:39,580
that's the bad idea ferry for Thursday

837
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:42,609
afternoon idea the I think much more

838
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:45,400
practical realistic right now idea is we

839
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:48,340
are at the moment of Ackley's 216 right

840
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,470
we saw this was HTTP it was built for

841
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:52,090
one thing and suddenly people wanted to

842
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:55,810
do all kinds of other different things

843
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:58,260
with it and it went wide very wide

844
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,150
across the the landscape of the internet

845
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,710
becoming by becoming so wide the new

846
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,230
waste of the internet was one of those

847
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:06,580
strange things we think this is gonna

848
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,650
happen again we think it's gonna happen

849
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:12,610
here and this is one of the few times I

850
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,860
think we can predict it and since we can

851
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:17,170
predict it this time I am actually going

852
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:19,000
to suggest that whatever efforts whether

853
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:21,280
they're the stupid idea ferries efforts

854
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,320
or something else we can do to try and

855
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:26,050
make sure people understand what they're

856
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:29,080
doing to the protocol as well as with it

857
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,820
is really important right now and that

858
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,930
may mean that during that six-month

859
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:35,140
period while we're waiting for

860
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:37,089
everything to Sun down we we write a

861
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,940
much abbreviated version of the

862
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:43,150
Hitchhiker's Guide to quick this is

863
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:45,070
something that you you did for sip and

864
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,570
others have done for other things so

865
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,090
they understood how the parts fit

866
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,370
together and what they were doing and it

867
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:55,240
is a lot of work to write Hitchhiker's

868
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:57,190
Guide like that but if we do see what we

869
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,740
expect to see I think the work would pay

870
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:02,470
off so you are talking about writing

871
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,990
this document for application designers

872
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:06,580
I think the whole point of a

873
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:08,919
Hitchhiker's Guide is that it's written

874
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:10,960
for any of the audience's who plan to

875
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,700
take up that technology and it's not

876
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:14,740
just the applications but anybody who

877
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,899
might be saying I want to do this but I

878
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:19,029
want datagrams with it I want to do this

879
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,920
but I need multi path for it it's how

880
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:22,870
all the pieces fit together so that if

881
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:25,030
they have an understanding from TCP and

882
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:28,210
Howell NP TCP works they see the

883
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:29,740
differences early and and connected to

884
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:32,950
the ways they fit together

885
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,839
I I think it has to be a lot simpler

886
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,390
than the Hitchhiker's God to sit in

887
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,010
order to be done in that six month

888
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,819
period but it might be a valuable use of

889
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:42,850
the time

890
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:44,170
so the applicability statement and as

891
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,990
well as a miniature police statement

892
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:49,000
were to documents that were actually

893
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:50,740
meant to be directed at like a different

894
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,480
audience than the people that implement

895
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,330
create great it's not what you it's not

896
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:57,250
quite what you're looking for but it's

897
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,450
definitely not what I'm talking about I

898
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:59,800
will send you a pointer to the

899
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,290
Hitchhiker's Guide that I'm thinking of

900
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,380
as an example but tech you can also

901
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:08,310
write a blog post Spenser Dawkins just

902
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:12,790
following up on that really quickly

903
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:14,770
imagine the TCP roadmap or the SIP

904
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,860
Hitchhiker's Guide or the course guide

905
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:19,450
to sip if work on that has started

906
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:22,660
before there were a hundred and fifty

907
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:24,970
RFC's which is kind of the case in both

908
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,940
for both of those protocols so I think

909
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:32,399
that's I'd like to really support his

910
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,400
suggestion that people think about that

911
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,650
Cullen Jennings I am also a quick

912
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:41,290
enthusiast though I'm in the pale shadow

913
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:45,550
of David but I hope to a supplier I'm

914
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:46,870
motivated I'm thrilled to see quickest

915
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:48,280
open for business with things like

916
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:51,130
Datagram moving forward because that

917
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,450
enables the things I want to do so I am

918
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:55,450
taking this opportunity to make a

919
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:59,350
shameless plug for some work we're doing

920
00:38:55,450 --> 00:39:02,129
over in art around how to encapsulate

921
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:05,259
audio and video real-time media into

922
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:06,460
quick or web transports or various forms

923
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,180
of that we're sorry' figuring that out

924
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:11,850
and if you guys wanna join us we

925
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,259
presented in dispatch on this rip draft

926
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:16,270
earlier this week and we're working

927
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,070
towards boff in vancouver that we plan

928
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:21,910
to run so if you're interested in that

929
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:25,480
type of area pick me and I will show you

930
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:31,810
where we are thanks Adam is working on

931
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:33,460
that mailing list as we speak Jong

932
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:35,200
clinic so I have an abstract question

933
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:40,090
and then a concrete instantiation of

934
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,890
that question so the abstract question

935
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:44,830
is you know as we do applications will

936
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,299
probably develop you know requirements

937
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,470
that it's not clear to us what they

938
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:50,320
actually need whether they need

939
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:53,379
requirements or implementation guidance

940
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,180
or even API guidance and

941
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,369
do that the particular the thing that

942
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:59,859
I'm looking at is a number of

943
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:01,720
applications of things like web

944
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:03,460
transport needs low latency congestion

945
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:05,589
control and I don't know if that's

946
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:08,799
something where quick protocol would

947
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:10,900
need to change if quick implementations

948
00:40:08,799 --> 00:40:12,519
need to change or just the API is such

949
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,410
that you know you get callbacks when

950
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:15,970
it's safe to send with low latency needs

951
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:19,118
to change and I think that needs

952
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:25,689
guidance from the quick group and what's

953
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:28,239
the best way to get that cut ins so my

954
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:30,039
my personal comment is actually if you

955
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,900
look actually for low latency condition

956
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:37,319
control that's protocol independent

957
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:39,970
right the tools you need for it yes

958
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:42,220
which is a which I've heard conflicting

959
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:44,529
reports about whether quick gives you

960
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:47,140
things like the per packet arrival time

961
00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:48,160
stamps that are I'm count wants for

962
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,900
instance I think the answer I can give

963
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,368
you right now is is that you know the

964
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,690
people you want to be talking to you are

965
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,549
going to be generally located in some

966
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:56,289
place like the quick working group now

967
00:40:54,549 --> 00:40:58,869
is probably not a great time to talk to

968
00:40:56,289 --> 00:41:04,269
them about it in terms of the workload

969
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:06,279
and their focus next year probably

970
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:08,160
whether the quick working group is the

971
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:16,150
right forum for that actual discussion

972
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:17,558
TBD ok yeah not in Thompson I think what

973
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,599
we're recognizing here is that the quick

974
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:22,920
working group has a limited capacity to

975
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,660
do additional work in this phase between

976
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:29,829
now when we're sort of close to finished

977
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:33,098
and when we really finish on this thing

978
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:35,259
and so there's gonna be some need to

979
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:38,469
manage the priority of the various items

980
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:40,509
in this process I tend to think that

981
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:46,900
Ted's idea might work given the timing

982
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:48,400
of it or because in Vancouver and the

983
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,719
next meeting after that which I'd forget

984
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,739
where it is Madrid we should be we

985
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,089
should be getting a few more of these

986
00:41:53,739 --> 00:41:56,499
things and Gauri's question is really

987
00:41:55,089 --> 00:41:59,529
interesting one because there's there's

988
00:41:56,499 --> 00:42:01,749
a unit of work that says I might want to

989
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:05,019
tweak some things in quick but I also

990
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:06,850
have an application or something along

991
00:42:05,019 --> 00:42:10,029
those lines and and so how

992
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:13,600
a group like that discussed specifically

993
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:15,040
that and a quick dispatch really does

994
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,960
sound like it's got all the wrong

995
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,550
connotations but I'm sure we can come up

996
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,530
with a name for for a group like that

997
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:24,190
and right

998
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:25,930
it'll be effective you know effectively

999
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:29,320
that's what we've offered folks in the

1000
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:33,810
interim in Zurich so yeah I wanted a

1001
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:37,090
caution there and that and that is that

1002
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:38,500
this area has very specific expertise in

1003
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:40,960
the development of transport protocols

1004
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:43,780
and congestion control and the

1005
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,820
application thereof and we're talking

1006
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:48,880
about multipath and all of those related

1007
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:51,730
things some of these people coming along

1008
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,050
will come into that group and go I want

1009
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:54,790
to I want to do this new application on

1010
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:58,930
top of quick and the immediate response

1011
00:42:54,790 --> 00:43:00,670
then needs to be go talk to the dispatch

1012
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:02,500
chairs in the art area because this is

1013
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:04,390
clearly an art area thing now some of

1014
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,250
that stuff we can do easily because it's

1015
00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:10,120
pretty obvious obviously the things that

1016
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:12,640
that Cullen is trying to do gonna happen

1017
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,470
in art there's I don't see any other way

1018
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,460
that that's going to happen but there's

1019
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:18,069
gonna need to be a little bit of

1020
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,020
judgment exercised to you otherwise

1021
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:20,890
someone's gonna get overloaded and I

1022
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:25,660
don't want to have that happen

1023
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:27,279
absolutely hi Brian Trammell I came up

1024
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,049
here to say something different and then

1025
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,560
I just ended up coming up to endorse

1026
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:33,970
Ted's idea I think that I I think we

1027
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,799
probably don't want to end up with a

1028
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:40,899
quick dispatch or slow and lingering or

1029
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:42,700
whatever we call it permanently but

1030
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,520
there is well I mean he said the quick

1031
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:46,930
dispatch was bad so what's the opposite

1032
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:53,080
of a quick dispatch is it's worse

1033
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:54,310
actually um the the if you hear the

1034
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,779
reason that I wouldn't just say hey we

1035
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:57,130
have dispatch we have that process we

1036
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:59,560
have that thing it just works let's do

1037
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:01,870
that is something that I haven't really

1038
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,850
heard surfaced is that the interface

1039
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,620
that most other transport protocols

1040
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:09,610
provide to the application is here's a

1041
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,810
byte stream and a hope and a prayer take

1042
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:15,310
your things slap it on the ice cream

1043
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:17,529
everything is good or not the interface

1044
00:44:15,310 --> 00:44:20,590
that quick provides to the application

1045
00:44:17,530 --> 00:44:25,330
is significantly more complicated and

1046
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:28,000
to find um so this is why at the

1047
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,799
beginning of things like people are

1048
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,630
gonna say oh I want an application and I

1049
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,590
think I need to act quick because I

1050
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:34,270
don't know what the interface does that

1051
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:35,740
thing is we discussed in the quickie

1052
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:37,630
working group whether or not we wanted

1053
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:38,919
to take on the work to do an API draft

1054
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,940
right like so there was a little bit of

1055
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:42,040
discussion about whether intake the

1056
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,440
applicability draft and put this api

1057
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:46,420
dropped around it and i think we kind of

1058
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:48,490
nobody had any energy energy around that

1059
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,530
because I don't think we understood what

1060
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:51,580
that interface looked like I still think

1061
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,330
we don't quite understand what that

1062
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:54,310
interface looks like

1063
00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:57,009
and I would like to say that one of the

1064
00:44:54,310 --> 00:44:59,110
other goals of having a non dispatch

1065
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,610
dispatch working group is to watch what

1066
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:01,960
comes through that working group and use

1067
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,760
that to figure out what that interface

1068
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:06,070
looks like cuz I think we're gonna learn

1069
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,290
something through that process and we

1070
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:11,320
can write that down in an RFC I guess I

1071
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:13,210
just volunteered to help with that or we

1072
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:14,680
can you know it goes into the or it just

1073
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,640
goes into sort of the lore and we figure

1074
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:16,720
out what it is and it's not that

1075
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,799
complicated we don't need to write it

1076
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:19,600
down anywhere and then we just have a

1077
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,410
process but I would I would say that one

1078
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,390
of the things we should do with that

1079
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:24,000
process is figure out what that

1080
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,990
interface is because it is gonna change

1081
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:28,530
how the people have to work with each

1082
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:31,060
other just to respond to that quickly I

1083
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:32,410
agree that's one of the things in the

1084
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:33,790
back of my head is is that this week

1085
00:45:32,410 --> 00:45:36,220
we've seen a couple of examples of

1086
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,759
people trying to use h-2b to an extent

1087
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:41,620
hb2 in ways that are broken or harmful

1088
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:45,190
and that's because they didn't have good

1089
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:47,680
guidance like that you know you're not

1090
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,870
calling anyone out are you I would never

1091
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,480
do that I would say that in some cases

1092
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:54,160
the the the answer is don't do that

1093
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,080
that's going to be painful but I think

1094
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,520
that if like in quick since we don't

1095
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,319
know what that is yet release we're HT

1096
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
many knows what it looks like for

1097
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,380
quickly don't know what painful is yet

1098
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,879
so like something that looks painful now

1099
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:07,840
it might actually be something that we

1100
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:11,050
need work on the interface so yeah this

1101
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,300
is Patrick I like quick to I'm actually

1102
00:46:11,050 --> 00:46:14,740
I'm really really excited about a number

1103
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:16,030
of things that's gonna do that I think I

1104
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:18,490
really don't change particularly

1105
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:20,770
webviews cases and this working group

1106
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:25,270
has been really unique in a couple

1107
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:26,980
different ways one is the extended focus

1108
00:46:25,270 --> 00:46:28,690
and volume of work that's been done in

1109
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,480
this group is really really remarkable

1110
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:33,940
if you follow it closely it is

1111
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:38,440
I mean if firehose does not really begin

1112
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:40,210
describe what's going on and I find it

1113
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,400
hard to simply summarize without writing

1114
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:44,470
the PRS I can't read the PRS as fast as

1115
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:47,470
other people are writing the PRS slow

1116
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:49,750
freaky but the fact that it's composed

1117
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,459
across really three areas has been I

1118
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:55,440
think a very successful experiment

1119
00:46:51,460 --> 00:47:00,250
enlarged and necessary for where it is

1120
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:02,800
and yet I don't feel the work on all

1121
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:04,829
three of those aspects has proceeded at

1122
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:10,240
the same pace within the working group

1123
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:11,770
it has been by necessity I think and

1124
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,310
appropriately so a little transport

1125
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:17,800
heavy going through and the application

1126
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,720
bits and security bits have been

1127
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,540
developed a little bit later and with

1128
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:24,160
less broad input we've managed to put

1129
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:25,839
the right voices in there I think to get

1130
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,109
a high quality product but it's gonna be

1131
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,210
a hard thing to sustain like that and so

1132
00:47:29,109 --> 00:47:33,430
going forward I think the right answer

1133
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:34,869
is more coordination than centralization

1134
00:47:33,430 --> 00:47:37,509
as you're talking about in farming that

1135
00:47:34,869 --> 00:47:39,369
work out further and so some citations

1136
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,079
we can use on this I think the web

1137
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:43,630
transport one is like is a good thing to

1138
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,950
think about in that model and it does

1139
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,220
have transported in its name but it's

1140
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,899
much more like WebSockets than it is

1141
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:52,930
like quick itself right it has to

1142
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:54,790
polyfill it has with other web like

1143
00:47:52,930 --> 00:47:56,348
mechanisms it has to be concerned about

1144
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:58,630
the web security although on a whole

1145
00:47:56,349 --> 00:48:00,640
bunch of different aspects and you know

1146
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:03,400
so yes it's a good example some that

1147
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:06,160
uses quick and it uses quick in a fairly

1148
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,270
close way to to native you can model

1149
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,649
that in your head in a bunch of

1150
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:10,930
different ways of exactly how that maps

1151
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,810
together but the expertise to bring a

1152
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:15,609
new thing into existence probably comes

1153
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:17,078
from somewhere else and so I think

1154
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:18,790
farming this out and really sort of

1155
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:22,990
opening the floodgates it's a great time

1156
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:24,700
so that's great just sorry just to

1157
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:26,680
respond to that very briefly you bring

1158
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,779
to mind very much that one of the things

1159
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:30,549
that Lars and I have observed is that we

1160
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:32,680
we see the implementers and the people

1161
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:35,140
working on the specs getting close to

1162
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,040
the point of exhaustion this has been a

1163
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,868
long slog it's a lot of work and well I

1164
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:41,950
know that people are excited about and

1165
00:48:40,869 --> 00:48:43,630
some of the same people are excited

1166
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:45,069
about new applications or extensions and

1167
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:46,930
there's going to be effort put in there

1168
00:48:45,069 --> 00:48:47,770
we can't assume that this group of

1169
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:49,390
people and group of

1170
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:52,840
implementors is going to be available

1171
00:48:49,390 --> 00:49:00,609
for infinite amounts of work we saw this

1172
00:48:52,840 --> 00:49:02,500
with HB 2 as well Jenai and God I'd want

1173
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:04,720
people not to get emotionally attached

1174
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:10,800
to protocols they tend to not

1175
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:14,770
reciprocate your feelings no they don't

1176
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:16,720
but I am here to say that I took a

1177
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,300
little little while but I don't like the

1178
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,060
idea of having a quick dispatch sort of

1179
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:23,710
a thing it seems to make sense and the

1180
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:28,150
other on the other point about

1181
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:30,460
congestion control with ICC RJ chair hat

1182
00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:32,890
on I'd recommend that people who have

1183
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:35,020
ideas on doing different condition

1184
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:38,140
controllers even if the problem is

1185
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:40,360
motivated and driven by having quick as

1186
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:42,339
a transport the problem really if it's

1187
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:45,220
congestion control belongs in a

1188
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:48,690
congestion control forum and the ICC RG

1189
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,689
is a place you may want to bring it to

1190
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:57,410
work

1191
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,270
not so much for you Marcus for the 80s

1192
00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,009
and and second everybody everybody in

1193
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,259
the room there was mentioned earlier of

1194
00:50:01,010 --> 00:50:05,270
some dispatch like functionality for

1195
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,500
transport that might be really good idea

1196
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:08,780
I can think of at least three discussion

1197
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:12,380
I've been involved in in this week that

1198
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:14,540
have that have included okay so where

1199
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:17,480
would we work on this thing in the

1200
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:18,080
transport area or the or the IETF in

1201
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,740
general

1202
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:23,600
I'll also observe the TSV WG as the

1203
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:26,839
catch-all working the transport area is

1204
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:28,970
bursting at the scenes based on what we

1205
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:32,920
did this week we'd ask for six hours and

1206
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:32,919
then Coover which ain't going to happen

1207
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:42,530
okay thank you very much for the

1208
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:43,850
feedback that was really good I hope we

1209
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:47,600
could also provide you some useful

1210
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:50,600
information from our side we would

1211
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,730
definitely consider a feed book you've

1212
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:56,060
feedback you've provided also the idea

1213
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:57,500
about quick dispatch maybe not for the

1214
00:50:56,060 --> 00:50:58,640
next meeting because we have like we

1215
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:59,930
have the feeling we have a plan for the

1216
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:03,049
things that we know that are coming up

1217
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:07,040
but but maybe we are so wrong right and

1218
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:09,680
but it's very good ideas and I don't

1219
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,540
have anything else for my site so we

1220
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,100
could have another open mic or we could

1221
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:15,340
have a real open mic if you have any

1222
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:18,259
other questions to the transport ATS and

1223
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,260
Magnus could be mem again if you want

1224
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:26,960
him to or we could just all go home for

1225
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:30,040
today okay I guess at the end of the

1226
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,040
session thank you very much
