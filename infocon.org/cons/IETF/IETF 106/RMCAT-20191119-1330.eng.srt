1
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:56,680
it was

2
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,080
Oh

3
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:57,660
all right so I guess we should get

4
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:58,290
started so this is the RM cats working

5
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,959
group

6
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm Colin Perkins I'm one of the

7
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,450
co-chairs we have Anna hopefully one of

8
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,620
the other co-chairs on meet echo and

9
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:26,789
searching as well who will be giving one

10
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:29,990
of the remote presentations there we go

11
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:38,300
you expect me to work the Chromebooks

12
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:43,669
can you hear me Anna churching yes we

13
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,669
ride or at least okay excellent

14
00:04:46,729 --> 00:04:57,360
churching either yes very well I forgot

15
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:59,100
to activate like okay get it since this

16
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,750
is all working all right so let's get

17
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,340
started

18
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,620
so as I say this is the ITP media

19
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:08,929
congestion avoidance techniques working

20
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,910
group we have the usual note well

21
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:16,740
hopefully everyone is familiar with this

22
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:20,900
by now you have to disclose IPR and we

23
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:23,639
have a code of conduct and the like

24
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,979
today's slides are all in the data

25
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:29,340
tracker if you want to follow along we

26
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:32,099
have mute echo is anyone in the jabber

27
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,200
room in the in the room Jonathan okay if

28
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:37,200
you can keep an eye out for comments in

29
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:39,090
there if I forget to press the red

30
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,349
button someone shout at me I know all I

31
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:45,510
am able to remote participation I will

32
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,789
attempt to take notes if anyone else

33
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:50,909
could take notes that would be helpful

34
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:53,409
and then we can combine combine them to

35
00:05:50,909 --> 00:05:55,539
make minutes

36
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:57,600
if you didn't take notes please send

37
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,370
them to me

38
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,680
so we've got a reasonably light agenda

39
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,170
today we've got this introduction and

40
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,090
status update to start with then

41
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,620
churching will give an update on the NAD

42
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:10,869
or implementation and some new

43
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:13,150
evaluation results and then we'll finish

44
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,340
up I have a very brief presentation

45
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,289
about the congestion control feedback

46
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:23,260
draft which will mostly be discussed in

47
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:27,400
a BT core and I think Friday so looking

48
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,560
at the document status we have a bunch

49
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,580
of congestion control algorithm

50
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:37,300
candidates and related documents the

51
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,789
Google congestion control draft is has

52
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,100
been dormant for some time and I'm not

53
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:43,360
expecting that to be updated although we

54
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,910
would be open to an update if the

55
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,390
authors care about that all of the other

56
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,950
drafts the NADA algorithms cream the

57
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:53,680
shared bottleneck detection and coupled

58
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:55,510
congestion control refer in the RFC if

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,100
it's a queue or have been published as

60
00:06:55,510 --> 00:07:02,020
RFC is already the requirements draft

61
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,790
the condition mutual requirements has

62
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,990
been in the RFC at HQ for a very very

63
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:08,050
long time

64
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,320
I believe that's part of cluster 238 so

65
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:14,380
hopefully will appear before too long

66
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,050
the evaluation drafts the video traffic

67
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:19,420
model was published recently recently

68
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:21,700
the evolve test draft has been approved

69
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:23,380
and this was the RFC editor when the

70
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:26,530
eval criteria and the Wireless tests

71
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:30,840
went to the IFG since the last meeting

72
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:30,840
and they're waiting for processing the

73
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,650
condition control feedback message I'll

74
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:37,630
give you a brief update about that later

75
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:40,270
today and it will be discussed in a BT

76
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,130
car on Friday here my belief is that

77
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:44,620
this is now ready for working group last

78
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:46,680
call in a BT core and hopefully we will

79
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:50,050
be able to wrap that up pretty quickly

80
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,200
the RM congestion control feedback draft

81
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:55,180
had a very brief update prior to this

82
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:59,159
meeting which just fixed a bug I noticed

83
00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:02,410
to make the calculations I actually

84
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,820
match the description in the text it

85
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,439
turns out that you have to specify the

86
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:11,949
dependencies in the make file if

87
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:14,289
things to be updated correctly won the

88
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:16,330
war for that draft once the feedback

89
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:19,330
message has been finalized that will

90
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:23,729
then get revised with the accurate

91
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:26,198
numbers and the congestion control

92
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:30,339
framework and codec interactions draft

93
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:31,959
have both expired and we will I think we

94
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:33,698
previously decided that we'd reconsider

95
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:35,500
those once the candidates had got the

96
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:42,098
standards track and that may be some

97
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:46,000
time so these are basically dominants we

98
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:48,160
have a number of milestones I have

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,970
omitted the the milestones that have

100
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,350
been done for some time on this draft

101
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,990
the others we had a milestone for

102
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,790
December 2018 or she was to submit the

103
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:59,730
requirements and evaluation criteria

104
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:03,910
drafts to the iesg

105
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:05,860
we're almost a year late but we managed

106
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,269
it within within a year after the

107
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,040
deadline so I consider that a great

108
00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:15,220
success and we we have succeeded in

109
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:24,610
submitting those to the iesg are better

110
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:28,060
than web RTC yes yeah yeah the milestone

111
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:30,399
has been delayed a little obvious the

112
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:34,630
evaluation results were supposed to go

113
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,310
to the ASG in July the publisher first

114
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,189
draft of the standards track congestion

115
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:40,719
control in July and we are supposed to

116
00:09:39,189 --> 00:09:42,519
submits that the final version of

117
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,970
congestion control and the interactions

118
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:47,470
to the ASG by this meeting I think it's

119
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,220
reasonably likely that those are not

120
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:58,480
going to happen especially the ones in

121
00:09:51,220 --> 00:10:00,009
the past so the suggestion from the

122
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,910
chairs after a little bit of discussion

123
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:06,879
was that we would spend the next 12

124
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:09,699
months or so gathering evaluation

125
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:11,769
results and implementation experience

126
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:13,899
and practical experience using some of

127
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:16,750
these algorithms for the next 12 months

128
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:18,850
or so and keep the working group alive

129
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:20,949
and if there's things to reports then we

130
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:24,250
can we can have meetings and have some

131
00:10:20,949 --> 00:10:25,420
reports and some discussion and if there

132
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,190
isn't anything to report for a

133
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:31,029
particular meeting then we can not meet

134
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:34,930
at that time and then in a year or so we

135
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:37,029
can evaluate that status see see where

136
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:40,239
things are and see if we should continue

137
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,430
in their pursuit of work if there's any

138
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,279
interest in taking any of these to us

139
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:47,319
done district I don't know if there any

140
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:58,839
opinions on that from that the rest of

141
00:10:47,319 --> 00:11:01,899
the group jad yeah I think I think

142
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,329
that's this sounds good to me but what

143
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,279
I'm I was wondering like what do you do

144
00:11:04,329 --> 00:11:08,529
with gathering information that is how

145
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:09,610
do you gather it like is it like I mean

146
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,899
we have been we have been showing

147
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,600
results when we were developing the

148
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:19,389
pollution control algorithms you have a

149
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,889
quite amount of evolution results there

150
00:11:19,389 --> 00:11:27,040
so basically what exactly you would like

151
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:29,589
to gather that was not already there and

152
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,980
how you would like to gather that so

153
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,600
where do we have the discussion well I

154
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:42,639
think we shall have that discussion in

155
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:45,670
in in this room yeah Mia Kulemin so what

156
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,019
we usually do for congressional tour not

157
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,449
that we have like a bunch of congestion

158
00:11:47,019 --> 00:11:51,250
control schemes sanitized in the IDF but

159
00:11:49,449 --> 00:11:52,959
like we've been carefully about Senate I

160
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,550
think I met proposed standard because

161
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,439
you want to make sure it's safe to use

162
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:58,000
them on the Internet so I think the only

163
00:11:56,439 --> 00:11:59,410
way to figure out it's safe to use them

164
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,720
on the Internet is to actually use them

165
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:03,519
on the Internet so what you want is

166
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,350
deployment you want not only evaluation

167
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,380
results you actually want like live four

168
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,959
styles of deployed traces and whatever

169
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:12,310
if you can't get that then maybe we

170
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,529
shouldn't go for proposed standard which

171
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:18,880
I don't think is like a bad thing

172
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:20,920
because you can use congestion control

173
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,300
without like having interoperability

174
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:24,279
problems or whatever it doesn't really

175
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,529
matter if it's experimental or proposed

176
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:28,740
standard so but like that would be my

177
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,740
bar

178
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:42,590
socha heading and so do do we have an

179
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:45,260
expectation of like what is the what is

180
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:48,140
the spread of the deployment like like

181
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,790
this amount of traffic need to use some

182
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,880
condition control or something like that

183
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:55,910
or how I mean deploy many I of course

184
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:58,160
like what we can do we can what exactly

185
00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,260
for a scream we did and basically we

186
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,439
have it open source we have a couple of

187
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:05,660
cases that we used it in different

188
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,640
trials and tests and a light network and

189
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,770
also how we know like some people are

190
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:10,430
working on it it is on gh2 more and

191
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:12,770
stuff like that

192
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:16,880
but if you want me to call it all the

193
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:19,160
more like instances of using scream it

194
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,710
will be very hard for me to come and get

195
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,719
an answer so what I would like to rely

196
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:27,260
on like anybody using those not ice

197
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,270
cream of Jesus they come and show show

198
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:35,060
up here and that's also like and not

199
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:36,770
really realistic as I'm saying so what

200
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,589
do you do here I mean that's my question

201
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,840
basically I mean we for one year I mean

202
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:44,360
we said like one year we're gonna gather

203
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:49,490
a revolution reserves and experience but

204
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:53,270
I mean this as a group I don't think we

205
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:55,640
can force people to use these right if

206
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:57,560
people are using them if people are

207
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,780
doing experiments with them we would

208
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,229
appreciate feedback if people are not

209
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:11,569
then okay maybe we just leave them as

210
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:13,730
experimental searching hi actually I

211
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,380
meant to ask about it after my

212
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,330
presentation but I think since we're

213
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,610
talking about the plan for the working

214
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:21,830
group I might as well make sure I have

215
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,770
sort of similar maybe question as that

216
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:27,200
he in sense of for the evaluation stage

217
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:28,579
we're no longer talking about evaluating

218
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,200
the performance right for that we have

219
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,320
the test case we have all the collection

220
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,450
of some preliminary set of our results

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,480
now that we're talking about trying to

222
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:40,730
gather a deployment results I was

223
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,410
wondering whether that's a good

224
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,939
expectation but I was wondering whether

225
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,339
there's any sort of

226
00:14:43,939 --> 00:14:48,319
treats guidelines around it for instance

227
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:52,159
the question I wanted to ask after my

228
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:54,368
presentation was that we basically put

229
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,169
in the implementation as kind of a

230
00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:59,869
experimental branch if you like as and

231
00:14:57,169 --> 00:15:02,899
the browser you know and buting an

232
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:04,879
alternative method inside web RTC I was

233
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:08,209
kind of curious to know whether any of

234
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:11,899
the owners of either web RTC modular or

235
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:14,748
inside Firefox is interested in trying

236
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,569
it out on a larger scale so maybe those

237
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:19,849
type of things so maybe this is more

238
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,618
carful participation you know either

239
00:15:19,849 --> 00:15:23,569
inside this working group and I guess we

240
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:27,139
can also reach out to people who are

241
00:15:23,569 --> 00:15:28,848
potentially interested yeah but then so

242
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,659
that's my commenting may be trying to

243
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:34,699
encourage evaluation of this method but

244
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:36,619
the question is do we also have

245
00:15:34,699 --> 00:15:38,139
guidelines let's say if someone is

246
00:15:36,619 --> 00:15:42,109
interested in contributing to

247
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:44,119
large-scale evaluation what do we tell

248
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:49,039
them what type of stats to collect what

249
00:15:44,119 --> 00:15:49,729
type of how to run comparison things

250
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:58,039
like that

251
00:15:49,729 --> 00:16:00,849
thank you I mean I think we I mean we

252
00:15:58,039 --> 00:16:05,449
have all the various evaluation drafts

253
00:16:00,849 --> 00:16:08,569
which lists the type of things we look

254
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,189
to evaluate now obviously what you can

255
00:16:08,569 --> 00:16:11,988
do in a simulation testbed is not the

256
00:16:10,189 --> 00:16:15,079
same as what you can do in a real

257
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:17,569
deployment but you know metrics along

258
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:20,659
those lines just generally experience

259
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:22,789
you we have used it or we have seen

260
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:26,839
other people using it it doesn't seem to

261
00:16:22,789 --> 00:16:28,939
break anything just some general

262
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,379
experiences from from people actually

263
00:16:28,939 --> 00:16:33,498
trying it out and seeing if it really

264
00:16:30,379 --> 00:16:34,720
works yeah you could let me let me at

265
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:37,579
one point

266
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,799
so we also discussed that or like we

267
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,959
decided long time ago that we don't need

268
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:44,659
like to pick one that is the winner

269
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:47,449
right we can we can document all of them

270
00:16:44,659 --> 00:16:50,629
and then we see what deployment which

271
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:51,649
deployment will happen and so I think at

272
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:53,359
this point it's also not about

273
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:54,679
comparison anymore it's not to say this

274
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,720
is this one is better than the other one

275
00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,220
it's just like if you can prove

276
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
that there has been deployment and it

277
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:02,030
didn't met the internet then we can move

278
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,380
to stand up strike if not it's fine as

279
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:05,119
well I don't think it's a problem so

280
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:06,800
like I'd really like the plan having the

281
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,139
group open for 12 months see if there's

282
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:11,149
like anybody who can report on these

283
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,800
things and this timeframe and then if so

284
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:14,180
we can move ahead that would be great if

285
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,680
not I don't think it would be failure

286
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:23,120
for this working group it would be fine

287
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:26,420
as well hi this is Newton from Facebook

288
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,209
I just want to add that we did some

289
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,310
experiments and some deployments of one

290
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,710
of these algorithms in a different use

291
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,560
case and I would love to like my team

292
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,820
would love to present at one of these

293
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,830
working group meetings maybe next year

294
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:47,120
great that that would be really helpful

295
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:50,449
thank you John Lennox I think I

296
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:53,919
mentioned on the mailing list that I'm

297
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:55,910
on the I'm working for the jitsi

298
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,160
open-source conferencing project now and

299
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:00,740
I've I think I mentioned the millions

300
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,310
would be interested in trying out

301
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:08,120
various algorithms in our open source

302
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:10,700
SFU and we could even you probably you

303
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,860
know we could certainly even try to try

304
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:14,000
various algorithms in production I mean

305
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,040
the thing about asset view obviously is

306
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,520
your subject your own that you can only

307
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,350
send what the browser's give you and

308
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,350
getting but and you know which are which

309
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:28,429
basically means GCC because they're all

310
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:30,820
chrome but but you know we can certainly

311
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:32,810
that's something that we'd be open to

312
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,909
contributions to try out various

313
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:40,629
algorithms at our code even eventually

314
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,630
in production okay thank you

315
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:51,840
yeah I think I agree with Miriah like I

316
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:53,790
mean this is fine with if we have the

317
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,500
results we have a stronger if we don't

318
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,320
have resolve so you have experiment and

319
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:00,660
I think we have we have somebody saying

320
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,700
here like they have dared I am doing

321
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,520
experiment and hopefully they are doing

322
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:09,169
more than like GCC because I don't think

323
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,879
like GCC is the experimental right now

324
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:14,130
GCC is an expert internet after this

325
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,559
expired internet drop but it is not

326
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,000
deployed and so basically if you guys

327
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,168
are coming up here and saying like we

328
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,730
have we have evaluated GCC I mean that

329
00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:28,950
actually doesn't help us perhaps so BB

330
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:34,530
so my expectation like you will do more

331
00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:37,350
than GCC so I just want to add that like

332
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,149
like at the time when I submit the

333
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,590
proposal like maybe to the cheer like

334
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:43,530
you can decide whether it's fun or not

335
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:45,959
but like our work is not just purely

336
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,889
evaluating GCC like we actually applied

337
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,410
it over a quick instead of UDP and we

338
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:54,960
applied it we applied it to a different

339
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:56,280
use case then video calling so there

340
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,590
might be some interesting learnings for

341
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:02,280
the group like I can submit a proposal

342
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,809
and then we can I decide yeah I mean I

343
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,750
think that would be an be interesting

344
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:08,190
and you know we'll see we'll see whether

345
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:11,220
this group is the right place to do it

346
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:12,780
so ever whether we should possibly point

347
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,360
you at so the the congestion control

348
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:18,059
research groups that's yeah it's it

349
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,559
sounds like interesting work and yeah it

350
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:21,750
would be useful to hear it present it at

351
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:29,760
least somewhere in in one of these

352
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:31,710
meetings okay so how I'm reading that is

353
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,929
that there is general agreement that

354
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:35,730
this is a reasonable approach and we

355
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:38,910
will have to see how things go with the

356
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,470
evaluation and it is clearly difficult

357
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,850
to be prescriptive you know we're not

358
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,000
gonna say you need so many hundred

359
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:48,870
million users and minutes of deployment

360
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,640
experience but if people are using it

361
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:53,000
and getting some experiences then please

362
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,000
report back

363
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,960
okay so the only other thing I have I

364
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,810
think that's the last of these chest

365
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,280
slides I mean obviously it once we're

366
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:06,220
talking about implementation experience

367
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:09,430
we we had a hackathon earlier this week

368
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:12,600
did anyone play with the erm catacombs

369
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:12,600
in the hack fun

370
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:21,520
Jonathan ik so I mean the main thing I

371
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:25,000
worked on the hackathon is to sew is to

372
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:26,260
try to get more visibility into tracing

373
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,610
and debugging of what these things

374
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:29,890
algorithms are doing cuz it's often it's

375
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,110
very hard to say okay what actually

376
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,120
happened here you know is you know is

377
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:35,649
the fact that my band was just dropped

378
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:38,110
you know some weird quirk about

379
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:44,040
algorithm or really a profession of my

380
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:44,040
network so there were there were no

381
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:50,760
Sergio I mean three I think developed a

382
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,889
bunch of visualization tools and so

383
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,870
we're working on getting a common input

384
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:57,850
format that our congestion algorithms

385
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:59,139
can output such that we can feed these

386
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,959
visualization tools to figure out what

387
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:03,670
actually happened which is a very

388
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,420
important thing for an actual production

389
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:11,440
system the other feedback we had you

390
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,230
know more about not so much what we did

391
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:19,090
but what we complained about not having

392
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:24,220
was one thing that we useful to us is

393
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:25,959
have a practical way to turn looks like

394
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:29,260
some of the guidance in the content in

395
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,760
the test cases into you know for

396
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:33,070
instance actual commands we can type

397
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:37,030
into Linux to turn on the various

398
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:39,610
traffic shaping algorithms to say okay

399
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:41,350
let's make something that looks like you

400
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:43,959
know so we can actually test front on

401
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:45,850
our real systems what's actually

402
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,340
happening and you know there's these

403
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,020
various tools there's this tool TC and

404
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:53,199
Linux which is nearly incomprehensible

405
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,750
to mere mortals there are various front

406
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,640
ends to it but you know it's always

407
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,380
clear whether the front ends are doing

408
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,660
what you know something realistic

409
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,330
because it's very easy to get a you know

410
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:05,740
to pick the wrong you know traffic class

411
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:06,789
or traffic shaping and get something

412
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,779
that's completely unrealistic

413
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:10,029
compared to what the test case they're

414
00:23:07,779 --> 00:23:11,619
trying to do particularly for things

415
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:14,799
like the wireless test cases we have no

416
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:17,829
idea how to make something look like you

417
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,949
know a wireless base station using TC on

418
00:23:17,829 --> 00:23:24,428
Linux that is extremely non-obvious yes

419
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:26,469
the that's not simple so if you had

420
00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:27,579
there's anybody if you if anybody has

421
00:23:26,469 --> 00:23:29,709
knowledge or know somebody who has

422
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:32,408
knowledge you can sort of help turn this

423
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:36,309
into something more practically

424
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:37,690
realizable especially as you know you

425
00:23:36,309 --> 00:23:39,099
know if you get a lot of weird cases

426
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:40,419
like when you change the settings have

427
00:23:39,099 --> 00:23:42,428
it not do something completely off the

428
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:43,509
wall and like throw away all the packets

429
00:23:42,429 --> 00:23:44,469
that were in the queue when you change

430
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,479
the settings or something like that

431
00:23:44,469 --> 00:23:50,139
which usually causes congestion value of

432
00:23:46,479 --> 00:23:53,139
them still completely haywire yes

433
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:54,819
that's possibly something that it might

434
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,248
be worth asking the math Hadji list

435
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:59,079
because that maybe some other students

436
00:23:57,249 --> 00:24:00,819
who've been doing evaluations and

437
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:02,649
testing for this so some things there

438
00:24:00,819 --> 00:24:05,918
might have some experience the other

439
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:07,748
thing we found is that a lot of both the

440
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,440
algorithms and the test cases are

441
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:13,569
written from the point of view of

442
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,769
endpoints whereas you know the things

443
00:24:13,569 --> 00:24:17,379
that the people who are working on it

444
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,379
are actually working on our SF use and

445
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:22,599
so I think we need to you know sometimes

446
00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:24,968
you get things like where the algorithms

447
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,349
will say okay when when this happens

448
00:24:24,969 --> 00:24:28,690
tell being coder to send more and I

449
00:24:26,349 --> 00:24:34,029
can't do that I'm in SF you so I think

450
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:36,849
sort of more you know clarity somewhere

451
00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,859
on you know how you know how it Asif you

452
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:43,079
should behave and how it asks if you

453
00:24:38,859 --> 00:24:43,079
should be tested would be helpful to us

454
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:57,749
okay thank you all right anything else

455
00:24:50,289 --> 00:24:57,749
before we move on okay

456
00:24:57,970 --> 00:25:08,889
so next up is cha-ching I believe okay

457
00:25:06,669 --> 00:25:11,230
stretching that should be a slides up it

458
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:13,479
in if you can see them yes I can see it

459
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:16,419
well just checking if the room can hear

460
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:19,299
my audio going through fine yes very

461
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:22,539
clearly okay great yeah so and this will

462
00:25:19,299 --> 00:25:24,580
be an update on the NADA evaluation

463
00:25:22,539 --> 00:25:27,460
results following the most recent

464
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,500
version of the draft and also somewhat

465
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:32,710
updated implementation in the an

466
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:35,100
open-source firefox browser and next

467
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:35,100
slide please

468
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,700
in terms of the draft the main update is

469
00:25:39,159 --> 00:25:44,950
really a recent sort of back to back to

470
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,009
version updates to address and comments

471
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:50,500
from both the gen art and sex sexy

472
00:25:48,009 --> 00:25:52,299
direct I don't know last car reviews as

473
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:54,309
well as the tele chat and reviews

474
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:56,740
basically right now the draft is in the

475
00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:59,408
editors queue and most of the changes to

476
00:25:56,740 --> 00:26:02,200
the draft are mostly editorial in the

477
00:25:59,409 --> 00:26:04,480
sense of trying to either be more

478
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:06,429
inclusive or you know trying to eat and

479
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,980
revise these discussions for more

480
00:26:06,429 --> 00:26:11,139
clarity and there's no algorithmic

481
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:13,029
changes for the draft and also the

482
00:26:11,139 --> 00:26:14,830
details of the revisions were summarized

483
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:17,110
on the mailing list one we have in

484
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:19,509
version updates so folks are you know

485
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:21,570
feel free to check them out and I think

486
00:26:19,509 --> 00:26:25,720
usually the diff view also gives very

487
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:28,830
quick and concise comparison of revision

488
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,330
updates and next one please and

489
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,820
implementation wise and compared to the

490
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:35,710
last round of our presentation we have

491
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,379
updated our implementation to now

492
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:41,590
include all the our following algorithm

493
00:26:38,379 --> 00:26:45,129
features and in this updated version of

494
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:47,199
implementation that includes the mapping

495
00:26:45,129 --> 00:26:49,719
the nonlinear delay warping mapping in

496
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,179
DES to the congestion signal as well as

497
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,759
incorporating lost as part of the

498
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:57,549
congestion signal penalties so this way

499
00:26:54,759 --> 00:27:00,129
the evaluation results I show today do

500
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:02,230
reflect all the features that's kind of

501
00:27:00,129 --> 00:27:06,639
bells and whistles that's in the draft

502
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:08,740
the other thing the other and things are

503
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:11,299
mostly for inconvenience we basically

504
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,200
added similar locking mechanisms

505
00:27:11,299 --> 00:27:18,980
the default rate adaptation modular and

506
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:21,919
inside the web RTC modular so this way

507
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,529
basically one we can do comparison we

508
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:27,350
can have similar locking for for

509
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:30,200
comparison of stats and we also enabled

510
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:32,658
my colleague Sergio he worked on being

511
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,330
an enabling on-the-fly switching between

512
00:27:32,659 --> 00:27:37,700
either running the rate adaptation in

513
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,249
nada or in you know the default mode

514
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:42,320
using the browser you know sort of a

515
00:27:40,249 --> 00:27:44,779
config panel so that just made our

516
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,428
evaluation effort a bit easier instead

517
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:49,100
of having to recompile most different

518
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:52,669
versions of the same code and then I

519
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:56,570
provided a link on kind of the current

520
00:27:52,669 --> 00:27:59,379
version of the code this is basically a

521
00:27:56,570 --> 00:28:04,850
branch that I fought off the web RTC

522
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:08,119
the the Firefox entire browser code and

523
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:09,619
we added the pasta the navigate

524
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:11,209
adaptation modular there we actually

525
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:13,070
have two versions we have post the

526
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:15,559
ground truth based version which is

527
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,320
somewhat more like a fallback if you

528
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,840
don't have the updated version of the

529
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,299
transport feedback or the one-way delay

530
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,908
based nada which reflects better all the

531
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:27,619
features in the draft and it's become

532
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,299
people feel free to go check out the

533
00:28:27,619 --> 00:28:34,249
code you know sort of take a look at the

534
00:28:29,299 --> 00:28:36,499
code to next slide please so in terms of

535
00:28:34,249 --> 00:28:38,779
evaluation results in this round we

536
00:28:36,499 --> 00:28:41,149
basically took the feedback we gathered

537
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:43,820
from our previous presentation in the

538
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:46,639
sense that previously when we presented

539
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:49,668
results book will always have

540
00:28:46,639 --> 00:28:51,949
bi-directional cause and always compared

541
00:28:49,669 --> 00:28:54,139
the forward direction versus the reverse

542
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:56,239
direction because the sender's were

543
00:28:54,139 --> 00:28:59,209
running different algorithms now that

544
00:28:56,239 --> 00:29:01,100
was is a chrome and people were having

545
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,950
some concerns about the they don't

546
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,580
necessarily follow the same path so the

547
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,769
results I'm presenting today although we

548
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:11,989
still set up bi-directional calls and

549
00:29:09,769 --> 00:29:14,690
all the performance metrics basically

550
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:17,869
all the monitoring logs come from the

551
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,700
the direction from client a to B and we

552
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:21,859
switch back and forth between the

553
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:24,370
default behavior versus the nagas based

554
00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:26,470
great adaptation and

555
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:29,168
as mentioned before for convenience with

556
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:32,289
both added logging on the sender site to

557
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:34,450
gather feedback from the receiver as

558
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:37,559
well as per packet feedback information

559
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:40,360
which is embedded in this kind of this

560
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:43,510
new form of transport which Chrome

561
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:46,330
already supports and the other may be

562
00:29:43,510 --> 00:29:49,090
side note is therefore nada the

563
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:50,949
algorithm we do impose possib mixed max

564
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:54,309
and minimum grades for the rate

565
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:57,970
adaptation where as per my observation i

566
00:29:54,309 --> 00:30:00,460
haven't observed a clear rate boundary

567
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:04,770
for the default option and we set the

568
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:08,350
default resolution to 720p so with that

569
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:10,418
and then only on the side and since we

570
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,639
do gather all the logging information on

571
00:30:10,419 --> 00:30:14,890
the sender using our own code we also

572
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,929
try to corroborate that information by

573
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:19,330
taking screenshots on the receiver

574
00:30:16,929 --> 00:30:21,789
because chrome the web art web RTC

575
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,299
internals tab do provide you with

576
00:30:21,789 --> 00:30:27,039
figures of various metrics of interest

577
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,230
so with that we can probably now start

578
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,539
taking a collection taking a look at

579
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:37,510
some of the evaluation results question

580
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:38,770
yes please so you modified Firefox to

581
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:41,740
support transport so you see because I

582
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:43,960
know by default it does not and that's

583
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:47,860
right that was I believe that's the

584
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:50,559
fruit of one hackathon maybe a few few

585
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:53,020
meetings away it was mostly work from

586
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,210
another co-author and Sergio may not

587
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,980
he's due to timezone difference is not

588
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:59,860
attending the meeting today he was

589
00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:01,919
mostly working with a neo from Mozilla

590
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,570
if I remember correctly so they do have

591
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,659
basically they enabled a transfer CC

592
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:09,939
inside the Firefox yeah so we're

593
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:11,620
building upon that yeah and chrome

594
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:14,380
already supports it so it works well for

595
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,449
us yeah the other thing I want to call

596
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:18,789
out is that this type of feedback the

597
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:23,110
default interval seems to be at 50

598
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:24,370
milliseconds sort of a 150 millisecond

599
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:26,168
would you get a feedback and the

600
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:28,899
feedback information in that's per

601
00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:30,970
packet sort of acknowledgments yeah

602
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:32,860
information so that's very we basically

603
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,169
have all information we need for running

604
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,168
the the another algorithm

605
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:43,930
great great so we can move on next slide

606
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:45,970
and I just want to mention as I

607
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:48,550
mentioned before now we're focusing the

608
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,780
comparison along one direction so at

609
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,879
least hopefully you know between the

610
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,540
same sender and receiver they follow the

611
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,480
same path we still count really to

612
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,580
idealize comparison so what we do is we

613
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,800
try two different mechanisms one is

614
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:05,110
back-to-back sessions so basically we're

615
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:07,210
on one car using the default for

616
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:09,399
immediately followed by another car of

617
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:11,710
similar duration use another the other

618
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,200
thing we do is that we also try a little

619
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:16,630
bit about running two parallel sessions

620
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,310
between the sender and the receiver one

621
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:21,160
of them running nada the other one run

622
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:23,230
in c4 so this way at least we subject

623
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:26,200
them to the same path and any loss in

624
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:28,240
delay pattern and we also get observed a

625
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,730
little bit about how Nava competes

626
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:35,920
against another default web RTC cop so

627
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:38,800
in terms of evaluation scenarios are

628
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:41,080
representing two different settings in

629
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,090
one setting it is a car between I'm

630
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,310
based here in Austin Texas

631
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:47,949
so the sender is based in Austin Texas

632
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:49,899
and the receiver is based in California

633
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:53,170
so it's a kind of a cross continental or

634
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:56,290
putting the US units are domestic long

635
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:58,720
distance car the other one is between

636
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:02,590
Austin and Europe basically between my

637
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,840
side and my colleague Sergio basting he

638
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:07,360
was taking those costs from Spain so

639
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,909
that you would you guys would see that

640
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:12,280
it would involve a somewhat longer and

641
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:13,870
wrong to delay baseline round-trip delay

642
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,670
for the past so these are the two

643
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:17,500
settings for each of the setting we

644
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:20,560
tribals the back-to-back session and

645
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:23,520
arrows worth it we're looking at four

646
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:28,000
set of comparison results you feel like

647
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:31,629
we can move on to the next slide so this

648
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,980
one for back to back I'm I thought it

649
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:35,410
would be easier so even though we do

650
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,180
default first followed by nada I thought

651
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:39,520
it would be easier to show both of them

652
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:43,930
side by side for maybe for ease of

653
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,960
comparison so we have both the rates the

654
00:33:43,930 --> 00:33:50,650
delay and the packet loss ratio for the

655
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,790
rate the blue lines show the target rate

656
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:54,190
calculated

657
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:58,720
the read adaptation algorithm whereas

658
00:33:54,190 --> 00:34:01,870
the blue the red dots are d and kind of

659
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,850
the measured acknowledged rate based on

660
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,469
the per packet feedback information and

661
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,839
the read great are calculated using a

662
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,490
interval of 200 milliseconds so they're

663
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:15,070
somewhat noisy or compared to the

664
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:18,339
calculation of the target rate the

665
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:22,419
middle two graphs show the round-trip

666
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:24,730
time and delay granter time map and

667
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,379
Ingrid and the queuing delay which is

668
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:28,750
kind of derived from within the

669
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:33,010
algorithm by subtracting out the long

670
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:36,460
term baseline one-way delayed and is in

671
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,980
blue and the the final two graphs show

672
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:41,679
the in kind of the instantaneous packet

673
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:45,310
loss rates basically we take the packet

674
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:47,830
loss rate within a window of you know

675
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:50,409
the 15-minute second the feedback look

676
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:54,130
at the gap in any sequence number and

677
00:34:50,409 --> 00:34:56,200
also try to do a temporal smoothing but

678
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:57,670
still we do see that even the losses

679
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:00,399
don't occur all the time when they do

680
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:02,260
occur they can be quite spiky so these

681
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,430
are the three sets of metrics that we

682
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,830
keep track of maybe the main observation

683
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,649
and here in the bottom I list out the

684
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,360
kind of the baseline are Kiki we observe

685
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:16,450
which is the minimum our T key over the

686
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:19,600
path which is around 16 in a second

687
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:22,240
between Austin and California and the

688
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:25,180
maximum are T key we observe is around

689
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,729
2.2 seconds so one things to queue up

690
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,589
apparently some of our routers along the

691
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:32,200
way have a deep use yeah

692
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:34,720
so with that maybe the main observation

693
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,640
I want to call out on this slide is that

694
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,609
obviously they are back-to-back so we

695
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,390
don't really have a exact comparison but

696
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:45,010
maybe qualitatively we still see and the

697
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,410
kind of the amount of losses the

698
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,980
experience are similar they have spread

699
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:51,879
the experiment sporadic and sort of

700
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,010
hiccups over the network

701
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:58,030
the default algorithm seems to be a

702
00:35:54,010 --> 00:36:00,580
little bit more so one day when they

703
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,380
back off and taken ramp up again it

704
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,720
takes a bit longer time and they also

705
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:08,330
incur they actually incur

706
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:11,390
a little bit less and delay so somewhat

707
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:14,210
less aggressive whereas the nada core

708
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:16,339
what we do notice is that it's very fast

709
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,860
to ramp up and whenever there's a hiccup

710
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:23,900
it recovers from the hiccup quite and

711
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:25,970
fast and so and interestingly even

712
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:29,540
though these two cars are between two

713
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,669
sort of enterprise offices but turns out

714
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:34,550
the Wi-Fi situation can be quite noisy

715
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:37,930
and busy and between both offices yeah

716
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,520
so next one please

717
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:42,950
so firmed so this is from the same

718
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,150
experiment I'm just showing the

719
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:49,220
screenshots captured from Chrome browser

720
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:53,330
for for each of the sessions more as a

721
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:57,200
corroboration and I guess qualitatively

722
00:36:53,330 --> 00:37:01,130
the kind of poster rate profile as well

723
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,799
as the frame per second to reflect the

724
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:05,090
rate we have measured internally at the

725
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,330
sender so these are really all

726
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:10,490
corroboration thoughts to make sure that

727
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:16,490
our locking mechanism is not broken

728
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:18,919
yeah next one so under the same setting

729
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,529
we now have two cores and side-by-sides

730
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:23,300
and post the default and neither they

731
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,400
actually share the past and over the

732
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:28,250
same time that's why if you take a look

733
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,150
at both the delay and the packet loss

734
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:34,040
ratio we do see very synchronized

735
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:37,130
behavior which is not surprising at all

736
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,920
and again you know occasional delay

737
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,850
spikes in this one so in this one and

738
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,240
the I guess the red the red dots of the

739
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:46,220
naba

740
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,410
car in terms of how much weight actually

741
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,919
gets through is a little bit hidden

742
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:54,649
behind the blue health busy lines but

743
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,350
it's sort of mostly there so there's one

744
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,870
big dip between 0 and 100 secondly but

745
00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:02,330
after that it it must of the time it

746
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:04,609
sustains quite well whereas the default

747
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:06,710
car took a bit longer to thing uh sort

748
00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:08,720
of a greater share of the bandwidth it

749
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:11,330
also does not seem to be a case where

750
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,089
the pendulous is fully limited because

751
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:18,160
most both of the cards are operating

752
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:19,890
more or less as at the maximum sort of

753
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,819
available

754
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:26,879
bit rate of 2.5 micro per second for

755
00:38:23,819 --> 00:38:29,119
instance doings 300 and 400 during that

756
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,210
period yeah

757
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,819
next slide please yes searching is a

758
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:38,819
little the red and the red dots

759
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:42,869
underneath the blue is the the line

760
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:45,630
stable funada and it is mostly stable

761
00:38:42,869 --> 00:38:48,839
after I would say after a hundred second

762
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:54,029
so there was a big dip between 0 and 100

763
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:57,359
second we can see a little bit from yeah

764
00:38:54,029 --> 00:39:00,329
sort of uh seeing's and it's cool yeah

765
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,058
after that it's quite stable we can also

766
00:39:00,329 --> 00:39:07,680
see those rate profiles in the next

767
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:12,569
slide reported by chrome yep okay yes

768
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,730
yeah one thing I'm not sure is and

769
00:39:12,569 --> 00:39:17,519
what's the kind of the measurement and

770
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:19,140
interval of these bytes received person

771
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,609
by the way everything is price receives

772
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,129
all the numbers would need to be

773
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:25,769
multiplied by 82 corroboree with the

774
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,109
numbers in a previous page I'm not too

775
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:32,459
sure about at what time interval day and

776
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:35,910
they sort of measure rate yeah but other

777
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:39,960
than that both kind of both the rate and

778
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:43,078
the resolution and frame rate do sort of

779
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,119
correspond to what we observe in the

780
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:51,269
center side in terms of the acknowledged

781
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:52,920
received rate next slide so for this

782
00:39:51,269 --> 00:39:54,390
round offer I thought it would be also

783
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,390
interesting to since we're mostly

784
00:39:54,390 --> 00:40:00,058
interested in reducing latency or at

785
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,980
least confining latency for conferencing

786
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:05,490
course so what I did is I basically

787
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,920
plotted out the CDF of the queuing delay

788
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,589
from each of the sessions and put them

789
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,740
side-by-side for both the back-to-back

790
00:40:10,589 --> 00:40:17,038
session and the parallel session to form

791
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:18,769
a comparison I called out some numbers

792
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:20,640
here but I think maybe the main

793
00:40:18,769 --> 00:40:23,609
observation for this round is that

794
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,650
there's not really a main advantage of

795
00:40:23,609 --> 00:40:27,660
the not a scheme with respect to the

796
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:29,400
default in fact for the back-to-back

797
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:33,058
session since it was a little bit more

798
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,750
aggressive it does it actually in you

799
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:36,570
know service

800
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:40,320
EF is somewhat worse compared to the

801
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:44,880
blood curve but that's sad we can also

802
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:48,000
see that if you take a look at 95th

803
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,950
percentile of queuing delay we can limit

804
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,860
it below a hundred millisecond for sure

805
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:54,779
and and that's that's a I guess that's a

806
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,780
good news post for the default option as

807
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,260
well as for another so next we can move

808
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:04,310
on to the cross and cross Atlantic cars

809
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:08,100
so first one is back-to-back

810
00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:09,960
back-to-back cars so again this is maybe

811
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:15,900
as a reminder this is between Austin

812
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:18,330
Texas and Valencia in Spain and here in

813
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:20,120
general for this round of experiments I

814
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:23,340
we observe a little bit less

815
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:26,609
interruption sort of hiccups over the

816
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:29,840
network ironically this this set of

817
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:32,580
results I was sending from my home using

818
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:35,790
Wi-Fi and then backed off by a Google

819
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:38,279
Fiber so it might be quieter compared to

820
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:40,590
an enterprise environment so with that

821
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,420
we see the similar behavior as we can

822
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:45,720
see before for the default algorithm

823
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,660
well if it does experience a delay spike

824
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,180
then it will take a you know sort of on

825
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:52,440
the order of tens of seconds to blend up

826
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,810
whereas in nada

827
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,840
even though it is subject to similar

828
00:41:54,810 --> 00:42:00,350
types of delay spikes the the ramped up

829
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:03,870
back is much faster because of the

830
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:06,390
accelerated ramp up feature in the grid

831
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:09,990
adaptation algorithm the other thing you

832
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:13,350
might notice is that there is a kind of

833
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:15,689
a floor of the rancher time around 190

834
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:18,000
mini seconds so then you know all the

835
00:42:15,690 --> 00:42:20,760
red curves are kind of floating above

836
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,360
the blue ones for for this set of

837
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,420
results and for for plotting purposes

838
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,870
all the delay and graphs are kept at 600

839
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,720
but as reported below and some of the

840
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:38,029
spikes actually reach as high as 4.5

841
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:41,580
seconds in terms of round-trip time and

842
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:44,810
next one so similar

843
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:47,880
kiryl screenshots to corroborate our

844
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:53,299
observations yeah interesting

845
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:53,300
for this round and even though we see

846
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:59,570
okay

847
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:02,640
I'm not yeah I'm not too sure the

848
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:06,620
screenshots for the default behavior

849
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,620
because it seems to be a little bit

850
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:13,020
different from from yeah basically the

851
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:15,480
the previous well no I think it's right

852
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,590
so yeah basically we have two tips in

853
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,510
the and default algorithm and then I

854
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:26,010
guess this could shopped missed the

855
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:28,620
second second ramp up duration for for

856
00:43:26,010 --> 00:43:30,780
that one yeah folder for the second

857
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:32,750
grandpa so it's not qualitatively

858
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:37,470
corresponding as well yeah

859
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:40,320
next next one now so this is in peril of

860
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:42,899
the default comparing against them sort

861
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,120
of competing against nada in parallel so

862
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,850
again we can see that both the delay and

863
00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:50,450
the packet loss observations from both

864
00:43:47,850 --> 00:43:53,880
of the floors are very comparable and

865
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:56,879
for the default algorithm even though

866
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,160
their target rate can sometimes ramp up

867
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,110
very high and go back and forth the

868
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:03,149
actual received rate is quite stable

869
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:07,560
whereas for nada we see very similar

870
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:16,110
behavior as before and next slide is for

871
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:19,020
the chrome observation and there was one

872
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:21,540
figure that we forgot to capture so I no

873
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:24,420
longer have a bit rate but other than

874
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:28,230
that we see for instance the chrome

875
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:30,690
reported bit rate for the for the

876
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:32,730
default algorithm one thing to note is

877
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:35,520
that it is actually kind of below

878
00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:40,230
basically typically the max trade is as

879
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:42,509
300 K bytes per second so this one the

880
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:45,330
received rates for default algorithm is

881
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:48,150
quite stable but stays somewhat lower

882
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:50,970
than its full potential and the NADA

883
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:54,810
graph we don't have the reach figure but

884
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:56,640
judging from the from the frame rate and

885
00:44:54,810 --> 00:44:59,310
height we see that there was one sort of

886
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,740
dip in kind of the beginning part of the

887
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:03,180
call and for the rest it was quite an

888
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,729
stay

889
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:08,609
next slide shows the comparison of the

890
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:10,859
queuing delay so for this round for both

891
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:12,630
of the back-to-back session and the

892
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,848
parallel sessions we do see an

893
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:17,789
improvement in terms of the queuing

894
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:20,609
delay distribution of nada with respect

895
00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:24,089
to the default algorithm I suspect part

896
00:45:20,609 --> 00:45:28,170
of it is sort of attributed to the kind

897
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:31,890
of the big spikes and then the low ramp

898
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:34,589
up time and so overall if we look at and

899
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:37,200
of their personal numbers for the the

900
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:39,150
blue nada stream and it's also quite

901
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,759
good it's actually interestingly for

902
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:43,589
this cross-continental sorry

903
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:46,500
cross-atlantic car if we're looking at

904
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:49,640
queuing delay just because the center

905
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:52,500
side is in a more in a less noisy

906
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:54,089
wireless environment this performance is

907
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,359
actually better than the previous one so

908
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:59,910
it's not really dominated by the past

909
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:03,630
arty keys were mostly measuring to

910
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:06,359
yelling here I think that's the end of

911
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:08,970
our my observation slides so in summary

912
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:11,670
I think maybe some of the consistent

913
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:13,919
observations is that the proposed

914
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:16,980
another algorithm and do have a fast

915
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,569
initial ramp up to achieve the maximum

916
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,119
allowed grades and typically that's

917
00:46:18,569 --> 00:46:23,788
within a few second whereas the default

918
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:26,490
algorithm if it does go down it can take

919
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:28,799
on the order of tens of seconds and it

920
00:46:26,490 --> 00:46:31,288
can recover and the proposed nada or

921
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:34,559
some can recover quickly from temporary

922
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:36,720
losses and queuing delay spikes it seems

923
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:39,869
to be quite robust to hiccups in the

924
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:43,230
network and it can effectively limits

925
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:45,329
the queuing delay build up sort of a

926
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:48,150
yeah I wanted to put in some numbers

927
00:46:45,329 --> 00:46:50,660
like nineteen percent out and queuing

928
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:54,299
delay is below a hundred milliseconds

929
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:57,450
and it does not really start the

930
00:46:54,299 --> 00:47:00,000
complete competing WebRTC flows so what

931
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:02,939
we put both of them side-by-side so at

932
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:05,490
least I'm not too sure I think the

933
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:07,470
environment we test is probably not a

934
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:10,200
bandwidth limited environment given that

935
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,240
both my home Wi-Fi connection is quite

936
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:14,839
sufficient and obviously enterprise

937
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,060
network it can be busy but it's probably

938
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:19,550
bandwidth limiting so in those

939
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:21,140
environments we don't really starve a

940
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:25,130
competing call so that's probably

941
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:28,069
relatively safe to mirrors early point

942
00:47:25,130 --> 00:47:30,500
or concern about how you know how it

943
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,140
works against existing traffic over the

944
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:35,210
Internet and for further investigations

945
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,640
the main things of interest would

946
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:39,140
probably to try it out over bandwidth

947
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:41,420
limited connections there were some

948
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:43,310
suggestion about try it out over LTE

949
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:46,730
links that we haven't got a chance to

950
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:48,320
fully investigate on and we're also

951
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:50,870
interested in understanding kind of

952
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:53,060
coexistence of if we have multiple cars

953
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:55,730
running our algorithm how it works that

954
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:58,220
is that something we can we'll be able

955
00:47:55,730 --> 00:48:00,290
to get evaluation results on even using

956
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:02,270
our existing setup and the other thing

957
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:04,450
of interest would be to try it out with

958
00:48:02,270 --> 00:48:08,690
running some kind of a TCP like

959
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:11,240
background long lasting the file

960
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,460
transfer type of traffic so that's kind

961
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,040
of the update I have for for this

962
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:19,640
meeting for the matter of person posting

963
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:22,190
terms of evaluation and kind of some

964
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:26,170
additional ideas I'm also here to maybe

965
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:30,310
gather further feedback and suggestions

966
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:37,790
thank you okay thank you any questions

967
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:41,470
searching what are the plans for trying

968
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:44,420
this out in real production traffic

969
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:47,689
sorry yeah so that was the question I

970
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:52,240
asked in the very beginning frankly

971
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:55,610
speaking we we currently don't have any

972
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:58,160
we haven't laid out a plan to try it out

973
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,870
in a large-scale deployment yet that's

974
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:02,270
something obviously were we would be

975
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:04,970
very interested in gather results on but

976
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:06,770
also like these are the type of tests we

977
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,990
I drunk we can I wrong with my

978
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:10,970
colleagues kind of manually and I find

979
00:49:08,990 --> 00:49:12,649
them to be here always surprising me

980
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,870
thinking bloggers have you know a little

981
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:17,390
bit awkward yeah so that's another thing

982
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,190
we're very much interested in yeah

983
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:21,500
either like learning from maybe Forks

984
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:27,350
like you guys and understanding how to

985
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:28,420
set it up or or yeah or you know maybe

986
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:31,538
collaborating this piece

987
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:37,240
yeah so I'm quite open to suggestions -

988
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:42,670
yeah my other question is in slide 11 if

989
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:45,729
you can go back to that I noticed that

990
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:49,240
on the top left side in the default case

991
00:49:45,730 --> 00:49:51,760
the acknowledged trait is very higher as

992
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:55,000
compared to the target rate do you know

993
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:58,000
why that oh no I think you so the blue

994
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:00,579
curve is the target rate the red dots

995
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,769
are here acknowledged rate we basically

996
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:06,940
measure based on per packet feedback and

997
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:10,479
average kind of gear side entry levels

998
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:11,799
are incorrect yet oh okay sorry about it

999
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,990
yeah okay

1000
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:18,759
yeah I think I changed color later ah

1001
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:22,390
yeah this is I use from in u.s. have you

1002
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:24,849
tried evaluating different combinations

1003
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,098
of default and not applause so let's say

1004
00:50:24,849 --> 00:50:33,190
you have multiple flows and 30% of them

1005
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:35,380
are default and 70% are nada no I mean

1006
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:37,539
to be honest this and the parallel

1007
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:39,549
setting is the only one we tried and mix

1008
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:43,569
well make sure meaning one versus one

1009
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:45,940
that's I guess that goes back to the

1010
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:48,400
question of a larger scale deployments

1011
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:50,019
if we get to let's say configure I guess

1012
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,880
the ideal case is that if we get to

1013
00:50:50,019 --> 00:50:53,680
configure you know different browsers

1014
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:55,660
running different traffic then we'll get

1015
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,640
to look at the mix that would be much

1016
00:50:55,660 --> 00:51:01,058
more interesting yeah but we don't have

1017
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:04,420
results on percentage wise comparison

1018
00:51:01,059 --> 00:51:07,119
yeah I think the percentage wise

1019
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,430
comparison results would be helpful

1020
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:12,240
because they would actually help you see

1021
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:15,879
that if you have most of you a battery

1022
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:19,269
RTC traffic or changing to nada what can

1023
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:20,079
you expect a network to change in so I

1024
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:24,640
see I see

1025
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:26,980
so your so ok thank you thank you

1026
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:29,019
I am I guess is that churching would be

1027
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:31,440
interested in collaborating if you wish

1028
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:31,439
to try this

1029
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:40,870
okay thank you I think that was a very

1030
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,520
interesting presentation it seems to be

1031
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:45,190
pretty stable it seems to compete pretty

1032
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:48,400
well with the earth flows that seems to

1033
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:52,060
be pretty nice behavior so thank you

1034
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:58,660
very much thank you are there any other

1035
00:51:52,060 --> 00:52:00,130
questions okay

1036
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:07,470
in which case I press the red button and

1037
00:52:00,130 --> 00:52:07,470
see if you disappear nothing happens

1038
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:17,080
don't know there we go all right okay so

1039
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:20,050
the only other thing we have on the

1040
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:22,450
agenda for today is a very brief update

1041
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:26,860
on the on the congestion control

1042
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:29,470
feedback draft from myself so this is a

1043
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:33,160
draft which started out in this group we

1044
00:52:29,470 --> 00:52:35,799
had a design team in this group for

1045
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:39,060
quite a while and then it moved over to

1046
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:41,260
a VT core and has been developed there

1047
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:44,700
and it's work that I've been doing along

1048
00:52:41,260 --> 00:52:47,830
with ahead Varun and Michael Ramallah

1049
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:50,680
the draft seemed pretty stable that the

1050
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:52,509
format hasn't changed for a reasonable

1051
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:56,020
length of time and there's been only

1052
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:58,510
details for quite a while now since the

1053
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:01,870
last meeting the only update has been to

1054
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:04,000
expand the design rationale section we

1055
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:05,799
had an action item to explain how this

1056
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,740
relates to the the other congestion

1057
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:11,710
control feedback mechanisms so that

1058
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:13,839
there were two two two two changes that

1059
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:15,750
there was a small ones just a dimension

1060
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:19,990
of the receiver estimated maximum

1061
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:22,960
bitrate option as draft already mentions

1062
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:25,720
the the timber mechanism forth for

1063
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,040
signaling the feedback and the the arian

1064
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,200
be seems to be a very similar mechanism

1065
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,600
so so I just added that in the same

1066
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,480
section to say it behaves broadly

1067
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:36,549
similarly and that there are details but

1068
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,140
but they you know the level of

1069
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,870
comparison we're looking at here they

1070
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:42,600
didn't make a whole lot of difference

1071
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:45,339
and they also added a paragraph

1072
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:47,109
discussing the relation to the the

1073
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:49,420
transfer wide

1074
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:52,420
just control extensions in the whole my

1075
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,339
drift now what that graph does is it

1076
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,829
adds an a TP header extension to each

1077
00:53:54,339 --> 00:53:58,538
packet to give a single consistent

1078
00:53:56,829 --> 00:54:02,589
sequence number across all the packets

1079
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:06,400
sent and then reports feedback based on

1080
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:07,869
those sequence numbers and then differs

1081
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,059
from the mechanism in this draft which

1082
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:12,309
uses the existing sequence numbers in

1083
00:54:10,059 --> 00:54:16,299
the packets and then reports per SSRC

1084
00:54:12,309 --> 00:54:18,480
the loss for each sequence number and

1085
00:54:16,299 --> 00:54:20,920
the the paragraph just explains that

1086
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,289
essentially the difference is that if

1087
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,230
you add this header extension you get an

1088
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:29,079
extra eight bytes per packet over

1089
00:54:26,230 --> 00:54:31,180
overhead in that format but it reduces

1090
00:54:29,079 --> 00:54:35,410
the size of the feedback packets

1091
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:38,259
slightly and if your goal is to do a

1092
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:40,058
rate calculation for the whole flow then

1093
00:54:38,259 --> 00:54:41,529
this simplifies the calculation because

1094
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:44,289
you're getting feedback for the flow as

1095
00:54:41,529 --> 00:54:46,809
a whole if your goal is to do rate

1096
00:54:44,289 --> 00:54:50,130
calculations per SSRC then obviously the

1097
00:54:46,809 --> 00:54:52,630
format which reports per SSRC is simpler

1098
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:55,920
so that's that's that the fundamental

1099
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:57,730
trade-off here it's trading off hetero

1100
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,049
additional header overheads for

1101
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:05,650
simplicity if you're doing your

1102
00:55:01,049 --> 00:55:07,390
aggregate level congestion control it

1103
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,029
also we also note that the transfer

1104
00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:12,730
white feedback on a per SSRC basis is

1105
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:14,950
perhaps a more natural fit for RTP since

1106
00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:18,039
everything else in RTP is done per SS I

1107
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:21,098
see where as this aggregate feedback in

1108
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:22,539
here in the header extensions it you

1109
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:24,339
know I mean it can clearly be made to

1110
00:55:22,539 --> 00:55:29,529
work but it fits less naturally into the

1111
00:55:24,339 --> 00:55:31,839
framework so we added that description

1112
00:55:29,529 --> 00:55:33,789
and made the usual set of updates to

1113
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:38,558
references comes in details that sort of

1114
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:40,420
thing Jonathan yeah drugs I mean I think

1115
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:43,779
the way I just experiment that last

1116
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:45,009
point fitting more naturally is if we

1117
00:55:43,779 --> 00:55:47,200
ever actually get to a point where we

1118
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:52,119
want to have multi-point congestion

1119
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:54,038
control obvious having you know not that

1120
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:56,259
anybody's working on that algorithm it's

1121
00:55:54,039 --> 00:55:59,109
a really hard problem but had this the

1122
00:55:56,259 --> 00:56:00,279
CCF V feedback is much more natural

1123
00:55:59,109 --> 00:56:01,000
because if you have multiple senders

1124
00:56:00,279 --> 00:56:03,430
into the

1125
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,380
then obviously their their sequence them

1126
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:06,848
and they have each have a transport wide

1127
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:08,950
sequence number though those sequence

1128
00:56:06,849 --> 00:56:10,869
numbers will collide whereas druid next

1129
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:14,259
thing them per SRC it just falls out

1130
00:56:10,869 --> 00:56:16,990
naturally yes yes process as he gives

1131
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:19,240
you more flexibility for topologies yeah

1132
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:20,950
yeah well just in general if you more

1133
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,439
flexibility because it makes it easy to

1134
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:25,180
treat each flow separately if you want

1135
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,440
that flexibility that's a win if you're

1136
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:30,700
looking to treat the aggregates as a

1137
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:32,080
whole then you have to you have to map

1138
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:38,859
it back to a single sequence number

1139
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:41,020
space yeah so that's basically all I had

1140
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:44,020
to say as I said we believe this draft

1141
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,550
is stable it will be discussed any AVT

1142
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,440
core on Friday

1143
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:50,560
the presentation for me that I will give

1144
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,359
an AV took in a VT core is identical to

1145
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:58,060
this one except that this slide will say

1146
00:56:52,359 --> 00:57:08,799
please can we issue a less call anything

1147
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:11,560
else on this drift okay that takes us to

1148
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:14,080
the end of the agenda I don't know if

1149
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:20,170
anyone remote has anything they wish to

1150
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:22,000
bring up it's always finish there's

1151
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:29,650
anything from anyone in the room who

1152
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:32,940
