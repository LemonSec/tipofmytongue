2
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:12,039
[Music]

3
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,529
[Music]

4
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,449
[Music]

5
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,390
yeah

6
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,530
[Music]

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:24,820
okay we are going to start so hello

8
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:28,720
everyone this is the cozy working group

9
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:36,930
meeting if you are expecting some other

10
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,930
meeting you're not at the right place so

11
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:48,960
do not well if you have not read it so

12
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:53,440
far please read it before commenting or

13
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:55,300
saying anything to the mic and if you

14
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:03,730
have any questions do not hesitate to

15
00:02:55,300 --> 00:03:07,870
ask the chairs or anyone else okay so

16
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:12,609
the agenda for today is first the

17
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:18,180
administrative Ian's we have passed the

18
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:23,380
blue sheets the minutes will be taken I

19
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,750
think Roman will be taking the minutes

20
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,079
first thank you

21
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:34,810
and Francesca will be our JavaScript

22
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:39,280
Thank You Francesca so we will proceed

23
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:44,050
with the document status then continue

24
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,180
with web o tenth and then we'll have

25
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:49,209
some discussion about additional core

26
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:52,660
items that have been requested and

27
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:55,900
whether there are some other algorithm

28
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:59,430
that people would like to have and then

29
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,430
we have some open mic time

30
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:09,210
is there an impassioned of the agenda

31
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:36,909
okay thank you so Jim so this is

32
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,770
probably I can only take that long so

33
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,270
we'll start with a cozy structured

34
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,270
document next please

35
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:49,780
so we finished working group last call

36
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:52,570
in September I did actually the edits to

37
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,729
it and of oast and da conversion oh six

38
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,159
updated and when I went back to

39
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:59,710
double-check earlier this month

40
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,720
I figured out that the data tracker had

41
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:04,060
the wrong version and at a point where

42
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,100
it actually had the didn't have a date

43
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:08,980
that I updated it in so I'm not too sure

44
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:13,960
what happened on the data driver that I

45
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:18,070
have a local version which has one

46
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,340
additional set of issues that came from

47
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:24,159
Lawrence where I have harmonized out the

48
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,590
difference between headers headers

49
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,830
parameters in parameter to make sure

50
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,140
that they all are consistent so header

51
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,599
by itself is no longer exists it no

52
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:37,870
longer exists is either headed of

53
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:41,280
parameters for things which are header

54
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:43,480
attributes in the cozy stuff and

55
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,150
parameter where it actually is referring

56
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:51,630
to a different type of parameter such as

57
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:56,650
a parameter in and the the NH in a mime

58
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:59,340
message so as far as I know the next

59
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:01,539
thing on the list for this document is

60
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,710
for the shepherd to get assigned a

61
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:06,010
shepherd to actually do the shepherd

62
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:08,549
right up and push the button any

63
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,550
questions

64
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,440
any questions from the room nope I think

65
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:23,450
we can go on then

66
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:26,310
okay next please oh um

67
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:28,710
the Interop status is basically the same

68
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,510
as it was at the last meeting I've been

69
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:34,739
making wine I haven't been looking at

70
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,870
trying to get any air up work done still

71
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,970
need some idea of what the iesg thinks

72
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:43,290
it wants Nord er to assess whether or

73
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:45,300
not we actually have Interop but once we

74
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:53,070
get that we I can do some sort of write

75
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:59,880
up and be fine next ok the cosy

76
00:06:53,070 --> 00:07:01,890
algorithms draft next so this document

77
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,330
went through last call at the same time

78
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:08,219
as the structured document so it

79
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:13,260
finished we have one at there's one open

80
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:16,380
issue that is in the current version of

81
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:19,020
the document boat needs to be ratified

82
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:23,310
by the working group that it actually is

83
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:24,960
what it wants to be and then the the

84
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:31,560
standard Shepherd right up and go to the

85
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:34,229
area director for publishing next so the

86
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,170
one issue that is still open and needs

87
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:39,000
to be dealt with is there was a request

88
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:41,520
from the chair is that we move the

89
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,600
capabilities work from the group ah

90
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:48,270
score documents into this document and

91
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,740
part of that means that I was going to

92
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:51,419
end up making a more general purpose

93
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:56,820
than than what they were in just that

94
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:59,040
document so I follow the same basic

95
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:00,810
structure that they had where they had a

96
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,920
set of capabilities based on the

97
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,510
algorithm and a set of capabilities

98
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:08,640
based on the key I thought and at one

99
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,230
point about combining them but I thought

100
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,760
that was probably gonna be more trouble

101
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:16,130
than it was actually worth in the long

102
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:20,539
run so the algorithms based capabilities

103
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:23,520
will always start with a key type if

104
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,910
there is actually a key that is used by

105
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,849
that

106
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:29,160
so for example a hash algorithm would

107
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:30,690
not have the key type in there because

108
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:34,140
there's no actual key used by the

109
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:37,289
algorithm you also have the ability to

110
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,830
put capabilities which are not

111
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:41,848
represented by parameters in in the

112
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,960
headers in there

113
00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,270
so one example of that is what I have

114
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,180
now for the hacks based signatures is I

115
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:54,810
actually have I was actually in in the

116
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,979
Hat and it and the key structure but the

117
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:00,719
hash which the key was based on even

118
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:04,710
though that's actually not a parameter

119
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,410
that shows up in the the cozy message

120
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:13,680
itself because it is actually encoded

121
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:16,709
into the key data there's also the key

122
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,199
based capabilities again they always

123
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,240
start with a key type because without

124
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,620
knowing that key type you don't know for

125
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,190
sure what the capabilities are supposed

126
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,950
to be in that key the assumption for

127
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:31,530
algorithms is the algorithm identifier

128
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:33,210
will always be transported someplace

129
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:36,030
else but it may be that we want to

130
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:39,200
actually put that into the into the

131
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:42,060
capability structure as well

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,180
the keys then might start with the key

133
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,729
type and then have parameters which are

134
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,489
described information about the keys

135
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:55,070
such as the curve or the hash for this

136
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:58,920
or the hash based signatures algorithm I

137
00:09:55,070 --> 00:10:00,930
attempted to minimize things so that

138
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,990
there wasn't overlap between the two of

139
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:05,910
them so in the aw score and the group ah

140
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,640
score stuff they had think of the curve

141
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:11,060
both in as per as a parameter for the

142
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,560
algorithm as a parameter for the key and

143
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:17,150
my assumption is they're gonna tend to

144
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:20,310
actually be show up in pairs or in

145
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:23,910
combinations so that you only need to

146
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:25,439
specify things once in general the one

147
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:30,360
exception that is going to be is the key

148
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,330
type and I've got a little bit of stuff

149
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,660
here for how you might do a negotiation

150
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:37,320
structure none of that is actually in

151
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,860
the dock

152
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,650
itself it is just here for people to

153
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,470
look at to see how I was thinking about

154
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,910
it might be used but I'm not making a

155
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,620
recommendation when we get the other on

156
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:55,050
that

157
00:10:48,620 --> 00:11:00,360
next please so should I ask questions

158
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:02,729
now or it's not a second so I got a set

159
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:06,960
of feedback from Francisco earlier this

160
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:10,200
week I have made a pull request which

161
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:12,450
contains responses to that and there's a

162
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,400
couple more things that she's commented

163
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:19,160
on since then and if I need to make sure

164
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,260
that people want to put the hash

165
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,410
algorithm from in in the hash signatures

166
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:27,150
capabilities it could either be in there

167
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:32,250
or it could not be in there either way

168
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:34,140
probably it will work I don't know

169
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,600
there's any other capabilities that

170
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,160
should be put into that as well I don't

171
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,720
know if Russ is in the room to comment

172
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,000
on that

173
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,770
and once we've done all that

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,630
verification I've done the updates and

175
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:51,960
I'll issue a new document okay questions

176
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:54,920
comments Francesca

177
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:59,370
so can you go back to the previous line

178
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:01,680
so as it is defined right now for the

179
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:04,170
algorithms the capability define it's

180
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,920
only the key type that goes with that

181
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:09,920
algorithm so you were saying that you do

182
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:18,420
not want to duplicate that information

183
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:22,860
right yes yeah but in the future you

184
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:25,650
could have a key type and additional

185
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,570
capabilities if the capabilities of the

186
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:30,209
key type are not enough for the

187
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:32,550
algorithm if there is something else or

188
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:35,670
different if there were other things

189
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:37,020
that were algorithm based rather than

190
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:39,839
than key based

191
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:43,380
yes at that point then I'm a bit

192
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:45,480
confused if you would because in this

193
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,160
case that we have defined right now then

194
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:48,890
you would just go and look at what are

195
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,120
the cover your disease of the key and

196
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:55,170
you would use that for the

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,670
rhythm and if we define something that

198
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:59,310
is different I don't know if these are

199
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:02,699
additional ones or would replace the one

200
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:06,920
for the key type they would be

201
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,860
additional ones for example if you did

202
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,930
the diffie-hellman key agreement once

203
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:18,060
right now we basically pack everything

204
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:21,000
together into one identifier so that

205
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:23,130
identifier describes not only whether

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,589
you're doing a femoral static but

207
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:29,189
whether you're the fact that using HK DF

208
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:32,670
for the key derivation function the fact

209
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,360
that you're doing AES 128 for the key

210
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,120
rap and the fact that using a particular

211
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,980
structure for the context one could

212
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,250
envision in the future that you might

213
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:47,600
define a diffie-hellman key where those

214
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,950
are all actually header parameters and

215
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:52,770
in that case they would go in the

216
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:55,080
algorithm based capabilities because

217
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:59,040
that is the set of things that you

218
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:01,770
expect to see yes that works for me

219
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,990
I think and for the record I review the

220
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:09,470
pull request and I'm fine with with that

221
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:09,470
so once that's merged I'm happy with it

222
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:25,380
do you want any other review of the pull

223
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:27,959
requests before merging gym or I'm

224
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:30,120
perfectly willing to merge and in the

225
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:32,729
node out and give people a day or two to

226
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:36,060
look at it before by the Shepherd review

227
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:38,550
is being written up that that makes

228
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,569
sense to me any any comments here on

229
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:45,240
that nope yep let's go ahead and merge

230
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,830
merge and publish a revision at your

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:55,220
convenience then okay I can do that next

232
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,220
please Jim just yes

233
00:14:58,310 --> 00:15:02,680
hash algorithms document next please

234
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,060
[Music]

235
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:11,300
this document has gone to working group

236
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:14,180
last call that finished on September

237
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:17,599
24th I have not gone through this

238
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:24,790
document to put in the capabilities

239
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:27,380
definitions but they're pretty simple

240
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:29,300
since is just plain hash algorithms

241
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,180
they're all going to be empty empty

242
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:37,459
array either on DME because there's not

243
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:40,040
Noth nothing relevant milkie's so I'm

244
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:43,070
planning to do that modifications and

245
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:44,959
publish that basically at the same time

246
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:51,290
the algorithm document gets updated so

247
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:53,000
by tomorrow at lunch your time and then

248
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,829
if that document should be ready for a

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,800
final review and for the Shepherd right

250
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,800
it to be done any questions about that

251
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:14,329
and there was an email from my boss I'm

252
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,070
gonna deal with that male and the new

253
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:18,070
algorithm and the additional algorithms

254
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:33,140
okay next okay i've said said that one

255
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:35,810
could do some funky things with shake i

256
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:41,170
don't actually plan to the x.509

257
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:43,969
certificates draft next right next I

258
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:45,349
have thoughts of this job document have

259
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:46,700
gone through working group last call but

260
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,959
when I went through and looks through

261
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,830
the mail I couldn't actually find that

262
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:55,520
it was ever started all the issues which

263
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:57,860
I received an email or in the database

264
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,709
have been addressed and I believe that

265
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,300
document is currently up to date so I

266
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:04,129
believe we should be ready to actually

267
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:08,680
start to working group last call on that

268
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:11,830
document yes

269
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,770
there was only one comment that there

270
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:19,240
was something like open questions or

271
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:20,980
issues in the document that you could

272
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,829
turn off and then we can start the

273
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,130
working group Lascaux I maybe I forgot

274
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:30,639
to say this explicitly sorry about that

275
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,200
I think you well we we verified that we

276
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,910
were ready for working group last fall I

277
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,410
think you just forgot to actually start

278
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:37,410
it okay

279
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,159
next actually I think that's the end um

280
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:48,220
oh okay I don't know why I left that in

281
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:49,720
there okay it's ready for working with

282
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:51,670
last of all the early code appointments

283
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,260
assignments are already done I just

284
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:59,230
didn't see that slide when I was reading

285
00:17:53,260 --> 00:18:03,760
through it next okay so that's the end

286
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,770
of that set of presentations so we're

287
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,220
running a lot we're actually running

288
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:10,570
significantly ahead the next presenter

289
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,270
was supposed to be Mike Jones he's on

290
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:15,340
his way over so Jim if you wanted to

291
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:19,870
cover the more algorithms now I think

292
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,909
that would give Mike some time okay I

293
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:28,629
have actually pushed up a more

294
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:31,210
algorithms document next it contains one

295
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:34,000
algorithm right now and that's the AES

296
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,730
padded key wrap algorithm it is

297
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,000
currently defined only as a key wrap

298
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:43,450
algorithm at the point where I talked to

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,190
Russ he wanted it to be both a here

300
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:51,610
algorithm and a content encryption

301
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:54,670
algorithm the step this the structure

302
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:58,899
document however has a statement that

303
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:05,710
says every content encryption algorithm

304
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:08,500
must be an AEA D algorithm padded key

305
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:14,140
rap is not an AEA D algorithm it is only

306
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:16,330
an eight yoga rhythm so if I was there

307
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:18,580
I'd be talking to Russ and saying do you

308
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:21,668
really need it for content encryption or

309
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:25,149
is he raps efficient

310
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:26,240
and Jim this is Russ everything's fine

311
00:19:25,149 --> 00:19:30,000
okay

312
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,000
[Laughter]

313
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:41,950
okay next so we got a piece of mail

314
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:43,329
today from Bob Moskowitz I don't

315
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,239
remember it went to the list or if it

316
00:19:43,329 --> 00:19:49,329
just went to the chairs myself saying

317
00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:50,469
that he thinks we should add the new C

318
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:54,579
HC

319
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:59,859
Shaykh algorithms to the set of

320
00:19:54,579 --> 00:20:02,739
algorithms which we have I don't have

321
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:04,570
any problems with that I don't have any

322
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:07,299
other algorithms at this point in time

323
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:13,869
to add unless people want to come up and

324
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:16,779
say I want this algorithm so I don't you

325
00:20:13,869 --> 00:20:22,299
know if we need to have a charter change

326
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:25,719
to do this draft or not I don't think so

327
00:20:22,299 --> 00:20:28,719
so if the chairs wished to I believe

328
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:33,700
they could start a an adoption call in

329
00:20:28,719 --> 00:20:36,609
this document right we will we'll double

330
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,969
check with our responsible ad to verify

331
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:41,259
that it it doesn't require recharging

332
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:42,669
and then we'll get that started once

333
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:49,209
we've had that conversation that should

334
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:51,309
be able to happen this week okay I think

335
00:20:49,209 --> 00:20:55,409
that's the end of my slide deck it is

336
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:55,408
all right and just in time

337
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,630
[Music]

338
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:31,890
okay all right

339
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:35,640
mr. Jones thank you all

340
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm here to give three slides which are

341
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:46,590
a status update about our draft defining

342
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:49,919
the identifiers used by algorithms that

343
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:53,490
were requested that we work on from the

344
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,210
w3c web authentication working group

345
00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:07,530
which is working on its second PR the

346
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:11,370
second version of the standard you just

347
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:13,770
saw on my slides by mistake so what's

348
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,860
happened since we last met our heroes in

349
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:20,490
Montreal we've had a working group last

350
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:25,168
call with substantive and useful reviews

351
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:29,809
by many parties including JC Jones and

352
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:36,450
Kevin Jacobs of Mozilla our own Jim shod

353
00:22:29,809 --> 00:22:38,760
Neo Madden and Ben Caidic I am the

354
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:43,140
co-authors addressed those working group

355
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,110
last call reviews replying to all the

356
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:49,049
comments received on our public mailing

357
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:56,699
list I will note that no normative

358
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:59,610
changes to the document resulted and per

359
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:03,030
the ITF process I think the next

360
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:06,540
question to the chairs is is it now time

361
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:10,980
for a Shepherd review to progress the

362
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:14,389
document and as a bonus question do we

363
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,390
know who the Shepherd might be

364
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:29,570
so yes I can write the Shepherd review

365
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:30,460
maybe Jim wants to say something all

366
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,779
right thank you

367
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:38,119
are there any questions from the floor

368
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:40,159
about the dog bites yes yes as far as

369
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:43,009
I'm concerned I still have one concern

370
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:47,450
that is outstanding from your document

371
00:23:43,009 --> 00:23:51,200
from the from my last call I believe you

372
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:55,159
need to describe why the approach of

373
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,349
assigning points was was used it doesn't

374
00:23:55,159 --> 00:24:01,249
need to be very long it's just I've just

375
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:07,369
wanted in the document telling me is not

376
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:10,279
sufficient okay I'm perfectly willing to

377
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:12,978
do that that issue for those of you who

378
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:16,129
may not have followed everything on the

379
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:22,239
list and Jim correct my description if

380
00:24:16,129 --> 00:24:27,908
you would like is that for both Jose and

381
00:24:22,239 --> 00:24:34,460
Jose we defined an algorithm identifier

382
00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:41,809
whose meaning is ECDSA signature with

383
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:49,460
the sec P 256 K one curve and the P R in

384
00:24:41,809 --> 00:24:53,200
the sha-256 hash algorithm this is as

385
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:56,570
it's used in practice by both jose

386
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,169
implementations and web authentication

387
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:07,129
which uses the Kozai algorithm

388
00:25:00,169 --> 00:25:10,309
identifier in Jim's useful working group

389
00:25:07,129 --> 00:25:13,988
last review comments he had asked well

390
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:20,690
why don't you just use the existing Jose

391
00:25:13,989 --> 00:25:23,649
algorithm identifier for ECDSA and part

392
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:27,649
of the answer is to be consistent with

393
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:30,119
Jose where in each case the algorithm

394
00:25:27,649 --> 00:25:32,309
identifier is specific to a

395
00:25:30,119 --> 00:25:33,928
serve so that when you look at the

396
00:25:32,309 --> 00:25:36,479
algorithm identify er you have a

397
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:39,179
complete description of what you're

398
00:25:36,479 --> 00:25:41,459
doing I and several others that I talked

399
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:44,129
to were unaware that because they didn't

400
00:25:41,459 --> 00:25:46,499
follow that route but that doesn't mean

401
00:25:44,129 --> 00:25:49,879
that for new algorithms we can't do that

402
00:25:46,499 --> 00:25:49,879
and shouldn't do it

403
00:25:50,359 --> 00:26:02,218
and so in part Jim had also asked a

404
00:25:59,579 --> 00:26:04,049
question in review in his review how do

405
00:26:02,219 --> 00:26:06,869
you know if somebody has changed the

406
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:09,179
curve on the key that you're presented

407
00:26:06,869 --> 00:26:12,059
and the good news is that if you have

408
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:16,769
this because a algorithm identifier that

409
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:19,829
is key and or that is curved and hash

410
00:26:16,769 --> 00:26:22,049
specific you can tell if somebody's

411
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:26,579
changed it if you're just using a

412
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:28,799
general ECDSA algorithm identifier it's

413
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:31,379
amenable to attacks where you can change

414
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,579
the curve and still get the person to

415
00:26:31,379 --> 00:26:38,639
perform the computation Mike I'm glad to

416
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,749
say that in the document that more or

417
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:42,149
less that's actually what I want to hear

418
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:49,799
in the document suppose I were to take

419
00:26:42,149 --> 00:26:56,779
AP 256 key and change the the curve to

420
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:59,429
the 2 to the K algorithm and hands you a

421
00:26:56,779 --> 00:27:01,709
message sign with a kit with the K

422
00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:05,459
algorithm and that key how can you tell

423
00:27:01,709 --> 00:27:07,889
that I changed the that would be what

424
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:15,259
used to said as what caps that problem

425
00:27:07,889 --> 00:27:18,948
would not catch that problem so I think

426
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:21,779
because there's a generic ECDSA

427
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:24,419
algorithm identify are already in COEs a

428
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:28,199
the protections only operate in one

429
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:31,559
direction that if you're using SEC P 256

430
00:27:28,199 --> 00:27:33,389
K 1 and it's corresponding algorithm

431
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,269
identifier you can be assured that

432
00:27:33,389 --> 00:27:41,668
nobody can change the curve to P 256 and

433
00:27:38,269 --> 00:27:43,950
get away with it no no I went the other

434
00:27:41,669 --> 00:27:47,010
direction I started with

435
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:51,360
I started with the k1 signature I mean

436
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:55,320
the other direction is I start with a p2

437
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:57,449
5/6 signature and I take a k1 key and

438
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,850
change the algorithm at the curve

439
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:01,200
identifier I mean if it works in both

440
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:09,030
the attack works in both directions

441
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:12,290
right and I guess my background question

442
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:15,360
is given that Hosea's that exists today

443
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:18,149
uses this generic algorithm identifier

444
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,580
am i right that there's no protection

445
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:22,680
against changing the curve and feeding

446
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:25,550
it to the algorithm because the

447
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:30,870
algorithm is designed to take all comers

448
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:33,180
no if you actually do the work of

449
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,189
verifying that the curve that the point

450
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,620
you have is on the curve that you were

451
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,770
given that is how you prevent that

452
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:43,010
problem ok I was taking that as a given

453
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,750
as something you always have to do and

454
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:49,640
partly in response to your review I

455
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:52,650
added text to the draft about

456
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:56,390
verification of the points being on the

457
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:59,610
curve in fact you supplied the text yes

458
00:28:56,390 --> 00:29:00,960
yeah but when you basically said to

459
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:06,679
start with is what I would like to see

460
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,680
in the document I'm fine with that

461
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:16,440
thank you all right so once once we have

462
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,010
that revision we will have shepard

463
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:21,030
picked out and we'll move that along all

464
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,430
right thank you

465
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,470
thank you Mike and it's not that I don't

466
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:27,960
love you but they scheduled Olaf at the

467
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:29,940
same time yeah we were basically we

468
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,880
thought we'd all be wrapped up and so I

469
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:39,060
am going to return there thank you thank

470
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:42,210
you so that was everything we had in our

471
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:49,440
agenda for today I think the only other

472
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:52,470
thing to note is the the draft ITF cozy

473
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,520
hash sig document is currently in is G

474
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,610
evaluation it's tell chat is I believe

475
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,429
the first tell chat

476
00:29:57,610 --> 00:30:04,540
after after this this meeting week so

477
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:07,179
hopefully we'll be progressing all the

478
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:10,950
way to putting one our first document

479
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:10,950
into the RFC editor queue here soon so

480
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:18,220
this is the open mic time if there's

481
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:24,690
anything anybody wants to bring up this

482
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:27,040
is this is your chance if you want to

483
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:29,250
continue on your email then that's fine

484
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,250
too

485
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,179
[Music]

486
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:36,280
all right well then we'll call this a

487
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:39,669
wrap thank you everyone

488
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:45,870
blue sheets make sure you've signed them

489
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:45,870
and otherwise enjoy the rest of your day
