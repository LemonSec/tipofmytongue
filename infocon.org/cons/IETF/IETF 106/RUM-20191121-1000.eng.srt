1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:11,579
uh Paul you keep trying to get you put

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:14,629
yourself on the queue I recognized you

3
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:14,629
and then you drop out

4
00:00:39,210 --> 00:01:02,280
he's I don't know welcome it's going to

5
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:02,279
get into the jabber room

6
00:01:47,280 --> 00:02:01,170
all right try it again you drop off as

7
00:01:57,579 --> 00:02:01,169
quickly as you get recognized

8
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,629
it's up he's up all the reserve about it

9
00:02:39,299 --> 00:02:41,629
yeah right

10
00:02:52,690 --> 00:03:03,560
yeah restart your browser we are trying

11
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:07,459
to get Paul connected here you just

12
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,900
wanted to check that you could okay you

13
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:22,940
haven't said anything it'd be nice to

14
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:26,390
hear you well I'm going to give it one

15
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:29,629
minute and I'm going to get going I can

16
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:32,708
do that ministry via I really did think

17
00:03:29,629 --> 00:03:34,879
I was going to have more people sorry

18
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:41,840
we've got a lot of people on remote

19
00:03:34,879 --> 00:04:32,360
which is good so this is uh the rum

20
00:03:41,840 --> 00:04:38,150
meeting note well yeah all right so this

21
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,740
is rum well there's the agenda really

22
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,370
just talking about the one draft and

23
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,440
where we are in the open issues does

24
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:49,370
anyone want to bash the agenda anything

25
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:53,960
you want to change if you're

26
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:56,150
participating remotely by all means ask

27
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,830
to speak and we'll recognize you on

28
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:59,810
including bashing the agenda you're

29
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:02,839
certainly welcome to do that if you have

30
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,279
any suggestions

31
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,019
yes we have someone in the jabber room

32
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:09,359
if you just want to have someone come up

33
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:12,299
to the mic you can type it into the

34
00:05:09,359 --> 00:05:14,729
jabber and and we have someone who will

35
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:19,078
do that it's because you're so quiet and

36
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:22,169
reserved yes all right

37
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:36,989
so if there's no agenda bashing to do

38
00:05:22,169 --> 00:05:53,989
I'm gonna switch to get back to data

39
00:05:36,989 --> 00:06:12,019
tracker there's this and the slides this

40
00:05:53,989 --> 00:06:15,328
alright so you know audit work yeah yeah

41
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:17,399
yeah yeah all right

42
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,559
so the first thing I want to talk about

43
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,129
is the discussions we've been having on

44
00:06:19,559 --> 00:06:27,569
the list having to do with media the

45
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:29,939
current state of the document is that

46
00:06:27,569 --> 00:06:32,789
g.711 and opus are mandatory to

47
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:34,529
implement there has been the discussion

48
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:37,019
of what what does it mean if your gate

49
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,299
wing from the PSTN and I think that

50
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:41,219
we're we've agreed that that's you don't

51
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,808
have to offer opus if your gate wing

52
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:45,139
from the PSTN that's the silly thing to

53
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:50,429
do there's no requirement to be silly

54
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:52,409
and we can I don't we'll make sure that

55
00:06:50,429 --> 00:06:55,099
the text is clear on that subject I did

56
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:58,110
try to do that on the current version is

57
00:06:55,099 --> 00:07:01,589
is there anything that people think that

58
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,799
they want to see in the audio section

59
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:07,499
that is not there or if we solve this

60
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,758
one issue having to do with yes you have

61
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:11,219
to implement it but you don't have to

62
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:13,439
use it in every call is there anything

63
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:17,159
else that people want to have modified

64
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:21,509
in the audio and again if you want to

65
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,430
speak on me taco go ahead or put

66
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:26,069
something in the in the jabber room any

67
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:28,770
any way that you want to feedback if

68
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:29,580
you're operating remotely that that

69
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,799
would be just fine

70
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:37,710
there's anything that people have on

71
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,479
audio that we have not covered I'm

72
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:46,349
hearing nothing and I'm not too

73
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:49,500
surprised Richard shields Richard go

74
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:51,440
ahead okay can you hear me okay yeah

75
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,419
it's not terrific but it's it's it's

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:59,090
understandable go ahead okay oh so what

77
00:07:54,419 --> 00:08:03,270
I did post something on the email list

78
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:08,310
about supporting devices that are older

79
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:10,530
than then maybe opus would be able to

80
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:13,949
run on given that we're already pushing

81
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,138
the limits on some of these devices I

82
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:21,270
don't remember who some Oh someone

83
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:23,699
posted back saying that that we don't

84
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:26,490
plant them I guess using these ancient

85
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:34,579
devices here's here's my concern

86
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:40,979
my concern is as a VRS provider the FCC

87
00:08:34,578 --> 00:08:44,010
will give us direction based on you know

88
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:49,070
input from RFC's and so forth if if they

89
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:51,660
simply say we must comply with this RFC

90
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,750
without any caveats about our older

91
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,459
devices that we do not support anymore I

92
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:59,790
mean we don't push new firmware to them

93
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:01,770
that best concern so I I I think from

94
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:04,230
our providers perspective this really

95
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:07,020
should be us should if there's any way

96
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:11,600
to word it in that way because should

97
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,600
you might with my understanding is that

98
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,290
it's essentially a must unless there's a

99
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:18,750
good technical reason why we can't

100
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:22,550
implement it and there might be cases

101
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,550
like that for some of our older devices

102
00:09:24,199 --> 00:09:29,670
this is Brian I there are a couple

103
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,010
things that

104
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,870
we need to say one of which is that that

105
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,410
there isn't any way to control the ITF

106
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:39,060
has no control over but the FCC does but

107
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:40,980
we have to do things that we think are

108
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:47,280
the technically best solution that we

109
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:49,800
have in a new document and if you're

110
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:55,250
trying to make the assumption that you

111
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:59,579
can upgrade and a very old device to new

112
00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:02,580
firmware software and meet the the

113
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,800
the Roo spec I'm not sure that I think

114
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:11,120
that that's reasonable or possible in

115
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:14,790
most cases but and and and so on I I

116
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,040
understand the issue I I personally just

117
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:20,370
speaking as just as an individual at

118
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,199
this point would think that that you

119
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,820
really do want to implement opus and

120
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,420
mandatory to implement so that you can

121
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,520
achieve high bandwidth connections in

122
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:31,380
everything other than a PSTN

123
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,780
circumstance and my experience with

124
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,689
implementing opus which I mean haven't

125
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:39,959
done the nuts and bolts but I've had

126
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:42,360
many people implemented in in in devices

127
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,580
that I've been associated with and

128
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:48,030
generally they record this got very low

129
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:51,390
overhead I mean it's really easy very

130
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:57,030
very small code space very low compute

131
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:58,939
requirements and III doubt that that's

132
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:07,800
really going to be the reason you can't

133
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:09,780
run Roo on a on an older device Adam

134
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:12,510
Adam Roche as an individual Richard do

135
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:16,100
you have some notion of what the CPUs

136
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:19,410
are in the devices you're talking about

137
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:23,100
why that's that's a really good question

138
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:27,579
III I don't I know we have some like

139
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:29,930
older mobile devices customers use and

140
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:33,330
[Music]

141
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,790
yeah those might be the ones that are of

142
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:38,910
concern okay if you have some way of

143
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:41,250
finding out what those run on and like

144
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:42,719
sending that to the mailing list I work

145
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,510
with some of the folks that did the Opus

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,580
development work and

147
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,460
happy to poke them to find out what they

148
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:49,950
think is is fusible on those okay thank

149
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,360
you

150
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:55,600
yeah dumplings I'm just sort of again

151
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,430
sort of questioning if you're not

152
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,830
pushing firmware updates to these things

153
00:11:57,430 --> 00:12:04,719
how is they going to run Roux at all

154
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:06,820
right I have to do I mean old soft no

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,000
old systems that aren't updated aren't

156
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:16,840
updated by definition so yeah III I

157
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,840
think I understand your points but if

158
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:27,760
but if the FCC simply says we must

159
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:29,080
comply with this RFC you know going by

160
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,080
the letter of the law than we would have

161
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,850
to update anything that does not meet

162
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:39,730
that specification yeah yeah so just

163
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:42,820
from my own you know following the list

164
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:45,940
I think generally I can arm m3 which is

165
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,550
sort of the very like embedded ARM chips

166
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,410
are able to run opus with only a little

167
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:54,130
bit of tuning because I understand it so

168
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:55,540
yeah they running video as well if

169
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:57,300
you're running video so if you have to

170
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:00,310
run video

171
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,599
I mean it is if you're running video

172
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:04,109
either you're a dedicated video hardware

173
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,220
in which case it doesn't matter or the

174
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:11,380
opus is trivial compared to the video

175
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:16,120
yeah yeah I mean making we're this is

176
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:19,750
Brian and I I I do think that we're in

177
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:23,380
we're the the load that opus places on a

178
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:27,120
cpu is very small compared to what video

179
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:30,310
does and unless you're running at 99%

180
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,990
CPU utilization and 1% will take you

181
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,880
over and I can imagine that you could be

182
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:37,630
in a circumstance like that but it's you

183
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,880
know I hope you aren't but but I think

184
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:42,400
the the real problem is that getting a

185
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,470
document through the ITF requires that

186
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,810
we do you know put our best current

187
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:49,990
practice in an opus is clearly our best

188
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:51,400
current practice and you know we can

189
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,260
make accommodations for backwards

190
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:56,140
compatibility that's always a possible

191
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,920
thing to do but in terms of meeting the

192
00:13:56,140 --> 00:14:00,519
requirement

193
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:03,430
so the device meeting the requirements

194
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:06,610
of us of a new specification that it

195
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:08,949
would be very hard to get it through the

196
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:10,480
a document through without without

197
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:12,579
requiring what we think is best current

198
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,850
practice all right thank you thank you

199
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:19,209
appreciate it is there anything else

200
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:26,339
about yeah anything else about audio

201
00:14:19,209 --> 00:14:26,339
that people want to want to bring up I

202
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,350
will work with anybody who wants to make

203
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,089
sure that the text on gate wing the PSTN

204
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,010
is clear enough if there's anybody that

205
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,959
that wants to make suggestions on

206
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,050
wording on that please send them to the

207
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:44,819
list and I'm happy to to to work on that

208
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:44,819
because I do want that to be very clear

209
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:55,240
Paul there you go

210
00:14:52,230 --> 00:15:05,640
no audio see your video don't hear your

211
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:05,640
audio nope no audio at all

212
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:23,960
yeah Paul I'm gonna let James Hamelin I

213
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:29,990
have the floor and you can work on your

214
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:37,660
audio and try try bringing me back James

215
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:42,800
your yeah yes I just to come back to

216
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:47,420
Richard was saying I think our problem

217
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:50,959
is that the there are two sides to the

218
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,930
rum interface there's the iue itself and

219
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:58,430
this the provider side and the way the

220
00:15:53,930 --> 00:16:01,400
documents phrased I think the provider

221
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:03,979
side represents essentially the

222
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:08,300
interface to the PSTN and a whole load

223
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:13,460
of legacy things which are not are you

224
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:17,240
ease some of which as we said may not be

225
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:21,020
possible to upgrade and so it's not just

226
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:24,230
the PSTN that is the only place where

227
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,120
you have legacy and and that's what I

228
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:33,020
think needs to be made clear in the

229
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:34,400
wording okay yeah yes I I'm gonna this

230
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:36,050
is Ryan out I'm going to read back to

231
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,270
you what I heard out of that and I

232
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:40,339
certainly if if if I'm interpreting it

233
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,980
correctly I agree with you you're saying

234
00:16:40,339 --> 00:16:45,589
that that in addition to gate weighing a

235
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:48,770
call from the PSTN you may be connecting

236
00:16:45,589 --> 00:16:50,990
to a device which is not route compliant

237
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:54,500
and you want to be able to establish a a

238
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:56,660
a communication with room on audio path

239
00:16:54,500 --> 00:17:00,650
and the only thing offered by that

240
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,110
legacy device is g.711 and you want to

241
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,780
make sure that that the ROO spec clearly

242
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:09,470
allows talking to a device that doesn't

243
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,930
support rum it doesn't support opus and

244
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:14,030
and I think everybody agrees with you

245
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:17,360
that that if you're calling a device

246
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,959
which is not Roo compatible but is

247
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:23,599
otherwise able to create a video session

248
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,110
and an audio session using g.711 that

249
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,610
that that that should be fully supported

250
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,340
by a device

251
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,928
conforming to the document and if again

252
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,399
if the wording is not clear on that

253
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:35,780
point I'm very happy to work with you to

254
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,440
make sure that it is very clear on that

255
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,428
point all right Adam Oh again again as

256
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,470
an individual and so sounds like

257
00:17:40,429 --> 00:17:47,990
basically wanted to say instead of PSTN

258
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:49,490
just like any legacy yes certainly I

259
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:53,510
think that's very appropriate we should

260
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:59,320
do that okay thanks

261
00:17:53,510 --> 00:18:13,640
yeah all right I'm gonna try Paul again

262
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:16,549
Paul nope dropped off yep all right

263
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:21,140
if there's nothing else on audio I'm

264
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:23,480
gonna go to video and a reminder that we

265
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:26,870
did agree that h.264 is the only

266
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:30,919
mandatory to implement codec and the

267
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:33,709
question I have for the room is is there

268
00:18:30,919 --> 00:18:36,580
anything other than what WebRTC says

269
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:39,559
about h.264 that we need in the document

270
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:41,030
it if you go read the specs there are a

271
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:43,690
number of things that it says that you

272
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:46,370
have to implement in order to maintain

273
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:49,549
streams and you know restarts and all

274
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,159
that frame framing all that kind of

275
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:53,690
stuff but is there anything else that we

276
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,390
need to say in addition to what's in the

277
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,220
WebRTC that that will get us what we

278
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,320
want and again I'm thinking mostly about

279
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,450
the backwards compatibility part if

280
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,790
there are pieces that we want to require

281
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,380
in addition to what WebRTC requires in

282
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,240
order to get better backwards

283
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:12,710
compatibility I'm happy to put that kind

284
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,410
of thing in so if anyone has any

285
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,210
suggestions on on what might need to be

286
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:20,990
added to the current text beyond what

287
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:28,390
the WebRTC specs say about video again

288
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:30,650
I'm real happy to put that in no one

289
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:34,790
apparently has anything to say again if

290
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:37,270
you if you think of something oh okay

291
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,270
Isaac

292
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,620
go ahead Isaac hi can you hear me okay

293
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,799
yes you're fine awesome great thank you

294
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,020
um one issue we do have with providers

295
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:53,779
and I'm not sure what WebRTC says about

296
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:55,830
this but we need we do require mode one

297
00:19:53,779 --> 00:20:01,260
because there are a lot of there are a

298
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:03,059
lot of devices they can't encode our

299
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:06,210
there are some older devices and codecs

300
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,980
that weren't able to do mode one and so

301
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,270
they would end up sending really large

302
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:14,070
packets that ended up getting fragmented

303
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:18,270
so we did require endpoints abort mode

304
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:20,428
one for packetization for h.264 I don't

305
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:22,590
know what where RT C says on that but

306
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:25,279
that might be something we need to

307
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:32,129
include to ensure interoperability

308
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:35,100
across many devices Adam Adam Rochester

309
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,600
the the WebRTC video specification

310
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,340
indicates that factorisation mode one

311
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,549
must be supported and other modes may be

312
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:43,230
dikko ciated and used by actually didn't

313
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:45,658
understand upon your making enough to

314
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:51,770
know whether that's a problem for you

315
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:54,779
that yeah I think you're alright

316
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:58,039
yeah if mode 1 is required then I think

317
00:20:54,779 --> 00:21:01,590
we should be okay so great we can be

318
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:05,669
great um I certainly would encourage

319
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:07,799
anybody to who's listening or you know

320
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:10,200
and any of the providers or anybody else

321
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:12,929
interested to to go back and look to see

322
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,690
what's in the WebRTC spec and think

323
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:17,880
about what you think you need to have

324
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,950
I'm not opposed to adding some more

325
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:25,049
requirements if that'll get us more

326
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:27,799
backwards compatibility we've had really

327
00:21:25,049 --> 00:21:30,299
good good success in getting

328
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:33,450
interoperability with WebRTC but that's

329
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:35,429
WebRTC to WebRTC and and and I

330
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:37,380
understand the limitations that you know

331
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:40,380
saying oh yeah well Weber C's work

332
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:43,950
really great yeah not good enough

333
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,990
so if you wouldn't mind taking a look at

334
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,520
the details here and making sure that

335
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,240
the things we need are there I

336
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,889
appreciate it and

337
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,090
again send send that to the list and

338
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll make sure it gets into the next

339
00:21:54,090 --> 00:22:04,379
version is there anything else on on

340
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:07,950
video anybody wants to talk about all

341
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:10,710
right the next media I have is text and

342
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:13,860
following our prior discussions the only

343
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:16,470
thing that's required is RFC 4103 which

344
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,000
is RTP transport you'll require recall

345
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,410
we had the discussion of whether we're

346
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,250
going to require the data channel from

347
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:25,230
WebRTC and decided not to so this makes

348
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,490
it compatible with any other device that

349
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:30,840
does real-time text with sip and I don't

350
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,700
think there is anything that needs to be

351
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:35,580
done there but if there is anything that

352
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,200
people want to bring out happy to talk

353
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:40,590
about that now but I think we're okay

354
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:51,870
that in the in the text side any any

355
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:54,510
comments on text all right so the the

356
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:58,530
next subject I want to get into somewhat

357
00:22:54,510 --> 00:23:01,140
relates to the discussion that we had

358
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:04,590
earlier about how the document currently

359
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:07,530
treats providers and and and Andrew

360
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:10,110
devices and the text does in fact have

361
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:11,899
things like the room us do this

362
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:16,199
providers may do that

363
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:17,820
etc and I'd like to propose that as an

364
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,520
IT after app that that really doesn't

365
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,950
have a lot of relevance to the kind of

366
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,690
documents that we typically create we're

367
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,580
defining a protocol or really were

368
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:33,420
profiling an interface and I'd like to

369
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:35,610
see if their support for getting rid of

370
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,850
that wording and just talk about the

371
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:45,379
interface as as what's required across

372
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:48,928
the interface and and that that you know

373
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:51,600
speaking to our VRS provider u.s. VRS

374
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:53,130
provider folks that means the FCC may

375
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,550
not get exactly what it wants out of

376
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:58,380
that because it doesn't doesn't put a

377
00:23:56,550 --> 00:24:00,360
requirement on you that you do anything

378
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,770
particular it just says across the

379
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:08,309
interface this must be supported and

380
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:10,530
and that that would make it more like an

381
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:15,080
ITF document the current document is a

382
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:22,290
little strange for a long time ITF

383
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:24,449
participant and and it if people like

384
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,870
what's there I'm all right leaving it

385
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:30,690
but I'd like to move it to a just having

386
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:35,699
a specification of the interface and not

387
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:46,830
of which side does what any any comments

388
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:48,330
on that I hear no one if there isn't an

389
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:50,730
objection I'm going that the next

390
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,860
version will will say we'll do that I

391
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:56,280
will at least to take a crack at it you

392
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:58,199
can always back out if we're don't don't

393
00:24:56,280 --> 00:25:04,670
want to go forward but that's that's

394
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:07,730
what I like to do James

395
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,559
just an observation and I guess a

396
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:13,200
question

397
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:16,500
surely this kind of situation must come

398
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,890
up quite a bit for example in pure

399
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,340
client-server interfaces where there's

400
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:27,360
definitely one side which is different

401
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:29,399
from the other and I think for the

402
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,610
reasons we've said though there is a

403
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:34,140
difference between the two sides in this

404
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:37,770
interface in the sense that we're

405
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:43,380
standardizing it a new interface to what

406
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:47,280
is a range of systems some of which

407
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:49,590
contain legacy elements so there is an

408
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,820
inherent asymmetry and what we're trying

409
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:55,359
to do

410
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:59,229
is it really that unusual to have to

411
00:25:55,359 --> 00:26:01,720
address that kind of situation well you

412
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:04,200
you most certainly have two sides of an

413
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,700
interface and you know you might have

414
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,049
clients and servers and the server's may

415
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,379
have different requirements the clients

416
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:15,820
that that that's certainly not all that

417
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:18,639
unusual but usually what you say is that

418
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,129
that it mean but but we don't have a

419
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:24,389
circumstance like that here we're really

420
00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:29,769
talking about a device interfacing

421
00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:33,879
towards a service it's the service you

422
00:26:29,769 --> 00:26:36,639
know the what in the the PSTN we call

423
00:26:33,879 --> 00:26:39,668
the Uni interface right it's the user to

424
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:41,228
network interface and what happens in

425
00:26:39,669 --> 00:26:42,759
the network or what happens to some

426
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:45,580
other device that's connected to the

427
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:46,929
network or anything like that is is

428
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,580
outside of the range of the

429
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:50,559
specification the specification only

430
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,099
talks about what does it look like on

431
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:57,279
the wire between the end device and the

432
00:26:54,099 --> 00:27:00,070
the the network in this case the

433
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,820
providers network but but it but that's

434
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:07,029
what it looks like

435
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:09,158
it's only there and that that means that

436
00:27:07,029 --> 00:27:13,029
you don't have to well that we're not

437
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:14,769
saying what happens inside the provider

438
00:27:13,029 --> 00:27:16,840
network we're only saying what happens

439
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:19,929
on the connection between the user

440
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,389
device and the network does that make

441
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:24,639
sense to you and is that helpful in in

442
00:27:22,389 --> 00:27:27,629
in in in getting work where I'm

443
00:27:24,639 --> 00:27:27,629
proposing you go

444
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,350
I think so

445
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:38,370
my first instinct is to think that

446
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:42,780
because there is some asymmetry that the

447
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:45,290
language will be will be simpler if it

448
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:55,170
makes the kinds of distinctions that it

449
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:57,389
has but I think if the structure of the

450
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,820
language has changed what will care

451
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,220
about is is the meaning in the end so

452
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:07,010
this will come down to what which way

453
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:12,810
explains things most succinctly I think

454
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:15,540
yeah and and III as as editor I won't

455
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:16,770
mind having a reset if if we try

456
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,990
something and we don't like it and we

457
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:21,420
want to go back to where it was

458
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:26,820
I'll keep the source text around and I

459
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,380
can always undo text let's see I got

460
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:32,129
several people in the queue so let me

461
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:36,000
move on to call let's do C does it work

462
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:46,290
this time and you hear me yes ah

463
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:51,150
Rome works better than Firefox today in

464
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:53,159
in in the VRS provider specs I mean we

465
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:56,520
have a more complex architecture yeah I

466
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,620
mean it's not just devices talking to

467
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,750
similar devices or something like that

468
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,850
you know we have roles for these things

469
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,920
so you know the provider has a rural

470
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:08,689
separate you know and the point-to-point

471
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:13,170
call between two crews you know is

472
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:15,570
topologically different and so I I think

473
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,590
that's the perspective from which you

474
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:21,899
know there's a symmetry in you know and

475
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,500
so if you just make a point-to-point

476
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:28,890
call then it's really ruined there's

477
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:31,620
it's all fine but if the roux is calling

478
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:33,900
and it ends up at a provider it may be

479
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,239
talking to it you know an IVR kind of

480
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:39,540
device for a while and maybe talking to

481
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,570
a to a conference or the conference's in

482
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:49,709
the interpreter

483
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:51,448
and you know it's technically Elise says

484
00:29:49,709 --> 00:29:53,339
things currently stand there is no

485
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:56,729
requirement that the devices that

486
00:29:53,339 --> 00:30:05,309
interpreters that work on the arrests

487
00:29:56,729 --> 00:30:11,669
use meet the ruse back yeah and maybe

488
00:30:05,309 --> 00:30:16,769
maybe that'll change too but so to me I

489
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:19,109
could see a utility in an asymmetry but

490
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:22,589
I think to deal with it I think we would

491
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:25,369
have to introduce some more terminology

492
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:31,168
and stuff like that in the document that

493
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:33,708
to define what the rules are on top of

494
00:30:31,169 --> 00:30:40,979
that I mean as far as the the earlier

495
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:42,599
consideration I mean there's a lot of

496
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:45,029
concerns for the providers that

497
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:47,339
ultimately come down to what the FCC is

498
00:30:45,029 --> 00:30:51,539
going to do and I realized that the FCC

499
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:58,289
is kind of like out of scope for us sort

500
00:30:51,539 --> 00:31:02,879
of but I think we have to yeah the

501
00:30:58,289 --> 00:31:05,579
situation is different if if the FCC is

502
00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:08,609
going to issue a regulation that refer

503
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:11,668
you know that for which the respect is

504
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:13,708
one part and there's you know like other

505
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:17,609
parts for backward compatibility or

506
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:20,039
something like that then it is if the

507
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:22,019
expectation is that the FCC is just

508
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:27,029
gonna say you know everybody's got to

509
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:30,389
support this and it's not clear to me

510
00:31:27,029 --> 00:31:32,039
how we sort that out but I think it

511
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:37,879
would it would help the providers if

512
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:40,229
they knew what was going to happen and

513
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:45,899
because it makes a big difference in how

514
00:31:40,229 --> 00:31:48,389
we write this stuff yeah I I don't know

515
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:53,760
how we go about getting a clarification

516
00:31:48,389 --> 00:31:56,370
there if we can well we can

517
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,470
on that there are a couple other people

518
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,469
in the queue so I'm gonna move on good

519
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:09,540
Isaac well Isaac dropped out all right

520
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:15,960
Richard

521
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:18,830
we'll get Richard oh great um so back

522
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:23,700
kinda what James is saying about the the

523
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:26,159
must for ruined me for providers for one

524
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:30,270
thing of course let's go through the

525
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:33,600
document with an eye with that in mind

526
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,670
and understand trying to see how that

527
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,929
was well play out I I did briefly just

528
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,600
run through the document looking for

529
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:42,090
muss and May and one one jumped out at

530
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,429
me and I'm wondering how oh you would

531
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:50,010
deal with this with your your your

532
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,560
current approach and it's it's a

533
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,320
paragraph in section five it's in

534
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:59,570
addition the room must and providers may

535
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,570
conform to an ELISA series series of RCS

536
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:05,340
like for example one of them is ice and

537
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,340
as far as I know I think Sorenson is the

538
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:10,590
only provider that uses ice today so how

539
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:13,050
would you go about rewriting that would

540
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:17,100
you say that the room us and just drop

541
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:21,960
the providers may now uh well I I

542
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:25,199
wouldn't what I would say is that that

543
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:32,120
ice is mandatory to implement for a

544
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:37,530
route compatible device and if it sends

545
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,360
ice candidates out it may or may not get

546
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:45,180
responses depending on who what it's

547
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:50,699
trying to connect to and so I across the

548
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:53,070
interface ices support it but as with

549
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,720
any other mean you picked on ice which

550
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:58,050
is something we know a fair amount about

551
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:59,820
and you know if if the other end doesn't

552
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,379
know anything about ice then you're not

553
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:04,169
going to get any candidates back and if

554
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:06,510
it does you will so rue de rue is going

555
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:08,280
to work and route it back to two old

556
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:10,679
vice may not

557
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:12,840
and you know something in the middle can

558
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:15,120
screw stuff up and the devices have to

559
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,740
cope with that but that's the way ice is

560
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:22,168
built anyways so I I think you're

561
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:25,439
probably okay but I think but you know I

562
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:27,239
think your your your intuition of look

563
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,679
well let's go look at the cases where

564
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,689
they're asymmetric and decide whether

565
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:32,639
there's a problem is probably the right

566
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:35,940
one and when we'll do that and I found

567
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,020
another one which is in 5-3 and it so it

568
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:43,139
that one is Roo must and providers

569
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,000
should support info requests well you

570
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,740
know again the same thing across the

571
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,120
interface you should allow the info

572
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:55,229
request and and whether it comes up that

573
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,630
is whether it's ever sent is is is is an

574
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:59,040
issue but if you get it you should

575
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:04,530
handle it

576
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,990
and I I think that that's that that's

577
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:08,490
where the that's more of a the example

578
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:10,410
that I had where I don't think that we

579
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:13,259
should have an asymmetry in the sense of

580
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:18,060
across the interface an info should be

581
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:21,480
supported okay so so in that example I

582
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,640
gave the simply just be reworded as in

583
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,790
addition the room must and and not

584
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,549
mention providers at all correct okay

585
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,610
that's exactly correct all right thank

586
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:31,610
you

587
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,050
anyone else

588
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,820
so what I'm getting out of this is that

589
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:50,450
there's some concern that that might be

590
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:52,460
problematic but there's no there there

591
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:54,609
there isn't really an objection as long

592
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:59,240
as the reality comes out all right and

593
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:01,070
as the editor I'm I'm making a proposal

594
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:04,609
that I'm willing to back out if it

595
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,460
doesn't work out so it'll be on me to

596
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:09,770
back it out if it doesn't work but I'm

597
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,080
gonna do that I'm gonna put out a

598
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:14,509
version that that that that doesn't use

599
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:16,100
the word provider in a in in on the

600
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:18,230
interface side I mean it's not got rid

601
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:21,290
of all cases of provider because just

602
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:23,990
what's on the other side but I'm gonna

603
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,930
I'm gonna try and get rid of the this

604
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:28,910
asymmetry thing I mean I kind of feel

605
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,740
like if this isn't actually making

606
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:34,569
narrative changes to what it actually is

607
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:39,680
done that's a provocative yeah yeah okay

608
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:53,330
yeah it doesn't alright anything else on

609
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:54,980
that subject when we started the work

610
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:56,930
and I brought in the original draft

611
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,760
which was based on work that mitre had

612
00:36:56,930 --> 00:37:04,520
done on that the FCC's behest there were

613
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,430
a couple of things that were flagged as

614
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,380
maybe they would survive in the ITF

615
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:11,180
draftin maybe they wouldn't and I'd like

616
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:13,760
to start the discussion of what survives

617
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,490
and what doesn't the two things that I

618
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,280
know about that are worth talking about

619
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:22,790
are the provisioning mechanism and the

620
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:24,830
contacts mechanisms provisioning

621
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,640
currently in the draft there is a

622
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:30,460
provisioning mechanism which works by

623
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:34,060
discovering and downloading a JSON

624
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:36,410
object that provisions the device

625
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:39,109
there's a known issue with that having

626
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:40,339
to do with usernames and passwords which

627
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:43,340
we would have to come up with an

628
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:45,350
alternative for the the question I have

629
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:48,950
for the room and the people on the call

630
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:50,540
is our is this do we want to keep it I

631
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:52,160
personally would like to keep it

632
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:56,180
think it's useful I think it's very

633
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,009
helpful to be able to provision a device

634
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,169
with a file instead of having to do it

635
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,020
manually

636
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:04,580
and so and I think the mechanism and

637
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:06,400
that's there which is downloaded JSON

638
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,009
divide the file is pretty reasonable

639
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,870
mechanism there was discussions of using

640
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:13,520
other mechanisms that the ITF is defined

641
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:18,140
but I think this is probably what people

642
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:21,350
would first see so other than how we

643
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:24,259
handle user name and password are we

644
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:27,529
keeping it is it alright to keep it or

645
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,850
or is it something that we we're you

646
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,750
think we'll have enough trouble coming

647
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:35,150
to agreement on um I'd like to leave it

648
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:39,070
so this is we discussed whether this

649
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:41,120
happens I'm asking the question now I

650
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:43,820
personally would like to keep it as it

651
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:45,770
is pretty much fixing the username and

652
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,990
password we can deal with the details

653
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:50,860
right if there's Mecca if there are some

654
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:52,899
aspects of the file or the you know the

655
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:55,070
provisioning the things that it does

656
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,050
happy to deal with any of the details

657
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,810
it's just that I'm asking the the

658
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:04,000
top-level question of does the mechanism

659
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,000
itself stay in the document

660
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:12,019
any comments on that the default is

661
00:39:10,069 --> 00:39:19,279
leave it it's already there and I think

662
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:20,868
it's fine do people have a preference

663
00:39:19,279 --> 00:39:27,769
for how to handle the username and

664
00:39:20,869 --> 00:39:29,630
password I will propose some mechanism

665
00:39:27,769 --> 00:39:34,660
I'll figure out what I'm gonna propose

666
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,660
but it'll be something that most modern

667
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:43,190
substrates can handle reasonably right

668
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:46,930
it'll encode it'll be encoded in some

669
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:50,239
way right as a file of some kind and and

670
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:51,710
that'll it'll it'll be something that's

671
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,739
standardized I mean I'm just going to

672
00:39:51,710 --> 00:40:00,799
use an existing standard not a no I'm

673
00:39:54,739 --> 00:40:03,079
not gonna make anything up Isaac yeah

674
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:05,869
I'm not sure exactly what you're

675
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:07,910
referring to can you in we can you be

676
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:10,220
specific about what section that's in

677
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:16,118
yes sure

678
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:16,118
young-kyu so what I'm talking about is

679
00:40:19,089 --> 00:40:28,219
section 9 provisioning and provider

680
00:40:23,029 --> 00:40:31,640
selection and if you go through that

681
00:40:28,219 --> 00:40:33,619
you'll see there are really two one for

682
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,729
the provider selection and the other for

683
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:41,839
the provisioning piece there are two

684
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:44,450
JSON objects defined that provide all of

685
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,969
the data for choosing among multiple

686
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,910
providers and provisioning for a given

687
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:53,140
provider that but that's the part I'm

688
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:53,140
talking about section 9

689
00:40:53,890 --> 00:41:01,190
go ahead Isaac some that it just says so

690
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:05,468
a configurable URL so that implies that

691
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:09,140
there's some type of service and

692
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:14,420
therefore a provider that would then be

693
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:16,569
providing this JSON with all of the

694
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:20,300
providers information in it or is this a

695
00:41:16,569 --> 00:41:25,000
provider by provider you are

696
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:33,200
it it's it's it is provider by provider

697
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:35,420
and it's you you you provision each of

698
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,180
the providers you are eyes and you

699
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:43,940
retrieve from that provider the JSON

700
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:46,100
object okay so from so there's there

701
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:49,220
must be some global thing then that says

702
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:52,270
here's all the provider URLs that you

703
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:57,169
can go to to get the configuration

704
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:59,060
password etc for that provider then yeah

705
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,560
the current document doesn't describe

706
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,120
how that works it just says you

707
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,549
provision it with one or more you are

708
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:08,870
eyes I'm happy to change that but wait

709
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:10,700
I'm not I'm not in love with that

710
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:13,009
mechanism I just that's just what's

711
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:15,669
there now yeah I'm just trying to

712
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:17,780
understand who where that's coming from

713
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:21,170
so you're thinking that could just be

714
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:23,710
something that's part of the rule and if

715
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:26,030
it needs the URL needs to get added

716
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,950
there would need to be a new version of

717
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:29,870
it that would have that in it like it

718
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:34,490
say for example a new provider comes

719
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:37,940
online or a writer goes offline how does

720
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:40,549
that get handled and then the other kind

721
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,680
of follow-up question to that is I'm not

722
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:47,930
even sure how that works for the hearing

723
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:49,970
calls side right so let's say I'm you

724
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:52,069
know I'm a Sorenson user I use the ROO

725
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:55,339
but then I say oh I want to I want to

726
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:57,530
use purple right now and so I get the

727
00:42:55,340 --> 00:43:01,570
purple configuration URL it gives me

728
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:06,440
everything I need to register with with

729
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:10,040
purple or Z how then does my hearing

730
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,440
call get routed like that's still going

731
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,830
to come to the provider that owns the

732
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:20,360
number so it's hard to even understand

733
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:23,569
how that works outside of just a test

734
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:26,410
case kind of like what mitre is doing

735
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:33,460
now would be a TRP just using it to test

736
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:33,460
interoperability so the

737
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:42,019
the way it's currently described it's

738
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:43,730
not clear and I and then I think that's

739
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:47,000
a fault of the document and we'll have

740
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:49,400
to fix it whether whether a device is

741
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,019
allowed to are required to support more

742
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:57,710
than one registration at a given time

743
00:43:53,019 --> 00:44:01,729
but ignoring that little detail where it

744
00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:04,730
doesn't say the the the way it's

745
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:05,990
described you have entirely separate

746
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:14,299
accounts with entirely separate

747
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:15,828
telephone numbers so the idea is that I

748
00:44:14,299 --> 00:44:18,589
would know that I would be switching

749
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:22,339
phone numbers at the same time if you if

750
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:23,869
you have another selection zvrs purple

751
00:44:22,339 --> 00:44:28,190
number and then I have my Sorenson

752
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:29,599
number yes which back and forth so

753
00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:33,829
you're really not trying to do like a

754
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,420
one-stage dial around no like that not

755
00:44:33,829 --> 00:44:37,579
that's not what this describes this

756
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,200
describes the ability to have more than

757
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:42,170
one account each of which has its own

758
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,339
telephone number what it doesn't say is

759
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:44,930
whether you can have more than one

760
00:44:43,339 --> 00:44:48,078
active or not and that might just be an

761
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:50,359
implementation question yes so I can

762
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,579
reread the document but it might be good

763
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:56,269
I think it would be good to clarify that

764
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:59,000
no problem and and and please send I I

765
00:44:56,269 --> 00:45:00,140
agree we want to clarify that part so if

766
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,970
you wouldn't you know if you wouldn't

767
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,440
mind reading it and strengths them some

768
00:45:01,970 --> 00:45:05,328
text suggestions I'd appreciate it but

769
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,690
I'll take a look at it and try and prove

770
00:45:05,329 --> 00:45:08,450
it

771
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,950
because I I agree that it's not very

772
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:11,299
clear just sort of launches into the

773
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:16,058
mechanism without a discussion of how

774
00:45:11,299 --> 00:45:21,288
it's supposed to be used okay thank you

775
00:45:16,059 --> 00:45:23,599
Paul I'm just trying to dredge up

776
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:25,789
memories from like three years ago of

777
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:31,069
what the original thinking and this

778
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:35,900
stuff was and my recollection is that

779
00:45:31,069 --> 00:45:40,910
yes there was imagine some sort of

780
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:43,490
service that made this advertisement of

781
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:46,730
what all the different providers were

782
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:47,509
that you might choose among that that

783
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:51,170
you had the

784
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,850
in order to go through that step and

785
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:57,260
pick which provider he wanted to

786
00:45:52,850 --> 00:46:00,529
provision with and I think the other

787
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:05,869
thing we're we're dancing around here is

788
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:08,810
dial around in the sense of there was a

789
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:11,840
distinction between yeah you yeah at

790
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:14,540
least in principle the Rue yeah a

791
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:17,900
sufficiently capable rue implementation

792
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:19,670
might allow you to have registrations

793
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:23,480
with multiple providers each with its

794
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:28,700
own phone number but in addition it

795
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:31,270
would have you know a mechanism to to do

796
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,890
what's called one stage dialer round

797
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:35,840
which would you know allow you to just

798
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,670
click a button to say which provider you

799
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,530
wanted to place a particular call

800
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:43,250
through when you're Flint placing

801
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:45,440
outgoing calls and then then your call

802
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:49,310
would be outbound which I think would

803
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:53,390
address part of what was previously

804
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:55,340
being asked about yeah yes I'm sorry say

805
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:58,339
apologist interrupting you a little bit

806
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:59,660
section five to two independent of the

807
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:01,970
section nine that we were talking about

808
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,640
discusses one one stage style round

809
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:09,770
so so the document does what you were

810
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:11,660
recollected it it was gonna do yeah the

811
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:15,619
other thing I think is if we're if we're

812
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:20,060
trying to have this deal with hearing

813
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:22,670
users that that have video support then

814
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:27,049
I think there would there would have to

815
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:32,920
be a mechanism for them to get their get

816
00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:35,390
their route like device configured so II

817
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,369
either the existing providers would

818
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:39,830
somehow have to be able to support

819
00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:42,050
hearing users with with with with route

820
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:45,259
of Isis which is it currently within

821
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:49,520
their mandate or else there would have

822
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:52,280
to be some other pseudo pseudo provider

823
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:58,520
that provided that service like what

824
00:47:52,280 --> 00:48:01,400
mitre sort of does but I think you know

825
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:04,820
between those things I

826
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:08,180
you cover all the possibilities but like

827
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:09,920
I say the original imagined mechanism

828
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,669
was that when you turned on a brand new

829
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,470
route or something like that

830
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:18,080
it would it would know where to go to

831
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:21,009
fit to fetch this list of providers and

832
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:23,450
then it would bill such that and then

833
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:25,460
basically provide you some sort of

834
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,080
configuration mechanism that picks what

835
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:29,030
people want the one you want and then it

836
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,610
would go through the the provisioning

837
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:38,510
mechanism with that one mm-hmm and then

838
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:41,300
and then you'd be set okay

839
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:44,420
the the text does seem to follow what

840
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:46,610
you just said so we'll we'll work on

841
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,210
yeah I got Isaac behind you and he may

842
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:52,340
have more information

843
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:55,010
sorry I cut you off and I didn't mean to

844
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:56,780
I think you have the floor yeah I just

845
00:48:55,010 --> 00:48:59,960
wanted to clarify that it has nothing to

846
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:02,510
do with a hearing user using video or a

847
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:05,150
roué client or anything like that it's

848
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:09,770
just when a hearing person places a call

849
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:11,990
to a deaf number that that call gets

850
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:13,700
routed to the provider that owns that

851
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:16,839
number yeah

852
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,980
there's no way I just don't see a

853
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,500
reasonable way that you would have a

854
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:24,340
hearing call going to one provider and

855
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:27,110
then somehow routed to another provider

856
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:28,940
so this idea of one stage dial around

857
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:31,490
where the user just picks which provider

858
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:34,310
they want to use there might be some

859
00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:37,279
ways to make that work for an outbound

860
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:40,520
call but it just it's not bi-directional

861
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,830
and doesn't really seem feasible given

862
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,860
that so I just wanted to add that

863
00:49:42,830 --> 00:49:47,960
clarification for Paul thank you yeah I

864
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:55,760
agree with you Isaac your your that's

865
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:59,060
what I think all right I what I'm

866
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:01,130
hearing is leave it as it is but make

867
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:05,210
the text clearer about how this

868
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:08,000
mechanism is supposed to work which I

869
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:09,710
will do I will do and if anybody has to

870
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,240
text suggestions send them to the lists

871
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:14,960
and I'll try and incorporate them in the

872
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:18,140
next version but

873
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:21,460
I'm hearing leave leave the mechanism do

874
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:28,279
a better job of explaining how it works

875
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:31,069
any other discussion on that okay then

876
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,500
the next one is contacts so the current

877
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:35,450
document has two mechanisms for context

878
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:39,410
there's an upload and download of a file

879
00:50:35,450 --> 00:50:44,029
of J cards and then there's real-time

880
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:47,450
sink using CalDAV not called F I wrote

881
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:50,599
the wrong thing carddav sorry that's

882
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:57,919
carddav not called AB it's not calendars

883
00:50:50,599 --> 00:51:03,760
its context and I the the floor is open

884
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:07,339
for people's opinions of what to do the

885
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,530
you know that we currently the upload

886
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:19,670
download mechanism is supported by most

887
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:32,510
providers and carddav isn't what what

888
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:35,420
shall we do with this Isaac yeah I just

889
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:38,240
want to mention that you know really the

890
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:41,059
issue with carddav is that it's fairly

891
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,950
limited and compared to what you know

892
00:51:41,059 --> 00:51:46,460
some of the things we do with our

893
00:51:42,950 --> 00:51:49,490
current contacts especially for deaf

894
00:51:46,460 --> 00:51:50,630
users where we implement things like

895
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:54,618
visual caller ID

896
00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:56,859
whether that's color or patterns there

897
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:59,690
are just there are a lot of things we do

898
00:51:56,859 --> 00:52:03,558
sherry and sharing contacts across users

899
00:51:59,690 --> 00:52:08,420
and groups I mean the card card dab is

900
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:10,670
just pretty limited in comparison like

901
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:13,010
it might might be okay for somebody to

902
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:16,160
go or some third party whether it's

903
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:17,480
might or somebody else you know there's

904
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:20,868
no reason they couldn't host their own

905
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:25,609
carddav server and then ruo or be a TRP

906
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:26,490
could use that it's just hard to see how

907
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:29,009
it makes sense

908
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:32,850
is indicate that that would be something

909
00:52:29,010 --> 00:52:37,260
that the providers and this goes back to

910
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:39,029
your must versus main language right you

911
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:40,560
said well you just want this to describe

912
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:43,980
the interface but if it says the

913
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:47,340
interface is carddav and then later the

914
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:51,570
FCC comes along and says well providers

915
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:54,810
must be compliant with the Rome profile

916
00:52:51,570 --> 00:52:58,950
or whatever it's called now then it

917
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:00,570
effectively becomes a must and requires

918
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:02,750
us to do something that's just not a

919
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:08,340
good doesn't provide a good user

920
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:10,530
experience are these are these

921
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:16,140
limitations of card def per se or of K

922
00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:19,369
card / v card I mean my understanding of

923
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:22,080
card AB is that it's just a vCard server

924
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:25,440
so I'm assuming the same limitations

925
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:29,190
apply okay I mean I mean like there's

926
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:33,500
bird defined you know there's no

927
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:36,720
standard for visual color ID or patterns

928
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:39,180
colors etc I mean there's only to be

929
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:41,910
exceptions to the card / J card right

930
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:43,830
yeah that's I think your your your point

931
00:53:41,910 --> 00:53:46,500
Jonathan is is that it is it's not the

932
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:50,400
mechanism but the data that that the

933
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:52,070
mechanism is transporting yeah unless

934
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,540
you mentioned like the ability to share

935
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:55,980
share you know yeah but even then the

936
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:57,600
mechanism allows you to do that it's

937
00:53:55,980 --> 00:54:01,280
just what the how does the server we

938
00:53:57,600 --> 00:54:01,279
know what cards does the server send you

939
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:07,140
and and as you say that the J card

940
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,779
format as with the X card format as with

941
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:13,170
the original vCard format is extensible

942
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:16,980
so adding extensions for things like a

943
00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:21,740
visual representation of the user in

944
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:27,600
some way is is certainly straightforward

945
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:30,029
and and yeah I mean you know the

946
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:32,390
counter-argument for for for saying well

947
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:34,980
you know providers do that all is do

948
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:37,140
some providers do some things you know

949
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:39,210
it's it's yes but that makes a device

950
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,720
proprietary unless it's using some kind

951
00:54:39,210 --> 00:54:42,150
of stand

952
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:48,839
that multiple multiple ends can can

953
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:54,330
implement I Paul is waiting in queue let

954
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:56,700
me we move to hat Paul go ahead I just

955
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:58,410
wanted to get more clarification on the

956
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:01,859
question I guess

957
00:54:58,410 --> 00:55:03,569
my understanding is right which might be

958
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:08,970
wrong right is that right now the

959
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:14,520
devices the providers use the the

960
00:55:08,970 --> 00:55:17,129
contact list functionality is hosted on

961
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:22,920
the servers on the on the providers

962
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:26,390
servers and and the device has some sort

963
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:26,390
of interface to it

964
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:36,540
I'm not clear I'm how you're imagining

965
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:39,419
that working with the Roose Beck would

966
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:41,609
it mean that would it fit within the

967
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,440
functionality of the ruler would would

968
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:46,440
the thing that's a rule also have to

969
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:50,190
have extra functionality in order to

970
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:52,140
interface with your contact list

971
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:53,580
especially since you know you don't have

972
00:55:52,140 --> 00:56:00,990
a call when you're trying to use the

973
00:55:53,580 --> 00:56:02,520
contact list to establish a call and you

974
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:05,009
know if it requires some extra

975
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:07,290
functionality than that that like blows

976
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:09,660
the whole idea of the you know a

977
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:12,150
portable rule that works across multiple

978
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:16,109
providers and let unless that mechanism

979
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:22,230
is standardized so the way it works now

980
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:25,080
as you and implied the the whole contact

981
00:56:22,230 --> 00:56:30,660
list is is is is internal to the

982
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:32,580
provider and so the way the way you move

983
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,770
contacts from one provider to another is

984
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:37,348
you request your old provider to send

985
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:39,420
you a file of your contacts and then you

986
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:42,270
send that file to your new provider and

987
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:45,660
he uploads it into his service so the

988
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,700
the what the ROO spec makes that a

989
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:49,470
little bit better right it just it says

990
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,899
that you do they upload and download

991
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:53,069
with the ROO you don't have to have it

992
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:55,050
go from

993
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:57,180
you to your provider to you know and

994
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,550
then he sends you an email with with a

995
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:02,970
with a file and then you email that list

996
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:05,640
here to your new provider at least gets

997
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:06,689
rid of that part but doesn't do much

998
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,310
more than that

999
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,990
right it's just slightly better than

1000
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:15,810
where we are now the there there it as

1001
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:17,430
there are some equivalents as Adam said

1002
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:20,880
there's some equivalents that some

1003
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:23,160
providers have for handling contacts

1004
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,800
among the multiple devices supported by

1005
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:28,049
the same provider so if you know you

1006
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:31,260
have a mobile device and you have a a

1007
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:32,910
fixed device some providers do have

1008
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,100
services that allow you sync your

1009
00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:38,310
contacts between those that's done again

1010
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:42,000
within the service and and the the card

1011
00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:43,950
AB thing would would would give you as

1012
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,800
Adam said a subset of what some

1013
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:52,200
providers do you referring to Isaac

1014
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:54,930
Nauta eyes away yes Isaac um I I agree

1015
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,569
with what you said pretty much but I

1016
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:59,430
think there's to me there's a little

1017
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:02,550
unclarity still whether we're really

1018
00:57:59,430 --> 00:58:05,609
talking about the contact list or if

1019
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:09,540
we're talking about you know as a as a

1020
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:14,090
as a piece of data or or if we're

1021
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:18,570
talking about you know that contact list

1022
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:21,150
feature that the end user uses to search

1023
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:28,830
his contacts and pick somebody and use

1024
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:30,960
one of them to make a call and it makes

1025
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:32,819
a difference because I think implicit in

1026
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,350
this although it doesn't say it anywhere

1027
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:38,550
because we don't talk about the user

1028
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:44,759
interface is that with the respect is

1029
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:47,040
that this past this contact list

1030
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:50,420
mechanism is just a way to get the list

1031
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:53,490
of contacts into the root with the

1032
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:56,970
expectation that the ROO somehow or

1033
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:59,430
other you know provides its own user

1034
00:58:56,970 --> 00:59:04,200
interface to that contact list for the

1035
00:58:59,430 --> 00:59:04,899
user to use for making calls and that

1036
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:09,009
that

1037
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:11,470
mechanism then mean the boundary between

1038
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,780
the proprietary part and the non

1039
00:59:11,470 --> 00:59:16,600
proprietary part is this transfer

1040
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:19,210
mechanism whether it's whether it's you

1041
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:21,819
know carddav or whether it's you know

1042
00:59:19,210 --> 00:59:27,100
upload/download of the list of contacts

1043
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:29,230
you know and but that's that's different

1044
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:32,370
from a from a mechanism that assumes

1045
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:35,860
that there's like maybe a contact list

1046
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:39,549
application on the device that talks to

1047
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:42,520
some server mechanism on the provider

1048
00:59:39,550 --> 00:59:45,010
that that provides you know like a web

1049
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:47,530
interface or something to to the

1050
00:59:45,010 --> 00:59:50,380
provider she you know that that offers

1051
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:56,530
the the contact list mechanism to the

1052
00:59:50,380 --> 00:59:59,650
user my principle here I mean I think

1053
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:03,400
normally an end user nowadays I mean of

1054
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:05,410
course the you know they only transfer a

1055
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,480
contact list if they decide to use a

1056
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:09,250
different provider you know so it's

1057
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:15,190
something you do you know like once a

1058
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:17,530
year or something yeah and and so I

1059
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:20,950
think at least what we discussed it

1060
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:23,620
before the mechanism that you used to

1061
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:28,359
you know to transfer you yes you could

1062
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:31,450
requested you know a you know a transfer

1063
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:33,970
of the list but it wasn't real time it

1064
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:37,149
might take weeks to go or you know hours

1065
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:39,189
or something to get it and it was kind

1066
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:43,270
of like a manual process at the provider

1067
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:46,300
and or at least maybe not up a little

1068
01:00:43,270 --> 01:00:51,280
bit the you know the download each other

1069
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:54,040
ways which here I mean it certainly is

1070
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:58,420
imagine this is a real time function and

1071
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:02,080
that you know in principle it's just an

1072
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:04,420
optimization you know that if the if

1073
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:07,240
every time you turn your your room on

1074
01:01:04,420 --> 01:01:10,840
and it connected to the provider

1075
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:15,399
it might just load the contact list from

1076
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:17,839
the provider and then use it and you can

1077
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,910
use card out this to sync it which

1078
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:21,969
probably it's more efficient or it can

1079
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:24,049
dis transfer the whole thing which might

1080
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:29,479
depending how big your list is might

1081
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:31,369
take longer or might not but at the end

1082
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:36,259
of the day once it was into your device

1083
01:01:31,369 --> 01:01:38,059
you know all the mechanism for using it

1084
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:41,210
in your device would be local to the

1085
01:01:38,059 --> 01:01:45,589
device wouldn't wouldn't depend on an

1086
01:01:41,210 --> 01:01:47,029
interface to the provider okay and we

1087
01:01:45,589 --> 01:01:50,569
got other people in the queue Paul

1088
01:01:47,029 --> 01:01:53,180
you've had okay okay Adam I think you

1089
01:01:50,569 --> 01:01:55,130
were next Thanks so I think Paul

1090
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,749
actually has a good point but I believe

1091
01:01:55,130 --> 01:01:59,210
we can get away sorry Adam Roach

1092
01:01:56,749 --> 01:02:01,249
speaking as an individual I think we can

1093
01:01:59,210 --> 01:02:02,839
probably get away with just defining the

1094
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:04,519
interface here without having to get

1095
01:02:02,839 --> 01:02:05,808
into how the device uses I think like

1096
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:08,508
all the modes of operation Paul

1097
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:10,369
mentioned would be perfectly valid but

1098
01:02:08,509 --> 01:02:12,319
what I got up here was actually I wanted

1099
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:15,349
to probe a little bit at what Isaac was

1100
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:17,599
saying around the capabilities of B card

1101
01:02:15,349 --> 01:02:19,579
and J card given their extensible

1102
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,410
formats and the two examples that he

1103
01:02:19,579 --> 01:02:23,539
that I heard him give all this at least

1104
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:28,299
were visual caller ID which I presume is

1105
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:31,729
a picture based approach we like have

1106
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:33,950
contact pictures and then colors which I

1107
01:02:31,729 --> 01:02:36,529
presume is categories and both of those

1108
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:38,749
are actually supported by the current

1109
01:02:36,529 --> 01:02:40,849
vCard format so I'd be curious if we

1110
01:02:38,749 --> 01:02:42,499
could collect what the current

1111
01:02:40,849 --> 01:02:44,779
capabilities are used by these systems

1112
01:02:42,499 --> 01:02:46,640
and see whether there exists a good

1113
01:02:44,779 --> 01:02:48,849
mapping and it might even be worth kind

1114
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,200
of doing that analysis in the document

1115
01:02:48,849 --> 01:02:54,019
pointing out where things might not be

1116
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:55,788
obvious yeah but I I would be really

1117
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:56,930
surprised to the capabilities given that

1118
01:02:55,789 --> 01:02:58,880
it's extensible and I'm looking at the

1119
01:02:56,930 --> 01:03:00,919
innn and registry right now and it's

1120
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,380
like more than a full page on my browser

1121
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,359
of fields and it and put in these things

1122
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:06,650
I would be really surprised if they

1123
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:10,340
weren't covered in some way or another

1124
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:12,380
yeah Isaac

1125
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,479
[Music]

1126
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,739
yeah I just wanted a couple couple of

1127
01:03:14,479 --> 01:03:18,649
things I want to call out you know when

1128
01:03:15,739 --> 01:03:22,489
I think of like my iPhone and my Android

1129
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:24,200
phone you know that that's pretty much

1130
01:03:22,489 --> 01:03:28,549
what I have to do right I have to export

1131
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:31,939
my contacts from one phone and use use

1132
01:03:28,549 --> 01:03:34,069
some service or or some other utility to

1133
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:37,279
import on my other phone I don't really

1134
01:03:34,069 --> 01:03:40,038
expect like iCloud and I suspect Apple's

1135
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:42,109
iCloud to work with my Google phone or

1136
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:44,989
my Google contacts to work with my

1137
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:46,970
iPhone so seems pretty equivalent and

1138
01:03:44,989 --> 01:03:49,009
standard in the industry to have to

1139
01:03:46,970 --> 01:03:52,669
export to a file and import it on

1140
01:03:49,009 --> 01:03:55,489
another device on the on the caller ID

1141
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:57,470
the visual caller ID is more than a

1142
01:03:55,489 --> 01:04:00,229
picture which is pretty typical and

1143
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:05,720
standard for us it's actually a pattern

1144
01:04:00,229 --> 01:04:07,939
of lights and it's something that we do

1145
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:10,160
I don't I I don't think that other

1146
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:12,049
providers do it exactly the same and I

1147
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:15,140
think we and we do actually have a

1148
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:16,788
patent on that so the problem is is that

1149
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:20,690
there aren't really any standards

1150
01:04:16,789 --> 01:04:25,940
defined across providers for how some of

1151
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:27,920
those things are done so you kind of end

1152
01:04:25,940 --> 01:04:30,890
up with kind of a lowest common

1153
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:34,279
denominator of functionality across

1154
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:36,799
contacts which just doesn't seem ideal

1155
01:04:34,279 --> 01:04:39,799
and then I kinda think I agree with what

1156
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:41,749
Paul was saying where it's it seems odd

1157
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:44,019
to say that the provider has to then

1158
01:04:41,749 --> 01:04:46,430
provide this type of card day of service

1159
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:49,399
or it's really I think that's up to

1160
01:04:46,430 --> 01:04:51,529
whoever the room provider is if they

1161
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:54,640
want to do their own carddav service as

1162
01:04:51,529 --> 01:04:58,489
a way to manage contacts across devices

1163
01:04:54,640 --> 01:04:59,779
devices that's great but it doesn't

1164
01:04:58,489 --> 01:05:01,460
necessarily make sense to say for the

1165
01:04:59,779 --> 01:05:07,190
provider that the providers would need

1166
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:10,849
to do that Thanks so I've been I've been

1167
01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:13,400
listening to all this and and I think

1168
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:17,839
there's there are a couple things that

1169
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:19,729
occur to me and one is to reinforce the

1170
01:05:17,839 --> 01:05:24,319
notion of the difference between the

1171
01:05:19,729 --> 01:05:25,790
transport and the data format we're

1172
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:29,540
talking about

1173
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:33,200
a j-card which is extensible and already

1174
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:34,520
has a large list of attributes and then

1175
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:38,089
we're talking about the transport

1176
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:43,250
mechanism for that which is a file of J

1177
01:05:38,090 --> 01:05:48,740
cards or a sink of J cards and it does

1178
01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:51,290
seem to me that even if you had a set of

1179
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:53,839
features that is you had a set of user

1180
01:05:51,290 --> 01:05:56,150
characteristics that were associated

1181
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:57,710
with a contact that was proprietary you

1182
01:05:56,150 --> 01:06:01,370
could just use the extension mechanisms

1183
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:03,950
to carry that and you may not that data

1184
01:06:01,370 --> 01:06:04,819
may not go to another provider but they

1185
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:05,960
don't have any way of dealing with

1186
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,150
anyways because it's a proprietary

1187
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:11,930
mechanism which is fine as long as you

1188
01:06:08,150 --> 01:06:14,720
implement the standard stuff it's a

1189
01:06:11,930 --> 01:06:17,720
question of whether or not it's a good

1190
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,180
idea for the device to have the ability

1191
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:22,879
to manage contacts within itself and

1192
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:25,100
have the ability to obtain contacts from

1193
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:27,290
some service not specified who runs the

1194
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:30,710
service it just says the device that

1195
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:33,800
across the interface a file transfer of

1196
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:36,620
J cards and the carddav interface is

1197
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:38,240
support it and it seems to me that

1198
01:06:36,620 --> 01:06:40,880
though both of those are good things to

1199
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:43,220
do it doesn't prohibit you from

1200
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:45,050
extending it it doesn't prohibit you

1201
01:06:43,220 --> 01:06:46,970
from saying I don't supply the service

1202
01:06:45,050 --> 01:06:49,760
all I do is support the interface across

1203
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:51,740
it so the URI that you provision which

1204
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,240
is your card dam server doesn't point to

1205
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:56,000
you points to something else that's all

1206
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:58,069
fine but I think that the that that I

1207
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,910
think personally think that it's a good

1208
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:04,370
thing for the ROO to have to support but

1209
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:07,100
both the the upload/download and the and

1210
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:12,100
the sync mechanisms and one more thing

1211
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:15,279
and then then I'll let Adam talk I

1212
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:17,720
actually don't upload and download

1213
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:19,610
contacts anymore or haven't had to do

1214
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:22,790
that in a very long time sync across

1215
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:25,130
services works quite well across almost

1216
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:28,730
every service that I use because they

1217
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:30,510
all use the same standards now so that's

1218
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:33,390
just my experience

1219
01:07:30,510 --> 01:07:35,250
Adam Roach you actually covered almost

1220
01:07:33,390 --> 01:07:36,450
everything that I've got up here to say

1221
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:38,580
but I want to go ahead and put a fine

1222
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:42,120
point on three specific items the first

1223
01:07:38,580 --> 01:07:44,160
is that the J card and and B card format

1224
01:07:42,120 --> 01:07:46,890
specifically has ways to register

1225
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:49,529
vendors specific extensions for things

1226
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:52,109
like proprietary features the second is

1227
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:53,730
this the sync text journal like my phone

1228
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:55,350
right now my address book is

1229
01:07:53,730 --> 01:07:57,060
predominantly stored on Yahoo because

1230
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,190
they have an address book server that I

1231
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,990
can use card out with and that thanks to

1232
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:02,400
my other non apple devices with no

1233
01:08:00,990 --> 01:08:04,229
problems which is a really good

1234
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:08,130
real-life example of exactly what you're

1235
01:08:04,230 --> 01:08:09,600
talking about the third thing was

1236
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,460
related to the third thing you said and

1237
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:13,500
I can't remember what it was but it I

1238
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:17,819
pretty much agree with everything that

1239
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:18,779
you just said okay Todd like the one

1240
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:21,420
other thing I've had is if there are

1241
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:22,500
specific contact things that are you

1242
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:25,620
know surly useful for deaf and

1243
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:27,510
hard-of-hearing users that should be

1244
01:08:25,620 --> 01:08:29,640
standardized then we should saturd ice

1245
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:31,230
them I mean not oh yeah not as a cup of

1246
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,030
this working group but you know take

1247
01:08:31,229 --> 01:08:34,740
them to whatever group does card dev and

1248
01:08:33,029 --> 01:08:35,670
say hey hey here are some things that

1249
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:36,870
are specifically for deaf and

1250
01:08:35,670 --> 01:08:39,770
hard-of-hearing users what's a turd

1251
01:08:36,870 --> 01:08:42,210
Iceland yeah if they're not if there is

1252
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:43,950
there's not or something or even if

1253
01:08:42,210 --> 01:08:57,840
there are patents you know dude IPR

1254
01:08:43,950 --> 01:09:00,870
declaration oh yeah sure sure sure if if

1255
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:03,779
we if the text is clarified to make sure

1256
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:08,399
that it's not an implied that the URI

1257
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:10,800
that's the card dev server or the file

1258
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:13,410
upload download is not specified at who

1259
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:15,600
operates it is there an objection to

1260
01:09:13,410 --> 01:09:22,910
leaving the mechanisms as they currently

1261
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:24,470
are defined again

1262
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:27,590
happy to work on wording to make sure

1263
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:29,870
that it's it's clear that that it's not

1264
01:09:27,590 --> 01:09:32,270
implying that any particular operator is

1265
01:09:29,870 --> 01:09:34,069
running any particular service it's it's

1266
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:38,630
just that the interface itself supports

1267
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:41,319
both a file transfer and um it's you

1268
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:45,290
know it's it's web retrieval right it's

1269
01:09:41,319 --> 01:09:50,179
downloaded Jason a large JSON objects

1270
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:54,109
not really a file I see Paul and Isaac

1271
01:09:50,180 --> 01:09:56,240
Isaac I was gonna say that this seems

1272
01:09:54,109 --> 01:09:58,250
like it could work we would just need to

1273
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:00,969
see that text yeah

1274
01:09:58,250 --> 01:10:04,100
see what that looks like before yeah so

1275
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:10,310
thank you right great well we'll

1276
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:13,100
definitely do that Paul I just want to

1277
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:18,080
comment on this that it at least the way

1278
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:19,910
I use this stuff I mean yeah you know my

1279
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:24,769
phone you know I can sync to multiple

1280
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:27,050
places and I mean I can see here the

1281
01:10:24,770 --> 01:10:32,240
this configuration is a way to provide a

1282
01:10:27,050 --> 01:10:33,920
place to sync to that's it's links to

1283
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:37,599
the provider somehow whether they

1284
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,460
implement it or do it by referral but

1285
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:43,720
but like Adam suggested it may be that

1286
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:46,130
the user wants to have his own and so

1287
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:47,750
I'm not sure how it fits into the thing

1288
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:50,660
but I think there ought to be a

1289
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:55,700
mechanism for the fruit for the user to

1290
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:57,710
provide a place to sync to independent

1291
01:10:55,700 --> 01:11:00,620
what the provider provides I think

1292
01:10:57,710 --> 01:11:02,540
that's an excellent idea and and we

1293
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:05,120
definitely should do that that currently

1294
01:11:02,540 --> 01:11:06,500
it's it is part of the the provisioning

1295
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,090
but I think that that ought to be

1296
01:11:06,500 --> 01:11:09,980
separately provisional because if you

1297
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:12,170
like your contacts coming from Google

1298
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:16,519
instead of your provider then you should

1299
01:11:12,170 --> 01:11:19,040
be fully entitled to do exactly that so

1300
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:21,220
that's that's definitely thing to do for

1301
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,220
sure

1302
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:29,889
any anything else on on the subject of

1303
01:11:27,410 --> 01:11:29,889
contacts

1304
01:11:31,949 --> 01:11:36,570
okay so now is the big question of what

1305
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:40,049
do we don't you know what what else is

1306
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:41,699
there if you know we're not ready to

1307
01:11:40,050 --> 01:11:43,800
call for last call on the document I

1308
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:47,339
mean we're not and I'm not talking about

1309
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:51,660
that but I would like to know what other

1310
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:54,570
areas of the document people think need

1311
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:56,550
neat work what what where where are

1312
01:11:54,570 --> 01:11:58,290
there things that it currently don't

1313
01:11:56,550 --> 01:12:02,969
currently believe it is in the state

1314
01:11:58,290 --> 01:12:04,830
that it needs to be in and I'll you know

1315
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:08,400
I I know I've kind of sprung this

1316
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:10,290
question so I'm I'm not really asking I

1317
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,910
mean if people know things by all means

1318
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:14,820
come to the mic and let's have them now

1319
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:17,370
but this is more of a plea to go back

1320
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:19,110
through the document and bring up areas

1321
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:22,559
that you think need to be discussed that

1322
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:27,449
you don't think are ready to go that can

1323
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:28,830
be small stuff or big stuff but I am you

1324
01:12:27,449 --> 01:12:30,719
know we started out with a pretty good

1325
01:12:28,830 --> 01:12:33,360
draft we brought a whole bunch of issues

1326
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:35,489
up and we're working on those issues I'd

1327
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,320
like to know what other issues people

1328
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:40,019
think they are they that exist in the

1329
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:42,570
document so that we can start thinking

1330
01:12:40,020 --> 01:12:45,660
through what what we want to say so

1331
01:12:42,570 --> 01:12:48,030
that's as I say it's it's more of a plea

1332
01:12:45,660 --> 01:12:49,949
to read the document and send comments

1333
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:52,590
the list of what areas you think need

1334
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:55,290
more work then coming to the mic today

1335
01:12:52,590 --> 01:12:57,900
and tell me what what's bad I'll list

1336
01:12:55,290 --> 01:13:00,900
them I'm apologize for being late them

1337
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:03,420
possibly mr. discussion I'd rather draft

1338
01:13:00,900 --> 01:13:06,540
this morning and I found a number of

1339
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:09,449
occurrences with of the term with the

1340
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:15,679
understanding that and then the protocol

1341
01:13:09,449 --> 01:13:19,169
violation and I would like to have the

1342
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:21,900
well the behavior that was intended

1343
01:13:19,170 --> 01:13:24,630
spelled out rather than having the

1344
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:27,839
understanding that okay for instance

1345
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:32,280
there was a and there was mentioned that

1346
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:34,890
we don't use media stream tracks and but

1347
01:13:32,280 --> 01:13:38,449
it doesn't say what do you mean by that

1348
01:13:34,890 --> 01:13:41,969
so that if you instead put them with a

1349
01:13:38,449 --> 01:13:44,070
but we are not going to send the MS IDs

1350
01:13:41,969 --> 01:13:45,150
and we are going to ignore them on

1351
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:48,030
reception that's fine

1352
01:13:45,150 --> 01:13:50,070
I mean if you want to bake the standard

1353
01:13:48,030 --> 01:13:51,150
say exactly exactly how you should

1354
01:13:50,070 --> 01:13:54,389
behave when you break this knowledge

1355
01:13:51,150 --> 01:13:56,549
okay I will take that under advisement

1356
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:58,739
and go look at all those instances in

1357
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:00,510
and try and come up with good worried

1358
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:06,269
you know I may contact you for

1359
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:08,520
suggestions but thank you I yeah that

1360
01:14:06,270 --> 01:14:10,469
with the understanding that is usually

1361
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:14,159
not good standards language and I wrote

1362
01:14:10,469 --> 01:14:15,409
that so I should you know I shouldn't

1363
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:18,870
have said that

1364
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:23,519
when it comes you'd be done with that

1365
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:26,040
topic yes yes the one thing that comes

1366
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,560
to my mind was still this question

1367
01:14:26,040 --> 01:14:30,570
that's that we had a discussion for a

1368
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:38,370
while and then we dropped it a couple of

1369
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:41,309
times I think this thing about having

1370
01:14:38,370 --> 01:14:44,790
client certificates in order to verify

1371
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:54,110
that the device has been certified by

1372
01:14:44,790 --> 01:14:57,769
somebody that's still hanging isn't it I

1373
01:14:54,110 --> 01:15:03,509
that very there is no text currently

1374
01:14:57,770 --> 01:15:05,460
there there there is provisioning of a

1375
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:08,850
certificate for the purposes of doing

1376
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:13,860
mutual loss which we could drop if

1377
01:15:08,850 --> 01:15:16,860
people don't want it but that there

1378
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:21,139
isn't anything the the piece that's

1379
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:24,150
still there is the call info header that

1380
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:28,710
tries to tell you who where this thing

1381
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:29,879
came from yeah I I didn't think that's

1382
01:15:28,710 --> 01:15:34,890
what you were talking about here you

1383
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:37,590
were talking about client authentication

1384
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:39,719
there was a yeah I know you had it in

1385
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:43,219
there and it was unclear to people what

1386
01:15:39,719 --> 01:15:46,710
it was about I thought I cleared that up

1387
01:15:43,219 --> 01:15:50,070
well we answer discussion on the list

1388
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:53,880
yeah I believed what I remembered it had

1389
01:15:50,070 --> 01:15:55,710
originally been put in for which I got

1390
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:56,969
confirmation from some other people was

1391
01:15:55,710 --> 01:15:59,900
true but which

1392
01:15:56,969 --> 01:16:06,449
didn't come through in the spec yeah and

1393
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:14,030
it's uh it was it was intended as a

1394
01:16:06,449 --> 01:16:19,320
mechanism by which the vent

1395
01:16:14,030 --> 01:16:24,719
manufacturers of devices could get them

1396
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:29,190
certified and then they would get us

1397
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:32,010
assert that they used to prove that

1398
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:35,449
their device had been certified that the

1399
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:38,330
providers could use to screen out

1400
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:43,099
uncertified devices from that you know

1401
01:16:38,330 --> 01:16:46,019
disallow them from being connected and

1402
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:54,719
frankly I never believed that mechanism

1403
01:16:46,020 --> 01:16:56,580
as written worked and yet III the

1404
01:16:54,719 --> 01:16:59,430
providers have a desire for something

1405
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:02,760
like that I don't know a mechanism that

1406
01:16:59,430 --> 01:17:05,010
would work I mean obviously we have

1407
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:08,850
things you know like phones you know

1408
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:11,219
that they have certificates you know you

1409
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:13,590
know like Google store and stuff like

1410
01:17:11,219 --> 01:17:15,989
that that certify apps that you can load

1411
01:17:13,590 --> 01:17:19,440
into your device but the mechanisms for

1412
01:17:15,989 --> 01:17:26,040
those don't work in this circumstance

1413
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:28,440
and so I was kind of always personally I

1414
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:34,320
never understood why we had to have it

1415
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:36,799
but the providers wanted it as a safety

1416
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:44,280
mechanism for their network to keep out

1417
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:47,180
untested stuff and so if we're gonna try

1418
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:50,670
to do that the mechanism that's there I

1419
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:52,830
don't think it works for that purpose

1420
01:17:50,670 --> 01:17:58,050
and we would need to see if we could

1421
01:17:52,830 --> 01:18:00,269
find a different mechanism that did all

1422
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:04,340
right got two more people in the queue

1423
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:07,380
let's see what I can Steve have to say

1424
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:09,330
Isaac you're on yeah I agree I agree

1425
01:18:07,380 --> 01:18:10,150
with Paul I think this is definitely a

1426
01:18:09,330 --> 01:18:13,090
big concern

1427
01:18:10,150 --> 01:18:15,540
something that we definitely do need we

1428
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:18,670
need the ability to protect our systems

1429
01:18:15,540 --> 01:18:21,580
from hackers or anyone that might get

1430
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:27,159
their hands on this open source code for

1431
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:29,769
the Roo or VT RP and I I can see ways

1432
01:18:27,159 --> 01:18:33,879
that it could work where it's like you

1433
01:18:29,770 --> 01:18:38,790
know if if I'm if I the provider in the

1434
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:42,010
one building the Roo I can include my

1435
01:18:38,790 --> 01:18:45,610
clients cert which I only have the

1436
01:18:42,010 --> 01:18:47,679
private key for and so that I'm the only

1437
01:18:45,610 --> 01:18:50,830
one that's able to do that so that when

1438
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:54,520
that client connects to my system I know

1439
01:18:50,830 --> 01:18:57,460
that as it has been tested and won't

1440
01:18:54,520 --> 01:19:00,989
cause any issues on my system that could

1441
01:18:57,460 --> 01:19:05,199
affect my users ability to communicate

1442
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:08,919
so it's absolutely critical that we have

1443
01:19:05,199 --> 01:19:10,928
some mechanism so that we aren't just

1444
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:13,630
creating this open door for anyone to

1445
01:19:10,929 --> 01:19:15,940
connect into our system which is not

1446
01:19:13,630 --> 01:19:20,409
typical I think the example that's been

1447
01:19:15,940 --> 01:19:21,909
used as web browsers right and web

1448
01:19:20,409 --> 01:19:24,759
browsers are another place that you

1449
01:19:21,909 --> 01:19:26,469
might use a client cert so so you know

1450
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,120
my bank could do that my bank could say

1451
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:30,130
hey look here here's a client

1452
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:33,219
certificate install this on your browser

1453
01:19:30,130 --> 01:19:35,890
and this will ensure that you're the

1454
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:38,020
only one that can access your account it

1455
01:19:35,890 --> 01:19:40,980
frankly hasn't been used because it's

1456
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:44,530
it's difficult right from from a user

1457
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:47,669
perspective to have to get a certificate

1458
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:51,340
and understand how to install that and

1459
01:19:47,670 --> 01:19:53,590
so I think the example that was given

1460
01:19:51,340 --> 01:19:55,270
was that well any you know web browsers

1461
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:57,880
are open source anyone can go get that

1462
01:19:55,270 --> 01:20:01,179
code and they can go and connect to any

1463
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:03,670
web server and this is just the same as

1464
01:20:01,179 --> 01:20:05,949
that but it's not the same because it's

1465
01:20:03,670 --> 01:20:07,750
our communication system or the phone

1466
01:20:05,949 --> 01:20:11,500
company for the Deaf and we really have

1467
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:15,640
to protect our system and our users from

1468
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:18,850
any hacker or various actors that might

1469
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:21,369
want to do them harm so it's absolutely

1470
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:23,649
critical that we have

1471
01:20:21,369 --> 01:20:26,969
saying I didn't even I had a notice that

1472
01:20:23,649 --> 01:20:29,320
had been removed from the latest version

1473
01:20:26,969 --> 01:20:31,449
we need to get that back in and we need

1474
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:35,768
to figure out a way that we can make

1475
01:20:31,449 --> 01:20:37,598
that work written right now all it says

1476
01:20:35,769 --> 01:20:39,099
is during the establishment of a secure

1477
01:20:37,599 --> 01:20:41,019
connection with the provider of the room

1478
01:20:39,099 --> 01:20:43,539
may be asked by the server for a client

1479
01:20:41,019 --> 01:20:45,249
certificate in this case it should

1480
01:20:43,539 --> 01:20:48,249
provide the provisioned client

1481
01:20:45,249 --> 01:20:49,840
certificate see section 9.2 riders may

1482
01:20:48,249 --> 01:20:51,489
reject requests that fail to provide a

1483
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:54,519
recognized certificate that's what it

1484
01:20:51,489 --> 01:20:58,119
currently says it is there but it it's

1485
01:20:54,519 --> 01:21:00,669
it's it doesn't have its provisioned

1486
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:04,110
into the device and it's a certificate

1487
01:21:00,669 --> 01:21:06,639
right the in order in order for that

1488
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:08,799
we'd have to be talking about exactly

1489
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:11,679
who's owning what part of what thing

1490
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:14,110
that that that text is not very clear

1491
01:21:11,679 --> 01:21:15,820
about how that works but yeah you're

1492
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:18,009
right you're right so does there I see

1493
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:20,768
that now and I think that the example

1494
01:21:18,010 --> 01:21:22,629
that Paul gave previously was almost

1495
01:21:20,769 --> 01:21:25,989
something like an app store right like

1496
01:21:22,629 --> 01:21:29,169
as as an as an iPhone developer or I

1497
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:31,688
submit my ad to Apple they tested they

1498
01:21:29,169 --> 01:21:34,479
verify it works okay and then they make

1499
01:21:31,689 --> 01:21:37,360
it available on their App Store for any

1500
01:21:34,479 --> 01:21:41,050
user to to download and use on their

1501
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:46,869
phone there was really no other way for

1502
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:50,110
me to distribute an app to iPhone users

1503
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:52,929
without going through the Apple App

1504
01:21:50,110 --> 01:21:56,379
Store where they provide that

1505
01:21:52,929 --> 01:21:57,969
authentication now I don't it's like I

1506
01:21:56,379 --> 01:22:01,119
don't know how that that would work in

1507
01:21:57,969 --> 01:22:02,649
our scenario with the room but there

1508
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,409
needs to be something like that where

1509
01:22:02,649 --> 01:22:08,619
the providers can test and verify that

1510
01:22:05,409 --> 01:22:12,669
the clients won't cause any harm to

1511
01:22:08,619 --> 01:22:15,938
their system I'm gonna move on to Steve

1512
01:22:12,669 --> 01:22:17,559
and then we have Jonathan at the mic and

1513
01:22:15,939 --> 01:22:21,519
I'll probably have some stuff to say

1514
01:22:17,559 --> 01:22:24,579
hello to go on deceive sorry oh thank

1515
01:22:21,519 --> 01:22:26,289
you I was going to change subject so I

1516
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:28,509
was gonna say if there's any other

1517
01:22:26,289 --> 01:22:30,550
comments with the regards to this maybe

1518
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:34,149
we should continue at that before I

1519
01:22:30,550 --> 01:22:35,349
change subjects okay let's finish this

1520
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:39,699
up and then we'll come back to you

1521
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:41,440
okay all right I guess athletics I just

1522
01:22:39,699 --> 01:22:43,059
on the certificate thing I mean the

1523
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:44,469
reason why Apple is able to sign things

1524
01:22:43,060 --> 01:22:47,409
in the App Store is they sign the entire

1525
01:22:44,469 --> 01:22:49,750
app whereas this you're not uploading

1526
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:52,509
your entire Ruth software to the

1527
01:22:49,750 --> 01:22:53,889
provider so the provider is no guarantee

1528
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:55,599
that the Ruth software hasn't been

1529
01:22:53,889 --> 01:22:58,409
modified or indeed that somebody hasn't

1530
01:22:55,599 --> 01:23:01,900
just extracted a certificate from one

1531
01:22:58,409 --> 01:23:04,719
you know piece of Roo software and using

1532
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:07,598
it in their own you know to attack and

1533
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:11,250
you know honestly I feel like saying

1534
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:13,270
that you know you know you can't have

1535
01:23:11,250 --> 01:23:14,920
you know the implication that you can't

1536
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,360
have a you know open-source

1537
01:23:14,920 --> 01:23:18,909
implementation of a roo and point

1538
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,170
running on a PC you know that allows it

1539
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:21,070
allowed to connect to the system and

1540
01:23:20,170 --> 01:23:23,730
that you know deaf and hard-of-hearing

1541
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:25,630
users can't you know do their own

1542
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:27,218
development of their own endpoint and

1543
01:23:25,630 --> 01:23:29,650
make their own enhancements feels like

1544
01:23:27,219 --> 01:23:31,480
it's kind of locking down the system

1545
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:34,030
more than I would like

1546
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:35,230
mm-hmm I think you know in general if

1547
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:37,570
you're running a service on the internet

1548
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:41,079
you have to be have some way of

1549
01:23:37,570 --> 01:23:43,389
protecting from you know crazy you know

1550
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:44,769
from something you know attacking your

1551
01:23:43,389 --> 01:23:46,570
internet and I think the protection here

1552
01:23:44,770 --> 01:23:48,429
is you know what you actually have is

1553
01:23:46,570 --> 01:23:50,860
you don't know the endpoints offer you

1554
01:23:48,429 --> 01:23:52,090
know the person and if the if you have a

1555
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:53,829
user name and password that's attacking

1556
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:56,409
you well you can say we're shutting down

1557
01:23:53,829 --> 01:23:58,809
this person because they're not behaving

1558
01:23:56,409 --> 01:24:01,690
legitimately they're you know they're

1559
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:03,489
screwing with our system so send so you

1560
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:05,888
know block them out until we figure out

1561
01:24:03,489 --> 01:24:08,709
what's going on

1562
01:24:05,889 --> 01:24:12,639
yeah that's that's kind of my thinking

1563
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:17,770
that that I don't know a way to protect

1564
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:23,880
a piece of downloadable software from

1565
01:24:17,770 --> 01:24:27,369
modification by any number of tools or

1566
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,520
extracting the certificate out of that

1567
01:24:27,369 --> 01:24:34,320
code and and using that as a way to

1568
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:38,110
protect the other end as from from

1569
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:39,909
malignant software we you basically

1570
01:24:38,110 --> 01:24:44,739
can't do that we don't know how to do

1571
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:46,629
that and and that we there just isn't

1572
01:24:44,739 --> 01:24:49,030
that just that mechanism just doesn't

1573
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:50,140
work Adam Rhodes I wanted

1574
01:24:49,030 --> 01:24:51,820
to put a finer point on it's not just

1575
01:24:50,140 --> 01:24:53,680
that we don't know how to do that as we

1576
01:24:51,820 --> 01:24:55,719
don't need to do that because we have a

1577
01:24:53,680 --> 01:24:57,790
really good proof of existence of a

1578
01:24:55,720 --> 01:25:01,150
system that that handles this just fine

1579
01:24:57,790 --> 01:25:02,800
mobile phones right I can take my sim

1580
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:04,780
out of my phone and put it in any other

1581
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:06,190
phone without any validation to what the

1582
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:08,380
implementation of that phone has done

1583
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:10,389
you can get like cheap weird phones from

1584
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:12,190
all over the world that do heaven knows

1585
01:25:10,390 --> 01:25:14,140
what and as long as I'm able to

1586
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:15,700
authenticate it goes into the system and

1587
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:17,410
it's the same sort of setup right if I

1588
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,760
put it my sim into a phone that starts

1589
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:21,490
attacking the network they're gonna turn

1590
01:25:18,760 --> 01:25:22,900
off my access and the system is pretty

1591
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:24,490
well protected this doesn't generally

1592
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:27,700
happen but you know in theory it could

1593
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:29,230
and I think that engineering anything

1594
01:25:27,700 --> 01:25:37,559
more advanced than that is probably

1595
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:41,230
unnecessary Paul you dropped Isaac

1596
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:44,200
you're up yeah well like a SIM card

1597
01:25:41,230 --> 01:25:48,790
would be great right a SIM card provides

1598
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:52,630
a physical hardware ID that allows me to

1599
01:25:48,790 --> 01:25:54,250
verify that that is my user so I don't

1600
01:25:52,630 --> 01:25:56,410
think that's that's a good equivalent

1601
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:59,170
the type of attack we'd be worried about

1602
01:25:56,410 --> 01:26:01,930
would be like a brute-force attack so

1603
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:04,720
let's say I know my ex-girlfriends phone

1604
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:06,250
number and now I can go get the open

1605
01:26:04,720 --> 01:26:08,650
source code and I can fairly easily

1606
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:12,310
write a script that can just boot

1607
01:26:08,650 --> 01:26:15,150
brute-force attack the system to figure

1608
01:26:12,310 --> 01:26:17,890
out what the password for that user is

1609
01:26:15,150 --> 01:26:19,360
if I'm just doing a brute-force attack

1610
01:26:17,890 --> 01:26:21,640
like that then I don't know who that

1611
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:25,450
user is and I can't necessarily just cut

1612
01:26:21,640 --> 01:26:27,100
them off and then but again something

1613
01:26:25,450 --> 01:26:29,980
like a SIM card would be a great

1614
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:32,590
solution I just don't know what the

1615
01:26:29,980 --> 01:26:35,110
equivalent is for a software app that

1616
01:26:32,590 --> 01:26:37,270
doesn't involve an actual device I know

1617
01:26:35,110 --> 01:26:39,910
there are like Isom cards on like Google

1618
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:42,040
phones but I don't I think they'll still

1619
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:45,450
depend on a chip or mechanism within the

1620
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:49,450
actual device to make that possible

1621
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:51,670
Thanks Mayer real quick I can answer

1622
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:53,769
that yeah it's in terms of mobile phones

1623
01:26:51,670 --> 01:26:55,120
they we do have soft sims where these

1624
01:26:53,770 --> 01:26:56,470
are things that can be pushed out that

1625
01:26:55,120 --> 01:26:58,390
you don't have to have physical devices

1626
01:26:56,470 --> 01:27:00,340
that represent these and they're

1627
01:26:58,390 --> 01:27:02,240
basically certificates and so yeah the

1628
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,250
answer for how you do this in

1629
01:27:02,240 --> 01:27:08,150
software's certificates right you can't

1630
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:09,290
brute-force a search it's your yeah it's

1631
01:27:08,150 --> 01:27:10,639
not like you can do this sort of

1632
01:27:09,290 --> 01:27:12,950
credential stuffing the you would if you

1633
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:15,440
were validating with passwords and that

1634
01:27:12,950 --> 01:27:18,010
part we have right you can grab a client

1635
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:21,230
cert that's okay

1636
01:27:18,010 --> 01:27:22,850
correct right it certifies the user but

1637
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:24,910
it's in a way that again can't be it's

1638
01:27:22,850 --> 01:27:27,410
not subject to brute forcing or

1639
01:27:24,910 --> 01:27:29,630
credential stuff I don't object to

1640
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:34,750
having a client cert that part's fine

1641
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:34,750
but that is a user cert not a device sir

1642
01:27:35,440 --> 01:27:43,879
Paul yeah I think maybe you hit most of

1643
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:46,550
it now I don't think we're gonna solve

1644
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,410
this here today I think this needs more

1645
01:27:46,550 --> 01:27:50,480
discussion on the list and make sure we

1646
01:27:48,410 --> 01:27:55,580
come up with something that meets the

1647
01:27:50,480 --> 01:27:57,620
needs of the providers I the best thing

1648
01:27:55,580 --> 01:28:01,100
I've thought of that that I could

1649
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:06,550
imagine could work here is that the

1650
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:09,080
provisioning server would somehow run a

1651
01:28:06,550 --> 01:28:13,720
self-test or something on the device

1652
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:17,840
that satisfy itself that the device was

1653
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:19,220
acceptable before provisioning it or

1654
01:28:17,840 --> 01:28:22,310
something like that and then it can

1655
01:28:19,220 --> 01:28:24,350
provide the cert but at the end of the

1656
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:29,170
day it would be it I mean it would

1657
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:29,170
probably be a client cert you know and

1658
01:28:29,590 --> 01:28:39,740
well again if yeah if you if you have a

1659
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:43,570
sufficiently robust way of doing a

1660
01:28:39,740 --> 01:28:47,480
one-time authentication of a user and

1661
01:28:43,570 --> 01:28:50,389
you can issue him a cert based on

1662
01:28:47,480 --> 01:28:52,309
something that you trust that you know

1663
01:28:50,390 --> 01:28:58,390
who you're talking to or you issue that

1664
01:28:52,310 --> 01:28:58,390
certain then that cert is an unfortunate

1665
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:05,030
user he has to have the private key in

1666
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:09,140
order to be able to prove that he is

1667
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:12,320
what he is this is a mechanism that's

1668
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:15,230
that's different than what the providers

1669
01:29:12,320 --> 01:29:16,790
had originally imagined when

1670
01:29:15,230 --> 01:29:19,910
when the stuck was originally written

1671
01:29:16,790 --> 01:29:22,790
into the respec if we can determine that

1672
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:27,380
that and because the original one was on

1673
01:29:22,790 --> 01:29:29,090
a per application basis if you will you

1674
01:29:27,380 --> 01:29:32,750
know and I don't know how to make that

1675
01:29:29,090 --> 01:29:36,380
work but if if something like this can

1676
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:39,620
be shown to be to meet the providers

1677
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:41,210
needs then maybe we have a solution all

1678
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:43,340
right I think we just have to discuss it

1679
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,929
on the with all right well I'll start

1680
01:29:43,340 --> 01:29:46,489
that discussion on the list I agree that

1681
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:53,020
that's probably a good list discussion

1682
01:29:46,489 --> 01:29:53,019
rather than doing it here verbally I

1683
01:29:53,739 --> 01:29:58,459
will well we'll just do that we'll start

1684
01:29:56,660 --> 01:30:03,170
a discussion on the list and see where

1685
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:05,840
where it ends up are there any is there

1686
01:30:03,170 --> 01:30:09,890
anything else that people know they want

1687
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:12,100
to do yes Steve is now he wanted to

1688
01:30:09,890 --> 01:30:17,090
change the subject so now's a good time

1689
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:19,010
Steve great one question I have I'm not

1690
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:23,480
sure if this has been discussed is with

1691
01:30:19,010 --> 01:30:27,670
regards to 9-1-1 and provisioning the

1692
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:30,379
user um this is all from the arrests

1693
01:30:27,670 --> 01:30:34,190
respect you know how how does the person

1694
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:36,679
indicate their death and we're able to

1695
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:39,980
provision their home address for use

1696
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:43,420
with 9-1-1 services and are we going to

1697
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:49,519
be passing X Y coordinates to be able to

1698
01:30:43,420 --> 01:30:55,790
service their 91 one calls faster okay

1699
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:57,800
so I brian rosen and about as good of an

1700
01:30:55,790 --> 01:30:59,600
expert as you'll get on this I've been

1701
01:30:57,800 --> 01:31:03,800
heavily involved in all of these

1702
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:07,070
technologies for the last 15 years what

1703
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,290
the document currently says is that you

1704
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:12,920
have to be so you have to be compatible

1705
01:31:09,290 --> 01:31:15,350
with it with is what with what is

1706
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:18,770
colloquially called I three origination

1707
01:31:15,350 --> 01:31:24,080
meaning you suit you conform to RFC 68

1708
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:27,230
81 that's IP emergency calls

1709
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:29,010
that's what next generation 911 is in

1710
01:31:27,230 --> 01:31:32,719
the United States and there's equivalent

1711
01:31:29,010 --> 01:31:35,790
coming up in other countries there is

1712
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:40,110
provisioning in those services to

1713
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:43,710
support deaf users in a manner that's

1714
01:31:40,110 --> 01:31:48,480
much better than it is now I can help

1715
01:31:43,710 --> 01:31:52,410
explain what all of those things are but

1716
01:31:48,480 --> 01:31:55,349
what this the text currently says that

1717
01:31:52,410 --> 01:31:58,769
the the ROO device has to support 68 81

1718
01:31:55,350 --> 01:32:00,960
and that means that it can supply an

1719
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:03,450
address or the address can be supplied

1720
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:07,020
by the provider that handles the call on

1721
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:11,490
its way towards the 9-1-1 service it

1722
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:14,640
means that you can support 3-way video

1723
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:17,130
with the bridge at the at the peace app

1724
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:22,050
the 9-1-1 call center

1725
01:32:17,130 --> 01:32:25,080
it means that that all three media are

1726
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:26,910
supported all the way through from the

1727
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:29,700
user all the way out to the p7 and if

1728
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:34,530
necessary out to the responders so the

1729
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:38,010
root of that by conforming to 68 81 okay

1730
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:42,090
does does the ROO application allow for

1731
01:32:38,010 --> 01:32:47,090
the user to enter their address so that

1732
01:32:42,090 --> 01:32:53,690
it can be verified by our 911 services

1733
01:32:47,090 --> 01:32:57,930
um that we contract with right well so

1734
01:32:53,690 --> 01:32:59,759
you don't currently have any support as

1735
01:32:57,930 --> 01:33:01,290
far as I know none of the providers

1736
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:05,760
currently have any support for next gen

1737
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:09,690
9 1 1 you currently use the eye 2

1738
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:13,050
mechanisms which are void mechanisms to

1739
01:33:09,690 --> 01:33:16,830
the current inai non 1 system which are

1740
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:20,520
different in every way from how the next

1741
01:33:16,830 --> 01:33:23,390
generation 9 1 1 works the text is not

1742
01:33:20,520 --> 01:33:27,600
clear and could be made clearer about

1743
01:33:23,390 --> 01:33:32,220
whether the device can supply location

1744
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:36,210
and how if it did how it is verified and

1745
01:33:32,220 --> 01:33:38,460
I think that that your that that prompts

1746
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:40,500
me to write a note in the notes that

1747
01:33:38,460 --> 01:33:42,800
says we should clarify that in the in

1748
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:45,860
the document

1749
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,570
as a practical matter although the ITF

1750
01:33:45,860 --> 01:33:50,540
doesn't like it the way it's being

1751
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:54,139
deployed the location is supplied by the

1752
01:33:50,540 --> 01:33:57,320
provider or the the the network operator

1753
01:33:54,139 --> 01:33:58,969
the the the thing that provides the

1754
01:33:57,320 --> 01:34:01,719
calling service it would be the VoIP

1755
01:33:58,969 --> 01:34:04,760
provider in the case of a VoIP device

1756
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:06,590
rather than the end device the sixty

1757
01:34:04,760 --> 01:34:08,690
eighty one implies the end device

1758
01:34:06,590 --> 01:34:10,880
supplies location as a practical matter

1759
01:34:08,690 --> 01:34:16,369
that the location is being put on by the

1760
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:18,949
service so our our provider on that we

1761
01:34:16,369 --> 01:34:22,130
supply XY coordinates to our provider

1762
01:34:18,949 --> 01:34:24,049
but they require before they'll use

1763
01:34:22,130 --> 01:34:26,599
those XY coordinates that there is a

1764
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:30,679
physical address already assigned to

1765
01:34:26,599 --> 01:34:33,590
that that person yeah and they'll only

1766
01:34:30,679 --> 01:34:35,449
use the XY coordinates if if that person

1767
01:34:33,590 --> 01:34:38,570
has been quote quote validated or

1768
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:39,678
registered with them yeah I I understand

1769
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:43,820
what you're talking about I know all

1770
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:45,590
about these mechanisms so the standards

1771
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:52,360
that are referred to in the current

1772
01:34:45,590 --> 01:35:00,889
document support either XY X X Y Z or or

1773
01:34:52,360 --> 01:35:02,808
Civic or both and and again we could

1774
01:35:00,889 --> 01:35:04,340
clarify in the text whether or not the

1775
01:35:02,809 --> 01:35:06,739
device has to be able to be provisioned

1776
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:09,170
with its location or whether it can

1777
01:35:06,739 --> 01:35:11,629
supply X Y we can there there's

1778
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:15,650
insufficient text on that subject and I

1779
01:35:11,630 --> 01:35:18,559
will I will do that I will fix that okay

1780
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:19,940
because I did do a quick look for 911

1781
01:35:18,559 --> 01:35:22,520
perhaps I should have looked for

1782
01:35:19,940 --> 01:35:25,009
emergency services and see any mention

1783
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:33,429
of it so yeah doesn't say 9-1-1 it says

1784
01:35:25,010 --> 01:35:33,429
emergency services yeah battle thank you

1785
01:35:33,550 --> 01:35:46,010
I'm just writing the note about

1786
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:48,079
clarifying that in the text oh yeah yeah

1787
01:35:46,010 --> 01:35:50,179
when I make the note it's an emergency

1788
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:52,070
calls yeah yeah yeah yeah that's the

1789
01:35:50,179 --> 01:35:54,020
problem some urgency services so why we

1790
01:35:52,070 --> 01:35:56,759
we've got the UN that's what we really

1791
01:35:54,020 --> 01:36:03,840
use yes your answer

1792
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:05,850
SSS okay but that was a good Steve thank

1793
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:08,220
you for bringing it up that clearly is

1794
01:36:05,850 --> 01:36:10,860
something we need to improve and I was

1795
01:36:08,220 --> 01:36:13,200
kind of aware of that we also probably

1796
01:36:10,860 --> 01:36:15,870
could spill a few words about how how

1797
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:17,700
the current document only describes the

1798
01:36:15,870 --> 01:36:19,170
existing system I'm sorry the next

1799
01:36:17,700 --> 01:36:21,360
generation 9 1 1 it doesn't really talk

1800
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:23,790
about the existing system the device

1801
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:25,620
doesn't have to do anything for the

1802
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:28,670
existing system so that that doesn't

1803
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:32,930
mean anything but we could say that and

1804
01:36:28,670 --> 01:36:32,930
then it would be clear

1805
01:36:33,650 --> 01:36:39,210
Isak

1806
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:41,269
go ahead want to clarify on when you say

1807
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:44,130
the device doesn't need to do anything

1808
01:36:41,270 --> 01:36:47,100
what it does need to do what we do is we

1809
01:36:44,130 --> 01:36:51,240
give we provide the user a way to enter

1810
01:36:47,100 --> 01:36:53,520
their address that's pretty typical inai

1811
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:57,110
one one requirement you see on Vonage

1812
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:59,550
and other over-the-top VoIP providers

1813
01:36:57,110 --> 01:37:03,509
from what I've seen there I haven't seen

1814
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:05,160
anything in the Roo or the B a TRP so

1815
01:37:03,510 --> 01:37:07,470
far that has provided that same ability

1816
01:37:05,160 --> 01:37:12,420
for the user to simply enter their

1817
01:37:07,470 --> 01:37:16,680
address and/or a standard mechanism to

1818
01:37:12,420 --> 01:37:20,150
send that up to the provider so I think

1819
01:37:16,680 --> 01:37:23,430
that that's the key piece that's missing

1820
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:26,009
if if you want that provisioned in that

1821
01:37:23,430 --> 01:37:27,480
that would be fine typically what almost

1822
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:31,590
every service I know about does for that

1823
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:33,030
is is a web page I mean that is how

1824
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:36,210
vonage does it it's not in the phone

1825
01:37:33,030 --> 01:37:37,889
it's not in anything that that is it is

1826
01:37:36,210 --> 01:37:40,560
in the inning and any interface it's

1827
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:42,150
literally a web page so if you want

1828
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:44,700
something beyond that I mean I'm happy

1829
01:37:42,150 --> 01:37:47,639
to put that in it doesn't isn't the

1830
01:37:44,700 --> 01:37:49,710
problem to do that yeah I've definitely

1831
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:52,200
seen it in apps like Google Voice and

1832
01:37:49,710 --> 01:37:56,040
others but if it is a web page I think

1833
01:37:52,200 --> 01:37:58,170
then it's important to say that okay so

1834
01:37:56,040 --> 01:38:03,140
there's at least some way for the user

1835
01:37:58,170 --> 01:38:07,340
to get that address in yeah all right

1836
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:07,340
text about that all right

1837
01:38:08,940 --> 01:38:15,349
[Music]

1838
01:38:12,820 --> 01:38:16,519
just Adam Roach you might want to give

1839
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:18,230
some thought when you do that about

1840
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:19,730
exactly how it's going to interact with

1841
01:38:18,230 --> 01:38:20,928
authentication given that users are

1842
01:38:19,730 --> 01:38:22,280
authenticated in the system right now by

1843
01:38:20,929 --> 01:38:24,530
certificates and you're not going to get

1844
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:26,630
that on the webpage side of things makes

1845
01:38:24,530 --> 01:38:28,130
things a little bit more interesting so

1846
01:38:26,630 --> 01:38:30,410
yeah we might actually look at

1847
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:31,699
leveraging the sip signaling information

1848
01:38:30,410 --> 01:38:35,059
to convey this information to the

1849
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:36,169
carrier in some way okay I was writing

1850
01:38:35,060 --> 01:38:37,610
member if there was any register use

1851
01:38:36,170 --> 01:38:39,199
cases we used that for and I was about

1852
01:38:37,610 --> 01:38:40,400
to go looking but you know just keep

1853
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:41,419
that kind of thing in the back your mind

1854
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:44,210
and see if there's anything a little

1855
01:38:41,420 --> 01:38:47,050
more elegant that might be used here I

1856
01:38:44,210 --> 01:38:49,760
mean we can send a J card

1857
01:38:47,050 --> 01:38:56,239
all right put in call info we have a way

1858
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:58,310
to do that so yeah oh that does bring up

1859
01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,900
another one yes all ditional data it's a

1860
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:05,360
note to myself you don't know anything

1861
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:14,469
about it but I do okay I'll bring that

1862
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:14,469
subject to also what Mike what's that I

1863
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,989
was gonna ask if CalDAV works are these

1864
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:20,230
these are certificates I guess it can

1865
01:39:17,989 --> 01:39:27,199
but we'd have to okay well what kind of

1866
01:39:20,230 --> 01:39:30,290
Gunnar hi I you mentioned that for the

1867
01:39:27,199 --> 01:39:35,719
emergency call you need you will get

1868
01:39:30,290 --> 01:39:37,510
video on multi-party view you know we

1869
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:42,230
have a discussion going on for

1870
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:46,100
multi-party real-time text well you need

1871
01:39:42,230 --> 01:39:48,949
that as well I think you would all right

1872
01:39:46,100 --> 01:39:52,520
maybe I should just draw attention to

1873
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:57,379
what we are starting up in abt core we

1874
01:39:52,520 --> 01:40:00,489
have a new draft or a revived old draft

1875
01:39:57,380 --> 01:40:04,250
about multi-party real-time text and

1876
01:40:00,489 --> 01:40:08,839
that will be discussed tomorrow in a BT

1877
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:12,290
core and hopefully you can join there

1878
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:18,559
and discuss multi-party real-time text

1879
01:40:12,290 --> 01:40:24,829
because there is more needed in the

1880
01:40:18,559 --> 01:40:24,829
device than just receiving single media

1881
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:38,190
yeah I'm taking notes about that yep

1882
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:39,900
you're right okay dad I just won the

1883
01:40:38,190 --> 01:40:42,780
point I did went then look it up

1884
01:40:39,900 --> 01:40:44,969
so RFC 64 42 specifically allows the use

1885
01:40:42,780 --> 01:40:46,829
of the geolocation header field and

1886
01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:49,550
register requests which would be a

1887
01:40:46,829 --> 01:40:56,400
pretty cut-and-dried way to handle that

1888
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:58,800
mm-hmm all right does does allow that ha

1889
01:40:56,400 --> 01:41:03,860
yeah okay well we actually have the

1890
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,860
answer Adam I'll just write it down

1891
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:12,598
there's their security implications in

1892
01:41:08,670 --> 01:41:16,039
that but you have to just note it Yeah

1893
01:41:12,599 --> 01:41:16,039
right yep

1894
01:41:18,949 --> 01:41:32,219
okay well gee this is Steve is Steve

1895
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:36,749
yeah just a quick question Adam which

1896
01:41:32,219 --> 01:41:39,630
which RFC did you say was it 64 4 - yeah

1897
01:41:36,749 --> 01:41:42,300
I believe that's correct is that they're

1898
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:49,320
not coming up correctly what are you

1899
01:41:42,300 --> 01:41:51,869
looking - okay it's just one of the next

1900
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:57,110
or yeah it's it's it's the geolocation

1901
01:41:51,869 --> 01:41:59,759
header for Sep okay thank you yep

1902
01:41:57,110 --> 01:42:02,190
that's referenced in our document so

1903
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:07,889
there there's a reference to it in in in

1904
01:42:02,190 --> 01:42:10,619
the text you can find it anything else

1905
01:42:07,889 --> 01:42:13,139
people want to talk about other again

1906
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:14,759
I'm other things that are in that need

1907
01:42:13,139 --> 01:42:17,219
to be improved in the doc before we

1908
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:20,670
consider it done this will not be the

1909
01:42:17,219 --> 01:42:22,709
last time and we'll ask for that but the

1910
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:25,440
earlier we surface things that we need

1911
01:42:22,709 --> 01:42:27,739
to do the happier I'm going to be to get

1912
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,739
them done

1913
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:36,820
anything else well for the lack of

1914
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:39,360
people in room this was a very fine

1915
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:43,840
meeting and I appreciate all of you who

1916
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:49,030
most of you are in the u.s. staying up

1917
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:54,250
late and Gunnar what time is it for you

1918
01:42:49,030 --> 01:42:55,900
it must be really awful but I appreciate

1919
01:42:54,250 --> 01:42:59,080
your participation it's been great

1920
01:42:55,900 --> 01:43:03,070
having you on participating in it in the

1921
01:42:59,080 --> 01:43:04,630
meeting and I hope we'll be generating a

1922
01:43:03,070 --> 01:43:06,880
lot of lifts traffic as a result of all

1923
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:10,330
these discussions which is always what

1924
01:43:06,880 --> 01:43:13,410
we want to see and unless there's

1925
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:13,410
anything else I think we're adjourned

1926
01:43:16,110 --> 01:43:19,530
whatever it takes
