1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:10,860
back in not the same room smaller room

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,299
mr. kiss lucky reminds me that people

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,590
should fill this blue sheet out the blue

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,680
sheets out so we make sure to get the

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,480
right sized room next time it's

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,369
searching 20 we're gonna start the

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,570
meeting The Cider ops meeting if you're

8
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,169
not here for cider ops you're in the

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,029
wrong room for those presenting please

10
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:29,669
make sure to talk into the mic like this

11
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:32,970
hold the mic don't use the stand if you

12
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:35,070
do if it's in the standard you're doing

13
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:36,720
this I can't see here you either there's

14
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,460
a nice thing in front of the presenters

15
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:42,809
they can read that instead of doing this

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,809
also very nice we have a yep you can

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:50,309
laser point to it like you can see what

18
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,660
I'm pointing at I can't see what I'm

19
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,489
pointing it doesn't work on the LCD it

20
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,328
works over here

21
00:00:52,489 --> 00:01:03,959
we're in cider ops in ietf 106

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:11,360
I am Mauro see and that is care we have

23

who'd like to type on the keyboard

28
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:31,910
during the meeting okay perfect we'll

29
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:40,800
well delay Natalie can take notes

30
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:47,190
minutes they're called strawberry man is

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,390
here yes I'll make my attempt next time

32
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,830
tonight hi there oh the other thing for

33
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,420
the people that are presenting medico

34
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:58,950
would like you to stand on the pink

35
00:01:51,420 --> 00:02:04,680
square Randy bush pink square you'll see

36
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:07,970
when you get up here cross fine whatever

37
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:17,100
it's a parallelogram it's seven parallel

38
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:18,910
lines five of which are transparent okay

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:29,640
somebody else will got that

40
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm sure okay ready Joe it's coming okay

41
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,970
okay okay okay good we'll just move

42
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,290
ahead blue sheets for those who didn't

43
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:41,710
get them earlier we could pass into the

44
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:44,140
back there's a note well for the meeting

45
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:46,030
I'm sure that by this day of the meeting

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,769
you've seen this a few times it's in

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,090
small print intentionally it doesn't

48
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,490
have all the resources that's further on

49
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:57,310
okay so today we have six presentations

50
00:02:54,490 --> 00:03:02,290
not counting this one hopefully will be

51
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,550
done quickly with our part those times

52
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,739
are approximate they probably don't add

53
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,790
up to the right time I didn't pay

54
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:11,020
attention so strat draft statuses

55
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,190
there's some stuff that we have to push

56
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,320
into the editors queue out of working

57
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:17,109
group last call there's at least two

58
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,359
things I think here yeah yeah maybe a

59
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:21,610
couple of more the last thing in iest

60
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,900
processing is LTI use cases I think

61
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:25,030
that's stuck for a long time and I don't

62
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,690
exactly remember why it'll pop out

63
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,500
eventually and the things that are

64
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,060
probably the ones that need to go into

65
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,350
the editors queue are things like OB

66
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,940
egress I think somebody's complained

67
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:36,820
about that I mean sorry I sent a message

68
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,829
about that a couple the others here at

69
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,560
will as well so we'll hear about those

70
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,630
I'm sure at the mic and afterwards we'll

71
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,060
scrape through the land list and figure

72
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:52,918
it out okay first person up is Tim

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:52,919
[Music]

74
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,920
almost a square almost

75
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,260
[Music]

76
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:25,040
which one is yours called alright so

77
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:27,680
deprecate rsync why well first off as

78
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,560
you know our sink is used in the RPI so

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,670
is another protocol that was invented

80
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:36,440
here

81
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:40,850
RDP so the RPI repository Delta protocol

82
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,060
for friends and what I'm proposing here

83
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:45,110
I I made a draft just in my own name it

84
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,290
doesn't have to stay like that I'm

85
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:49,220
actually looking for some people I

86
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,170
mentioned to me that they want to

87
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,240
co-author as well but I wanted to get

88
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,740
out so they get something out quickly so

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,530
I did that but before going into all of

90
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:04,640
that a quick reminder why why did we

91
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:08,119
invent the Delta protocol there you can

92
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:09,830
talk about this for longer but mainly in

93
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:13,490
order to run an R sync repository

94
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,450
reliably it's not that easy

95
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:21,230
and with RDP you can leverage CDMS so

96
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:23,510
the job becomes a bit more yeah less

97
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,340
challenging I would say and also from

98
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,490
the relying party point of view

99
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,229
most software ends up calling the arcing

100
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:33,160
binary on a system which may have

101
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:35,330
different behaviors on different systems

102
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:40,840
those would be my top reasons why I

103
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:43,520
would want to get rid of it how well

104
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,500
this might be controversial so it's here

105
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,299
intentionally because I think we should

106
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:53,810
have discussion about this pragmatically

107
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,170
speaking I propose to keep the rsync

108
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:59,120
your eyes even though a repository might

109
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:01,400
not be available at that location and

110
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,800
the reason is that if we update the

111
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:06,679
certificate profile this can lead to

112
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,110
things be becoming rejected and that

113
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,740
will make deployment much harder there

114
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:15,530
is some prior art in an XML where

115
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,630
namespaces are HTTP your eyes quite

116
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:20,719
often and their main

117
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:22,640
be anything there I don't particularly

118
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,260
like it I think it's ugly but on the

119
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:29,900
other hand we do need names for things

120
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:31,880
for debugging and yeah I don't I'm

121
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:35,179
trying to avoid breaking things and

122
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:40,520
that's why I'm proposing us so but you

123
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:42,800
know we can have that discussion also we

124
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:47,450
could instruct relying parties to prefer

125
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:50,960
our DP if it's available and well

126
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:55,610
ultimately phase out our sync

127
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,530
but when well there's a bit of a chicken

128
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,970
and egg problem here I didn't find good

129
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:02,570
pictures of chicken and eggs maybe I

130
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:04,670
didn't look well enough but essentially

131
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,080
this is the situation you have many

132
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:09,110
repositories you have many relying

133
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,690
parties and the relying parties talk to

134
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,430
all the repositories and repositories

135
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:21,020
will need to support our thing as long

136
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:23,750
as can only drop support for our sink if

137
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:26,419
all the relying parties support the

138
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,250
alternative and vice versa our relying

139
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,050
parties can only drop support for our

140
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:34,940
sinker and all the repositories support

141
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:36,320
the alternative and I think measurement

142
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:38,930
should turn into that because if you

143
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:42,320
look at the wrote there then Randy wrote

144
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:45,410
a proposal actually that can work but

145
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,290
I'm not sure that we have to tie it on

146
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:49,670
to that but to repeat what you said

147
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,350
Randy and you can correct me later if

148
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,600
I'm wrong is that well you can start

149
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:55,760
from the repository side you can say now

150
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:58,820
you all go support our DP once that's

151
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:02,000
done and you have the green button right

152
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:04,550
here right so they all supported and you

153
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,140
could say to our Peas well some of you

154
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:08,000
support it most of you support it but

155
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,930
please now all start supporting it and

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,550
then you can measure with in recession

157
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,590
measurements whether people actually

158
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:19,070
deploy these new versions and at some

159
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,609
point you can now say ok now the

160
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:24,469
repositories can phase out parsing but

161
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,290
in my view I'm not sure that this should

162
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:30,660
be a heavy segment of the document I

163
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,099
think in the eventual document that

164
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,220
final document that you probably not be

165
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:36,419
there at all in my view because I think

166
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,640
it should just talk about what it

167
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:41,728
updates but of course this is an

168
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,090
important discussion to have in my view

169
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:47,700
I think we aim for having everybody move

170
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:51,630
forward in parallel because I don't see

171
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,450
why that cannot happen meaning that we

172
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,720
would ask relying party software

173
00:08:53,450 --> 00:09:00,750
implementers to it also support RDP even

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,540
if not all the repositories already have

175
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:06,360
it so

176
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:08,189
but first questions and well this is not

177
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,200
even a working group document so that's

178
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:16,640
also another question that it might go

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:16,640
to the list so the floor is yours

180
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:28,830
Jeff Houston

181
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:32,030
there were many mistakes and bad ideas

182
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:37,290
in the original work that developed this

183
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:39,540
and one of them was a sink I actually

184
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:43,740
think that the problem that we got given

185
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:47,640
which was the entire x.509 distributed

186
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:49,800
repository mess and the inability to

187
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,840
sort of smash them all together was was

188
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:57,530
was a really terrible problem to get

189
00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:00,690
given and opportunistic pool was a

190
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:04,709
solution clutched out of desperation

191
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:07,680
rather than a hard design the problem is

192
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:12,270
actually reliable flooding of

193
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:15,390
information right and we're doing that

194
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:19,290
by opportunistic grab in N squared mesh

195
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:25,230
and it just seems to be wrong and when

196
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:27,089
you rephrase it as flooding reliable

197
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,280
flooding in you actually look at

198
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,310
protocols like BGP which is actually a

199
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:36,050
reliable flooding algorithm and if you

200
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:40,140
think that you don't necessarily have to

201
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:42,719
do routing information and route objects

202
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,160
bgp is actually an amazing protocol as

203
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,370
many other people have used for many

204
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,189
other

205
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,589
purposes if I tell you something I told

206
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:50,490
you I never retell you you never have to

207
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:51,990
ask me again

208
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,570
I've told you it for the life of the

209
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:56,880
session the whole issue around the way

210
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:59,370
it gets flooded is actually not a bad

211
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,900
approach and I kind of wonder if we're

212
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,680
going to drop all this stuff about a

213
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,410
sink and replacing it with yet another

214
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,469
opportunistic grab holding algorithm you

215
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,079
have kind of exchanging one model of

216
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,770
anchor for another neither of them flow

217
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:18,779
and although I might be accused of going

218
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:19,980
well the perfect shoulds the enemy of

219
00:11:18,779 --> 00:11:22,529
the good here I thought we could do

220
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,310
better and if the abstract problem

221
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,140
really is

222
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:28,469
I want reliable flooding of what's

223
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:31,140
inside repositories maybe we should look

224
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:33,390
further afield than just replacing the

225
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,029
underlying mechanism of this particular

226
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,670
protocol and look at an architectural

227
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,120
sense and go other alternatives we can

228
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:44,160
piggyback then actually do do reliable

229
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:46,680
flooding so that when I publish in my

230
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,800
repository it just flows through

231
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:52,050
everyone else so that's what I would

232
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,029
urge us to think about before simply

233
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:58,760
just going to this particular solution

234
00:11:54,029 --> 00:12:04,040
because it doesn't change a lot thanks

235
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:06,510
yeah can only respond to that because

236
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:09,569
well in my view it's it's quite

237
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:12,150
interesting to look at BGP as a plotting

238
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:14,279
protocol for this but I think there will

239
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,510
be many things that need to be figured

240
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:18,890
out and it's going to be a while before

241
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:21,600
that's a reality at this moment I think

242
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:25,170
supporting our sink is impacting people

243
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,790
and it's low-hanging fruit to do that

244
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,040
first of all so in parallel you can look

245
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:33,959
at alternatives at least that's my my

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:40,370
take on it video photo spherical I

247
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:40,369
oppose using BGP for flooding this

248
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:49,310
before

249
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:51,529
before before I retire I don't know

250
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,770
whether some research group will be

251
00:12:51,529 --> 00:13:00,170
looking into more optimal solutions than

252
00:12:54,770 --> 00:13:07,029
this some problems with arsenic are

253
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:10,310
known the RDP has been developed as a

254
00:13:07,029 --> 00:13:17,290
probably working solution we do not have

255
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:21,020
the proof in actual scaled operations I

256
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,959
think I think we need some something

257
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:30,260
there some document that explains the

258
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:35,980
roadmap for actually getting forward for

259
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:46,430
the question of how eggs and poultry are

260
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:51,170
bred my take is actually actually the

261
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:54,290
repositories have to move first that

262
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,540
does not preclude getting the

263
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,860
implementation for clients quite

264
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:03,849
obviously if the road map says the

265
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:07,630
repositories actually should work on

266
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:11,390
providing a reliable service before

267
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:14,900
clients start to rely on them or even

268
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:24,530
start to do large-scale operational

269
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:27,650
testing now and yes kind of a fixed a

270
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:31,220
fixed time schedule I think is not going

271
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,390
to work the schedule has to has to be

272
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,240
conditioned alized

273
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,480
on criteria that say well okay if we

274
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:43,220
achieve that kind of operational status

275
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,800
on the repository side we we tell we

276
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,370
tell we tell client sites to move

277
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:48,370
somewhere

278
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:58,459
I dima from our Kista open source a

279
00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:03,189
relying party project team I like your

280
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:07,130
idea but I'm wondering whether you have

281
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:09,580
extreme nose with repository manager so

282
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:13,750
whether it is it easy for there to

283
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,750
support Delta protocol

284
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,390
well I no longer work for the ripe NCC

285
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,610
but we deployed there uh-huh

286
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:28,010
and there's some experience there and I

287
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:30,560
think we're all new software there's an

288
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:33,470
initial phase of getting it right I

289
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:37,280
think the tricky part of that protocol

290
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:38,870
is generating those files reliably but

291
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:43,610
serving them on the other hand is quite

292
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:46,970
easy but I agree also at what routing a

293
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:49,790
said that we should build a operational

294
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:54,230
experience with running this but some

295
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:58,120
people have been doing that so

296
00:15:54,230 --> 00:16:01,640
particularly the ripe NCC and Edenic and

297
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,550
others are in the process of developing

298
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:07,960
and employing as well thank you so oil

299
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:10,969
information are you our test bed I think

300
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:20,570
Delta is a watch is walking much better

301
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:24,040
than I think Wendy Bush are kissing i oj

302
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:27,560
I don't think Jeff went far enough and I

303
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:31,670
and I don't think Jeff went far enough

304
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:36,560
and I have and I have a t-shirt that

305
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:40,579
says BGP awarding PhD theses since 1994

306
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,800
and I think other bullish males pushed

307
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,960
BGP down our throats when we really

308
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:52,969
should have considered idrp more

309
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:55,850
seriously I have also a problem Tim with

310
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:59,840
the chicken and egg because that is not

311
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:04,569
the case there is a sequence that gets

312
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:11,480
you both poultry and dinner

313
00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:17,629
and and do you have a problem with the

314
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:20,720
sequence I suggested I mean do you have

315
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:23,809
another sequence which doesn't drop

316
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,780
stuff on the floor oh yes you did the

317
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,559
end I think we may actually mean a very

318
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:34,370
similar thing what I mean to say is that

319
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,860
I would encourage relying party

320
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:40,250
implementers to already start supporting

321
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,840
our DP definitely right and and I don't

322
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:45,620
want to wait until all the repositories

323
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,668
have it right but it doesn't mean we've

324
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:48,709
done that already

325
00:17:46,669 --> 00:17:52,370
no I think some still need to implement

326
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,669
oh well now haven't we encouraged all

327
00:17:52,370 --> 00:18:01,158
right oh maybe but if we put it in a

328
00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:03,440
document so are you suggesting a

329
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:07,130
document that only stops at encouraging

330
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,200
them or lays out the whole sequence I'm

331
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,350
into mind about including a sequence I

332
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,690
think is useful during this discussion

333
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,340
and the coming period but if eventually

334
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,890
you have a document that updates the

335
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,220
existing standard documents I'm not sure

336
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,419
that it should still include a road map

337
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,830
but you can have a road map whilst

338
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:26,419
you're talking about this stuff and

339
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,490
maybe keep it in a document because it's

340
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:29,929
a convenient place to put it but once it

341
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:31,970
becomes our of seed and I'm not sure

342
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:35,030
that a road map is going to get outdated

343
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,679
I'm afraid but maybe you should take

344
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:38,780
this offline it's not that I finally

345
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:41,210
oppose it but I don't want to end up

346
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,350
with a document that is going to be out

347
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:46,850
of date the moment it's published and

348
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,280
you have that risk when you include road

349
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,320
maps in it I'm perfectly happy with

350
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:58,030
documents that go out of date once

351
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:59,179
they're successful two minutes left

352
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,470
jokes

353
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:08,240
nighters NTT OpenBSD I would be

354
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:12,620
supportive of offering let's call it a

355
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:17,150
BCP titles using our Seng to distribute

356
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:20,469
our P key is considered harmful and it

357
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:23,030
is good if the ITF puts out a signal to

358
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,620
publishers and consumers of the

359
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:27,050
published information that our Seng is

360
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:31,969
not the preferred method to disseminate

361
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:34,850
this data if in an appendix to such a

362
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,970
documents a roadmap is included that may

363
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:41,810
be beneficial but at least statements

364
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:43,430
need to be published that we do not like

365
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:50,780
our sync and we need to state why we

366
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:53,780
don't like our Seng for this purpose Rob

367
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:55,460
lost Arkus and Dragon research labs a

368
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:57,230
couple of comments with a claisen said

369
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,120
they were running out of time first of

370
00:19:57,230 --> 00:20:01,190
all two people who didn't quite get

371
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,340
Tim's comment about why we want to keep

372
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,600
the arson to our eyes um

373
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:08,149
the problems would definitely basically

374
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,740
have us hashes because we very very

375
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:12,620
carefully removed all identifying

376
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,880
information from the RPK oh and the only

377
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,379
thing that was left as the authorized if

378
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,880
you take your eyes away to them what you

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,680
have is hash it's lots and lots and lots

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,340
of hashes which gets kind of confusing

381
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:25,430
pretty quickly on secondly I slightly

382
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,679
disagree about the marshalling the data

383
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:29,540
into our DP being difficult actually

384
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,600
it's not yeah we hit limit of this what

385
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:35,030
four years ago um we had to

386
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,070
reimplementation zuv our see a code that

387
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,649
is because our CA code was in retrospect

388
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,389
designed badly it should have been doing

389
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,290
basically a transactional model to begin

390
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:44,510
with as soon as you go to a

391
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:45,800
transactional model this is just you

392
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:50,000
generated Delta a for every transaction

393
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:52,370
done it's trivial there are a few

394
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,340
interesting characteristics on the RP

395
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,780
side though in particular when you're

396
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,020
dealing with a very very large

397
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:01,690
collection like the ripe ncc collection

398
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,980
the validation behavior is different

399
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,300
okay if you've got I'll just use this

400
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,010
poster children uh throwing rocks of

401
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:09,710
anybody poster children you have a pea

402
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:11,360
neck as the you know holdouts for the

403
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:12,140
least efficient possible way of doing

404
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,320
arson

405
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,070
and you have Reitman CC as the early

406
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,659
adopters for a big one of our DP the one

407
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,429
nice thing about the rather strange

408
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,770
think the de pinna cause is you can kind

409
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:26,960
of do all the crypto in parallel right

410
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:29,270
fetch it fetch d fetch and the fetch is

411
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,320
so slow that by the time time you're

412
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:34,160
done fetching you've also done all the

413
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,629
validation with the right model it's a

414
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,370
little stranger than that with the right

415
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:39,530
model you have to wait wait Rance fir

416
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:42,379
and process and suck into the database

417
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:44,330
which unfortunately is slow all of that

418
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,070
data before you can start validating any

419
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,300
of it really and it maybe there's some

420
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,580
efficient way to do it I haven't figured

421
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,899
out yet but to first approximation you

422
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,939
have to eat the whole update apply all

423
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,440
the deltas and unfortunately databases

424
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:56,510
tend to be bad about doing this quickly

425
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:59,050
and then you have to do all the

426
00:21:56,510 --> 00:22:02,870
validation is this massive chunk so the

427
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:04,190
behavior is a little different I think

428
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:08,030
this protocol is actually pretty much

429
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:09,890
ready whether or not we are ready to

430
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:11,720
deprecate our sink is a different issue

431
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:17,030
but I think this I think this protocol

432
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:20,570
is mature enough to go sorry Rob are you

433
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:24,220
saying to adopt it then or adopt it and

434
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,220
just straight during your bless call

435
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,750
that I was not actually expressing a

436
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,340
straightforward opinion about whether or

437
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:36,100
not we had to just throw our sit got the

438
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:36,100
airlock at this point in time okay

439
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:44,510
should we yeah but I guess I'd need to

440
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:46,689
send out to the list yeah and but thanks

441
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,100
for feedback I think that who else and

442
00:22:46,690 --> 00:22:53,290
yeah also available for offline

443
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:53,290
discussion about this this week

444
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:14,870
mr. Asimov think this one no no this one

445
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:17,780
no this one no I don't know one two

446
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:24,260
three four five six maybe they came last

447
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:27,050
minute I didn't we could do that

448
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:32,260
good work let's see I don't know that I

449
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:37,340
got them right here

450
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:43,570
what are they called oh yeah no I didn't

451
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:45,949
upload those for sure too much going on

452
00:23:43,570 --> 00:24:02,030
don't you

453
00:23:45,950 --> 00:24:05,090
is there when you want to start with we

454
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:08,000
could do that yeah let's maybe we'll try

455
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,379
that of course now I don't have my chair

456
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:18,140
slides I have no idea who's next

457
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:25,760
hold on Oh Randy how about Randy mr.

458
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:29,620
Bush here's our easy to find Europe and

459
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:39,850
we'll do uh then we'll do mr. asthma

460
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:39,850
clear okay so back many many years ago

461
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:52,330
we drafted this document and essentially

462
00:24:46,730 --> 00:25:00,620
it's transfer of resources between two

463
00:24:52,330 --> 00:25:02,060
registries known asses and IP numbers by

464
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:07,189
registering the rest of this discussion

465
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:11,200
we mean ISPs our IRS NIRS etc we're not

466
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:15,409
going to transfer between two I Anna's

467
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,590
it should be doable and we kind of have

468
00:25:15,409 --> 00:25:21,440
to do it fairly often actually how often

469
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:25,939
do you do transfers Nathalie often she

470
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,190
says okay and just to get some

471
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:32,750
terminology

472
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:37,610
there's the seller and the buyer and the

473
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:39,950
swing point is the I are at the lowest

474
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:43,100
point in the hierarchy which the seller

475
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,909
and buyer has a common parent and which

476
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,850
is agreed to act as the agent if this

477
00:25:46,909 --> 00:25:52,970
one doesn't agree their parent could be

478
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:56,090
the swing point is what subtly mentioned

479
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:58,549
there and there was actually an internet

480
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,340
draft I'm not sure whether it became an

481
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:03,950
i or i've seen or not that talked about

482
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:08,240
parents grandparents acting with

483
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:10,460
authority I don't remember that that it

484
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,309
didn't make it to RFC yeah I remember

485
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:15,590
writing it because of this problem but

486
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:18,139
anyway I'm gonna breeze through this

487
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:22,360
fairly quickly because the point of this

488
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:26,240
exercise is really not transfer okay

489
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,760
simple transfer is the seller separates

490
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,690
out the resources and tells the swing

491
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,539
point the swing point without deleting

492
00:26:32,690 --> 00:26:38,809
these resources without the leading this

493
00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:45,500
delegation creates and gives them to the

494
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:47,690
buying I are okay the swing point

495
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:49,909
delegates to the buyer and then the

496
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:57,860
swing point withdrawals from the seller

497
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:59,809
when agreed okay and Steve Kent said

498
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,149
he's going to write up something I

499
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:04,970
jokingly called the torn euro protocol

500
00:27:02,149 --> 00:27:07,039
which is they tore a euro bill each of

501
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:09,500
them has it and when both of them turned

502
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,700
that bill into the swing point when the

503
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:19,669
swing point receives both halves then it

504
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:22,700
can withdraw but until then both

505
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:27,570
delegations are active

506
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:29,730
because we want make oh this is just a

507
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:32,309
side you know hey you can have things

508
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,230
where the sellers double indirect you

509
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:39,330
can have things where the buyers double

510
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:45,540
indirect you know who cares there's a

511
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:49,350
problem or that you want make before

512
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:53,850
break you want both of these active at

513
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:58,439
the same time because possibly circuits

514
00:27:53,850 --> 00:28:01,379
are moving possibly other administrative

515
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:06,929
problems are occurring in that transfer

516
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:11,040
and actual operation of the internet is

517
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:15,540
depending on both of these being make

518
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:20,970
before break the point of my story today

519
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:25,320
is the our IRS have are driven by

520
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,840
underlying data which I'll call stats

521
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,490
files but you know some of them call

522
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,530
them something else some of them have

523
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:36,960
their authoritative data hidden and the

524
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:38,580
stats files merely a realization of it

525
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,840
but it makes the difference this is a

526
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:48,000
sit the problem is these files I believe

527
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,928
in all the RI ours are one-to-one

528
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:59,280
mappings this resource may only be owned

529
00:28:51,929 --> 00:29:06,150
by one are up one I are at a time which

530
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:08,760
means break before me okay now there's

531
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,010
no blame seemed like a good idea at the

532
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,950
time

533
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:20,750
okay and the question is how do we help

534
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:27,300
the our IRS get out of this position

535
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:30,960
okay so the our p-a-k-i

536
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:34,550
structure can do it it's real easy it's

537
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:42,790
the our IRS have a problem

538
00:29:34,550 --> 00:29:42,790
with these one-to-one mappings okay so

539
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:50,570
what we have today is not operationally

540
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:57,400
viable there I was brought to my

541
00:29:50,570 --> 00:30:02,928
attention by an LIRR who actually broke

542
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,820
okay so where do we go with the transfer

543
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:08,150
document shall we move it forward or not

544
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:13,189
I don't know and how do we help the are

545
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:16,250
the our IRS become unstuck from this

546
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:26,570
problem and I think that's my last slide

547
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:31,160
I managed to stay on the degenerate

548
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:37,309
square very good four minutes for

549
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:40,570
questions Oh Dutch Telecom I seem to

550
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:45,590
remember that Steve Kent at some point

551
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:50,770
did draft that allowed some outside of

552
00:30:45,590 --> 00:30:59,110
rpki signalling of something like this

553
00:30:50,770 --> 00:31:04,220
being in process and first of all

554
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:08,409
criteria for relying parties that wants

555
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:13,280
to check whether the are PKI certificate

556
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:18,020
system actually looks reliable quite

557
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:22,340
obviously include include the criterion

558
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:26,059
that it looks very suspicious if a

559
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:33,230
resource is claimed by two parties in

560
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:37,210
parallel signaling when this is actually

561
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:45,100
intended and authorized is something

562
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:45,100
essentially needed there as far as rir

563
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:51,350
keeping of data

564
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,859
it would seem to be fairly

565
00:31:51,350 --> 00:32:00,029
straightforward to have to have markers

566
00:31:55,859 --> 00:32:08,129
to have a notation on resources

567
00:32:00,029 --> 00:32:10,980
this is outgoing and potentially a time

568
00:32:08,129 --> 00:32:15,090
limit and it would be nice to have that

569
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,909
published so that discriminating relying

570
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:21,149
parties actually can figure out if they

571
00:32:17,909 --> 00:32:30,179
see strange things in the classic words

572
00:32:21,149 --> 00:32:32,518
of Vince parallelo send code I think uh

573
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,639
problem I think there's a lot of

574
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:42,179
software tied to those stats files is

575
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:45,840
the problem a points of a job Snyder's

576
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,999
ntt a point of clarification I would

577
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:54,080
like to ask you are you talking about

578
00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:54,080
transfers inter area or in Tran re era

579
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:06,658
we see the problem today in truck RI are

580
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:11,899
the problem I believe exists inter-rir

581
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:14,820
and so now I mean having been the first

582
00:33:11,899 --> 00:33:16,758
victim or actually I wasn't a victim I

583
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:21,749
was very happy with the experience of

584
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:27,059
transferring between RI ours um it was

585
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:28,859
made before break so since we're

586
00:33:27,059 --> 00:33:34,440
venturing into the political landscape

587
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:37,889
anyhow there may be use cases where it

588
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,549
is desirable that the transfer only half

589
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:49,109
completes and the certificates continue

590
00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:54,389
to coexist in multiple re ours from a

591
00:33:49,109 --> 00:33:57,289
redundancy perspective inter-rir is

592
00:33:54,389 --> 00:34:00,959
probably simpler in the current universe

593
00:33:57,289 --> 00:34:03,408
due to the perverse political situation

594
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,409
yes

595
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:08,730
and I think this work is very much worth

596
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,770
considering and progressing through this

597
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:11,940
working group so I'd be interested so

598
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:14,668
yeah we gotta do something

599
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,940
actually I know what we have to do I

600
00:34:14,668 --> 00:34:20,730
think is helping the our IRS figure out

601
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,040
how to not make not break before make

602
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:30,560
moving the transfer document is

603
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:30,560
something we can do at our leisure right

604
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:35,790
yeah no I'll keep it really sure I think

605
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:39,659
we should talk about this offline

606
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:43,429
I read the document I never get scared

607
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:46,139
of the mechanics that are proposed and I

608
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,750
think we can aim for simpler solutions

609
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:51,540
and I'm not yet convinced that you need

610
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,699
to signal these things to anybody

611
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,340
looking at the rpi maybe you can

612
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:59,220
leverage the provisioning protocol let's

613
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:00,930
have a talk this document it sits in my

614
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:08,910
memories this document doesn't suggest

615
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:11,640
that I'm saying I'm not sure that you

616
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:15,180
need the signaling of the intent to have

617
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:16,859
a transfer done in the aapki I and if

618
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:21,990
you do I'm not sure that this is the way

619
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:24,720
to do it but that's for the sake of time

620
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:25,919
maybe have the discussion not right here

621
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,370
right now because I don't think there's

622
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,370
time for it

623
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:48,279
was it long as quick for an attempt at

624
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:50,540
code I get the nasty idea the RI hours

625
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,480
presented us with an applicability

626
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:57,430
statement as an internet draft that

627
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:00,890
pointed to a certain file for

628
00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:04,750
disambiguating potential conflicts in

629
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:08,900
the rpki it would be very simple I guess

630
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:11,920
to add in that file another column that

631
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:18,350
says okay this resource is moving

632
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:20,450
somewhere this is a nasty comment and I

633
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:23,720
don't think I don't think it is actually

634
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:31,970
going to work but it might be actually a

635
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:34,310
practical way right okay on the break

636
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:36,290
side for example provisioning protocol

637
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:38,660
you ask a question to your parent you

638
00:36:36,290 --> 00:36:40,430
say what are my entitlements it tells

639
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:42,740
you what they are it might be less than

640
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:45,140
what you have there's no grace period

641
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:47,990
for example that's one thing you might

642
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:50,900
consider that you can communicate to a

643
00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:53,270
child that something will be shrunk go

644
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:56,840
clean up that's one thing you can think

645
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:59,509
of on the side of initially initiating

646
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:01,250
all this there's a lot of line processes

647
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:04,910
involved as well so I'm not sure that

648
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:06,560
the rpi should be driving this I'm not

649
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,450
even sure that anybody else needs to

650
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,500
know that a thing is going on but if you

651
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,540
do then yes

652
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:13,970
currently the proposal is to create a

653
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:15,230
separate certificate with all the

654
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,419
resources that are going to be

655
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:20,750
transferred on it I'm not sure that

656
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:22,730
that's the way to do it you can also

657
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:24,620
invent a signed object that says these

658
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:28,730
resources are going to be transferred I

659
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:31,430
would think that's already easier so

660
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:34,430
just you know we can have more

661
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:38,419
discussion but that's at the beginning

662
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:40,730
of it and a quick question for you about

663
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:44,900
where do we go from here there were lots

664
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:46,120
of comments that you got and job said

665
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,970
this is

666
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:51,400
work that this working group can take so

667
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:55,299
do you want to switch your call on this

668
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:57,310
I did I think there's two bull bullets

669
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:59,530
here and I think what we're strongly

670
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:09,070
agreed on is the second one which is not

671
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:10,960
pushing a document okay the Straz mob

672
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:14,230
leave we have your documents now

673
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:21,640
although if you're a telex thing to

674
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:25,830
reload okay

675
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,830
max length second one

676
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:31,089
[Music]

677
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:37,779
hello everyone my name is Alexander

678
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:44,259
Asimov I work for Yandex and this will

679
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:48,520
be a rather quick update thanks about a

680
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:50,770
spade rats during this year Randy with

681
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:53,680
fighting with me to make the draft less

682
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:55,810
ambitious to have clear description

683
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,899
about the procedures that are present in

684
00:38:55,810 --> 00:39:06,250
this draft and these slides is another

685
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:23,110
tenth that's failed so the cookies not

686
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:26,710
working try this that's not the right

687
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:31,240
one but oh it's this thing the other

688
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:34,000
fullscreen oh yeah sorry son take it

689
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,919
please is an oversimplified description

690
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,250
of the solution without no feelings and

691
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:44,410
unknowns and so on so there is a drafts

692
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:46,210
suggest two procedures first procedure

693
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,490
for prefixes that I received from

694
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,100
customers and peers and the second

695
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:55,330
procedure for prefixes that I received

696
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:57,640
from providers and for if we are

697
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,269
receiving prefixes from the customers

698
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,449
and peers the only

699
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:04,758
pair so that may exist in the ice bath

700
00:40:02,449 --> 00:40:07,130
is custom to provide a custom to provide

701
00:40:04,759 --> 00:40:10,999
a custom to provider as you can see CA

702
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:13,130
here if we detect a single pair that is

703
00:40:10,999 --> 00:40:15,499
provided at a customer or at least it's

704
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:18,140
not accustomed to provide a source sorry

705
00:40:15,499 --> 00:40:24,158
for ambiguity of these slides its

706
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:28,788
invalid path the downstream path it may

707
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:32,509
have both upstream path and downstream

708
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:35,449
sub path and but each fit is followed

709
00:40:32,509 --> 00:40:38,929
again by an upstream path it's a route

710
00:40:35,449 --> 00:40:40,099
lik so don't look at this light its

711
00:40:38,929 --> 00:40:44,869
listen what about what I'm speaking

712
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:47,119
about it's very simple and very hard to

713
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:50,719
describe not in gold but with words and

714
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:54,229
slides so there were also questions

715
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:57,799
about deployment process I and it's very

716
00:40:54,229 --> 00:41:00,259
important to bring immediate benefit for

717
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:04,159
the ice be who will be the first one to

718
00:41:00,259 --> 00:41:07,339
sign first a spay record and a speed

719
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,679
desert because as soon as it signs a

720
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:12,499
spay record it gives a chance to other

721
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:15,169
parties to detect mistakes around leaks

722
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:18,198
so it's very poor to know islands you

723
00:41:15,169 --> 00:41:20,868
know cooperation which just works for

724
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:25,159
malicious activity it's slightly a

725
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:28,339
harder process but it's not that hard so

726
00:41:25,159 --> 00:41:31,369
you need to create royal records - so

727
00:41:28,339 --> 00:41:33,529
it's a it's also up to you and your

728
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:36,589
security also relies on your upstream

729
00:41:33,529 --> 00:41:38,659
providers if you have happy to be t1 you

730
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:41,209
are not relying to or to anybody so it

731
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:43,819
uses an is period so this the only thing

732
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:46,519
that is needed to protect you from

733
00:41:43,819 --> 00:41:49,219
yourself from malicious activity if you

734
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:54,919
are tired - you rely on your upstream

735
00:41:49,219 --> 00:41:56,869
providers so the change look I hope - it

736
00:41:54,919 --> 00:41:58,569
will not be an additional ambiguity so

737
00:41:56,869 --> 00:42:00,649
it is rather simple

738
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:04,459
after the suggestions in the mailing

739
00:42:00,649 --> 00:42:06,828
list we changed a spay profile from

740
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:10,638
players that were customer and provider

741
00:42:06,829 --> 00:42:12,920
to pairs where we have customer and set

742
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,310
of providers to solve Possible's you

743
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,190
musician issues we also added another

744
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:22,520
state for verification procedure which

745
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:25,610
is unspecified so we have valid invalid

746
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:28,670
unspecified it will not be that's useful

747
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:32,480
at the state of owner adoption but can

748
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:35,210
give your additional debug opportunities

749
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,660
at the state of middle adoption or high

750
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:42,050
adoption rate I've added some beautiful

751
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:45,649
drawings that shows how the state

752
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:49,100
between valid in validity unknown are

753
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:52,280
changing I'm sure you if this made the

754
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,650
draft more readable but I hope you

755
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,050
enjoyed it and this enjoyed it and with

756
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:59,630
good first implementation on top of that

757
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:04,700
many things goes to yogini become asif

758
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:06,040
and andre such as ik i hope i pronounced

759
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:10,460
it rightly

760
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:14,360
I know that there is another

761
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:18,740
implementation coming so we're we're

762
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:21,520
good here so and now action plan please

763
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:25,129
read the drafts we need your feedback

764
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,580
because we need at least another person

765
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,560
which will start telling me that's the

766
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:34,250
way I'm writing text ruining the

767
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,080
principle of least astonishment so if

768
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:39,560
you want to at least work to proceed

769
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:43,190
quickly please give us feedback help us

770
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:46,040
to work on the text another on outside

771
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:49,490
we will receive your feedback work on it

772
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,370
and we'll try to finish working on the

773
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:54,319
text until the next ITF meeting rain

774
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:58,490
they also promised that he will work on

775
00:43:54,320 --> 00:44:01,220
archaea protocol and so this is the last

776
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:04,490
missing part so we will have three

777
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,430
drafts one profile one verification and

778
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:10,250
a data that is supposed to go together

779
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:16,129
to the working group Lascaux so that's

780
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:20,320
all Randy Randy Bush Jai anarchist Randy

781
00:44:16,130 --> 00:44:23,320
promise to do the RPI router protocol

782
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:23,320
when

783
00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:31,640
um object was clearly designed and

784
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:35,630
clearly not very significantly changes

785
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:37,700
they all document progresses I'd agree

786
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:41,619
and since we have changed their profile

787
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:48,049
if we have a stable version of object

788
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:51,350
and secondly I really think the draft

789
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:54,860
needs some reading by a couple other

790
00:44:51,350 --> 00:45:01,299
people because some of the authors are

791
00:44:54,860 --> 00:45:04,640
in disagreement of its clarity yeah

792
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:08,440
hands up for this please read the draft

793
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:12,589
give us feedback it's very important

794
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:15,710
all right profile drafts in particular

795
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:19,280
that's what any other one and I left a

796
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:21,320
comment on the list I wanna eat here so

797
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,540
this is not a big deal but only the

798
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:25,640
customer is actually needs to be present

799
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:29,270
only and entity certificates in the

800
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,250
signed object and I would think it would

801
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:34,220
be good to recommend people that they

802
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,980
don't include anything else because if

803
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:39,230
you do then you run an unnecessary risk

804
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,570
because of any of those resources are no

805
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:44,300
longer held by the certificate signing

806
00:45:41,570 --> 00:45:46,850
that ASPA object and the whole ASPA

807
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,980
object become invalid and i think it's

808
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:52,819
easy to avoid you can just have the one

809
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:54,200
a yes only and then so yeah yeah thank

810
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:57,109
you for the comment and thank you for

811
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:59,710
your previous comments that you

812
00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:05,150
highlighted possible issues with the

813
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:07,910
pair of provided customer I think the

814
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:11,240
CAC the text currently says that the

815
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:15,140
object is valid as long as the customer

816
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:19,299
a s is in the set that is on the EE

817
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:22,549
certificate and I would suggest that you

818
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:25,460
keep that EE certificates small in terms

819
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:27,830
of resources because you only need to

820
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:30,109
have that a s that customer s there you

821
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:31,670
don't need anything else so I wouldn't

822
00:46:30,109 --> 00:46:34,310
include anything else because if you do

823
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:36,820
that's just a avoidable risk of things

824
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:36,820
that can break

825
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:48,830
really do you give up yeah okay

826
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:51,920
this is my second set of slides and they

827
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:54,200
are not related to any draft but I

828
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,040
believe they can bring variable

829
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:59,930
considerations for this working group so

830
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:05,720
and we will discuss as you see much

831
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:06,919
length the default behavior normally

832
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,899
when we are speaking about default

833
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,000
behavior or default settings by

834
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:15,490
expecting that these kind of settings

835
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:18,860
are working in most of cases and for a

836
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:21,950
current advocare object roll the default

837
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:25,280
behavior suggested to be drop invalids

838
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:30,350
now rejected methods don't accept in

839
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:33,440
minutes so when route becomes invalid

840
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:35,868
there are two options first option if

841
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,860
the reason is match in the outer own

842
00:47:35,869 --> 00:47:42,800
sister numbers and the second option is

843
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:45,580
that the prefix length is bigger than

844
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,540
the length specified in the row object

845
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:52,400
so as you have already guessed so we

846
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:59,690
will spend next five minutes discussing

847
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:01,880
I if max length applicable for with the

848
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:06,710
default suggestion that such with such

849
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:20,960
rounds should give it a rejected and it

850
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:27,380
can a move forward I'm sorry some types

851
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:31,220
I included yeah there will be another

852
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:35,359
type us on the next slide so I'm sorry

853
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:38,689
it's not a thick it's AfriNIC so I've

854
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,720
tried to contact all current reuse to

855
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:43,670
find out what are their default settings

856
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,359
when people are creating much length

857
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:49,850
because as you know the the hosted our

858
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,569
creation of rows is the current

859
00:48:49,850 --> 00:48:56,120
so nearly all of them while answering

860
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:59,150
just seems to think they're looking at

861
00:48:56,120 --> 00:49:01,100
the prefixes detective at the moment and

862
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:06,860
creating marks length that is equal to

863
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:15,799
the prefix length look from now but

864
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:19,820
there are okay but there are a couple of

865
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:23,240
problems first if we all took the site

866
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:26,630
of ingress filtering you cannot drop

867
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:29,810
invalid in case of custom sending your

868
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:32,270
air black hole from egress site is just

869
00:49:29,810 --> 00:49:34,640
the same so if you are sending a black

870
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:38,480
hole route you cannot just blindly drop

871
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:41,960
invalids and it is related to Rudi girls

872
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,520
draft and she is already in line but

873
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:45,170
there is another issue let's say let's

874
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,140
take a look from the security

875
00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:50,270
perspective from the security

876
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:52,700
perspective in a perfect world where is

877
00:49:50,270 --> 00:49:55,130
a pacaya is globally deployed we will

878
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:00,560
have raw and I hope will also have a

879
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:03,770
spare objects and to stop both malicious

880
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:06,590
activity and mistakes we don't need max

881
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:09,020
length and there is another point and it

882
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:11,350
is more crucial at the state because it

883
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:17,990
happens at the state of partial adoption

884
00:50:11,350 --> 00:50:24,380
imagine you are the possessor of Network

885
00:50:17,990 --> 00:50:28,850
/ - 23 and you have created rows with

886
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:30,620
help of some web interface and your

887
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:34,640
supervisor is a good fellow

888
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:38,509
and here already using a rotation

889
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:41,540
procedure but somewhere another guy

890
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:44,870
makes it typos and he hijacks your

891
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:48,680
prefix and it's going to be propagated

892
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:51,620
and there is it's not specific and you

893
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,330
cannot fight it because you first need

894
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:55,430
to update roles after that you need to

895
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,819
call your action provider okay if you

896
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:58,040
are using

897
00:50:55,820 --> 00:51:01,250
egress filtering itches a slightly

898
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:04,360
simpler but again it's it's doesn't

899
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:07,630
provide it in a way to fight

900
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:12,500
militias are not malicious but mistakes

901
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:14,840
rapidly so it's great additional

902
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:19,940
security risks at the states of partial

903
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:22,970
adoption until it's already here it's

904
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:27,350
I've copied it yesterday from NIST and

905
00:51:22,970 --> 00:51:30,649
it says that a half of invalids that are

906
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:35,600
in the world for correct are consistent

907
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:40,070
number and incorrect Marsland there are

908
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:42,560
networks that have already put to this

909
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:45,650
issue into consideration and some of

910
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,290
them are sitting max length to the L to

911
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,780
the maximum values as it's possible this

912
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,000
way I said yes it turned into to fix

913
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:56,510
this issue because I was thinking about

914
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,700
this risk a couple of years ago but

915
00:51:56,510 --> 00:52:01,340
recently I've learned from several

916
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:03,589
players for some of them have very big

917
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:07,340
names this so they are already hacking

918
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:11,120
on top of apical cache so the increase

919
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:14,690
in max length on their side to accept

920
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:18,470
invalids from their peers and from their

921
00:52:14,690 --> 00:52:21,080
customers and of course it is all

922
00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:25,879
connected what is set by default in

923
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:27,799
hosted CAS in routing registries I'm not

924
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,160
giving you any kind of solution at the

925
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:33,440
moment but I'm asking this working group

926
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,980
do you consider this as a problem that

927
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,800
should be taken into account if and if

928
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,280
you think we should work on this issue

929
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:49,070
let's discuss possible solutions right

930
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:51,830
again okay there is in my opinion

931
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:57,530
absolutely no question the correct

932
00:52:51,830 --> 00:53:03,190
default for brewers is a simple row with

933
00:52:57,530 --> 00:53:06,430
max length equal to V traffic's length

934
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:11,890
that's the basic that's the basic rule

935
00:53:06,430 --> 00:53:14,810
the max length the max length longer

936
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:17,109
might be something that should be only

937
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:20,230
available in expert mode

938
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:22,180
the user interface after after

939
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:25,750
examination that people have a rough

940
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:28,919
idea what they are doing may enter at

941
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:32,170
you and ask you is a co-author of egress

942
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:36,430
filtering how do you see deployment

943
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:39,100
process of these draft if the default

944
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:41,319
policy and drop-in reddits is not

945
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:43,660
working for the leaves because I'm not I

946
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:47,410
don't think that the target audience of

947
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:49,810
this draft is dr. chili con I when I

948
00:53:47,410 --> 00:53:52,450
first saw this draft I said I was

949
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:54,790
thinking all great so they're stupid

950
00:53:52,450 --> 00:53:58,870
guys will protect themselves from making

951
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:01,360
mistakes but if if it's not working by

952
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:09,549
default I'm not thinking they will

953
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:21,610
deploy it i I have I have to think about

954
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:25,420
it but kind of I I guess that well okay

955
00:54:21,610 --> 00:54:29,790
if roars if well okay if you if you want

956
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:34,170
if you want to have to pass to pass

957
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:38,680
routes that are actually invalid with

958
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:46,270
Nami I don't well I heard you asked

959
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:51,790
about yesterday when we talked the day

960
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:54,009
before yesterday yeah I could have some

961
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:57,880
more radical thinking about this issue

962
00:54:54,010 --> 00:55:01,030
at the moment I believe that if you flip

963
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:05,980
the coin and even much length for the

964
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:08,410
experts instead even the default like is

965
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:13,710
specified for example by some companies

966
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:23,410
that already see the risks it might be

967
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:26,980
flying from the box well if for my own

968
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:29,430
network for your own network it is quite

969
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:32,579
it is quite clear over egress

970
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:34,890
will help me to shortcut stupid

971
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:40,710
misconfigurations that my colleagues are

972
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:44,400
doing for customers for customers a kind

973
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:47,599
of the ingress policy will ensure that I

974
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,430
will not accept invalids they are in

975
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:53,730
except for the cases where we have a

976
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:56,640
special agreement and that special

977
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,950
agreement quite certainly you have will

978
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,279
have implications for special handling

979
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:06,868
on the egress site if there is actually

980
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:09,180
a egress side yeah but again I really

981
00:56:06,869 --> 00:56:12,589
regret that not all companies in the

982
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:17,359
poles at Deutsche Telekom and into the

983
00:56:12,589 --> 00:56:19,890
okay okay okay okay I will not least

984
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:25,740
each company that is at present in this

985
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:29,069
room but anyway but take into account

986
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:31,709
the idea that there as far as I

987
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:34,290
understand the target audience for

988
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:38,010
egress draft is Leafs

989
00:56:34,290 --> 00:56:39,869
and to make it working at least site you

990
00:56:38,010 --> 00:56:42,869
make you need to make it as simple as

991
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:46,680
possible the principle keep it simple

992
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:49,290
stupid is the only way to make it and to

993
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,230
make it work to make it global or not

994
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:53,849
global even but it is partial doctor not

995
00:56:52,230 --> 00:56:58,020
only by but big players because I'm not

996
00:56:53,849 --> 00:57:00,930
afraid of you I'm afraid of this jeff

997
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:03,480
has trying to keep this short the max

998
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:05,430
length stuff is obviously advice to the

999
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:07,200
global internet at large this is what

1000
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:08,058
the global Internet should be seeing for

1001
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,558
these things

1002
00:57:08,059 --> 00:57:12,869
the misconfigurations we tend to see

1003
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,619
here are often things that you want to

1004
00:57:12,869 --> 00:57:18,540
have no longers show up for some scoped

1005
00:57:16,619 --> 00:57:20,609
purpose in many cases now the black

1006
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:22,799
holes typically need to go 1a s over

1007
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:25,140
same thing is true in many cases of

1008
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:26,609
various types of te routes no something

1009
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,990
that might be a little bit longer than

1010
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:30,180
what you're really good announce to the

1011
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:32,368
world at large the two things that can

1012
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:33,899
be done here is that the parties that

1013
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:36,359
are next to each other that are

1014
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:38,490
cooperating can just simply configure

1015
00:57:36,359 --> 00:57:40,200
something into their system that says

1016
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,729
that we're willing to ignore the rpki

1017
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:42,720
answer for this because we've otherwise

1018
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:45,000
done validation

1019
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,149
we know that this is a valid origin it's

1020
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,230
following the paths for my filters and

1021
00:57:47,150 --> 00:57:51,780
I'm willing to accept it because it's a

1022
00:57:49,230 --> 00:57:54,510
little bit longer the other thing that

1023
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:57,150
could be done is that maybe provide some

1024
00:57:54,510 --> 00:57:59,670
sort of hint into the RO objects

1025
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:02,750
themselves for these narrow scopes of

1026
00:57:59,670 --> 00:58:05,310
things that it's okay if you are here

1027
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:07,140
but for your more general case of you're

1028
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:08,670
seeing something much longer and trying

1029
00:58:07,140 --> 00:58:10,609
to mitigate an attack I think that's a

1030
00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:14,250
much harder problem to solve

1031
00:58:10,609 --> 00:58:19,080
okay thank you for coming yep job

1032
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:21,720
Snyder's ntt it is quite tricky to at

1033
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:24,180
this stage of the game fiddle with the

1034
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:26,970
semantics of next length because we're

1035
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:30,210
deploying the snowball is rolling down

1036
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:32,160
the hill and for better or for worse

1037
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:36,359
some things kind of are what they are

1038
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:41,089
what they are right now you identified a

1039
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:45,000
specific case black holing for deaths I

1040
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:48,270
brought up a different approach where we

1041
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:51,410
make black hole route requests rely on

1042
00:58:48,270 --> 00:58:53,609
less specific routes which then can be

1043
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:56,430
pumped through the original validation

1044
00:58:53,609 --> 00:58:59,460
procedure so it may be that for the

1045
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:01,129
black hole use case we don't need to do

1046
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,420
anything insider ops but rather

1047
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:07,680
documents enough away of black hole

1048
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:13,380
routing in grow but if there are other

1049
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:16,500
use cases that may still allow this

1050
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:18,510
conversation to continue but I as you

1051
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,190
explain things right now I would remove

1052
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:24,660
black hole because there are I think

1053
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:26,550
more feasible more pragmatic so can i

1054
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:28,470
interject guys we're seriously out of

1055
00:59:26,550 --> 00:59:31,339
time it'd be great if you take it on the

1056
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:34,859
list thank you small points of order

1057
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:36,839
meets echo jabber room is not reachable

1058
00:59:34,859 --> 00:59:45,109
from my laptop anymore so I cannot at

1059
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:45,109
this moment scribe thank you

1060
00:59:46,790 --> 00:59:56,849
did you want this one or the other one

1061
00:59:49,020 --> 00:59:59,509
first thank you hi folks I'm Deema from

1062
00:59:56,849 --> 01:00:03,060
zds and I'm also working for mr.

1063
00:59:59,510 --> 01:00:06,660
open-source project for RP Caroline

1064
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:09,540
party so I'm here to report to the

1065
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:12,060
working group I can say if it was about

1066
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:14,730
the update after this informational

1067
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:18,150
document these things is the working

1068
01:00:14,730 --> 01:00:20,160
group last call and during the working

1069
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:25,290
group last call we had got some comments

1070
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:29,460
we got some supports and Allah is out we

1071
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:31,410
also made update accordingly especially

1072
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:34,560
by adding double control to reference

1073
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:38,819
IFC 84 16 which you suggested by leaking

1074
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:42,570
out and making some wording improvements

1075
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:47,420
as such as by oleg komarov ski and then

1076
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:49,320
we made a further update because some

1077
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,890
reference to the draft has been

1078
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:55,500
partially of the documents okay at the

1079
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:58,049
present we also believe this document is

1080
01:00:55,500 --> 01:01:02,550
ready to move forward and the request

1081
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:06,300
for chess actions so next step I'm ready

1082
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:10,470
for actions and I suggest you owe me the

1083
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:13,109
last call we just sorry notice ask that

1084
01:01:10,470 --> 01:01:14,549
you email the list to ask otherwise we

1085
01:01:13,109 --> 01:01:16,920
will likely forget or at least I will

1086
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:18,329
likely forget so just email us I'd like

1087
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,220
to make last call for this thing please

1088
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:22,220
quick quick thank you

1089
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:37,750
I don't see your other slides on this

1090
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:53,530
that's concerning me because I put them

1091
01:01:37,750 --> 01:01:57,400
on there oh wait sorry yeah okay it's

1092
01:01:53,530 --> 01:02:00,930
Dima again I like to take this

1093
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:03,700
opportunity to brief implementation of

1094
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:06,549
synchronizing rpki in the cache by

1095
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:11,500
distributing cache data in JSON over

1096
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:13,960
HTTP so before I touch upon the very

1097
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:16,930
topic of my presentation lesson review

1098
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:19,210
the rpki cache deployment scenarios as

1099
01:02:16,930 --> 01:02:22,210
discounting obviously attitude when they

1100
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:25,380
are ooh another background for the

1101
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:28,390
following discussions as far as I

1102
01:02:25,380 --> 01:02:30,670
comprehend as ARP cache deployments in

1103
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:35,140
arif are describing I see a tattoo one

1104
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:37,540
arrow - concurrently could be made that

1105
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:40,569
a lot older dogs have to set up its own

1106
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:44,560
RPC system to do our PTI data

1107
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:46,840
synchronization and verification and RB

1108
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:49,890
k value than the cash is not necessarily

1109
01:02:46,840 --> 01:02:52,030
transported around us but between two

1110
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:57,490
intermediate italo's arranged in a

1111
01:02:52,030 --> 01:03:00,760
hierarchical scheme last year as my team

1112
01:02:57,490 --> 01:03:04,439
was establishing a third party ERP

1113
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:10,630
system is called our pica-x cloud-based

1114
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:14,170
system I will reassure that the

1115
01:03:10,630 --> 01:03:16,300
conclusions that I just made in my last

1116
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:18,250
slide was a reasonable and it's

1117
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:24,359
desirable for us to have a tool to

1118
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:27,100
distribute our PK value data cache to

1119
01:03:24,359 --> 01:03:30,960
among different organizations over

1120
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:34,529
network the university disease figure

1121
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,530
the architects

1122
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:39,520
implemented ways Avista the open source

1123
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:41,200
software is not in service

1124
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:43,750
our Praveen

1125
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:46,870
cache data to some organizations in

1126
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:50,370
China by distributing cache data in JSON

1127
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:53,920
format over HTTP to our servers

1128
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:58,299
deployment in lead hooks of ISP or

1129
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:04,320
ICPs in China so moving along to this

1130
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:07,000
slide I am now presenting our

1131
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:10,810
consideration of the implementations so

1132
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,060
Alif all the way of formatting data we

1133
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:16,029
prefer to facilitate data paths for this

1134
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:18,820
violation and applications other than

1135
01:04:16,030 --> 01:04:21,160
router origin validation as well as to

1136
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:24,970
take advantage of slum to do local

1137
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:26,890
control and then we choose HTTP l

1138
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:29,890
transport because it's a widely

1139
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:31,540
supported it is with security

1140
01:04:29,890 --> 01:04:34,029
enhancement to offer interpreter

1141
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:39,220
protection and it is independent from

1142
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:42,790
protocol than you need so if you are

1143
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:46,419
already familiar with our C 84 16 slum

1144
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:49,120
you would have finally easy to do RP

1145
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:52,140
cache that update by the virtue of slum

1146
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:54,850
filters and some assertions which are

1147
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:58,390
responsible for deleting and adding

1148
01:04:54,850 --> 01:05:02,370
cache data items respectively so that's

1149
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:04,930
a reason why we choose JSON as a format

1150
01:05:02,370 --> 01:05:09,390
to be in alignment we're still on fire

1151
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:16,629
for mate in other word will slim file to

1152
01:05:09,390 --> 01:05:21,460
describe cache data and it's update so

1153
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:24,340
I'd like to reiterate our motivation to

1154
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:28,840
do these so aren't here either over

1155
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:31,390
there why bother to do these on here I

1156
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:34,290
designed excuse me for preventing RP

1157
01:05:31,390 --> 01:05:38,830
cache their cache data for routers so

1158
01:05:34,290 --> 01:05:41,080
the RTR PDU is bounded to transport

1159
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:46,090
which is difficult to as some extensions

1160
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:48,640
and some applications well which is not

1161
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:54,170
supported RTR cannot read the binary

1162
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:57,770
data offered by RT r and we will also

1163
01:05:54,170 --> 01:05:59,360
like to take the adventure of just you

1164
01:05:57,770 --> 01:06:01,780
know why API to do business in

1165
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:05,240
correlation and local control because

1166
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:09,230
the Salam file is in JSON format and so

1167
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:11,779
that's the reason why we'll do these so

1168
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:16,340
here is a desire HTTP header for it's

1169
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:20,030
used in transporting cache data so it's

1170
01:06:16,340 --> 01:06:23,120
inevitable for us to have got some had

1171
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:26,600
to be her extension to signal what is

1172
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:31,460
piggyback in a message body so the we

1173
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:33,410
look added we can find inside head that

1174
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:36,170
indicates some control information such

1175
01:06:33,410 --> 01:06:39,319
as operating model time stem version

1176
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:44,030
information and a Sigler ship which is

1177
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:47,570
the for integrity production and also

1178
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:53,030
about a inside body which is actually a

1179
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:56,990
slim file so our implementation supports

1180
01:06:53,030 --> 01:07:00,040
those push and pull model so in pull

1181
01:06:56,990 --> 01:07:03,470
model the HP clients need to indicate

1182
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:07,970
whether it wants who are copy or it just

1183
01:07:03,470 --> 01:07:10,689
needs an incremental update so that's a

1184
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:15,049
well this is a most important reason of

1185
01:07:10,690 --> 01:07:17,420
why I talked about this I think it's

1186
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:21,380
necessary to do stand eyes our bouquet

1187
01:07:17,420 --> 01:07:23,720
manager caches invalidation because sync

1188
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:28,160
relation could take place between

1189
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:30,560
different organizations and the Randi

1190
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:35,270
dedicated reserve receiver match in his

1191
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:37,940
provider so and present we have got a

1192
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:39,590
crafter bodies coming soon and I hope

1193
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:42,440
the well be adopted as a working group

1194
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:45,320
item so by the way I will be also

1195
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,360
sharing our implementation code at a

1196
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:52,730
chill hub for you guys who have a give

1197
01:07:47,360 --> 01:07:55,130
it a try and I also note the CloudFlare

1198
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:57,860
has a made us similar efforts yet in a

1199
01:07:55,130 --> 01:08:04,790
slightly different way anyway we'll keep

1200
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:07,090
an open mind to any inflammation details

1201
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:07,090
and

1202
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:13,239
anyway if any in Hawai I interested in

1203
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:15,489
this walk and can contribute to this

1204
01:08:13,239 --> 01:08:17,319
let's work together and I hope it

1205
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:20,259
working group will consider whether this

1206
01:08:17,319 --> 01:08:22,619
work is it is of our efforts to seek

1207
01:08:20,259 --> 01:08:26,078
deny elation thank you

1208
01:08:22,618 --> 01:08:28,479
jeff has I'm confused slightly by the

1209
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:30,908
deployment scenario is this attempting

1210
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,879
to populate the catio caches that are

1211
01:08:30,908 --> 01:08:37,059
supplying inet router to the routers

1212
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,400
themselves no this mechanism is designed

1213
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:42,460
for the the catalyst in correlation

1214
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:46,899
among different administrative

1215
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:48,609
organizations so that's a leaves case so

1216
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:49,868
this does not actually catch the routers

1217
01:08:48,609 --> 01:09:00,429
themselves you'll have a nothing to the

1218
01:08:49,868 --> 01:09:05,019
way the router thank you we actually

1219
01:09:00,429 --> 01:09:08,770
ended up with some other format

1220
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:11,020
intermediate for the payload the

1221
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:18,900
validated payload out of the crypto

1222
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:22,210
system and yes such such such a

1223
01:09:18,899 --> 01:09:25,059
standardized interface we actually have

1224
01:09:22,210 --> 01:09:29,649
three different validators producing the

1225
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:35,440
same stuff quite certainly has some

1226
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:41,129
advantages for scaling scaling the

1227
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:47,408
feeding of many Reuters and well okay

1228
01:09:41,130 --> 01:09:51,190
the validated crypto payload as I would

1229
01:09:47,408 --> 01:09:57,699
call it quite obviously has also other

1230
01:09:51,189 --> 01:10:00,879
potential very interesting uses so I

1231
01:09:57,699 --> 01:10:03,098
have one thing to add up as far as I

1232
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:07,780
observed the implementation of

1233
01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:09,909
cauliflower and our our t-rex there are

1234
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:12,099
those pride now is private

1235
01:10:09,909 --> 01:10:13,690
implementation well both working very

1236
01:10:12,099 --> 01:10:16,360
well but I think the community will

1237
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:21,210
benefit if roms are standardized in the

1238
01:10:16,360 --> 01:10:21,210
face so that's the motivation thank you

1239
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:32,900
yeah go for it

1240
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:35,690
Oliver you're up run fast I just want to

1241
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:38,420
interject something in the transfer

1242
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:41,509
presentation and make before break issue

1243
01:10:38,420 --> 01:10:44,409
um I forgot to give credit where dude

1244
01:10:41,510 --> 01:10:54,590
this issue was raised by Nicki alert I

1245
01:10:44,409 --> 01:10:57,860
did not invent it it's Nick hello my

1246
01:10:54,590 --> 01:11:01,250
name is Alma Boyett I'm from NIST so

1247
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:03,049
today I'm talking about the draft be

1248
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:07,400
trapeze act like validation signaling

1249
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:11,659
which we proposed either last ITF or the

1250
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:13,699
ITF before give you an update so since

1251
01:11:11,659 --> 01:11:18,379
the last time we talked about that we

1252
01:11:13,699 --> 01:11:20,900
had Burton group adoption call and which

1253
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:25,340
was successful but had some interesting

1254
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:35,030
discussions the first discussion was

1255
01:11:25,340 --> 01:11:37,909
that why would we need in why would we

1256
01:11:35,030 --> 01:11:40,849
need a new attribute for that there's

1257
01:11:37,909 --> 01:11:44,119
already the attributed RFC 80 97 out

1258
01:11:40,849 --> 01:11:48,440
there that signals the orator meditation

1259
01:11:44,119 --> 01:11:51,019
and it has a long section for reserved

1260
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:54,379
and we just could basically pick a big

1261
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:57,980
on on the reserved field and at pass

1262
01:11:54,380 --> 01:12:01,789
validation to that that would work very

1263
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:05,799
fine because the unverified stayed for

1264
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:11,300
us would have the value 0 and RFC 1897

1265
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:13,369
set sees feared as zero on the sending

1266
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:15,039
side and has to be ignored on the

1267
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:19,039
receiving side so that would give us

1268
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:28,159
some backwards compatibility to anyone

1269
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:31,639
who implemented the 1897 furthermore

1270
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:33,639
after the draft got accepted there came

1271
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:37,870
some discussion about

1272
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:41,560
the validating BG speaker another draft

1273
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:46,720
out there that deals with origin

1274
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:50,710
validation on ebgp and has second part

1275
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:55,930
second focus on the operational modes

1276
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:59,230
that can be configured and they came the

1277
01:12:55,930 --> 01:13:02,740
part of why don't we merge all these

1278
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:04,320
work together in one thing so we the

1279
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:10,570
whole thing is a little bit more

1280
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:13,299
organized so then you cup from the e6

1281
01:13:10,570 --> 01:13:16,570
and I we had some conversation about

1282
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:19,530
that and said okay the his history

1283
01:13:16,570 --> 01:13:22,950
basically this this is two sections of

1284
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:27,400
ebgp as well as the operational part

1285
01:13:22,950 --> 01:13:30,190
half of that also applies to what we

1286
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,379
want to do and the other half the

1287
01:13:30,190 --> 01:13:38,110
operational mode could be taken out as

1288
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:40,660
as a BCP so that was what we decided so

1289
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:44,380
far and maybe some input from the

1290
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:47,200
working group would be would be good

1291
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:52,630
especially in regarding to splitting the

1292
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:55,120
validation BGP speak a draft so and then

1293
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:57,970
the remaining portion in the validating

1294
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:59,920
BGP speaker which would mainly deal with

1295
01:13:57,970 --> 01:14:03,670
the operational modes and so force would

1296
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:05,860
be put into a BCP or informational draft

1297
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:10,540
because everything that's written there

1298
01:14:05,860 --> 01:14:12,160
is actually pretty good so what does

1299
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:17,590
this mean for B to B's neck validation

1300
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:19,750
signaling we we add some additional

1301
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:23,400
language or a little bit more clarifying

1302
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:28,420
language and regarding to ebgp usage and

1303
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:32,469
clarify error handling so the top part

1304
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:35,590
is currently RFC 1897 there you have the

1305
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:40,030
long block of reserved and at the end we

1306
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:43,630
have the validation state and we update

1307
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:46,660
that by using the second to the last

1308
01:14:43,630 --> 01:14:47,320
octet for pass validation and we rename

1309
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:48,880
the

1310
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:52,329
while relations state for you it into

1311
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:57,270
origin validation to clarify which

1312
01:14:52,329 --> 01:14:57,269
validation state is in which octet

1313
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:06,369
furthermore we we at the validation

1314
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,980
state so a lower part where we have zero

1315
01:15:06,369 --> 01:15:11,290
for unverified one for valid and two for

1316
01:15:08,980 --> 01:15:13,809
not valid that are the egypt lee sec

1317
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:16,750
states that are defined in at least

1318
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:22,449
develop none sell it as the b2b sex

1319
01:15:16,750 --> 01:15:25,869
states defined in AD 8205 we went ahead

1320
01:15:22,449 --> 01:15:31,000
and did one further thing we in the 1897

1321
01:15:25,869 --> 01:15:34,809
the fields are considered lookup resort

1322
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:36,250
and we renamed that into validation

1323
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:40,449
state because it makes much more sense

1324
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:46,510
you signal the validation states so why

1325
01:15:40,449 --> 01:15:49,690
not why not calling it like that so

1326
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:51,400
regarding ebgp signaling RFC eighty

1327
01:15:49,690 --> 01:15:57,519
ninety seven actually allows you to be

1328
01:15:51,400 --> 01:16:02,739
signaling it has some Contessa birding

1329
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:04,570
of volunteer situations we are two

1330
01:16:02,739 --> 01:16:07,388
adjacent guesses under the control of

1331
01:16:04,570 --> 01:16:11,920
the same administration for example or

1332
01:16:07,389 --> 01:16:14,020
the other example what is as a warrants

1333
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:17,560
iteration is basically side or RPG i

1334
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:22,960
which is the link to the b2b to the

1335
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:23,650
draft what i explained before from which

1336
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:28,110
one was called

1337
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:31,239
validating b2b speaker yeah so we

1338
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:33,369
propose the change in this wording to

1339
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:36,519
say implementations must provide a

1340
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:38,589
configuration mechanism to allow the use

1341
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:43,179
of the community in both sending and

1342
01:16:38,590 --> 01:16:46,929
receiving and the implementers should

1343
01:16:43,179 --> 01:16:49,270
enable the use for this community on ib

1344
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:54,630
tree on all ibgp sessions and short by

1345
01:16:49,270 --> 01:17:00,500
default disabled on ebgp sessions to

1346
01:16:54,630 --> 01:17:04,619
make it more clear and yeah

1347
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:06,929
then error-handling currently 1897 is

1348
01:17:04,619 --> 01:17:11,250
has an indirect error-handling and

1349
01:17:06,929 --> 01:17:14,449
they're mainly deals with if the

1350
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:18,420
attribute occurs more than once in the

1351
01:17:14,449 --> 01:17:21,230
BGP update currently it says disregard

1352
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:25,739
all instances except the one with Z

1353
01:17:21,230 --> 01:17:27,239
largest integer value and that gives a

1354
01:17:25,739 --> 01:17:30,659
little bit problem if we have not two

1355
01:17:27,239 --> 01:17:34,389
integer values in there so we say okay

1356
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:36,259
if we have more than one instance then

1357
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:39,900
[Music]

1358
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:41,460
disregard all of them and apply the

1359
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:48,480
strategy similar to the attribute

1360
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:49,980
disregard so now some thought so that's

1361
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:52,169
that's changed what we have right now

1362
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:57,019
and I upload it's a document yesterday

1363
01:17:52,170 --> 01:17:59,610
it's just take some time read over it

1364
01:17:57,020 --> 01:18:02,130
now current the current path is to

1365
01:17:59,610 --> 01:18:06,900
update eighty ninety seven to add these

1366
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:12,690
part but the question is where we had so

1367
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:15,000
much more wording and also we change or

1368
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:18,480
we add other things if it wouldn't make

1369
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,429
more sense to obsolete 80 97 rather than

1370
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:27,678
update 1897 I think that's something

1371
01:18:20,429 --> 01:18:31,349
that should be discussed another thought

1372
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:33,060
currently the draft is b2b techno b2b

1373
01:18:31,349 --> 01:18:35,250
segmentation signaling and we definitely

1374
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:37,340
should rename that in path orientation

1375
01:18:35,250 --> 01:18:40,230
and origin validation signaling because

1376
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:47,900
the definitely Dean's know there's all

1377
01:18:40,230 --> 01:18:52,098
those posed questions job Snyder's NCT

1378
01:18:47,900 --> 01:18:54,780
unfortunately I am not entirely sure

1379
01:18:52,099 --> 01:18:59,969
you're heading in the right direction by

1380
01:18:54,780 --> 01:19:02,790
merging the allegedly called validating

1381
01:18:59,969 --> 01:19:04,650
Beach P speaker draft into this I'm not

1382
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:06,780
sure if you're aware of the extreme

1383
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:09,299
controversy that that draft has

1384
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:12,880
generated and absolutely failed to reach

1385
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:15,880
consensus it is very disappointing

1386
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:18,400
you see it resurfaced yet again well

1387
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:22,960
there are tens of comments unaddressed

1388
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:27,099
and with an ITF process it is not the

1389
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:29,949
best quality of work so I think when you

1390
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:32,620
set out to specify extended communities

1391
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:36,400
to signal bgp SEC validation states that

1392
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:38,530
is a lot about goal but then perhaps you

1393
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:42,580
accidentally stepped into something that

1394
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:45,940
doesn't smell as nice and that may drag

1395
01:19:42,580 --> 01:19:48,790
down the effort that you set out to

1396
01:19:45,940 --> 01:19:52,629
originally accomplish in other words if

1397
01:19:48,790 --> 01:19:55,449
you fade share with a draft that was not

1398
01:19:52,630 --> 01:20:01,770
well received it will complicate your

1399
01:19:55,449 --> 01:20:04,780
original goal and I I hear what you say

1400
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:10,659
the only part of the merging what we do

1401
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:15,040
here is actually that we take the ebgp

1402
01:20:10,659 --> 01:20:18,009
signaling into the BGP section it's a

1403
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:22,330
transfer for me to be sick that actually

1404
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:24,310
makes perfectly sense I want and the

1405
01:20:22,330 --> 01:20:27,460
other part which we stay completely

1406
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:29,260
clear of of the whole operational mode

1407
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:33,460
and all this kind of stuff nothing of

1408
01:20:29,260 --> 01:20:36,480
that is in this draft at all so maybe if

1409
01:20:33,460 --> 01:20:39,639
you if I can research for us I

1410
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:42,129
understand where you're coming from but

1411
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:45,040
the cider ops working group does not get

1412
01:20:42,130 --> 01:20:47,560
to redefine what transiti means in bgp

1413
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,620
attributes that is outside our scope and

1414
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:52,840
a non-transitive extended community will

1415
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:56,400
not in this working group be redefined

1416
01:20:52,840 --> 01:21:01,179
as well it's now subtly transitive and

1417
01:20:56,400 --> 01:21:05,679
it is a mistake that's in the eight zero

1418
01:21:01,179 --> 01:21:08,440
nine seven draft that it suggested that

1419
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,150
or perhaps it could be transitive know

1420
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,638
that sentence should never have been

1421
01:21:10,150 --> 01:21:15,460
there that's a buck in the draft and you

1422
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:19,030
will meet opposition from implementers

1423
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:22,190
and operators if that part of the church

1424
01:21:19,030 --> 01:21:23,909
is spray Pence's

1425
01:21:22,190 --> 01:21:26,309
[Music]

1426
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:28,650
so this this is a technical issue

1427
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:31,500
because BGP implementations do not

1428
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:35,099
behave that way putting it in a draft

1429
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:38,100
will will will not help okay so I would

1430
01:21:35,100 --> 01:21:41,610
recommend to not proceed with the merch

1431
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:44,550
and and proceed with what you originally

1432
01:21:41,610 --> 01:21:51,599
set out to do they will make the chances

1433
01:21:44,550 --> 01:21:57,630
of success higher okay thanks John

1434
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:59,280
Scudder two things one is personally I

1435
01:21:57,630 --> 01:22:01,320
would take no offense that if you

1436
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:03,870
obsoleted eighty eight ninety seven then

1437
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,130
just rolled it in that would be fine

1438
01:22:03,870 --> 01:22:09,540
with me

1439
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:13,880
the second thing is on your can you wind

1440
01:22:09,540 --> 01:22:18,350
back to your error slide yeah that way

1441
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:20,760
that looks like a downgrade attack to me

1442
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:23,699
because if you pick the numerically

1443
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:26,429
highest one that's sort of the least

1444
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:30,000
desirable validation state and that's

1445
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:31,920
going to be less desirable than the lack

1446
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:34,860
of signaling of any validation state

1447
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:37,409
which is what the bottom box does so

1448
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:39,030
that we can take it to the list but that

1449
01:22:37,409 --> 01:22:41,460
doesn't seem like a desirable strategy

1450
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:43,949
to me I think we should bring it to the

1451
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:46,350
list because the only problem is what

1452
01:22:43,949 --> 01:22:48,690
what I see currently now we have two

1453
01:22:46,350 --> 01:22:51,090
validation state in there and let's say

1454
01:22:48,690 --> 01:22:55,500
for example we have fun attributes it

1455
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:57,719
says Origin validation invalid and pass

1456
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:59,670
validation valid and the other one says

1457
01:22:57,719 --> 01:23:01,739
pass validation invalid and origin

1458
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:04,190
validation valid so now I know I have

1459
01:23:01,739 --> 01:23:06,299
the problem do I start

1460
01:23:04,190 --> 01:23:08,489
cherry-picking the values out of them

1461
01:23:06,300 --> 01:23:11,159
and takes the highest integer value and

1462
01:23:08,489 --> 01:23:13,049
I take information of multiple

1463
01:23:11,159 --> 01:23:15,719
attributes what I don't know if this is

1464
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:18,270
the right way to go as well or which one

1465
01:23:15,719 --> 01:23:21,840
which one do I know choose - I prefer

1466
01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:23,520
origin overpass or path of origin so I

1467
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:27,659
think there's definitely some discussion

1468
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,310
needed that that's why I said okay the

1469
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:34,019
easiest way in this regard to deal with

1470
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:36,480
that is if I have these problem what I

1471
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:37,770
have to solve somehow if I say okay if I

1472
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:41,009
shouldn't see more than one

1473
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:43,380
Ennio that I mean that's the first thing

1474
01:23:41,010 --> 01:23:49,020
why why would I see more than one

1475
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:53,760
attribute in the in the update so but

1476
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:56,070
yeah 90 bushard in Arcis the reason you

1477
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:58,800
should is careful reading of the BGP

1478
01:23:56,070 --> 01:24:09,360
spec says that you also have to check

1479
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:12,810
origin as John Scudder said obsolete in

1480
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:18,420
1897 probably is not at all harmful

1481
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:20,790
there is actually a subsequent RFC blah

1482
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:23,340
blah blah clarifications whose number I

1483
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:32,670
cannot quote which throws away a

1484
01:24:23,340 --> 01:24:36,720
significant part of 1897 and because it

1485
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:39,510
was ill-advised 1897 is one of a small

1486
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:41,700
number of RFC's which has my name on it

1487
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:46,700
to which I formerly objected in working

1488
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:46,700
group last call and an ITF last call

1489
01:24:48,830 --> 01:24:54,330
Jeff has I own an implementation with a

1490
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:57,270
policy engine that has to look at this

1491
01:24:54,330 --> 01:25:00,360
stuff you do not want to put these

1492
01:24:57,270 --> 01:25:02,430
things both into the same community the

1493
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:04,110
primary reason for this is there's a lot

1494
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:06,870
of if you flip back to the community

1495
01:25:04,110 --> 01:25:09,630
description a lot of people that have

1496
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:12,690
policy out there that is matching

1497
01:25:09,630 --> 01:25:18,360
against you know basically a scroll

1498
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:20,490
going go go go go one more thank you

1499
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:22,530
there you go there's an awful lot of

1500
01:25:20,490 --> 01:25:24,809
people that have policy that says no

1501
01:25:22,530 --> 01:25:27,179
match community for three zero zero

1502
01:25:24,810 --> 01:25:29,820
bunch of zeros and then number one two

1503
01:25:27,180 --> 01:25:31,560
or three and it is done as an exact

1504
01:25:29,820 --> 01:25:34,469
match type thing despite the fact that

1505
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:35,730
no it says reserved most people know if

1506
01:25:34,470 --> 01:25:38,100
they're doing something slightly smarter

1507
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:40,650
for match purposes might do regular

1508
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:42,090
expressions regular expressions suck for

1509
01:25:40,650 --> 01:25:42,559
performance so a lot of people don't do

1510
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:44,880
that

1511
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,800
the consequence here is that if you

1512
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,880
overload it you know you don't have a

1513
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:50,100
bunch of zeros in the middle in there

1514
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:51,840
anymore and you'll no longer match the

1515
01:25:50,100 --> 01:25:54,660
thing you know you'll basically have

1516
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:59,040
an incomparable number and you'll jump

1517
01:25:54,660 --> 01:26:02,340
into the wrong spot year policy code so

1518
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:05,880
your suggestions to keep them separate

1519
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:08,100
yes exactly as we had originally yeah

1520
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:10,410
it's an extra as an extra community it's

1521
01:26:08,100 --> 01:26:12,480
not a big deal it'd be nice if engines

1522
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:14,700
that work this way you're a victim of

1523
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:16,620
what I like to call magic extended

1524
01:26:14,700 --> 01:26:18,349
communities although the validation

1525
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:21,150
procedures you give is an attempt to

1526
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:21,780
choose one out of many because it's

1527
01:26:21,150 --> 01:26:24,809
magic

1528
01:26:21,780 --> 01:26:28,980
okay actually if I can quickly into jaga

1529
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:30,900
I was myself contemplating whether we do

1530
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:33,360
this as a separate community or not but

1531
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:35,160
I think Jeffress is a really really good

1532
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:37,469
point and you probably want to take this

1533
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:39,330
out you know that I think I think that's

1534
01:26:37,470 --> 01:26:40,590
all very very well good points and I

1535
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:44,220
think there's some discussion that has

1536
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:45,840
to be done on the list and that pretty

1537
01:26:44,220 --> 01:26:47,630
much also answers your second question

1538
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:52,190
whether you want to obsolete our

1539
01:26:47,630 --> 01:26:55,140
existing RFC or not just leave it as is

1540
01:26:52,190 --> 01:26:57,059
dr. Montgomery just a quick question I

1541
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:59,400
guess for John's comment as I'm not sure

1542
01:26:57,060 --> 01:27:02,670
I understand the threat scenario that if

1543
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:05,040
you're in a position to somehow on the

1544
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:07,740
wire insert a second one of these

1545
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:15,750
communities aren't you equally in a

1546
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:17,099
position just to strip them all and I'm

1547
01:27:15,750 --> 01:27:21,320
not sure the vulnerability that you

1548
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:21,320
don't already have if that's your threat

1549
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:32,119
III only want to respond to that if I'm

1550
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,489
not taking away from the rest of the

1551
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:36,919
agenda there's no more agenda last three

1552
01:27:34,489 --> 01:27:40,699
minutes all yours okay there we go

1553
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:43,519
so still John Scudder yeah I don't want

1554
01:27:40,699 --> 01:27:46,879
to try to defend it as an attack even

1555
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:52,869
though I used that word I guess sort of

1556
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:52,869
putting it in more neutral language the

1557
01:27:52,929 --> 01:27:58,280
their handling that was prepared

1558
01:27:55,189 --> 01:28:00,860
proposed on that slide is sort of less

1559
01:27:58,280 --> 01:28:02,989
stringent than what was it that the

1560
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:04,938
you've changed the semantics you've

1561
01:28:02,989 --> 01:28:07,218
changed the semantics to something that

1562
01:28:04,939 --> 01:28:11,030
will accept routes that were previously

1563
01:28:07,219 --> 01:28:13,849
rejected and that made my knee-jerk you

1564
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:16,820
know if you subsequently analyze the you

1565
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:18,289
know the the case and sort of convinced

1566
01:28:16,820 --> 01:28:19,369
me that and you know John even though

1567
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:20,898
we're letting in routes that you were

1568
01:28:19,369 --> 01:28:24,919
previously gonna drop on the floor it's

1569
01:28:20,899 --> 01:28:27,050
okay hey okay but I think that you know

1570
01:28:24,919 --> 01:28:29,510
I think Jeff's comment kind of moods the

1571
01:28:27,050 --> 01:28:40,999
whole thing so you know we probably

1572
01:28:29,510 --> 01:28:42,199
don't need to to dig into it further so

1573
01:28:40,999 --> 01:28:45,679
you're gonna do some more work on this

1574
01:28:42,199 --> 01:28:51,098
and okay cream make sure I didn't

1575
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,099
misunderstand result all right yes yo I

1576
01:28:51,699 --> 01:28:57,049
think just one no oh there were two so

1577
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:59,959
there'll be we'll find it and we been a

1578
01:28:57,050 --> 01:29:04,639
question of job Snyder's entity a

1579
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:07,610
question about procedure the draft ITF

1580
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:11,570
cider of validating BGP speaker which is

1581
01:29:07,610 --> 01:29:14,570
of course anything will validating did

1582
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:18,880
not reach consensus what is the current

1583
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:18,880
status in the working group

1584
01:29:22,729 --> 01:29:31,880
see you in Vancouver no I believe the

1585
01:29:28,729 --> 01:29:33,889
end result of it was the author's could

1586
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,139
go back to try and make something

1587
01:29:33,889 --> 01:29:38,150
sensible out of it or we're not moving

1588
01:29:36,139 --> 01:29:39,170
it forward anywhere any further so right

1589
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:40,339
now they weren't group doesn't care

1590
01:29:39,170 --> 01:29:42,860
about it it I think is the end result

1591
01:29:40,340 --> 01:29:45,530
like it's not part of our game plan so

1592
01:29:42,860 --> 01:29:48,018
so should we still consider it's a

1593
01:29:45,530 --> 01:29:48,199
working group documents I don't know do

1594
01:29:48,019 --> 01:29:53,809
we

1595
01:29:48,199 --> 01:30:01,549
oh I can kill it I think it's not on the

1596
01:29:53,809 --> 01:30:03,260
list right yeah wait wait wait it is

1597
01:30:01,550 --> 01:30:06,800
currently a working group document

1598
01:30:03,260 --> 01:30:10,130
because we inherited it from cider and

1599
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:12,639
we therefore it was before that it was

1600
01:30:10,130 --> 01:30:18,190
an individual submission so it currently

1601
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:21,769
may be a working group documents which

1602
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:25,969
yeah okay yeah we can take that on the

1603
01:30:21,769 --> 01:30:29,119
mailing list yeah that's what I want but

1604
01:30:25,969 --> 01:30:30,860
not maybe what the offer sponsor I would

1605
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:34,190
say like a please email the list and say

1606
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:40,728
you said ba ba ba ba ba do we kill this

1607
01:30:34,190 --> 01:30:43,178
now or that would help Thank You Jimmy

1608
01:30:40,729 --> 01:30:43,179
Cooper bye

1609
01:31:18,730 --> 01:31:21,830
[Music]

1610
01:31:29,869 --> 01:31:31,929
you
